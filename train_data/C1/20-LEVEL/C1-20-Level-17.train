Well I only said whatever you want to do.
Do you wanna go up for suit .
"I said, that's all we want."
"Now, you know"
"We go out to win on the night, we're playing tomorrow"
Exactly!
and we go out to win.
Everybody goes on about .
"If we win without it, we come in the first five that's all well and good."
"We you go out, do you go out to win?"
Everybody
But
does that.
you don't argue about it.
"If we lose, we lose."
"You don't, I mean I'd like to win it every bloody week but, I'd be chuffed."
I'd be as happy as a dog with two dicks!
I mean they stopped us Friday didn't they?
They thought it would stop us didn't they?
You thought it would stop us as good as they did.
"What, seven two was it"
Six
or
"No, six."
two.
one of them.
Mm.
"I mean we played good, but just  couldn't get out and they did."
Well the door was open and nobody were worried about that.
Don't you remember that thirty doubles.
"What, they got it?"
Oh fabulous!
What?
"You mean, in other words, you won't have life insurance left."
"So money you've put into life insurance, goes?"
"Well that's what the life insurance is for, to pay the house off."
Oh!
Put that against the value of the house.
"Oh, great!"
So
So
in other words the money from your life insurance will pay the mortgage?
Yes.
So we've not got that much hassle then?
"No, not yet."
"So  well then, what you worrying about?"
I wasn't worried!
Good!
Glad to hear it!
Now where was I?
What happened to the grand throw out this year?
I wasn't worried at all.
"Listen though if, we can't keep everything again!"
If we go through and chuck out all the grotty stuff.
Like what?
"Well, wardrobes and stuff like that."
"Cos, we can get rid of these can't we?"
Sell these?
No!
"That, this and that."
No!
"But keep th , keep the"
Absolutely not!
Never seen that.
Well they all have.
It's customary to go to work dressed in black or white or suits or
Not at all.
It's navy blue with flowered blouse they've got.
I've never seen it.
Each bank's different.
Well they've had them for years.
Well in the Midland Bank and they were wearing them the last time you were there.
The electric board wears them.
The gas board wears them.
Woolworths wear them.
Mm.
"And so really it is no different, just that they are making a song about it."
But there's no need to go to that prices.
a name on.
You can have the firm's name and give them a brooch or something.
"Well they've got them anyway, haven't they?"
But  Val was on about it last summer.
They was talking about it then.
But she said that they had been so many months  or when everybody else had a pay rise they only had a little bit.
And the extra that they should have had is going to pay for these uniforms.
Oh.
didn't want the uniforms.
Well a percentage is taken out of your money for them.
There's no doubt about that.
Mm.
"Well that's what she was on about that, and and they was  they were going"
Well everybody has got to do that.
to go on strike because of it.
"And really, it would be a good thing for Val."
Why?
The speed is increasing.
Sort of
Stop.
"sort of actually stops, and then it's going very slowly again for a bit, and then what happens here?"
"very, it just goes very fast"
Right.
"in a very short space of time then, but then carries on."
Very short space of time it's gone quite a distance.
"So that was a, that is at, that constant speed there is much faster than, than this one."
"And then, it's stationary"
It's
for a while.
And then
Just goes down there.
What's happening here?
Deceleration.
"Well let's make, let's make this bit a straight line, from there to about there."
That's a straight line.
"So, well let's go back to the physics."
We've just been going on timing it for one minute or something.
"And we time it again, one minute and one second"
It's reversed.
It's reversed.
How far away was it when I started the watch?
Thirty metres away.
"How, how far is it after another one second?"
Twenty metres away.
Ah.
Ah!
It's coming back.
Okay.
So that's going backwards.
Cos I wasn't sure of some of the answers.
And that it it's saying which of the following days of action has the group participated in.
I mean cos we haven't really sort of really done a proper day of action have we?
We've done little bits and pieces.
I know we did the returnable bottles.
.
I mean cos and we did that stall on peat but we didn't really take part in the peat day of action did we?
.What do you think?
Fiona and I did the electricity
What  at the supermarket .
Is that the global warming and electricity privatization?
That one?
Was it?
It was erm efficiency  of
Oh fuel and efficiency.
Right that one then.
"Oh we didn't, we didn't do the ozone layer one did we?"
Did you do a stall  on that ozone layer?
We did do something.

"with the, with er snow remember?"
That was Christmas last year wasn't it?
Oh yes that was
That was ozone.

Oh so I'll put down for that then.

Yes I did.
We did.
Sing Don't be cruel .
I'm not singing at all.
Why not?
Because I can't sing.
Oh hang on the ex-directory number's ringing.
That's the boss he'll be complaining.
So there's no chance of getting rid of all these coaches and getting people to walk round the er the guided tours and stuff like that?
Er well that would defeat the whole object of offering the open topped tours if people were actually walking.
Well it would defeat you making a few bob .
There is actually there is actually walking tours around the city for those people who wish to opt for
Mm.
for a walking tour.
So there is the option of doing both the walking tour or the bus tour.
Okay hang on just a minute.

"There's a lot of people who er don't, who would not have gone to the bother of going into the shop and buying a one pound or two pound or four pound"
But why did they do well out of them if they were free?
Well yeah they're free but they've got their advert on it haven't they?

Oh my goodness.
On his left ear.
"He's nice though isn't he, wasn't he, he did say something"
Yeah.
More than half the people don't want any help at all.
"Well, I think that's, we can accept the point easily."
"erm Quite a lot of help required in areas of the remit of this committee I would guess, things like home, security and safety, heating down here, quite a lot of people want help with heating."
"they're both, press it hard  right that's going."
"Press the one, the black one behind there to switch it off."
So we're on now are we?

Oh you're not going to take them with you?
Well  See how it goes
It's going off a bit now isn't it?
Oh no.
Erm  you do realize this ham is already cooked don't you?
No.
No.
"Thought it might, they won't eat it like that, that's"
Have they not eaten anything at all?
I haven't given them anything yet.
Mm.
"because if if you do that, and it begins to erm o occur to her and if she's fairly bright"
Mm she doesn't seem daft yeah.
"She's not clever cos she's  bearings ,"
Erm it it it no
she doesn't seem engineering clever.
No.
But she's not daft.
No but but you're gonna help them.
Yeah yeah.
You're going to your object in life is to help her do the job better.
Right.
And explain to her.
And by sitting down and having a technical and commercial conversation together
Mm.
you can sort of chair that that
Mm.
meeting and help her to understand
how much we're helping them through this  .
and appreciate how much else we can do.
And and okay if we're a pound or two different.
We're forty minutes up the road.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If we can't e e I've had a couple of months of stock on the shelf for 'em.
Yeah.
"In fact I must admit, I hinted to Dave  if if linear will do consignment stock for , why shouldn't we if we're only forty minutes away."
But I mean that's the last thing I wanna do but
Yeah.
"but even then we could have consignment stock here in effect cos they're only forty minutes away, we could throw 'em in the back of the car and have 'em delivered."
"Well that's what we've got we've got consignment stock here, it's on our premises"
Yeah.
Well that's daft innit?
"I says I don't, I says when am I gonna be able to go to town I says and afford fifteen quid for another bloody rail?"
I says you
When you've already got some up.
Yeah!
She wants me to take them down and swap them for one.
Steve'll go mad.
Yeah.
Bloody would an'all.
I thought you crafty sod.
"She wants them to extend to eight feet, well these don't extend to eight feet, they extend to seven."
Oh.
"And I thought no I'm not, Steve's just cleaned them up."
Yeah.
He spent about two hours in with them.
"Have you seen what he's done to ends of them, they've gone silvery, he's rubbed and rubbed and rubbed"
Rubbed too bloody hard .
and he's rubbed all colour off it.
They've got silver ends on them ones.
I said
I says can't you rub harder on other piece.
He ain't done them ones yet.
He's done these ones.
"Well they, are they not silvery then?"
Well he washed this one first and then he went over there and er then it dawned on him that the ends pull off
Ah!
"on ends, so he took the two ends off, cleaned the rails and he was sat on settee watching telly rubbing away and rubbing away and I says hey you gonna put them ends back on?"
And he'd been rubbing for that long they'd gone that colour.
Like my Steven with my new non-stick pans.
I remember.
He took all the black off.
He scrubbed and scrubbed till it all come off didn't he?
"Yeah, so said it was that  spaghetti Bolognese that did it."
Makes you thirsty.
Mm.
"Well, it's probably"
Mm.
it's probably that.
Maybe it is a flu going around then.
Well these all need to be  well I mean quite often this stuff we can
Throw?
"no, no, half of this stuff we can actually  keep bi , or or leave, leave for them because it's actually  relevant information."
What leave them bills and everything?
No I mean it's
And guarantees?
"Well it's no damn good to us once we've moved, is it?"
"Ooh God, they've had the house at a cheap rate anyway!"
They can damn well pay for these stuff if it breaks down!
That's not the point!
Just stop it!
Are we taking the cooker with us or not?
"Not the cooker, no."
"So they get i ,we will work pay for all our appliances and stuff?"
Eh?
Will work pay for all our appliances?
"Not all of them, no."
"Well a lot of , yeah?"
And water softener as well?
All those big salt pebble things I have to fill up every week in the ?
Well I guess we may get a  we may get ourselves a  waste disposable unit.
Good!
"Get one of those we got  in, particularly in favour of those."
Does she like them?
Stick some raw eggs and things down there.
You'd think after that one they'd have thrown the keys away for that.
Mm.
The kid hadn't done much
Get an extra two years for missing.
"the kid hadn't done much, I mean it was nowt  serious ."
You know I had a moving traffic accident
Yeah
"wasn't trucking there, you know  or owt like that."
No sense of humour.
Got brought a pushbike wheel the other day.
Can you get the cogs off that?
Why?
Well they go a lot better on that bike of mine.
I don't think so.
Oh pity.
So what you've done to bend the wheel?
I haven't.
"The gaffer knocked somebody off their pushbike, had to buy him a new wheel  and some compensation"
Scrounge the wheel!
How do you get them off?
He says you go to a pushbike shop and get special tools.
Ring spanner things with the
Mm.
keys on the outside  pumps and things on it to  I wouldn't bother.
A new set of back cogs for bike's only about seven quid.
"A brand new set and they come with the ra with the, erm free wheel and everything all in like, just screw them on."
"Go to a pushbike shop they whip them off and whip them on for you  you buy, you know, if you go out and buy one then just take wheel with you they'll stick them straight on."
Mm   that fellow don't go to the police.
Lucky to get away with having to buy him a wheel  compensation
Unusual innit.
It's very expensive that's why it's unusual.
Sixty nine ninety nine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Two two
It is.
"It's, it's sort of following the demise of part of er Trevor's empire."
Thus making it even cheaper.
For to a smaller an empire.
"I should use that word, that was used very loosely that word  cheap."
What?
Cheap?
I mean  I'm briefed
on that.
Mm.
Okay.
So the urgent work procedure has now been removed to make life easier.
D two
And to let the client know where the job lies within our organization.
Good.
Given a point of
"Straight into a function and that function head will then s write to the client saying, I've got it."
"My project coordinator is Mr X, and then we've got the point of contact established straight away."
"There are quite a few fairly minor changes to the appointment contract procedure but I haven't, I don't pretend, intend briefing those because I think most people can read."
Right.
"So they should be aware there, there are some."
Yeah.
Right?
Er J two stop zero.
Trainees training report file.
Yes.
"Erm there is a requirement that all trainees and new starters within the group, who are having training reviews undertaken, will maintain a training file."
So they know where to find and we know where to find all their bits of reports and the like.
So you've got  nine  plus four  Did we do a sample all day?
"No, just in the peak hours they're sampling."
Didn't we do them off peak as well?
We should have done them off peak as well shouldn't we?
I don't know.
I mean Jan did those.
I think it was just peak hours.
Er   It's gonna take thirteen people isn't it?
"Yeah, I mean if it was peaks only I mean there's nothing to stop me doing it."
Well I appreciate that.
"Or you use it, you put everybody on in the peaks"
Yeah.
"and then you, you"
You use the
cutback
"In the off, in the off peak they rotate the staff and"
I'm not The thing is what you're assuming then is that the pattern in the peak hour  is typical for the day as a whole.
That's not right is it?
Mm  maybe not.
Well you'll get a different pattern in the morning peak and the evening peak for a start won't you?
Mhm.
Mind you maybe you won't.
"Depends, what you're really concerned about is how does the proportion of traffic  split to left and right and  straight ahead isn't it?"
"If that pattern basically stays the same  then you've got, the volume, the flow will go up and down."
Mm right.
But if we did a full turning count how would we do that?
You can't do it can you?
It's not realistic.
You have to do  if you're doing that you have to have all the ins and outs plus a circulation flow.
Yeah.
And I've never done one like that.
"We've always  you know, found a way round it."
You're not supposed to know .
"Oh my, I'm not supposed to see."
Switch it off now for a few minutes.
Okay?
Ah ah!
I'll leave you with that.
The  worm.
Look at these flowers!
So these are lovely!
Mm mm.
Five cheesies to one slurp of drink.
Hmm mm.
Why is it pure gin?
I think Ted would be proud of me.
"Well, my stars say   if you find yourself at a low ebb this weekend don't worry."
Every so often we all need to wind down.
There you are.
"If your a little numb, cynical, or apathetic it's probably a healthy sign."
It simply means you're in the process of recharging your batteries and reassessing your priorities .
Well Anna-Marie is there something you want to tell us?
I'm Cancer.
What does it say about me.
Mm.
Market forces do not make the world go round.
"The earth does not spin on its axis for profit, the sun does not shine because it happens to have shares in a household firm."
"If any force guides the universe, universe, it surely must be love."
"In allowing yourself to be led now by the same illogical but kind motive, you are not being as silly as you think."
"Indeed, the more selfless you can be this weekend, the better things will work out"
Oh how nice.
That sounds good to me .
What's Virgo?
Better .
Yes.
I'm finding something totally wrong with   and got shot of it  and then things have been
"Well actually he didn't, but he says"
worse  thinking he'd been to solicitors  but I'm trying to track down anybody!
Just trying to get some information.
Apparently  oh my God tha they're that much within the law.
"Yeah, that's what we've been told."
"They must have a legal section cos this is one of the biggest organisations,leisure group in Britain"
Yeah.
for caravans.
"They, they, they,they own"
They're going to clear themselves aren't they?
You clear you!
More than that!
Apparently
They're not going to
"one man told me, he said"
"well if you think you might get some money at the end of the season, he said, you may find that you'll be paying them at the end of the season!"
"I mean, what's the good of it?"
"Yeah, you see!"
Well we may as well have got that money and thrown it down the toilet!
Gone straight in the bin!
Well that's right!
"Straight away this year, you get a list through  now, do you want winter cleaning done, curtains cleaned,"
Yeah.
"carpets cleaned, upholstery cleaned?"
"Or outside valet, do you want the underneath painted with grease and everything?"
I say we did have it done.
By the time you add all that up  if you're not local.
All your profit's gone!
You'll  you will end up paying them!
Yeah.
to be made out of recycling
Well  well this is what
Well at the moment it's so dear
well what he meant was
to
"th , I mean he said they"
process it.
we are not
Well
we are not dealing with anything that we cannot
In the short term.
sell.
In
Ah.
"other words they were selling glass, and they were selling  metal  back to  whatever  and manufacturers  to re-use  but  in terms of collecting and the cost of collecting it all and and"
That's expensive!
"handling all this it's, yeah."
The cost that they were  having to bear were greater than what they were actually getting back on the sale of this stuff.
"But, at the same time  the  normal sort of refuse if you like, disposable  was being reduced  because"
That's right!
these other items weren't in the normal refuse collection and therefore they were going to sort of reduce them from a weekly collection to a
Well that's if
"fortnightly collection, so they would be saving in that"
Well that  er
But not saving to these
that's if
particular firms
that
that they want.
that's if
No.
Mm.
Now we're gonna be  using acid  very very dilute acid.
Nevertheless we have to take proper precautions.
"So, if you would be so kind as to get into a position where you can see what I'm doing without being too close  it means that if we do splash any acid by accident er the likelihood of it causing any problems to anyone are minimal."
Have you come to  supervise Miss  's class?
As it happens it would seem that most of those children are out on an English trip.
Oh.
Perhaps you would like to go and do your own thing.
Perhaps you'd like to stick around and watch this happening because I remember you subbing once for an etching lesson.
Oh it's an etching lesson is it?
Yes can you remember?
Yes
Yesterday wasn't it?
And you thought well I'd better not
I'm not having them running around .
That's right.
I remember you saying.
So perhaps you'd like to  keep them right
Have a .
and make sure I do it right.
But on the other hand if you
I don't know how to do it .
Oh well I meant from the point of view of .
Safe safety point of view.
Safety
Oh I'll stay for this.
Is that alright?
Mm.
Smashing.
Thank you very much.
This by the way is er Donald who is making sound recordings of  in the school today.
. So  swearing.
Er  right my friends.
"I don't want any more s in instances where the quantity surveyor thinks he's got a certain fee that he's working to, only to find out later"
Hear hear.
on that somebody's knocked it down by half and not told him.
"Because that causes all sorts of problems on the  report and, and bad blood all round."
Course it did
It's not what team work's
"I mean I, no."
"I would reiterate that my objective is a very simple one, and that is to give the client the most cost-effective service we can."
"Er with this instruction, it will get picked up on the quality"
Co in accordance
er check list.
Good.
Good.
"Could I could I, could I ask that B E S be taken off the distribution codes."
We do not use quantity surveyors for that purpose and indeed the quantity surveyor is not geared up to do any measurement for us.
So you want that
The answer to that is
rewriting then?
No.
Because I think that there should be no reason why the Q S shouldn't provide you with that service in the same way as he provides anybody else Jim.
Unless there's
"But he's, but he's not geared up to do it."
But you've got erm a  Q S then.
We have.
I'm not too sure that means  .
"Well I think, I think  bloody robots"
we all were.
in there like.
electrical  away isn't it?
Mis yeah.
Mister Metal.
That's wound the buggers up.
X is going to go up when Y is a million.
X X is a million.
X is a million.
"What, what would Y be?"
A million squared.
Yeah.
"So th the minus one doesn't make a lot of difference, so as X is very, when X gets very big, it'll just look like Y equals X squared,taking one off if"
Mm.
you're working with millions of millions.
"So it looks like Y equals X squared, moved up a bit, more or less, as a good approximation."
"I mean a hundred is probably big enough, twenty five might be  is more or less big enough."
Mm.
"Er five, say we can have five here, you can have twenty five,over here somewhere,"
Mhm.
behind your shoulder.
"Yeah it'll actually be twenty five minus one,"
Minus one.
but it's a good enough approximation just to see what it'll look like.
So how do you work out the gradient?
"Well you see, it's pretty flattish isn't it?"
"The gradient of a curve is the gradient of tangent, so we can draw a tangent where you wanted it at that place."
It would be the gradient of the tangent.
Mhm.
"If it was at the bottom where it's flat, where you just, you're just coming down, and then you started to go up again, just at the bottom there, it's, it's zero for"
a moment.
"But what would the gradient be there, and how would we find it?"
Er
"It would, it, up here."
"So could you do an approximation, a ver just a very rough guess."
"I mean does it, does it lie over that way or has it sort of gone back on itself?"
Lies over that way?
Yeah.
How many people have said that they're going so far?
Well er me and Steve and Mark and you you're going
Yeah.
too aren't you?
So that's four of us definitely going to.
Erm Alison  says she'd like to but her you know it depends on this that and the other.
Yeah.
I I'm definitely going to  I picked this up from the information places.
It's got all a list of all sort of bed and breakfasts and
Oh.
holiday flats and things.
And the holiday flats in here are quite expensive.
But bed and breakfast are all very cheap.
Erm you know.
Where whereabouts is this is it?
I don't know she didn't say.
Didn't that's one thing I don't know .
Cos if it's two or three miles away it's gonna be a bit of a problem.
Yes that's right.
Erm I I need to check that.
How how much erm are the B and Bs?
Well quite cheap.
I mean about ten pound is the cheapest and perhaps even twelve .
The the extra advantage of the of the house would be cooking which we may get.
Because if if people took advantage of the of these facilities it would make the whole business an awful lot cheaper for them.
And if there's four of us there definitely then that's we only each have to cook once while we're there.
Yeah.
to get out of conference  to go to cook.
If it's close.
Yeah.
If fact it's it's I found it in the past to be a welcome very welcome break from the atmosphere because you can't hang around in in the dining hall without talking a Green Party.
As I remember it conference tends to run through until  new clients so.
Makes a little noise click click click click.
Can I have a chip does anybody hi Rita
Hi.
Lovely Rita meter
Oh don't please.
I hate that isn't it awful to be obvious.
Well that's what everybody sings to me when them and they meet me for the first time or get introduced to me.
Oh they don't.
Where are you calling from we're very loud with callers today I know I'm not the most exciting thing on radio but you know there must be some callers out there somewhere?
Where am I.
I'm at a little place called Ellenthorpe.
Ellenthorpe.
Is the weather as bad as people keep telling me because it was Okay when I drove in this morning.
"No it's not it's it's quite mild, there's no frost on the ground it's all gone."
So what's this about snow at Thirsk?
Well they can keep it we don't want it.
Bit strange in Thirsk anyway I thought.
I think there'd probably somebody with expanded polystyrene ceiling that's been pulled out.
Probably.
Yeah it's it's actually it's not too bad it's a bit misty it's a bid hazy erm slight wind but it's not bad.
It's not?
No it's not bad
No Okay.
I've just got to get something do you mind?
No go and get your chips or whatever.
No I've got I've got  I wanted t
It's all right my hubby can wait for his lunch I aren't bothered.
Jolly well ought to as well.
Er I wanted to talk to Jim Bowen you see about this quiz show host ought to be a a little nicer than they are and apparently his answer machine is on at home.
Well I must admit James I've threatened to put mine on.
Have you?
Well Karen said that if I won the competition she'd ring back.
Mm.
If you see what I mean.
Yeah.
Well so you think actually send something through to reprographics  for them to do in Liverpool?
Well you don't want to be doing it on the machine down here do you?
No.
"And if you got three thousand interviews, say a thousand at, well y you probably wouldn't, you'd probably get"
Probably two of those boxes would do wouldn't it?
"you could get  nearly four thousand interviews couldn't you, altogether?"
Yeah.
At two on a page is two thousand sheets  plus however many you'd only get one on.
So I'd have thought three thousand wasn't  out of the way really.
And like you say if there's some left they won't go to waste anyway.
No.
"Oh on the other hand I suppose we could say well we'll use, we'll get some and if we run out we'll use English ones."
"If you do it that way, you know, by the time they get there they should know what the questions are shouldn't they?"
Yeah.
"Excuse me, by the time you run a"
Cos we hold the original  to that.
To the interview
Well we'll need some  anyway.
Yeah.
"We've probably, I mean we, we hold the original on an A three  so it might be worthwhile  doing a  copy of it."
Doctoring it
Oh I see yeah.
to insert the Welsh because John will have to send the original off for
Oh right.
Yes .
We'll have a look
And then we can have the base copy of each then couldn't we?
Good.
"I'll, I'll dig it out after."
There's that other roundabout isn't there?
You know where the horses were in the field?
That was a four armed roundabout.
Just down from
Yeah.
the station house place where we parked
You'll find that erm  the flows there are very low.
So you think we could get away with treating that as a crossroads and have people
I reckon
doing that?
I reckon
"Well we could have a person counting and not only are they counting what's coming out of their junction, but they could do left, straight on or right."
Treat it as a crossroads  perhaps.
"I reckon  si yes four or six people would cover that, no problem."
I think you'll find the flow is a  a low
it wasn't busy when we were there was it?
"No I mean it may be, you know you  i it may be reasonably busy straight through but I would have thought even there you're probably talking about four  not a lot higher than that I wouldn't have thought."
No.
Okay I'll take four people
And erm we're going very round very slow.
And the visibility was good and everything.
"So I'd have thought that erm  you could put four or six, four or six people on that."
And actually if we just counted this  to through traffic wouldn't be too much
Hello  right.
your pudding?
What erm  have you heard any of it?you have.
What did it sound like?
It's good.
We both just said that it ne you'd never think that you sound right on  tape.
I always think I sound high pitched.
sounds all like bloody  what she does say.
Yeah
don't we?
Well we wanna know whether we were gonna try and do them all in that week?
Twenty seventh of April.
Monday Tuesday Thursday.
I think the plan that goes to  to the police  thank you  needs to show the i interview sites on it.
"You remember we had, on the Ormskirk one we did one that had a study area on it?"
Yeah.
But we also had one  that showed the individual locations.
Yeah.
And I think that was the one that went to the police.
Right.
"Er and the fire brigade and, and so on."
Yeah cos they'll want to know.
Well that's it.
Yeah.
"And all you're doing is warning them that they will, the things will be there and we'll make sure that if a  emergency vehicle comes along  erm"
But they will know your precise dates won't they?
Well they'll want to know precise dates.
I can't remember that we did actually.
"No I don't know whether we do give them, even  the precise dates."
"It isn't really much use then is it, just giving them  a rough ?"
Well it's only a warning.
"Well we'll have a look back in, I'll have a look back in the file and see what we did last time."
"Erm  Do you wanna do that, have a look at what we'd said in Ormskirk"
Yeah.
on that side of things?
Yeah.
I think I wrote to them if I remember rightly.
Well I didn't.
Erm  now we need to do something about layout plans.
So we need to get some  if we're going to work on ordnance survey ones we'll need to sort something on that.
Have to have a chat with   Anyway you're not in an immediate rush to do that are you?
We've gotta devise a new land reform law.
What's our priority?
"What, what, what really is the land reform  to achieve now?"
of feudalism
You've gotta
Right.
Yeah.
Protect commerce and industry.
protect commerce and industry.
"Yeah, I guess it's all"
Just looked after  go on.
Erm  well  erm it's that
Yeah.
we are now in power  but I don't think  that presumably proved that we can run an economy efficiently
Mm.
and
once we've got that then we have the resources from that I think to introduce other programmes that take
Mm.
"quite a long time to implement, for example"
Mhm.
erm
"Wh when you're saying to run the economy, do you mean the rural economy or the economy, you know, China as a whole?"
Well let's say we've moved on to and we're into nineteen forty nine say
Yeah.
and we've  in nineteen forty nine
"and  w w w we are either half controlled or we're, we can now see that you know the civil war is, is going so quickly our way that we are going to have control  within a year or so we are likely to have control over the economy as a whole."
D does that begin to make a difference?
Yes because now
Right.
Yes.
So we then have to coordinate our policies
Mm.
Yeah
"They come through the doorstep, through the doors though."
Through the door they they just throw them away.
They didn't read them.
"I said well don't you live in Stortford, didn't you have it delivered?"
No.
And I'm sure they'll pick them up if they see them in the
If they printed
print them up and they do it on their own  will.
Couldn't we do it with him?
With him?
Well yeah pro
I mean they could couldn't they sponsor us to do it or something?
"Well yeah I I've I've  whether he  well I mean if, if he's gonna do this seven page thing then  I you know I  you can look at it two ways."
Either we can influence and help that to be  to be good or or  you know if that's a failure then  see whether they can help us to produce one for the town.
Mm.
I mean I'd much rather they do it  if we can influence him enough.
They've got the right information.
"Well the thing if we did it with our  as they keep saying there's some, there's so much in the pipeline."
I mean it might take us another  two week two months before we get it out.
Three months.
Well
I would say six months.
Yeah
No I would just think of something really straightforward.
"They do want stuff on local levels I mean if he's East Herts he's got a huge area, hasn't he?"
Yeah.
It it might be a help to him to have little local groups that  helped him out with these things.
But I mean if we print something and then suddenly they instal all these new bottle banks which we didn't know about.
Then they are not mentioned
Well
in our recycling directory and we can do the next one
No cos I wasn't too sure if it was available  you telling me it is available.
A as I said this morning t to the management team it is available.
The only problem is as a one-off exercise on
er existing jobs.
We will have to put in er a summary of the existing remit.
Including
Right.
all the variations and what not.
"And that's something that Mike  and Ken  will help dig the historical contracts out and, and suggest er a remit."
"Erm b cos, cos he, it prints a remit back out out the client ."
"But it, it, it's ready"
"When, when are we likely to, to have the contract reports available?"
The Q S
the physical works
The physical works.
Yeah.
"We're gonna start specifying that now and Brian will, will er"
Right.
"will start to, to, to work that up."
But of course that can become quite a complex thing depending on how much we want to sort of use it to produce certificates and things like that.
Right.
So that's gonna incorporate the Q S cost report as well as the physical works is it?
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
"A and that's, that's gonna be quite a complex erm"
Right.
thing to specify.
As it's a p it's a pound to a penny
Mm.
"that, what we're doing at the moment, we won't want to b put it all in this system"
Fine.
Okay.
Yes.
"Apparently we've got a mistake on the back of that form, that it referred to a noncompliance report, on the back, which is referring to the front but the front was called a quick-fix report"
you see?
"So I said, should I fill in a quick-fix report or a noncompliance report, to say that the quick-fix form, or is it a noncompliance report is wrong."
Right.
We'll get there.
Erm
He said I could leave it with him and he'd sort it out.
there have er
first mistake .
"there have been some fairly er minor alterations to the procedures concerning contract admin wallets er and the various client reports, er but Hugh did ask me to raise them at this meeting, er to remind people of the need to er complete client reports."
Correct.
And I've rai I raised it this morning.
Right.
And erm in the context of Regional Railways
Fine.
wanting them from us.
Yeah.
But I must say that we're using these client reports and  managers within each section
I know you are.
the only one who is.
are finding them extremely useful
Mm.
"in keeping an idea of where the jobs are,"
Yeah.
and the comments I'm getting back from the er the clients are very very favourable.
Right.
They do find them extremely helpful.
Have you run off
C
any interim report from t the computer yet?
"I mean really it, it's erm  er we, we have a form don't we we, we use when people are interviewed for something or other?"
"Well if we put their name and address and phone number on it, I mean  it's probably just as well to use a standard thing that you can xerox."
Yeah.
Maybe Jim and I could
And when they ring up
do that this avo
Yeah.
"When they ring up we can just say oh yes, what's your ?"
Now look this is meant to record
"this, this, this is meant to record"
"life as it is lived, English as she is spoken."
You're not meant to bite your tongue like that.
Right.
Yeah if we
You can swear in the privacy of your own home.
It was your company that I didn't want to swear in front of
not the tape actually
yes alright
"No if we er do something so as they have a checklist and we can all, you know like me and Jim say, have a copy to say oh right, can we take your name and address, telephone number"
"And if you've got a pad of them or or, or some by you you can just fill it in and let it go through."
Yeah that'd be a good idea
Write the name and address and phone number down and then
Yeah.
it's there.
Okay I'll buy that.
Cos you you'll almost certainly need to ring them back.
Yeah.
Even if it's to say erm
Oh sorry!
sorry we've got enough.
Yeah okay.
"Erm and that also makes sure, if you've got it all in front of you, erm that ensures that you're getting all the information that you need rather than thinking oh hang on, what else do I need sort of thing."
A word.
"It was, well it is, you, you stick in pieces of articles, into a book, you're collecting them."
Just any articles?
"Well, they have to correspond to the lecture, so  the lecture this week was, world population."
Had to so it.
"Like the world,"
And business?
the world.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And then, you have to get to about three to four articles on that."
I don't know where I'm gonna get them from.
And then
World in
"It, it gets a bit easier, because they go on to like health, age, I know I'll be able to find loads to stuff on age, won't I?"
"World population, erm probably what I'm gonna have to do is, although they, they said you can't do it  don't get any ideas about doing it with  because it's not possible."
It is possible
Mm.
"cos if I find that I can't find something, I'll just have to look like"
Keep looking as you're going along
"Yeah, do you know what I mean?"
"So, that's what  is."
"And it's just like, and they want you to make some comment on what you've worked out, which is no problem really, is it?"
"Do you know that newspaper that they brought out, the European, and it's like, just to, just to"
Yeah.
take you through the whole of Europe.
Yeah.
"like world issues, then,"
Yeah.
Because
"I know the Telegraph always have a lot of foreign, foreign news."
"But that's what, but The Sunday Times has always got a world news section at the back in it."
Alright
erm which is quite  management at
right
erm I suppose one of the er things I'd like to er get out of this would be a bit more
Okay so putting all the  that positive
Yeah sort of ums and ahs
Oh right okay okay so I mean are are you saying that's about confidence?
Is it or  ?
"Well maybe , maybe, maybe thinking ahead too much"
"er right, okay okay so better preparation so that when you make the presentation it's more effective, yeah?"
"Yeah I mean you're trying to think ahead, you're umming and ahing"
So effective preparation
yeah
effective preparation so that you so that when you you stand up here you're more confident you're more
yeah
"Good, do you do you make present any sort of presentations ?"
Well I meet clients quite a bit erm the last one I actually made was last week
Oh really
To Tarmac  financial directors  directors
How do you how do you feel it went?
"It went pretty well actually, the feedback I got from my immediate boss  fairly pleased with it was pleased with it"
Good
Obviously
Right
"yeah, good okay good."
So effective preparation.
Mike.
I'm a senior  with South West I  management course I cover site planning right the way through.
erm been in the game now for something like forty years.
Started as an apprentice and worked my way through to management.
Erm  this course or mainly my presentations are written
Okay
I never did like those open topped buses.
Well unclear
So I'll be back to you.
at the moment I can see about half well a dozen people sat on one of the buses.
Can you?
Yes.
No wonder there's no traffic moving out there today.
"There is traffic moving, it's moving quite freely apart from the cars going into the car park just behind Clifford's Tower."
Is that right?
That's right yeah.
There's never any spaces behind Clifford's Tower so I don't know how you're just telling me fibs aren't you?
Well they're all they're all queuing up to go in there so I not sure.
I just don't understand all these buses with the open tops it's freezing out there and all these tourists look they could walk Rachael.
Well are tourists
"They could walk, why don't they walk?"
It's a seven kilometre tour.
It takes an hour and a lot of people don't want to walk around the city they'd like the option of going around on the bus.
What did the Minister of Health say the other day?
Obesity obesity and lack of exercise.
and that's what you're encouraging Rachael .
Not encouraging lack of exercise we're encouraging an informative tour around the city with a qualified guide.
You still got that beautiful blonde hair?
We're not on the air are we?
No no no we're not on the air.
Heaven forbid I wouldn't talk to you like this if we were on the air  would I ?
Anyway so go on.
Right.
What were we talking about?
So you don't mind
Talking about the buses.
Yeah.
"So I mean I think it'd great Guide Friday you run around little flag in the air, I've seen them in London and you can do that and and and people get so fit."
That right?
They say unless you've been unemployed six months you're not unemployed.
You're looking for a job.
They don't call it unemployed.
Well you can't go on the list for six weeks anyway.
Six months.
"six weeks, yeah."
"Well if you haven't been working for six months you are looking for a job, you are not unemployed."
They don't call that unemployment.
Course this is all  voting   propaganda again.
I mean when is it  it's a disgrace to the social service workers isn't it?
To make them wear uniform.
They're getting them like prison officers and policeman and
Well it's the same as anywhere else.
If you work in Marks and Spencers you wear er their uniform.
If you work in the hospital you wear their uniform.
Yeah.
That's only to advertise the place though isn't it?
Marks and Spencers and
It isn't.
If you went into your Clarke's shoe shop they've all got the same clothes.
"It's it makes it so easy that  the staff, one can't dress any better than the other."
They're all equal.
When you go to places like  in the big stores  the staff have all got the same type of apron er overall.
"And that's for the customer, if it needs help they know who is who to go for advice."
Yeah.
That's all it is.
But when you've got people stood behind a desk and serving you and doing nothing but serving you as you come.
They'll be wanting bank clerks to have uniforms next.
Good god bank clerks have been wearing uniforms for these last three four five years.
Oh I've never seen them.
Well
what's the point in making them worse.
I know.
"So, jump in me box, and I ain't jumping in me box blind, for the last ten years."
I'll manage the way I am.
"You see, that works where I"
Benjy
"Aye,"
"Benjy, look at 'im."
Benjy
"Where are you, when it's gonna be, he said corner, then we'll make an office and a little canteen in that anyway."
"Then there's another long unit right at side of it, just enough to get one trailer in."
"I said, I said, if we do get going, and we do start finding out that it's going alright, he'll turn that, into like er, shop er, blasting shop."
"And like,"
Yeah.
"A spray area, then"
Yeah.
Employ a sprayer.
"So, I mean, we know what we want, but  it's them and not us, I mean, it is frightening to start a business up, 'cos we don't know how much work we'll be getting, but, I mean,"
"Well, it's same for anybody starting any business, ain't it, you don't know if it's gonna work  as well."
"It might go well for the first three or four months, and then all of a sudden we might have a lapse in a few months ,"
Yeah.
you could be struggling to keep it above
Yeah.
"and especially, you know, these bloody big firms, they do not like paying bloody bills."
No.
"I mean, you could have as as much as two or three thousand pound owed to ya, but your business will still go under."
"Yeah, because of it."
Because of it.
Yeah.
"They don't look on them things, how much you've got owed out to ya."
I know.
"When you look you see everything's a bloody risk,"
"Most graphs will keep going on up, and there's a tendency for people to make them come back down again"
Mm.
or at least to where they started.
That means it's going backwards.
"Erm  now you don't do, paper three, you don't do  velocity time graphs, but you probably do them in physics don't you?"
You would do them in physics.
It's just like pure coincidence.
Aha!
Oh that's a good one that.
Revising it yesterday to be honest.
That's a good one.
got all pictures in it.
"Yes it has, but these are, those are, I've seen those before and they are very nice graphs, I would recommend them to anyone."
Right.
"So, you were revising them yesterday."
Should I
"Well the big thing, ah."
"See, it's very easy to get confused between distance against time, speed against time, and even acceleration against time."
"Yeah, because I mean it had them in our exam,"
Right.
"in our mock, we had like those four pictures, and you had to say which was"
"It comes up time and time again, and you have to know the difference between the different types."
"So  you also, when you get used to each type individually, need to then be able to switch between"
Mm.
between one and the other.
Yeah.
"So if we've got erm  acceleration against time and we get, no, no peeping."
No peeping.
"We get a flat one, what does that mean?"
"It's  Every one second, you've gone further."
We haven't gone anywhere
we've measured the acceleration.
That's the only way.
"Our cat, and I've really watched her  makes a point of going and walking slowly in the road."
And I think that is exactly what we have to do as cyclists.
Not squeeze to the side because they might not see you there.
right
"Well you sh you're supposed to ride a fair way out from the gutter, never in the gutter so they can see you round the bends."
Yeah but
And they often hoot you if you're doing it but that's the place
That is their fault if they hoot.
Erm especially going up that hill at Hockerill lights.
They overtake you  and then they slow right down so that you have to go oohooh and stop.
You can't cycle that slowly up a hill can you?
"They come in too quickly on, once they've passed you"
They don't they're in like that aren't they straight in front of you.
frightens me .
cycle underneath a car today .
Oh dear.
Michael  's got  helmet.
That's a good idea.
Yes  idiot wearing it though.
If everybody looks like him!
Oh well.
I mean it looks alright if you've got all the gear on  you know cycling shorts and top and everything
make them like swimming hats with lots of little flowers all over them
Yeah.
But if you do get one you have to be careful you get one that's done to the proper standard because some don't work apparently.
absolutely nothing.
Well that's what I thought it just seemed to say they were gonna have sort of cycle ways going through the green wedges along  where I cycle already.
Mm.
And that's no help at all is it.
we can't complain.
That should do quite well in trying to get the traffic away from the centre in Stortford anyway.
Well wonderfully cool.
They would they would watch where they would where they would excavate this thing out
Mm.
from.
But yes it was wonderfully cool.
Mm.
And the produce was salmon ?
And the prod it was it was sort of kept as within a reason of time of course it wouldn't.
But er and of course stuff was salted.
Venison
Venison of course.
you you buy er salt it away in barrels in boxes and and work on it until it was through.
Now was that your father's own particular task the the salting of the venison?
Oh oh oh n no really I can't say that.
Er we only probably did it when ourselves we got venison beforehand on the last shooting and to keep.
But no no er there was so many hinds having to be shot in the winter time and and and it would be sent away you see.
But not away what they're doing now or but it'd be sent down to their premises down in the in the shooting lodges in the south.
Mm.
And that  and to their friends.
And there would be always a beast or two cut up for to be given to the village.
Mm.
Oh yes that was one thing.
I always remember that.
So where did the venison actually go to?
Well it well ah but ah but they never they never killed it in that quantity as they're doing it now.
Mm.
To make money.
No no there was no money made of it.
It was just for their for their own use.
Mm.
And haunches of venison that was the best part in the  they would be sent away to themselves  the haunches.
But the other parts with the ribs and all that'd be cut up given to the and the lodge itself for the.
Right.
Let's list the tasks of a receptionist.
"Shout now, go on,let let's go for it."
"Telephone, answering it"
"And  telephone, answer."
That's what you think they do.
"Er, you're right, erm I can't think of the right word er"
Re-route.
"Re-route, same thing as what you meant isn't it?"
"Diverts, if I wrote divert up here you might use it against me in later life."
"Erm er route, let's just call it route er to  correct   yeah?"
"Does that make sense, that's for the receptionist we don't expect her to fiddle with the rates for liability, capital or whatever do we?"
Anything else a receptionist does?
Okay?
"Okay, so it's erm  meet  public yeah?"
We need to
Right fair enough.
well I did do stat view in the first year but not very much
Yeah.
"No, no I"
how to use it.
"find stat view very difficult to use myself but er when the time comes, once you've got a few that are filled in we can erm  well I'll show you how to do an S P S S data file and, and erm so you can bash your data in and if you bring it back we can turn it into a system file and analyze it."
Erm so er  that shouldn't be too bad.
"So I don't know do you, do you fancy now kind of giving the different versions to a few people by way of er er"
Yeah.
"another pilot and, and see if erm"
Well I'll just do it in my flat I suppose
Yeah.
"Yeah fair enough if, if that's erm you know how you fancy starting."
And then if you
finish it off.
"any, any sort of, yeah, any sort of changes or anything erm  er  I don't know if you're around sort of early next week we can"
That's fine
your using a name.
Oh no.
He's responsible.
No.
"Because within, within our, within our procedures and our quality systems, the word project engineer crops up quite a lot."
Project team
Yeah.
"But it's, it's not defined as er an M S two or an M S three."
"I mean take the example that Hugh is always using, is that if I wanted to knock a wall through, a hole through that wall and put a door in there with a link in it surely to goodness we"
Right.
don't need an M S two.
If that's
Mm.
"the case then can I suggest that we define within our quality systems, that project engineers will be M S twos or above, for check categories of zero or above, and that for jobs with a category of double zero"
Oh no.
they can't be beneath
"Very, making it very rigid."
Yes.
You see what our policy is M S two except b except by exception.
"For instance erm we would give certainly the better M S ones the smaller jobs to project manage, but that has to be very carefully thought about."
Project engineer.
Project engineer.
That's right.
What happens if everybody wants to
panel view this
Now I would imagine if we had suggested
In broad terms
I would imagine that if we'd suggested that project engineering duties would beco
Could be done at M S one
At M M S one and S T O
Thank you.
And for one reason or another the subcontractor bowled up on site on the Saturday afternoon and decided to do it then.
And he set up his own system of work using wal er er lookouts etcetera using er walkie-talkie radios and
staff exposed themselves to danger by standing in the four-foot.
His staff?
his staff.
Yeah.
There was nobody else's staff around at the time.
"It's likely we will ban the contractor for three months from, at least three months, from doing the work"
Mm.
although h he took a very professional erm attitude in dealing with the inquiry afterwards.
And didn't hide behind erm didn't try to make any excuses.
He said that it had been done wrong.
"He's actually sacked his own foreman, the main contractor cos the main, the foreman turned up on site and this I think is one of the lessons to be learnt, is that foreman turned up on site and saw what was happening"
and didn't stop it.
Mm.
And so condoned what was going on.
Mm.
And it's the major contractor.
Er may as well tell you i it's
So possession had already been arranged?
For the night.
The April the ninth.
For the night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But they did it.
Mm.
Yeah.
"That's the only reason we found out, is our supervisor turned up to take possession, and the contractor's guy said, there's no point, we've done it."
So.
we've actually found it.
Could have been an inquiry into a death.
"You know Ben Lech?hill, red hill going down to ?"
"I was young and foolish at the time,"
Fifty miles an hour on a bike ?
"Very, very high gear on it, we used to go out a couple of us"
And er  we were passing this M
You've got this on tape remember?
Oh no!
"We went past this bloke in a Morris Minor,"
"a convertible, with a  eyes streaming, it was really hard to see, and  clocked his speed at fifty, and er the bloke behind me nearly got hit,because when I went past this bloke  I went"
all over the road.
No you didn't really though did you?
Ooh no.
"No, no you didn't."
No officer I didn't.
Distance okay?
Yeah.
And displacement.
"When they measure your speed, they're measuring your velocity really, they're measuring it in a particular direction, along that road."
Mm.
"Erm so  we'll call it distance, right?"
"But we're actually talking about displacement, just so that you feel more comfortable with it, cos there are other things coming up to make you feel less comfortable you see."
Okay.
So the police say you were doing forty miles an hour.
You say how do you know I was doing forty miles an hour?
"I wasn't driving for an hour, you weren't following me for either an hour or forty miles."
"They say, ah well, we followed you for a tenth of a mile, right, and it took you so long to cover that."
"And we, our little machine here has calculated it that that's forty miles an hour."
Yeah.
"Okay, so what did they do?"
"They had your hundred a hundredth of a mile say, let's say it's erm  let's say it was a tenth of a mile."
Nought point one miles.
And they divided that by erm  nought point O
Not really.
So long as we're talking about sort of half a mile away ma maximum or with other sort of proper travelling arrangements.
If it's half less than half a mile away then it's it's fine but if not it starts to becoming problematical.
The other thing about financing it.
So I haven't done the sums in my head.
How much is it actually to get a  place?
Well if it's six pounds for six people that's thirty six pounds a night isn't it?
For four nights
Plus three
Plus a bit.
So it's about forty quid a night and there's Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.
It's four nights.
So that's  that sounds quite a lot to ask the political party
Oh I wouldn't ask them to pay
Yeah.
That would be too much.
But it's one way of distributing any money that the party wants to give to subsidize people so that everybody can benefit from it erm rather than means testing.
I'm happy as long as we we get the definite six people definite.
We I think you know we can do go into just four four people .
I I'm quite happy to come in on it.
I think I probably would like a single room though.
Are there two single rooms?
Two single and two double.
Yeah well on a first come first serve  basis a single room I'd come in on it .
Well strangely enough I think we'll have to have double rooms .
Well if if we do only get four people it's going to be more isn't it?
Yeah.
It's going to be ten pounds a night each
Yes erm.
roughly and you don't get breakfast thrown in.
No that's right.
I I would hope to be able to  party conference probably only  which would mean turning up either Friday night or Saturday morning.
But it
Or was that last year what seven or eight of us wasn't it?
At St Michael's?
The church.
Yeah.
That was last year or was that two years ago?
Er
There was something at St Michael's but I didn't know it was the one world week.
Yeah I have never been involved in a  one world week event at St Michael's.
I thought there was one there .
You certainly were there.
In the church
No I don't I don't think
Yeah.
Anyway I mean hopefully this this will be sort of you know if it's well publicized it it will be well attended because of the past.
I think we might as well get in a few things and anyway I want some envelope re-use labels .
I've run out completely.
There you are  so many packets already.
Well if you don't want Traidcraft's re-use labels I don't care!
Oh!
I didn't know you did them!
Well erm
Doesn't matter does it
"well apart from this leaflet on recycling facilities, what else shall we have?"
On the stall.
Well who's gonna do the leaflet?
I will.
I think we ought to sort that out
"Well that will be, I personally think that's the only thing we can do."
"And we should just sort of say what is necessary to find out and everybody gets a few telephone numbers or telephone calls  check out addresses  find out about new ones, get in contact with the district council erm what is in the pipeline."
Find out about Uttlesford possibly why there's is running and whether that is going to br breakdown.
"Erm and if we then find money for printing it I would approach Barclays Bank, banks, local banks  and would it do it very modestly the same local the same style er and only hand it out to  places where people are likely to pick it up."
"Oh yeah, Jean told me"
"she said no , Jean said oh I can't walk that, have a bloody heart attack she says, so they put her in a trolley"
"they put her in a bloody trolley and oh course she said, this woman said erm"
said she might be small she said but she ain't half put on some weight you know
Oh yeah
you know?
Yeah
"So I said well I don't, I don't look at her and I sort of see"
she said yeah she said sorted that out and put her in a trolley
Yeah but she had to walk back that way didn't she?
Did she?
"Yeah she went to, she went to the shops and got one of those trolleys, she said what for?"
"She said I want to go to Minehead now, what she said it's only just up there, yeah I know but I've, I've bloody got to climb down there and bloody try and get back she says, er"
"well it's not that she, it was affecting the drink she had you know"
Oh I see
"she said the drink, the drinks are quite expensive down there"
"Yeah, I'm glad they took their, took their own"
"Yeah cos what, what they said like, their own, cos they run out of wine at the bar  and er, they went in the supermarket and got two bottles of wine and kept them on the table you see"
Oh
"so, they said"
what was it?
"The wine that have in the bog, is that a cheap wine?"
Yeah
"Well they ran it like that cos they said at the bar we can sell you a bottle of wine for seven pound fifty though, so he said you bugger off he said that, went down the supermarket and get our own like"
Oh
"and of course the bloke that were drinking that he kept, then they buy a"
bottle and erm they used to queue at the table that for the
you know
Oh yeah
used to just keep topping that you know
I thought they'd be more into spirits than wine
"Well there were spirits weren't there, vodka and all that, you know, no I suppose one or two drunk the old wine you know"
Nowadays I mean I know there never used to be apprenticeships for women but
"Well I don't know if there are any women, I couldn't tell you whether any girls have applied to be like trainee tenters, that's people that sort"
Mhm.
the looms.
"Or, the trainees in our department would be female anyway."
Mhm.
"And the way the management work in here,I can say is they,aim they're promoting anybody to a chargehand they usually promote somebody that's actually no threat to themselves."
"There's a kind of yes man, that, that's the way the carpet industry works in general."
Mhm.
They don't promote somebody that's gonna shimmy past them up the corporate ladder although  you couldn't
say this place
"is a, a giant corporation ."
Mhm.
Aha.
"But sometimes I, I do feel that the girls, I, I know a couple of people in other departments that you could say would do the job equally well as the man they've put in, they probably"
Aha.
have bu be a better grounding.
Aha.
Yes.
"But I saw that in the glazier and  when I worked in there, they would bring people in."
Mhm.
Oh
M
they wouldn't promote?
"No, er, if you had a degree,"
Aha.
"and you absolutely no knew nothing about producing plain bearings you were sitting in the chair and probably a guy that worked his way through the factory floor who knew the job inside out, he was still"
a deputy.
Aha.
but because er you maybe had a degree well you get in there and you have to start
Mhm.
learning all this but you didn't know all the
"Their performance reports, training r reviews, schedule of objectives etcetera."
And that's J two stop zero.
E five stop one.
Contract documents and specifications for works and bridges.
E five stop one.
Sorry.
There is an X on it.
Works bridges and Q and Q S.
Erm there is now a standard pro forma for identifying liquidated damages.
The project engineer to agree with the client what the liquidem liquidated damages ought to be.
And there's a pro forma that goes through to the quantity surveyor's section.
P on it either.
Mhm.
Eh?
yours
Erm
got P on.
No.
Con H five stop two.
Contract variation orders.
"Erm contract variation orders are to be signed by the project engineer, irrespective of value."
Er subject to him of course having the nec necessary financial authority from the project manager or the client.
There are
Mm.
"arrangements in here that if it's in the middle of a possession and the project engineer cannot be contacted, then obviously the resident engineer can sign it."
"Erm but obviously there's er a, a need, the need to advise the project engineer, and the project manager, erm following the possession."
"Can I, can I raise a small point on that?"
That is
Mm.
"a number of my staff have repeatedly asked me the question, what is a project engineer?"
"And I've told them what a B E S one is and they said, why?"
Why are works ones different then?
everybody saw was not the
Mhm.
fit strapping Heseltine which I wished
You looked terrible.
which I wished to portray.
But this sort of tottering wreck.
Yes.
"You know, hobbling to the helicopter  it was my"
foot which had had been had gout induced.
Nothing to do with the heart at all.
"Anyway, Sod's Law you know."
that's politics.
But you did look you did look truly awful in that picture that appeared in the newspapers you looked as if
"Well my real real girlfriends wrote and said, Michael, you've got lovely legs."
But did you think you were going to die?
I mean was it
No no I didn't.
"I mean I must be honest, I did not feel that frightened erm it wasn't an acute pain that that I mean I mean one of the things that one has to realize, you can become a heart attack bore."
Very easily.
"Everybody who's had any sort of tremor or experience or much worse, they're all individual and it's no use me talking to you about my heart condition, because you haven't got my heart."
"Erm e e they're all individual and mine I think, looking back, was erm erm er a light er experience and I mean as I've said, the  the erm er w this telescope they shove up you, er I mean, Chris Patton had the same thing."
Erm is local anaesthetic in the groin.
"Up goes the telescope, you're lying there you know, and the doctor told me, he said, Do you wanna watch?"
Do you wanna watch?
"And I said, Ah."
You know.
Anything but.
Absolutely.
But erm anyway that's it's all it's all now a few a few months ago.
"Did it change your perspective on anything, on life, on politics, on what you're doing in in in the job?"
"Well I suppose erm well I  I I I mean I remember er ludicrous really, sort of thinking of what I would say at the Tory party conference while I was lying in  that hospital in Venice."
And I actually made some notes .
"You could substitute it, perhaps for that one."
"Yeah, okay, okay well look,"
Have a think about it
"yeah, okay."
"if, if you want to do a version of it first, I think we, we, we'll appreciate it very much."
"Okay, fine, okay yes."
"in order to get, because I hesitate to give you more work to do, you got enough work."
fine.
"But, think about it, it could be interesting."
"Yeah, okay, sure, fine."
We'll have words about it.
Thank you.
come on in.
"Now, I have some good news for you, and you could do with some good news, couldn't you?"
Yes.
"Least, I hope it's good news, from what you said last night, I think it would be good news."
"I have got you a computer, one of these  would you like one of those?"
I'd love one of those.
"Right, we can get you one."
I'll tell you what's happened.
"The thing is, the school has just launched a, a new programme to lend portable computers to graduate students, okay?"
"Now, we've got one in this department, like this, and er, one of our graduate students was very interested in it, and since she was just finishing her P H D   the in some of the ways, some of the most erm, outspoken erm, persons for this, but I'm certainly not alone."
"There's a growing body now, of people who are thinking along similar lines, and er, so it's, it, it's, I think you'd be unwise to wipe this off just, just as my eccen eccentricity."
"I mean, it may be that."
"Look, we're gonna have to stop."
"we can carry on with this next week, as, as you see, we've touched on a big topic, so we'll, we'll leave it to you to introduce next week's discussion, whatever way you think fit, erm, that raises other issues which you want to talk about."
Okay.
Thanks very much.
And well done  that was an excellent
a little contradictory.
"Erm, I read another erm, book on believing this."
"Yeah, fine."
I
"no I can't, no not there"
Let's have it then
"No, no you can't love, because"
We've done it at work
"Go on then  that is the same thickness as that in there, that is"
What's that there then?
"That's what that, that's come off there that has"
Well you pull it out don't you?
"Go on then you try and pull it out of us, that's what I'm trying to do look"
you want a pair of pliers do you?
"Have then, it's harder than what you think it is this"
Ah?
It's harder than what you think it is this
"Oh, I wonder why this was"
yeah
"I suppose that's why it went, sucking it up properly  I suppose she had it riding up"
had a tug at it and that's what rips it I suppose
Yeah
I'll get you a pair of pliers?
"You can get, you can get, you can get whatever you like darling, but you won't get that in there pliers, you won't get that in there, what I'll try and do is get a"
"What about cut through, what do you reckon?"
Well
"With that, let's have a go"
Want a cup of tea?
I suppose you've been whistling today
No
"Well we'll have to do upstairs, hoover that much longer"
Why's that then?
Oh cos when I've been doing it
"has been up there nattering, it's been noticed, so Norren come up to me today and she said oh er you don't have to do upstairs she said, give it a couple of weeks she said and you won't have to do it any more"
Why's that then?
You've got six month's free membership don't worry about it.
Yeah I wasn't worrying about the six month's free membership.
But it does put in rather six months out of phase with the local membership so at least
Well John sorted that he's brought you up to date now.
Mm.
Because you know it's the same thing.
I was gonna give the er local party er  it'll be sixteen months  worth local membership
If you want to give us a donation that's entirely welcome.
Perfectly acceptable.
I'll buy some .
I've already bought some
yeah.
bought some  more er
So what Joe wanted the meeting to decide is should we ask Mark to send off a cheque for those three people?
I think that's the only way to proceed to to sort out this tangle once and for all.
Yeah.
You see apart from anything else if those people  joined through us then we we must make good .
And we fixed it.
The system's fixed so.
Yeah.
It it has to be fixed by either us or the national party.
We can't ask those people for money if they've already joined once.
Okay.
Erm I'll get Mark to send a cheque off when he gets back from .
Okay is that oh I suppose as as another officer I can er tell you that the the newsletter has indeed been finished and gone out.
Erm I would like to apologize on behalf of myself and my  proof reading team for the fact that two calls for nominations that erm that are in this newsletter don't actually appear to have closing dates on them.
Oh god.
Which is a bit of a stupendous cock-up from us
"At least on my part I'm, if I had my engineer's hat on I'd er blame the proof reading team as well."
But er I suppose really I er
Well you forgot to read it because you threw coffee over me.
I suppose the blame is at least almost entirely mine.
"Oh, brilliant."
So there should be something in there.
"I found something from the AIDS one the new Benetton advert, have you seen that?"
No.
Is it really sick?
Mm.
"Not really, it's a bit rude, I suppose."
"It's of erm,photo coloured photograph of, it's either a bloke or a woman, you can't tell, from there to about there, so you can see all the hair and everything it's got  on the skin H I V positive."
"Oh, I think I have seen it."
"Ah, that's terrible."
"They're just out to shock, aren't they?"
"Yeah, I think it's a good way, and, cos it makes people go, bloody hell."
"And then they take note of what the issue is, yeah."
"realize, don't they, yeah."
"So I've got all ready, for me AIDS  cos I used to just think oh I don't really, I could just go and get some leaflets on ban on"
True.
"Well, I must ad I'll probably end up going down there, and getting the"
Our local chemist at home.
"Yeah, they've, they've always got this good stand, haven't they?"
"All this stuff, loads of stuff down there about pregnancy, and measles."
"Yeah, so they reckoned it's not a scrapbook, but it is really."
"That's quite easy really, I'm quite happy doing that."
Quite like that idea.
"But erm, yeah, it's alright."
"I like this girl, cos she's Welsh, just, I can't do her accent, but she kept saying it several times, he was getting really pissed off with her."
He'd obviously taken time over building up this little booklet explaining the stuff.
She just destroyed it in one go.
Really?
"Like he, he was like saying, it's got to be a  the word book, will eventually  he was really getting into it and really going into about, you know, how it's really gonna be jam- packed with important information, and she just said,so it's just like a scrapbook really  you know, when if you've filled all that up"
Yeah.
and somebody said that.
"It's like, oh yeah, thanks."
General essays can turn into just regurgitating from the .
Okay so is there anything you've read that you all would want to concentrate on?
Erm Well not that I've come across yet  I'd rather do something that's  getting the facts and then giving examples.
Mhm.
I want top do something on what what you noticed about  and what you've got
Right.
Right.
Er let me think.
"I'll just go and find out when the due date for this essay is, and then Cos if it is the end of week three then I'll I'll say o I'll say it can be in in week four sometime."
"But if it's due in when the project originally was which was week five, then that"
"gives you a bit more time to decide exactly what you want to talk about cos if  if it has go to be in week three or week four, then we really sort of like decide now what you're going to write about so that n Cos next week is gonna be our last meeting on this topic, so you really want to sort of give a bit of a presentation on what you're going to say."
Yeah I want everyone to do like five or ten minutes next week on what they're gonna write.
Okay I 'll just go and find out.
What are they supposed to be doing by the way?
What happens to the like project?
It got cancelled .
Cancelled
It got cancelled?
"Oh right, didn't hear that then."
"There  Oh that's why we're not doing it any more, so what do we have to do instead of having to do an essay ?"
Just an essay.
"Oh, they decided not to give us quite so much work?"
Mm.
Oh right.
So we Is that why the
"Is that what we're meant to be doing this term,tutorials?"
Think so I don't
When do our tutorials stop?
I'm really confused.
We've got two more tutorials?
"What Oh yeah, week three and week four, and"
Yeah.
It just cannot work every time.
Right.
"The on the, the, the, the procedures should be flexible er written in such a flexible way"
Yeah.
that those idiosyncrasies of the different sections can be accommodated.
Th they should reflect the best practice shouldn't they?
Yes.
"The best practice in, sometimes in M and E is, is quite different from the best practice in the"
Mm.
civils.
Right.
Le okay.
"We can talk genera generalities till the, the cows come home."
"I believe that, that that procedure could apply to you the same as it can to Roger and Terry"
Yeah.
and Dennis and Alan.
"Er and if, if y if there is a resource problem then you David and I need to address that"
Mm.
erm and find a solution.
"If when we address it we find that th the procedure is inappropriate, then we should change the procedure."
I agree with you .
Mm?
Yeah.
Okay?
"Er D two stop three, receipt of appointment contracts."
"Erm what we're trying to do here is to get the clerical sections more involved in the projects, and in passing the paper backwards and forwards."
"Er and we're identifying that the clerical sections are required to do a certain number of things when the project arrives, like erm recording the project in the index book, creating a correspondence file, creating project admin wallets, and the like."
So it's sort of er three things we're trying to do there.
"What, what was the reference of the urgent work one?"
"I, I've got that down as D two point three"
Was it three point two?
Mm.
Metal Mickey.
really
Metal Mickey.
Well that's
really a bright spark.
You know.
Yeah.
What I'm
But erm
"what I suggest is these procedures are, we briefly mentioned this this morning, are supposed to reflect the best practice of what we do now."
Yeah.
That is not what we do now.
"That is actually saying to the Q S, you've now got authority to come in to B E S and effectively do what you do on the civil side."
And what I'm saying is he's certainly not geared up to undertake that task.
And that certainly hasn't
Jim?
been debated.
"On, on, in many cases"
Mm.
Go on.
"I mean if I took your line, your, your logic and maybe I'm misinterpreting it, er we would not have changed anything when B E S came into, to our organization."
"And one of the most significant changes I wanted to make, and I think we have made was that the, the letting of contracts and the vetting of contracts and so on would be done by our Q Ss, in the same way as it is for the civil work"
Indeed.
"for a very simple purpose and that is that it, it improves our internal control."
Yeah.
"It puts an in a a almost er an independent view in there, of the costs and valuation of variations and so on."
"Now I, I think perhaps you're worrying unduly, Jim in so far as, your, your men will continue to administer contracts in the way they do now."
"The they still issue the certificate to the client, which is signed off price correct."
Yes.
"For them to sign off price correct, they have got to have had a look at the measure."
Haven't they?
Well they don't.
Alright.
May we go sir?
"Yes, you can leave the court now."
Thank you.
Back to case thirty one.
Miss  apparently you represent Mr   er well I  I notice from the documents with the er  summons it was adjourned  because erm  their solicitor wrote to say that he will be claiming not guilty?
Oh yes.
Is that the case?
"Yeah, your worships I understand that the  the prosecution are  are making application   I don't that you should go on with this."
So is it ?
If if it's not going to trial
When they were
we'll do it now we'll take it now.
"I wonder if I can insist, it isn't a matter where  and they have spoken to me about this  particular case  and"
Go to forty five your worship.
"Sorry, I forgot the"
"The view of the prosecution that this is matter  could be dealt with  quite satisfactorily by the way of  in the court  were minded to do that, if the court would accept that course of action."
I understand that Mr  would be  willing to be bound over.
Does that compare with that ?
Well obviously Miss  the magistrates will need to be satisfied there are grounds  why they should bind him over  they will also need to be satisfied that there is a fear for the future  otherwise they will not bind him over.
"I appreciate that sir, but you may feel at the end of the day that you need to hear  conducts from the case and if he is still present obviously  whatever the court wishes to do."
"I see, well in that case then I will leave it alone, I'll deal with this a little bit later on, obviously  it could take"
As you want.
possibly .
Who else is present Mrs ?
"Er  number forty one sir,."
Do deal with that your worships  please?
Forty one .
Are you Sylvia ?
Yes.
What is your date of birth please?
Ha?
"curiously enough, they seem to have I mean I I have"
"Yeah, but they have only to do with things like national security and and"
"Yes but er I I think that erm er the little by little, the conventions have been stretched."
And of course there's huge
do you think they should be tightened up again?
There's huge money.
Dramatic money.
You know.
"And and and and have no illusions, the money and the contents are very linked."
"That it's no use going round saying, Well here's my view of history as I wrote it."
"Er and it's factual it's it's analytical, it's it's erm devoid of the sort of bitchiness of politics."
Cos you won't get enough money.
You mean people spice them up
"Oh yeah, sure sure."
You think Mrs Thatcher's done that?
I have no idea.
I wouldn't dream of making such an observation.
But it sounds as though you suspect that.
I I'm not going to be drawn even by your deft questioning
Alright but the rules
in this direction.
But the rules ought to be changed.
There ough the rules ought to be hardened up to stop this kind of thing going on
I I I I I doubt if you could have rules.
I doubt any more whether we live in the sort of society where you could have such rules.
"Since we're talking about rules, what about erm Mrs Thatcher, Lady Thatcher wanting to change the rules so that a sitting Prime Minister can't be challenged."
Oh no certainly not.
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
"I w I I personally er made it clear at the time when they changed the rules er er fairly recently, that I didn't think they should."
"Erm I think that er erm politicians understand full well the nature of the profession in which they're involved and the parliamentary party is erm more than able to exercise a proper judgement, er I don't think there's any case at all for er changing th I don't think there was a case for changing the rules and I don't think there is a case for changing the rules today."
So you're out of step with people like Douglas Hurd and Norman Fowler?
Where they'd come from?
On some cases yes because I was always told this man he that used to come and he was so clean looking and that he was a barber.
Well that er er er an Englishman that he was trained as a hairdresser.
As a man's hairdresser.
But somebody er whatever he no he didn't carry anything to to do that no.
But that's what he's he told you?
Oh yes but he told somebody that he was a hairdresser.
And you would see that they were very some of them intellectual people.
Mm.
Too and who knows how they went to the road.
Mm.
Did they fail in their exams or something or went to drink or.
It's said nowadays about drink but I don't know.
They they were quite er learned men they weren't numskulls you know.
Mm.
So something just peculiar at that very time put them to the.
Did they ever do any form of casual work?
S some of them did yes if they came in the springtime and then in the ar in in the harvest time.
Yes oh some would w w work but some wouldn't.
Er and if if they would work they didn't want money for it but they would stay a while with you so that they would get their bed for the night and they would get their grub.
Mm.
What type of work did they  ?
Well they would take in er er er they would er er and they would put hoe potatoes you see when that was coming on that time.
And they would help to lift potatoes and they would er stack corn and hay.
Oh yes and that's those only that would do it but you wouldn't get the ordinary man taking any he would just be on his rounds.
And you wouldn't say oh I think it's going to be wet today John you better stay.
Not him his his mind was made up on going and that was it.
And were you visited by the peddler the pack-man character
Yes.
who sold goods
Oh oh yes er er who who sold.
Er there was one chappie that  er erm I can remember of him and he had a suitcase and well he had a shaving soap I suppose cos people used soap then with your shaving brush and and that and proper shaving brush and razor blades probably that quite.
"Yes, it says"
It says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.
You're no you're not reducing the size of the bus
well I think that's crazy
"And someone who's been u just used to driving a car, are they going to be able to drive a huge long bus with no extra tuition?"
Well
"Whether it's got sixteen people in it or twenty nine, it doesn't alter the length of the bus"
"Well, I drive the mini bus at the hospital"
I know
Which only takes four wheelchairs and of course there's the drivers of the minibus thing at .
I think I I would query that anyway
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition
"No, no but"
and just drive it
"But but I query as well whether, just because you reduce the number of passengers in it, that you don't need a P S V licence or the equivalent, it isn't a P S V licence but it's it's"
have looked into that
"It sounds doubtful to me, but anyway, there's the insurance point of view, but anyway  if people whoa re willing to drive can have experience in driving before they take passengers out."
Y'know I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it without passengers.
Y'know I I drove the minibus with only somebody in with me before I drove it with people in it
Did you drive
"Oh yes, I drove that, but that was a long time ago that"
"Yeah, but, you drove that one"
I drove it to Ashington and back
You drove  to Ashington in it.
Erm do you think I could throw these roses out?
"They're dead, aren't they?"
I'm afraid so
It's a shame
Pardon?
"They'll they'll have been forced from last Sunday, that was the  wasn't it?"
"I know, I know but they were dead by about Tuesday."
The yellow one was dead by Tuesday.
"Mm and then you thought, Oh God I've done it now ."
But I had to speak to you you see and I dialled you while you actually said on the air that anyone that won had to speak to you and said to Karen look if you ring back I'll  put the answer phone on .
I know I thought that was good because then everybody puts the phone down you see and they all think they're going to be terribly clever.
Yes I think it depends on what kind of a message you actually have on your recorder to start off with.
Is your's rude.
No it just says that it's basically to the effect of that the answering machine is quite reliable
I  I
"and if you leave a message it will be dealt with and people do leave a message, whereas before when it just said I'm sorry I'm not available they didn't they just put the phone down."
I usually leave a message saying I'm having sex at the moment ring back in about three seconds.
And do they?
Sometimes sometimes they never ring back at all ever.
I should've just say you're bragging.
"Yes you're right, you been speaking to my wife?"
Well yeah we'll probably use the same supermarket I don't know.
So listen I wan er er so is there any snow out there at all anywhere?
No no hon
There's not.
Any chips out there ?
Well to be honest Ja I can't see that far normally from where I live I can see the White Horse bank but it's shrouded in mist at the moment erm no I can't see so I couldn't tell you whether there there is snow up there or not.
Okay.
I also I I also erm er what was I going to say I would take the disc but I can't find a way of getting into this machine actually it's broken erm .
It sounds about par for the B B C.
"Young Danny, the big boss now weekend said er take a disc take a disc and I said yeah well  it's knackered er erm."
What?
Sorry.
I'm doing that talking to you look for Jim Bowen's mobile phone number so I thought we'd give him a ring that'll surprise him wont it?
Yeah.
Okay er
Can the B B C afford these phone calls?
I don't think so no I don't think so at all that's why they don't call anybody back.
Oh well you can call me back.
Erm oh hang on just a minute can you hang on there?
"Then there's, I, I, I'm the only person."
"quite a long time now I  begin to understand there are M S twos and threes are project engineers, and I"
Not necessarily.
No.
Er
They can be.
That was certainly my understanding and certainly
No.
if that is not the case then I'm gonna have to change the consultation documents because
No.
It's terminology isn't it?
No.
"Because, because the consultation"
We've
"documents clearly set out to the staff, what I thought was our collective understanding of the section engineer oblique project engineer relationship"
Right.
that section engineers at M S four level er acted as project coordinators or looked after their own element of the
Yeah.
"work, negotiated the er"
The fee
the fees
Yeah.
"and the remit with the client, and then delegated to, the work to a project engineer."
"And the project engineers were M S twos on medium jobs, small jobs, and M S threes on larger jobs."
And they were supported by a pool of engineers and technicians at
Mm.
M S one and P N T created .
Yeah.
But why can't the engineer at M S one level be project engineer
Because his responsibilities are different.
"in, in terms of"
Well.
"Erm, we're looking at all other things being equal."
"Let's assume that all the offspring are the same, in quality."
"Even, let's even make them all the age."
"Let's say they're all the same in quality, they're all the same in age."
There's still a difference as far as the parents are concerned.
Can anybody see what it is?
"Well, alright, I mean."
Let's deal with the first bit first.
Why should they treat them all equally?
"Why, why does the parent regard its offspring equally?"
In what sense?
Why?
This is the important one.
"From the parents' point of view, it is equally related to all its offspring."
"Now this is, this is the counter-intuitive bit."
Supposing I'm a parent.
"In fact,let let's do this in terms of a little diagram."
Let's put this on the board.
I'll do this in the lecture.
But let's just do it.
"It's easier if you do it on the board, and you can see it."
"Let's, supposing that I am the parent."
Okay.
I'm the parent P.
"Here am I, parent P, okay."
"I have two offspring, A and B which are smaller, little er A and B  offspring A and offspring B, and they are exactly equal in eve every point of view, size, quality and animal  okay."
"Now, erm, supposing that er, I have ten units of parental investment, and I invest ten in A and ten in B because I'm equally related to both of them."
Okay.
"Now, supposing that I want A to do something for B, like in  's case,A to give up a food item for B. Okay."
"Now as far as I'm concerned, if the benefit to B is greater, supposing for example, they're not the same age, sorry, I shouldn't have said that about being the same age."
"Er, supposing they're not the same age."
"But supposing I invested equal amounts of parental investment in both and supposing that if offspring A gives two units of parental investment to offspring B, the benefit to B's reproductive success will be three minutes, which it could be, if B was younger."
Yeah.
"Right,."
Okey-doke.
Hmm.
"It's, it's a bit cracked ."
It makes it very
"As I say it's better than, it's a bit better than it was."
But it's still not that
No.
good is it?
No.
No.
"Right, what we need to do is to hit it fairly hard and try to get it damped down as quickly as we possibly can."
Now don't get rid of the Betnovate have you still got some left?
Mm.
Okay.
Because as soon as it starts to die down you could probably go back on to Betnovate to keep it maintained.
And you may actually have to use Betnovate on a preventative basis every now and again.
"Even if there's not a deal there, as soon as it starts  it's slightly flaky  straight in."
But what I'm gonna do is give you erm Dermavate Dermavate is actually more potent than Betnovate in the ointment form again to get the rapid penetration.
"And once again, like Betnovate it's used twice a day."
And in a similar fashion you should use the Dipabase to keep the skin as soft and moist as you can
Mhm.
rather than letting it get dried out and cracked.
"Dermavate is, as I say, it's more potent, it's probably not so suitable for keeping going with, but for jumping on top of things in a hurry, it's fine."
And I think that's what we ought to use.
"Sometimes you actually need to use it under something, but it's difficult to use under things and part of the hand."
I don't know what you mean under
"Well sort of under a dressing, or"
Oh right.
"under a bit of polythene, so it, it actually gets absorbed even quicker."
Mm.
Mr
Yes.
"Obviously there are a number of detailed points and these are just the ones that are coming off the top of this meeting and you will have more when you take them home and, and read them."
"Most of the schemes that are put in here are actually assessed by the area highway engineer and if you've got particular schemes, especially ones that you know you've talked about in the past, the best way of dealing with them is to speak to him directly and say, why isn't it in this time?"
If you're not happy with the answer then I'd be pleased to hear about it and er and er obviously we can assess the priority .
"Erm, on  there's a specific question I'd like to ask er  if he could throw some light on that one."
"Yes, if I can mention that the  is on the  and it's really associated with the government's intention to raise the er limit of lorries to forty tons by nineteen ninety nine."
Now what we have done is looked at s these causeway relief arches which  pass the water from one side of the  to the other at .
We've looked at those and the v they have very seriously deteriorated.
"The concrete's spalling, the reinforcement is being attacked and we've looked at various ways in which they can be repaired or replaced."
"To replace them, for example, would cost something over a million pounds, but this is actually a repair to those er culverts  the ."
"Right, thank you Mr ."
"Right, can I take you to the recommendation on page nine that the programme be circulated to all members of the committee."
Erm
Quickly then
I  would be the case
No er
He's got a beard.
Oh dear
Ken
On erm
Ken  yeah that's it.
Bruce?
"Bruce, yeah."
That's it.
Yeah.
I like him.
Oh I used to listen to that for ages.
Mm.
I like him I do.
"He, he has some lovely records."
"Good, good choice, you know?"
"I believe there is so now, but there wasn't then."
"So it, it didn't really matter to me."
I've always still held my card.
Although I still held my card of the Transport and General Workers.
Mhm.
So you continue to be a member of the Transport and General
"Oh aye, yes, oh ."
Oh yes.
"God I  you could never tell if you're, you're going to be there long enough in job, if the, the boss didn't like you then he would just say well you're, you're paid off and that's it, so that's sort of benefit of keeping your union membership up you could go to anywhere where there was a trade union, a union membership and get a job."
"So er the, was being unemployed at that time quite precarious?"
If there was
"It was, it was."
"At that time, yes."
"It was er at that time because of the, they were very few and far between."
Employment was very few and far between.
"Because there wasn't the same amount of work,this is just after the war I'm talking about, and there wasn't so many  going then."
There were only starting making themselves then.
Er
"So were erm were jobs quite hard to come by in those days, after the war?"
Well er well it all depended on the individual themselves.
If there's a miner who's  in getting work.
Although you had to be very careful in er in d knowing what to go after.
Depending on the rate of wages.
Depending on the rate of wages.
"So you're actually, if you're going for a job, you want er for the highest place where you get the highest wages, which was a   for any working, you're going to"
What did you do after you left the erm after you left the timber mill?
"After the timber mill, er ."
Now can I remember about after the timber mill?
Let's see now.
My mind's a blank  I've been in that many different jobs now.
"I thought you said you were in a, a warehouse after that wasn't"
Oh that's right.
"Wednesday is a better day, and anyway Thursday's  erm   he's got a  he's gotta go at four  actually go at four not  an appointment, he's gotta go at four."
Why erm  why do the ministry keep coming down there then?
Do they turn up there?
"Well I don't know, whether they're trying to catch them out but they they certainly coming down more and more an and sort of more and more frequent."
I'm surprised they warn them that they're coming.
Well it's erm  the sort of things they pick them on really is not that
Not hygiene sort of thing?
"No, thing I mean silly little thing, well I think it's silly but there you are, they all see to  know what they're talking about but  I mean cer certain things like in the fillet room"
Mhm.
the meat is not allowed to go on just an ordinary pallet.
It's gotta go on a special one?
It's gotta go on a steel pallet  and yet next door  in the export chiller  they're allowed to go on a wooden pallet  and we work on wooden pallets  erm
I'm surprised they use wood.
Well if you see how many pallets they got  and you see the trouble is the metal ones are so slippery  they're all the while dropping meat all over the floor.
"Yeah I suppose they would, yeah."
There's loads of things they're on about  oh th the there's a whole  book what they gotta h have sorted out.
Do they?
Oh Christ yeah!
"Certain doors are not to be opened  things like emergency exits there's  they notice that there's more one of the emergency exits is actually broken, so the door don't even open."
Bloody hell!
So all that stuff
"Well then that is, that's gotta be sorted out because if you"
Yeah.
"had a fire there, somebody wouldn't get out properly!"
That's right.
Yeah.
Well that's like us we haven't got an emergency exit.
What way do you go to your nearest exit then?
"Well there's a bloody great  roller door, but you see it's at the end  we work"
Yeah well what about if the fire was down that end?
Well exactly!
How would you get out?
And I think they're ones that have a cartridge in.
And the information's recorded on the cartridge.
And they take the cartridge out and they send it down to Cardiff which is where Mel  is
Yeah.
"and he chucks it into, bungs it into his machine and then gets the printout then which he then sends to wherever."
Ah.
"So what we, we need to go to him I think in the first instance and say we want to do X Y and Z, and if he, if he says fine  you know."
"But if he says I'm sorry, I haven't got the equipment we then have to go outside"
Yeah.
obviously but I think you need  clearly in the first instance to use that
And you're saying to also mention to me if he's got
"Well I, it's just a thought."
I mean if we're gonna be speaking to him we may as well ask whether
Yeah.
"just to say that we, you know, that we'll, we, we're going, we're proposing to do some  origin destination surveys  interviewing, and we'll need the signing to go with it  that Gwyneth don't appear to have them and, and in consequence we're proposing to hire them elsewhere."
"Erm  and erm  you know, we know that last time it was done er the, the signs were not bilingual, the ones  census point and so on"
Yeah.
"and that erm is he w er would, did he think that would be a problem."
Yeah.
Cos I think last time we hired them from Staffordshire and I'd have thought if they're going to buy some they will be very happy to hire us them.
"Cos presumably, when you look at the layout  most of the signs are keep left signs."
Yeah.
Or you get the  you get ones that are sort of road narrows
Yeah.
"and you get the, the warning ones."
Yeah.
And the warning ones have a little census  plate on.
Erm  so presumably you perhaps need to do something about that.
But the keep left ones they're gonna have in stock aren't they?
Yeah.
"So the only ones you really need  and, and the, and the road narrows and the warning ones, they're all gonna be in stock."
Yeah.
My brother-in-law said he read in the paper that erm  over a year sort of  the amount of oil tipped on our land and down drains which shouldn't be there is almost like equivalent to the disaster at Exxon Valdez.
I heard that.
"Th erm  the amount of oil that people just tip on the ground, or down the drains or whatever"
Mm.
over a year is equivalent to the disaster of the Exxon Valdez.
So really people ought to be trained to take their engine oil out
"There's this, there's this er out of sight out of mind principal"
You are fined you are heavily fined in Germany and for  decades already.
"You were not allowed to wash your car on a normal street  because oil would automatically be flushed into into the guttering, into the"
They must be going absolutely mad about East Germany mustn't they?
Well it's just so incredible that this oil has never been  I mean nobody focused on it did they?
No.
People just don't think.
They just tip it oh tip it down the drain.
Same with petrol stations I mean  the way they  spill the petrol.
I know!
There used to be safety catch mechanism
Yeah.
but there isn't now is there it just comes splashing out.
Well really I mean with quite a few you really have to watch out which is
they had a row at erm petrol station when that happened to her.
And they said it was our car.
"and, and it went, cos it was quite a bit more worth petrol that went all over the place."
And she refused to pay.
And they  me up about it.
"I, I sort of denied all knowledge ."
I didn't know it had happened!
I think they were being most unreasonable.
We at the time the attendant said it was alright.
She didn't have to pay for it.
it could easily  I mean  will be shorter I think.
Sorry?
"Right, that's the other element, it's what you think they think you should be doing and it's amazing how few people, yeah that's the  yeah"
"I  talking about, but that's what job specs are all about."
"It might seem long-winded, but dependent upon er if you get it right at the start with it, it might mean that one of the things we're suggesting er you might say no, it's not for me this, but you might think that job analysis is a good way of identifying training."
What they've gotta do and why they do it.
What's the starting point for job analysis do you think?
What's the first thing you've gotta identify?
"Yeah, the need for the job er  er  yeah, not, not quite exactly what I'm looking for,the way of the trainer's dilemma isn't it?"
"I've got an answer for that it's not quite right, what shall I do?"
"Can I just say no, shut up."
Or should I and this is all part of it isn't it?
Cos he won't say anything to me if I don't know what's wrong
erm won't say anything else will he?
What  results
"Yeah, alright."
"Yeah okay, so we're looking for results."
The results of this person why are they employed.
So the results that we expect out the job.
If you get results it could earn a job analysis what would we do?
"If I, if I was a job analysis person, what will I  sit next to you wouldn't I and what would I have missed out?"
"Right, yeah."
Another word for main responsibilities.
"Mm, you're testing me today aren't you!"
Right.
Key  tasks  What is the person's key task?
This is difficult stuff I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this  because it's covered on various other courses as well.
"Things like appraisal skills er level one level two, various others, other courses that we run."
"There's your job  the first thing I should do is say well what are the key tasks, what are the areas that would mean results?"
Perhaps a working demonstration might highlight something I'm trying to .
Take the job of a receptionist.
Who's been a receptionist?
You have haven't you Elaine?
Yes
"So they went up there and did that, and then, I ca they've done quite a lot and then they're going up London tomorrow, I think."
So I don't see much of her.
So you think they'll probably stay up there next weekend?
Don't know.
"I'll see, I might, might go out tomorrow instead of Sunday."
"I don't know yet, I don't know ."
"What's happening about your car, is Craig going to take it back with him?"
"Well, I suppose he might as well, I mean, if you're off work, he might as well have it, mightn't he?"
"Yeah, that's true."
Mm.
"Unless I feel like being really vindictive,"
"saying, I want the car."
No.
I don't need it.
"I could have done with it, I couldn't get on the bloo they got this internal bus service that runs from each college, cos you have to go to the other colleges for your lectures, and I just sort, there's not enough, and you, you get turned away, and I just thought, I went for that bus Tuesday morning, I was supposed to get it at eight fifteen, and he just said sorry,no more room ."
"Oh no, so what happens then?"
"So, security guard came over, and if you go up to the next stop,bus, you could come in with them."
"So we got on that bus, and he didn't like it, this bus driver,oh, you're not supposed to be on here"
"What, because you hadn't parked your cars there first?"
"Yeah, but the thing is, we're not from  college, so that means their students are gonna be, like, pushed out."
Yeah.
"So anyway, we got on, and he"
"Well, that's their problem, they should get more bloody buses."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, the thing was, because it left about fifteen minutes later, at a quarter past eight, there was so much difference in traffic,"
Mm.
"half eight, getting on quarter to nine, it was jam-packed and I didn't get into the college."
It's a ten minute bus ride.
I didn't get into that college until gone half nine.
"Oh, really?"
To my lecture.
"Yeah, I didn't walk in till half nine."
The lecture starts at nine.
We didn't come into it
"Well, I mean we just said well that's, you know, an expensive place for a holiday by the sound of it, but erm we hadn't got into any details."
Well this was erm Bulgaria
"Yes, yes"
Mm
"but er so I, I don't know if he'd be interested in."
I certainly wouldn't coach it  so  I think you would be creased by the time you got there in two days.
Yeah but of course if you were being serious you'd have to ask him directly wouldn't you?
"Oh yes, yeah, well I, I, I think we'd have to  to begin with to er get something a bit more concrete, you know, about time, time"
Yeah
"cost and what not, and then you know when we've decided I mean  I'm not particularly bothered whether"
"comes along or not, but I just thought it might be nice to to give him a break away from home and he won't go on his"
"Well I mean you're only doing it for him really aren't you, that's the idea was to help him"
"Well this is it, he won't go on his own will he?"
"But the only other thing perhaps he'll go with one of the kids, that's a possibility"
"Yeah possibly but I don't think they, do, they don't, I mean they, they lived in Germany for a while haven't they, so, I don't think, oh no, didn't they go to Cyprus one year Pete and Colin or am I dreaming?"
Italy
Did they?
Yes Florentine
or near Venice
That was when he was posted in Germany wasn't it they went from there
Yes
"that's right, yeah, but whether they I suppose to be in a position to"
What they got
"afford a holiday now, I mean now they've taken on a mortgage"
Yes that's a point
"so, you know"
"that's a point, yeah"
so unless erm
even if we
tell us we
went away for the weekend we could ask him along couldn't we?
"Thanks, bye bye."
You can stay of course!
Don't blame you!
Can I just draw your attention to your item on Urgent Business.
Do you all have sight of that?
"It's headed up ‘Appointments and Authorization of officers’ and you're asked to authorize Stephen Stansfield, a non-professional health technician, as detailed in para."
"2, it's a very normal and routine bit of work for you."
Are you agreed?
Agreed.
So that we can get on with this work.
Thank you very much indeed.
On to item six and seven.
You'll remember we do this on an annual basis.
It's very efficiently organised for us to do.
"We've got Keith Dryer here, I think, of the engineers."
"Keith, would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six, street collections in Oxford."
"Thanks, Chair."
"Basically, the latest, and I mustn't take any credit, and there seemed to be some credit, Chair."
"This lady on my right, Katherine Powell, does all the hard work and committee reports, and I thought it only fair to bring her here today, because she's the person that does the set fifty-threes,"
She does?
She's one of the members you can come to.
So Katherine can answer the details on the report.
Right.
"Welcome, Katherine."
I didn't realize that's who you are.
I'm the one who'll always be late getting a reply back on the set fifty threes!
"So Katherine, do you want to say anything on the report at this stage?"
"I'd just like to point out that erm on the street collections as you've always done before, AvaRag and NovaSports don't generally get passed, because they don't actually help anybody in Oxford."
Right
That's the only thing I'd like to bring to your attention.
"So, you can confirm for us that NovaSports are still in that position, and I think some of us understand the nature of Avarag."
"Yes, erm they've got a sports centre in Nottingham, and that's the nearest thing they've got to Oxford."
going on.
"that falls down Hugh, is that people assume because they've commented that, that when it comes out in its final version it'll reflect their particular comment."
"They never get a feedback saying, thanks for those comments but I've  those because, because I thought somebody else's"
comments were more
a lot more slice .
No.
No.
"Not not, not"
It's just a modification from
Yeah.
the slices
"L lots of the revisions are not sliced and certainly in, in cases like this where"
Mm.
it is a er er a specific
Direct.
"request or a direct request that something is changed, then it"
is given to in this particular case the Dave  s of the world or other function heads and told
I would still like to issue
that.
"Er a and I think we issue it and then t in Jim's situation, erm I think what you tell your staff is that this, this has been issued, and we are gonna find a way of erm working it in your organization."
Or if it is impossible to do so then we will have to have a look.
"Well surely it, it just means that in in Jim's organization"
"I, I don't see the problem."
that when specifically requested w will apply in
in ninety nine percent of the cases.
That will be reflected in the quality plan anyway.
So
Yeah.
where's
Yes.
the problem?
Mm.
"Shall we have just a quick Lisa and Dean want to tell us what's going, cos they've had you, had the first meeting now, haven't you?"
Do you want to tell us what interest there was.
"I, I was about to ask the same thing, yeah ."
"Are you going to,interest  ."
"Well I called a meeting but I didn't think I advertised it well enough because there was a lot of interest and then I think we held it at the wrong time as well didn't we,"
Mm.
"we held it after prep, so we've organised another one for tomorrow lunch time and erm  and lot more people express interest because of that, we haven't actually got any letters yet."
"No, that's  so when we leave there should be more interest."
"Mm, mm, good, good."
"And I'm intending to, to hold a few more assemblies as well to sort of get interest going again because it's been a while since we did an assembly on it, so if we do another one, that usually gets it going again doesn't it?"
"What you run assembly's with on, particular topic then."
"Yeah , well we'll take erm Michael  gave us say erm a, an assembly sheet didn't he and we just read from that, and that got a lot of interest from that."
Yeah
"Mm, good"
How many teams were suppose to meet  out of that?
It was about twelve people.
How many is that?
.
There were a lot more people than that.
That was last week.
"I was gonna say, there were a lot more people when we went to school."
"There are a lot more people than that, there, I only put one advert ."
"Well that's, that's, lot more people who are interested ."
Right.
"Even so, that tell us ."
"Ah right, well yeah, I suppose"
Advertise in Stortford
Twelve is a working number.
"Oh well I hope, I hope it goes right tomorrow."
Yes.
"Yes, good, good, just keep in touch with us and know how things are going."
Yeah.
What you you say the shock of it.
What what was it like?
All of those of us who haven't had a heart attack live in fear of it obviously and think
"Yeah well, I mean we all My father died of a heart attack."
Mm.
And erm er that was a long time ago.
I si think it's very possible that he wouldn't have erm died under today's
Today.
conditions.
I had wonderful treatment in Italy.
I was very close to a a hospital with a wonderful cardiac er unit er where they had a professor who was one of the leading Italian in the subject.
"I was there within an hour, so I couldn't be more grateful and appreciative."
"They're wonderful people, the Italians."
"Er anyway that the the but the actual experience, er one knew something was wrong."
"I was not frightened, I didn't think anything was that wrong."
"But I said to Anne, Look I think you better get a doctor."
This was before it happened or when it happened? you didn't have sort of intimations that something was going to happen ?
"Well I I you see, it's all hindsight."
"I think in truth erm er we'd taken a weekend off and er to go to Venice, there was a big er art exhibition on and Anne wanted to see that."
"Erm and I I wasn't feeling on top form and er looking back, I perhaps should have gone to a doctor then."
But you don't you know.
"Erm but th anyway, there it was and er I had this pain Not not acute, that's why I wasn't that worried."
it didn't last that long.
Erm and from that moment I got into hospital and I had no more trouble.
But I mean of course they plugged me up with all sorts of things.
Wi with of course one disastrous consequence.
"Which er I mean, damn the British media like all politicians do."
One of the things they have to do is to get your uric acid I think it's called erm content correct.
And it it so they give you some m medicine for that.
A side effect of which can be that you can develop gout.
And so the what what what that
"Ah, that explains"
right okay what sort of.
Do you make presentations now?
meetings
yep so it's it's about meetings?
yep
"great, thanks, Tom"
"erm, my name's   from Edinburgh a couple of jobs  one which is  the sort of presentations I do tends to be one to one  the hardest one for me as I say meetings with quite a lot of people there"
right
"erm, I think I want to try and improve my presentation"
"right, so it's the actual presentation skills themselves"
that's right
and what we actually do when we're standing up so that it becomes more effective yeah?
Great.
my name's  I'm from Tarmac Construction Plant at  depot  I'm office manager and I'm also in charge of the stores hiring all the plant and equipment for all the sites in our area
right
I also  as many stores as possible
of course
erm I don't make presentations as such but erm I do have one to one discussions with on the sites on what plant they need and stores
"right, yep"
basically I hope to be more  effective in talking to  as I can
"right, so it's about persuasion isn't it?"
yeah
"right,Mike"
"I'm  I'm a site agent for Tarmac Construction at  erm I attend quite a few erm presentations really, tender interviews often going to the clients management meetings, site meetings and then like a lot of you the one to one situation."
sure
apart from most of those
right
erm I'd like to be able to present something in front of me which prompts me a bit better than I do at the moment I tend to get lost in what's in front of me.
"right, right so that's that's partly to do with you your preparation isn't it but it's if I put the word script"
yeah
we'll I know what we mean yep  how do you prepare what what you physically have in front of you so that you're able to put the point over effectively
"yeah right yep great, Dave"
comprehensive list.
New recruits ask them  what a good idea.
"Charts of  asking questions, if people come to you and ask questions keep referring the same things  similar things to you all the time."
Perhaps it's cos they don't know the basics.
What sort of errors do they make?
Persistently make errors and the same  with it.
"Complaints from other departments and complaints from members of the public, changes in job spec er new technology perhaps er   backlogs that, people always have a backlog don't they?"
"Is it cos they're lazy, often think it's cos they're lazy don't they?"
I think it's often because people are always  and then it always gets put to the bottom of the pile.
Things they're not so sure about .
"Perhaps might not be it, can't, you can't wave a magic wand and say everything's  but they might not."
Body language can suggest you have  like jumping out a window or hanging themselves or whatever.
"Promotion, succession planning."
"We do enough succession planning in C U  you know it's magic you know, you know number two like it's smashing number two it's still you know, you know young children, number two has a different connotation to what it does here, but definitely if you are a number two here, it means the same to what a child thinks it is, but I"
"er, and appraisals."
All  all packets that we can use to identify  I really do need people to talk to me.
"Alright, so that's a brief out overview if you like of some of the errors that we can do."
Let's go a bit more specific  Job analysis.
We do the first bit who needs to be trained  what do they need to know is the second
"Yeah, so what they need to know and why  forms a heading Job Analysis."
Where do you get your job analysis from?
Personnel.
What?
Personnel.
Personnel.
"Okay, has anyone seen their job spec?"
Does it actually give you any training  on it?
It's very broad isn't it  yeah.
Erm
Oh no it's the same sort of thing you're told it when you
You're told it aren't you?
It tends to be blocked up in somebody's mind what you do.
"What a shame, never mind."
"Right, I'll put my make up on"
Can you tell me where you want this umbrella tree?
Er
it needs a saucer of course
Well there's a huge saucer on the old one
Oh but that's in
Well
plant pot  altogether
"Well, just leave it there for now."
"Erm, I'm going to put my make up on and think what I need from the shops"
It's ten o'clock
I know.
I'll have to hurry up or you'll get no dinner .
Oh my head feels .
I do I haven't had a headache like this for
I wanted a carton of live yoghurt.
"I don't think the live yoghurt I used was any good because, for a start it was fruit flavoured, no it wasn't it was natural, but it said mild flavoured and I don't think it was the proper like the Greek style really live yoghurt that would have started all the fungus growing on it."
It is beginning to look like a proper .
"Er, ok, I'll go and get ready"
I don't think it matters but if the weather's still going to be freezing at night
"I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still."
I've got it standing on that brick to drain.
Wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
"Some of the erm stems on it look as if as if , not mouldy, but er they're sort of"
Well we'll just have to dig it up and put another one in
green
"Those hyacinths in the corner are taking a long time to come out, aren't they?"
"I'd have though the tulip  in the coal scuttle, the tulips in the cauldron, I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely"
"I know, but they've straightened out"
but they've grown up again.
And those forget me nots that're called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers are coming out with tiny pinky purple flowers.
On the deep
Oh on the deep
two or three gorges
Oh you want to fetch it down to a board technic
"That's so I can get two out of the one you know for the sides, erm, sides and"
"Oh you want them to deep, deep, deep"
"I don't think I'm gonna get that much joy myself, cos their reluctant aren't they to do anything that's not new."
"I thought there might be somewhere where they'd have an old circular saw you know, probably got a bit more chance with help, but they do a bit of rough cutting do you know what I mean?"
"Yeah, but you won't get two out of it will you?"
But
"Well they're only for sides, you know, I'm, I'm doing them like er"
I
the sides are coming out er like this you see
"those, those are already you know like that their fortunate with those"
"I, I like them"
"but, but I haven't got enough you see"
Yeah
but er
you won't get two that size will you?
"You reckon not, not with the cut, it's, well not that I know it's, it's got two"
it is a good er about one and five eighths
"Oh I say, yeah, you, well, you'll get one, you'll get a second one there, full one there"
"Get a full one, get it doesn't matter really and I get one that width out of"
"Yeah, yeah"
here you see and it'll all be joined up.
"It's, it's a band saw really that you want to put down"
"Mm, they're not really safe"
"Yeah,"
a band saw are you now are you?
"I got the old metal detected on, but, of course it could always be a bit of grit in it couldn't it"
Yeah
or something like that.
"as opposed to the, but, but some cupboard doors are diamond pattern, Muffin will you be quiet  have we any more bones cooked for them or have they had them all?"
No there's some there
Cooked?
"oh that's what I mean, erm, well listen we'd better try and just, practice somehow and see erm"
what do you
erm
Are you gonna left that battery on
"well, well only temporarily, I only want this"
"it's alright it's just this unit thing, when connected to"
"right erm, just erm"
"It just drops in there doesn't it, hanging"
"oh I would of thought there was a rest for it surely, no?"
Do you think so?
Just down the bottom
Just down the bottom
Right  what you're going to have to do is erm
Get a piece of wood with a nail in it
"Yeah, yeah"
I tell you what get a hold of that and put something underneath it.
"I don't know, it don't seem to react to that, that's a bit, mind you there again there's only going to be that there isn't it?"
"Er, well, put it on the floor"
Go in your basket go on
"Yes, I cannot give it much more"
"re-allocated, I might be able to get the two sides on, but I'll need more, obvious have some more wide bolts for the er top and the bottom"
"So er, what you actually got to have it cut now, what have you?"
Those four
Mm
to that section of the
"oh these are about two inch are they or some, didn't say"
it wouldn't split in half went for it and
Twelve inches across are they?
That way
"the main point that I made to him was that after such a superb beginning where, where they actually state how much rubbish we produce, there's absolutely no mention  even though there's space at the bottom  there's no mention of recycling at all."
"And he said well it's a different, you know different department."
Mm.
I know yes
"And this was, this, that, that wouldn't have entered into  that brief but my argument was that, you know everybody would be much happier if there was less rubbish to put in the landfill sites  in the first place."
"Now that was about two weeks ago and I've been sitting on it meaning to, to write to the press and say how disgusting it was."
Which I have just done today.
"Aft , no"
"Yes, half way through I spoke to to the environ environment officer"
Mm
who was much more  switched on.
"He's a new environment officer, he's only been there for a month or something."
And he says that  erm.
He sort of agreed with me that it was a waste of an opportunity.
Erm but he did say that he's actually writing a leaflet which they can run to seven or eight pages.
A detailed one about recycling.
anybody will read so  eight pages.
Well I don't know.
I just don't know.
But I mean he was very interested and when I said that we'd actually done a recycling directory and that I was thinking
redoing it.
Erm.
He was very interested and he would like to meet us and I said that if he's actually doing a directory
all this all this about.
I thought Rob is doing a sort of recycling what do you call it composium
Rob has just done a green audit for the district council.
Yes.
Yes.
But we haven't had the opportunity to read it.
I mean he knows that we have a recycling d .
I was in touch with them.
I sent them the recycling.
The
I
only re yes by all means
our project quality plan check list reflects that.
.
Naturally your
Mm.
your way out is to get
"D Dave  to write a letter, saying for all projects I wish him to do"
Y no.
No.
No.
"Terry, Terry there's no point."
"All all that, all that"
That is stupid.
All that Jim's trying to do
the reason why
Is to change
"I, I don't mean that in a disrespectful way."
No.
No.
I know but
"It, it, it, it is stupid in, in so far as the more sens if we were gonna do that, all you'd do is you'd write"
the procedures in a different way.
Yeah.
The procedures
"were written in this way, because erm there was a move from a certain part of the organization to exclude the Q Ss from elements of work on an unreasonable to an unreasonable extent."
"Now if we work as a team and we work very sensibly and reasonably, it may wo may well be that the most sensible way of working is for the project engineer to decide who's gonna do the site measure."
But at the end of the day these guys sign off price correct.
"These guys therefore must have a facility of ensuring that the price is correct, from an internal control point of view I want them to be involved in certifying that the price is correct."
That is how we came to the conclusion that they should be
"I, I, I  I certainly think there's a great deal of sense in it all."
Yes but I remember right a .
So it was things that wasn't too heavy to carry but things that was always needed in a house and that you could run out of.
When we were er were living all on the road so we were expecting to be supplied by vans.
Mm.
And my word there was plenty of vans in them days.
Both getting butcher meat.
What even in the thirties?
Yes oh yes er er when we had a wee baker's van coming up from the Nedd to Lochassynt when when  Lochassynt Lodge you see.
So these people that had little private shops in them days did well because when the people came to the lodges it all the commodities were bought to as well as them.
It's not like nowadays when people has big fridges
Mm.
buy their stuff away down south and take it.
But no they would buy it there aye .
So provisions were bought fairly regularly in those days.
There wasn't the same er bulk buying that you see nowadays ?
No no there wasn't the same.
But only well we would get it buy it in bulk ourselves supplied by er Hamiltons of Glasgow
Mm.
and it would be coming on the steamer McBrayne's steamer and
Up to Lochinver?
Yes to Lochinver yes and that same steamer would be calling in Kinlochbervie and all the villages and this traveller for Hamiltons would be going round beforehand and you would be getting a hundred weight of sugar and tea it would be in a big tea box er er probably er er Ceylon coming from Ceylon but you the whole or you could buy a small quarter.
But oh yes you would buy all that stuff in bulk.
Mm.
But that stuff that was in bulk but you would never er no perishables no peri
Mm.
Can you recall in those days Tommy how people kept perishables?
Well er er there were it was big caverns that'd be underground.
If there was a big bank at the back of the house they would have a hole just dug out and er built up with flagstones
Mm.
and therefore it was when when you would go in there it was quite cool.
Mm.
Even in the Summer?
"Erm but the idea that someone is putting it all down, all those private conversations, all those tensions, and it's all being recorded, not to present the historic truth, but to present the truth as the person wants history to read it."
"That's what always happens, they're self serving, self pleading, self justifying."
Er perhaps they're helpful to the historians because they can then put them all in a room.
"Although I must say I I mean, one of the most fascinating pieces of politics I was ever involved in, was when I had to defend Mrs Thatcher over the Belgrano incident."
And people were very kind about the quality off the speech that I made that that did it.
I believed she was one hundred percent right.
I believed then and I believe now.
I must make that absolutely clear.
"But I had to get together in one room, the admirals, the intelligence people, the civil servants, all the people who'd played a critical role in advising her."
"It was only six months before, they couldn't agree."
I wonder what each of their memoirs would look like.
So what about mrs Thatcher's memoirs?
The timing.
"Well I glanced Yeah, yeah."
"You know, look, I did a deal with Mrs Thatcher in nineteen eighty six, that I wouldn't open up many of these issues, and if she sticks to the deal, I'll stick to the deal."
But she hasn't.
"As far as I'm concerned, personally, so far, she has."
What was the deal then?
That I wouldn't pursue the issues of nineteen eighty six.
"And I I haven't I  with the No it's very simple, I left it to the select committees of the House of Commons."
"But we're talking about now, we're talking about Mrs Thatcher having written"
I  deal
a set of memoirs er critical of the Prime Minister while he's still in office .
Erm er I'm she hasn't been critical of me.
No but she's been critical of lots of other people.
Well we don't know for sure yet about what she's said about you.
Do we.
If
"That's what I said, If she sticks to the deal, I'll stick to the deal."
S But but y what what you're saying is that if someo Have you seen the book by the way?
Have you read the book?
Right .
It was the Daily Herald wasn't it?
When it came out first.
Ooh.
Senator Ted Kennedy revealed yesterday that he is to wed lawyer Victoria   who's father is to stand trial over an alleged  fraud.
Kennedy sixty started dating the thirty eight year old divorced mother of two last June.
I love her and her children very much  he said.
"Victoria's father retired   oh he's   father's  Victoria's father, retired judge Edmund  denies fraud ."
The Kennedy's are in  trouble every corner aren't they?
It's nothing to do with him.
"No, but er I mean he's even marrying into trouble."
The whole of his family.
His father and all.
Remand prisoners at a top security jail used a thin mobile phone to make threatening calls to court witnesses it was revealed yesterday.
An astonished guard alerted Durham Jail chiefs when he heard a phone ringing in a cell.
A search revealed the battery operated handset hidden under a mattress.
Calls made from it were traced by police to the homes of witnesses due to give evidence in trials on Tyneside.
At least one case is understood to be involved in a murder charge.
A top level enquiry is underway into the racket.
Dubbed by prison wives the cellnet scandal after the cabinet mobile phones system.
"Visitors are thoroughly searched before they are allowed in to the jail which houses two hundred remand prisoners, killers, I R A terrorists and rapists, and the investigation will examine whether a prison officer may have brought in the phone."
"One senior officer said  it would be extremely difficult to smuggle one in, security is so tight here on visits ."
"Oh well, there's always a lapse isn't there?"
What time does this budget start today I wonder?
Not that we've
What budget?
heard it all before.
What budget?
"This er, the labour giving their  oh dear"
Is Barnado's advertising?
Back again.
Oh there.
Make a credit card donation.
Haven't really
local wood guides ?
Well Rob's got two
cos I'm just deciding on a new window frame.
And all the firms are claiming that they only get their hardwood from government  erm replanting programmes.
And one got a  stamp and a seal on that.
But whether that is acknowledged by our Friends of the Earth I don't know because I mean they have so many stamps and seals on
They won't give you names now will they?
The Friends of the Earth .
They won't give you names of companies any more.
"No but if this stamp, this acknowledgement."
Oh it's like a little  is it?
good government scheme or not.
Whether that is known  by Friends of the Earth as a good scheme or not.
I think  there's a day of action coming up on this sort of D I Y stuff.
so maybe we'll get some more information about that.
I'm gonna try and get the  book back from Rob.
Martin's an architect and  and it actually probably would be  you know it might be a good thing to actually sort of provoke a question with architects because they do specify these things and they're the ones who actually say  you know right we'll specify hardwood .
It's one of the decisions that are actually made by them in terms of what they use so  erm that could be something that is
Yeah
"round to architects just sort of provoking the question cos they, a lot of them have never thought about it"
Mm.
"and er  you know if they did erm I mean Martin asked about the, he asked about the good wood guide you know and I told them where they can get it but that they can have it in their office and put it in their library."
"You know so that, that's quite a good idea."
Yeah
"But that's so quickly out of date again you see the good wood  cos I mean they they have new government schemes, schemes every year don't they?"
Mm.
And new other schemes.
And
"What, at least it will enable you to know what the tropical species are because some of them have got quite weird and wonderful names and most people don't know what some of them are."
Mm.
I know mahogany is citello .
"I can't do job, it's course work, don't you understand?"
Well
"How am I suppose to copy up course work, it's my own work"
"Do, do you study that at home then?"
What?
A science or something
"Mum it's a tutor period, it means work"
Oh you'll have to work then
don't sit around for an hour doing nothing
I realise that Richard
but don't be stupid
"Look, if you've got work to copy up, why can't you study and work in"
Because he's a tutor
What do you do in it?
I have D R N L As to do
"Mm, I used to let my  when it's tutor period, get on and do some revision work"
Good grief.
"and it's much nicer it, they know what they've got to look at."
"I've got to go and see Wally in tomorrow for the forms, I ain't got any forms to fill in cos I'm officially not leaving, I'm only moving"
"That's right, that's right"
change of address
I don't know it yet
"it will be change, I can't say, is it, I mean I said it's a change of address, they know I'll probably be moved in four to six weeks"
Do get that out of your mouth please
Which is it gonna be?
I'm not signing or changing anything Richard until we have exchanged contracts
"Oh yeah, that's easy muck around do what I do"
"No Richard because the whole thing can fall through  when we have our survey done it might show a defect or something, we might pull out, when they have their survey done it might show a defect so they might pull out, you don't do anything Richard until the contracts have been exchanged, then you can start saying right I think that's, that's, every thing's definite"
Alright  we were doing company law  and
"Mm, mm"
"I was damn good I knew everything, first I had to watch the accounts and secondly I'm looking at all this stuff for when I start my business"
"Mm, mm"
Now let's move along the line.
"Erm any any questions on er  itself or you know if there's anything I haven't told you, I mean there's probably quite a lot, well there's a lot I know there is."
But yes anything you want to er erm please jump in.
"Er but if not let's move up erm to towards er towards , and this is erm this is the erm former under-bridge at , going up to Mill."
Now the roadway used to come under the railway.
"Little humpback, bridge here, erm and used I say used to go through to  er Mill itself just er quarter of a mile along the track."
"Erm the er the road was later just moved to the left hand side of that bridge, and er no longer having to have that restriction."
But that is still in place as you can see.
"Er a fairly light railway, erm but er but adequate."
That's taken from just re wh basically where the roadway is now.
And that's the trail looking towards .
"Now let's move up to the next port of call, which is  Station."
I should say it's convenient for neither I should imagine.
Erm single track shown on this ordnance survey map.
"Again about nineteen er I think nineteen fifteen, maybe a little bit earlier."
"Erm a passing loop there, for trains to be able to just pull in and let anything going the other way, because it was mainly single track from er from  onwards."
Erm and a little bay there for er goods traffic to go into the sort of station.
"Station platform, the bridge there, and the station master's house, there."
A little head shunt at the end to protect anything running back onto the er main line.
Erm slightly nearer picture.
Er and I think erm er a bit later date actually.
No it's probably about the same.
"That one's a bit later date, and you can see that they've double the track here."
"Erm just made it a er does it's not double track er very far, but they have actually double tracked that."
And this is erm in the nineteen forties nineteen fifties.
When there was a fair amount of er goods traffic particularly coal from .
That er that line I think went to just er a bit further up and erm er I say not an any matter of er another couple of hundred yards I think before there was only a single track.
Er that is the station master's house at  Station.
And er it's now the part of the  you can er go to a picnic area along here.
You know you can walk through there back to .
You can just see the remains of the platform there.
And er platform over here.
"It's not, how I prosper financially."
"It's not, whether I'm in good health."
"It's not whether,a , whether I've all my little  itty-bitty prayers answered."
God's blessing to me  is life forever.
That's his blessing to you.
It's not making a list.
"It's not giving you  total health, and free you from all sickness and diseases."
It's not answering all your prayers.
It's not making your life easy.
It is giving you life forever!
That is the blessing!
That is his big parcel he's given to you.
It's wrapped up in a .
", thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift!"
The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
"Those disciples, they had the storm stilled for them  and it got  easier sailing."
It was plain sailing then to the other side.
"They were more comfortable, it was a, it was a more enjoyable journey, and let's be honest  if I can go through life without hassles and without problems my life will be more enjoyable, of course it and these difficulties, and these storms coming away, coming your way your life will be more enjoyable."
"But like the disciples, it will not be any better, or any safer."
Their safety did not depend on the storm being still.
Their security and safety depended on Jesus being with them.
That was it!
"Your safety, and your security and my safety and security in life  does not depend on how pleasant my ways are and how pleasant my paths are  how much I manage to amass, and how I can overcome all the little difficulties and problems and  steer clear of the big ones  the security and safety of my life, now and in eternity,security is there in the boat  and lying with him."
"See, the real peace  is not the stilling of the storm  the real peace is that the assurance of who is going to stop it."
That's the promise to your eternal life.
I will never leave you.
"You don't understand the circumstances, you don't understand the storm    I might , I might not  leave that to me he says  I will be with you."
I will never leave you.
I will never forsake you  even to the end of the .
Well let's see
Come in.
So potentially two nights out of the four.
Does it have an address Helen?
No it's through  erm
Right I just wondered if she gave you an address cos it you know got a super little town map here.
If I was being cynical I'd volunteer Mark's car to get people to and from the town.
If it was a long way out.
Well he said that was a possibility but I really  so.
But then again .
Erm but then it starts getting very very silly.
I mean this is basically she's she already books some flats and house a house because self-catering accommodation's in such short supply because of long lets over the winter.
Do we need to proceed on this now.
Do we need to see if we can draw up an extra .
I think one of the ideas behind the the party chipping in on this is because it would be extremely convenient for people who are popping in at the last minute for
Mm.
for a night or two to have somewhere that they know they can at least kip on the floor.
Where you know so as not to have to risk going having to go to an expensive B and B because all the cheap places have gone.
So to a certain extent the idea was to that if we had the thing worked out it would be of great benefit to the people who were popping by.
Erm whereas at this stage the four of us could probably find accommodation which wasn't that much more expensive erm but to have the actual focus for the for the local party .
Could we have  people to pay the six pound a night and erm you know  a hundred and forty four to start with and just ask people to pay the six pound a night anyway and just get as much back as we can?
Yeah yeah.
Cos six pound a night isn't bad.
It's less than we pay in Wolverhampton .
Oh it's very reasonable yes.
It would be possible I suppose with the commitment of people  for the local party to make  on the committee.
I mean I have a couple of ideas.
I was going to ask Mike  if he wants to come as an observer because he's never been to conference and erm
And when it comes
he was talking about spending a weekend with us anyway so it might be nice thing to do.
When it comes to that though there will be people from other green parties who who'll be looking for accommodation so at the last minute we can
Dick  for example.
Yeah.
We're hoping that we'll
And could British Rail be sold to British Rail?
We've learned that the government can't rely on enough support from its own back benchers to push through privatization on its own terms.
And why should Chinese ancestor worship appeal to government ministers.
John Cole returns from the seaside with answers to the questions you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask.
But first Michael Heseltine.
"He's been a force in British politics for a third of a century, but for how much longer."
We've heard nothing from him for the past four months since that heart attack in Italy.
"Though the rumours have told us a great deal, he's still far from well, he might need a heart bypass, he's gonna have to retire form politics."
"At the very least, his influence over the party and British politics is at an end."
"Well it didn't sound at all like any of that when I spoke to M Mr Heseltine, near his home, a couple of hours ago."
"I asked him first, How are you?"
I'm well.
"Er medically, as best as I understand what the doctors tell me, er I'm er fine to carry the responsibilities and strain of er the cabinet job that I had."
But you have to do it g slowly.
Take it a step at a time.
It'd be crazy to sort of do a dive in from the sort of recuperative process.
"But er er the er one of the doctors who looked inside my heart They put a local injection, telescope upside, he said I've got the arteries of a man of thirty or forty."
Don't don't quarrel with him.
Don't quarrel with him .
So what does that mean?
No need for a bypass?
Because they
No no no no I just lost the tip of an artery.
"Closed down, finish."
So there's it w it wasn't close to the heart.
And so there's n the arteries themselves are very good.
"But this tip for reasons beyond my knowledge has gone so there's nothing to be done about it and erm er the last test I had the guy who conducted it said, You've already got the heart off an average sixty year old who hasn't had a heart attack."
And that sort of is very encouraging.
So you're completely fit er
Medically yes.
Er but it takes time to recover from the er the the shock and the experience and the unnerving.
But I've come a long way and er so I'll go back next er Wednesday to the department and er er if people will bear with me and put up with it er I'll take it er fairly slowly to start with but I dare say there will come a time when er erm you won't notice much difference.
"No that's what you've gotta, you, he showed us"
Oh
said the stuff you're using is
Rubbish
"old fashioned he says, it's got linseed oil in it he said, how'd you get it off?"
Mm
You know
"that was the trouble you had with that table top, do you remember doing that polishing?"
"And that, and this, you kept getting this er"
"Oh no you, you can use this, but you"
oil through
"don't use that for polish you use a special oil, but he says don't even use that."
Oh
"His brief seems to be, put as little french polish on as you can"
Mm
"put, and then wax you see, now this is what we haven't seen yet"
So just use wax to build up the polish
"waxing to, well not necessary to build it up, cos you, you've got this sealer on first you see"
Mm
but you can
"that's what he does, but, if he want, I don't know, he have to"
"Yeah sort of thing, so I have heard you say only three is that the number of posts they put in?"
That's already done innit?
"Well, cos with him being on night, I don't suppose he got up till about"
"He started just after me, yeah"
"one o'clock, yeah, there, and there were huge holes in the"
"I mean you, you ask him if he'd erm arranged for a cement mixer and he said oh no he didn't want to bother, but I thought afterwards  that'll be each one of those holes, he"
He says oh a ton what are we going to do with the
yes
or
"well that's right, in fact he might even need more sand"
he will
I mean
Okay.
let them live their lives in peace without the harassment of chasing them with dogs and  supporters and what have you!
Okay.
"Any others  that, yes?"
"I don't think animals should be ta , used to be tested for cosmetics"
Mhm.
perfumes or  detergents
Mhm.
different things like that.
What about medical research?
"Well, there again, yes, with reservations  because if it comes to the fact that if it's going to save human lives, yes."
"Yes, and you get all the animals who are experimented on and you sa there's not a week that comes out and you don't an a report saying, oh well this this, this causes cancer in rats or  and you, imagine the amount, the huge amounts of  the sub , whatever substance it is that had been given to rats to cause the cancer, and there's no  knowing that the amount that's gonna be given to rats  causing cancer, will give cancer to humans!"
"I mean,i it's just absolutely ridiculous!"
I'm a trustee for the beauty without cruelty charity
Aha.
"and we would like to see an end to all experiments on animals, for cosmetics, toiletry, household product  purposes."
Hasn't that campaign been going for
"Oh many, many years!"
a long time?
Yes!
And we're making progress now.
How?
There are already many alternatives to the research carried out on animals which has been going on for a long time.
"Erm  for example, you can grow human skin in a, in a cell culture and use that as a, as a testing er, medium"
Mhm.
instead of a live animal.
"We can  it can use erm  a si similar substance for eye tests  erm, to test  to replace the Jeyes eye test"
Mhm.
which again has been used for a long time on animals.
These tests are very misleading.
"They don't protect bu su er, er the public, they protect the people who are actually manufacturing the products."
Ah well more or less much the same as it is today.
That's what we got the union for.
That's what we got the union for.
"That's what we got the union for, to make sure that these things did not happen."
Mhm.
That we wouldn't be stepped upon.
Were you involved in er any strikes or anything?
"Yes, I was involved in the nineteen twenty six strike."
And in nineteen twenty er strike  going at the present day there was what we called the soup kitchens.
And every local village where there was a mine had these soup kitchens.
I do not forget  the other unions which were going at that present time helped us out quite a bit.
Though we los we actually lost the strike through no fault of our own.
"There was just because there wasn't enough money within all unions, not forget that there wasn't such a thing as a T U C then, this was in at the infancy when the unions first started, there wasn't such as a T U C, Trades Unions Congress."
"These were er in, in its infancy then and er we had a soup kitchen and er we, we got soup once a day, when we got issued with it."
"Each family took over a, a ration card."
"And you got so many slices of bread, so many pots of soup."
"And this was all done in old wash houses, where they used to have the boilers."
Where we used to b boil the water.
"And the soup was made in these boilers, and they were issued with their soup then."
And that was all we got.
What was it erm started the strike in the first place?
Well they started the strike as muddled as  as some greens come up and the men as union thought that was not right.
"Not forgetting in that most of the mines then, at that particular time, were nearly all privately owned."
Mhm.
Were nearly all privately owned.
Were nearly all privately owned.
"Most, right across the length and breadth of Great Britain, were all privately owned."
"Which the present administration of central government are doing their best to, under the same hammer as  it was in those days, so  it's just, this is just a repeat performance of the those days and the government today."
Was what it erm finally brought about the end of the strike in twenty six?
Pardon?
What was it finally brought about the end of the strike in nineteen twenty six?
"Well it were just like I  like I  the unions weren't as, as er financially well off as they were er at the present day."
If not entirely mine.
So I I would like to ask the meeting whether erm  I suppose  technically for advice on this topic.
think we can get away with putting out another newsletter on the seventh of February with a ballot in it anyway for these two things even though we didn't
Yes.
I think so.
I I mean er I doubt whether we'll we'll have a full slate in February anyway so I mean they'll probably be the option for people to come in later and we'll probably end up co-opting people later and er I think we should
Yeah alright.
I'm pleased you think that because it gets me off the hook now.
I think that because I don't think people wait until the deadline to er respond anyway.
Helen?
Erm I think technically we're actually constitutional because it doesn't say anything in the constitution about us having to publish the deadline.
It just says that we have to make the the call for nominations so long before we put out the selection ballot.
So  they can do it from they can work it out for  themselves actually .
briefing.
Ah so so it's alright.
"So everybody who got the newsletter when they read it should have thought, Aha best look up"
I'm sorry
my copy of the  constitution  that I filed away so neatly when I received that months ago.
I think perhaps an apology and erm and an  in er the next newsletter might be appropriate for.
Otherwise we'll  phoning us up and complaining .
You'll probably be ringing people up anyway trying to get them to understand.
Yes I agree entirely.
I don't think people are going to be disappointed if they miss out .
Great.
Otherwise I if it's appropriate I'll say it looks like a great newsletter.
Yeah.
Right on the newsletter front the other thing is the next newsletter we said would go in the post by the seventh of February.
Which is actually two days before we next have a meeting which means I'm gonna have to slap another one together in a big hurry.
So I'm collecting things to go in it.
Er those things should include well something about the box erm next next day or whatever I can find .
Details of about where and when.
I've got a thing from Steve about erm planning permission or application for Sizewell C that I didn't have room for in this newsletter.
The prisoners of war were used as miners in the
Oh yes
camps?
yes.
Oh yes.
"We were used as miners, yes."
How did the pay and the conditions and such like in the army compare with erm being in the mines?
"Er the, the money, the money that I  money difference wasn't great but the fact was er who you were thinking about er when you did come out."
"You had a lot of, a lot of qualifications which you could get in the army in those days that you didn't have when you were in civil life."
"For instance you could learn to be a, a motor driver, you could learned to be an electrician, you could learn to be an engineer, you could learn to be anything."
"And you  through these courses and you got a certificate when you come out which er some of the  said to us, a fully qualified member of a, so these advantages were open to us then you see?"
Mm.
"So this was the, the main incentive for joining the army then?"
Pardon?
Was that the main incentive for joining the army?
Knowing that you gain qualifications?
Well my that was my  incentive  the mines.
Yeah.
"But as I've already told you  just, it was very ironical that I should l go back down the hole in er Germany again ."
"Were the conditions worse in the, in the German mines?"
In the ?
"Oh no, I  the mine, the mines in Germany at that time were far advanced of what er Britain's mines were."
"Cos they had different methods of doing the, digging the coal out, than they h than they had in Britain."
And I believe .
"Although I've not been down a mine since then, er the German mines to my er estimation were far more advanced than what the British mines were."
Were you made to work hard harder being a prisoner of war?
No harder than we did in Britain.
"You could not, no, a miner once he's been a miner, cannot go down er a pit and say to anyone down a pit, and say to anyone down a pit, that he's not a miner."
Because he gives his  right away.
"The experience he has gained in the mines at  immediately a man g a man who has been in the mines goes down there again his er n er he gives himself away, because, just because of the experiences."
"I saw an incidence er down in the, the mine a, a miner himself can tell, by the creak of a tree just where the heavy, heavy weight's coming on the, on the, the roof."
And where there's likely to be a fall.
And they would be looking for a bed for the night and it would be in the old  hay shed that we would put them but there wouldn't be a problem.
It was in the winter time so it was full of hay but they would be very careful and we would ask them that they had no matches in case er there was no cigarettes much and that but pipes  they were pipe smokers.
Old clay pipes with black twist.
But they would soon tell that they would have their before they would go to bed and thanks er very much when getting the bed and you could er vouch for that they would never.
But the odd one yes we saw the odd one but they were very odd.
Aye they were very odd.
Y you refer to them as mile stone inspectors.
Mile stone inspectors and gentlemen of the road.
Mm.
And there's a story about the late Duke of Portland when he was travelling up to to  estate where his lodge was.
There was many's a tramp that would have taken the A nine then but this one in particular and he was very very fond of him and he would ask when he was around to that he would get over to see him.
And when that poor tramp perished out on the roadside one severe winter or spring time the Duke found out where it was and to this very day there's a little mound and a stone put on it.
That was the er Lord of Caithness I think Tommy that the stone was.
Yes yes that I'm referring to yes.
The Lord of Caithness.
I cos I can't picture another stone you know on any other roadsides and I've been on plenty that and I travel and no and I can never know of another st stone that was put up to a tramp.
Anywhere in the north as far as I know.
But that one was and I heard a year ago but I never saw it till the bus driver I went with some years ago up to John O'Groats.
Mm.
And going up to to John O'Groats and right into past Castle May where the Queen Mother has and into the church where sh where the royalty goes when they're living up in up in Castle May At er well er Johnnie Groat is buried there too.
There's many a person Johnnie Groat to my name.
From these young days that you spent in Tormore can you recall how the tramps actually looked?
Oh they they
How would you describe them?
Erm the tramps?
Well fearsome looking
wild looking as you would say it now.
But but the very opposite to what people would er er th think of them as regards people now.
And that's ordinary people.
But but they looked wild because they would have long hair beards a  and and all oh my word they were wild looking but er.
And probably it was cold weather they would have two or three coats er you know.
And jackets probably below and their little bag of stuff.
I think that's where Dr  lives now isn't it.
"In the nineteen sixties an awful lot of er of stuff went, er or was just allowed to er to get into bad repair, and of course er B R weren't terribly interested so they just abandoned it."
"You can see again this er this decorative work on there, and again  most attractive er chimneys."
The er gents toilet.
A bit spartan but there it is.
And er the ladies one  look er there we are again.
"Going round the other side, where the sun was shining that way better."
Very attractive for modelling purposes this.
Looking close close up.
There you can see the sort of leaded light windows.
And the basically the whitish colour of the er the brick work.
"The doors to the waiting room etcetera, or to the booking office."
Inside.
Used to be panelled there I think.
But er rather dirty yellow buff interior.
"And again that's looking at the same time in nineteen seventy se seventy seven, seventy eight time, it's looking back into that er er driveway, and if you can remember the sort of the Victorian or Edwardian er photograph that er I showed you before, of er virtually that er that view."
Going back to seeing to to looking at the erm goods shed.
There you can see the main entrance.
"And that's where you went down slightly, er or erm carts, lorries, anything else went down there."
Erm normally there was a er  horse and cart here.
Er certainly until the I think probably until the end of the war.
"Erm I believe there ha there was a comma or a Yeah, I think there was a comma vehicle that was used, er later on."
It may have come from York I don't know.
"Er I suppose that's where they er did a lot of the office work, a wooden shed built on to it."
"You can see the buttresses, and again the rather attractive brickwork that even even on a goods shed, a functional goods shed."
"Now that's the entrance and there is where the er there used to be the erm er  wagon turntable out here, and the entrance for the trucks was er through that doorway."
"I won't say through the door,looks as if it has been."
But er there.
I'm afraid the er er the end loading ramp and a lot of the other stuff had gone by then.
Interior.
"There you can see the er wooden staging, and this is where the wagons were brought in, er and were unloaded onto this wooden staging, and the delivery vehicles would come down this er sort of rampway, erm between er well either side,the staging either side."
And you can just see some of the er you can just see the timberwork on the in the roofing.
"And, did continue to get professional help after that, but I think she was actually one of the  factors that  sent me further down, by telling me I looked well!"
What age were you then?
Twenty.
Yeah.
"And can you identify why yo wa was, are yo are you now over it?"
Are you
"Yeah I would class myself as a recovered  anorexic, but as recovered as I'll ever be!"
I don't think I'll ever totally get over it.
I've still got a very distorted body image that I have to live with.
I think I'm fat!
"The reality of anorexia for you was what, just not eating at all?"
"Cutting down on food, I was University missing whole meals, telling people I was training, I'm a P E teacher so sport and the perfect body was very much up front, so the more weight I lost the better I was told I looked until it became totally out of control and I was eating an apple and black coffee a day and then vomiting so that I had nothing in me."
Erm  my metabolism was  out the window.
"Now, as a P E teacher you're working what, boys and girls?"
Yes.
"Do you see ah,th the pe , the boys and girls or the, the young people that you're working with  erm, having the same  veering towards the same kind of thing, I mean, do you see pressures on  on girls, towards achieving that perfect body in the way that you felt it yourself at one time."
I see boys calling the girls fat and it makes my hair stand on end!
Erm  it goes on continually and these poor girls are  oh you're fat!
You've got a great big bottom!
"And they're not, they don't have, they're normal."
I wonder what you think of what you're hearing?
Yes?
I just wondered how much actual help professionals are?
"I mean, is is there really  enough help given?"
"I mean, we talk about eating disorders"
Yeah.
but do they really actually dig into the  the real reasons for the eating disorders or they just try and get you back onto a stable diet?
Yes?
I think what put me off in th and certainly em embedded was some of the comments as around control of our lives.
Mhm.
"And maybe hope that we as, as people as women need to do is regain control of our lives so they, they belong to us, so it doesn't matter if if  boys say we've got fat bottoms or not,yo you say my bottom's alright an and you live with that."
"I'd be interested to know the lady who mentioned that, er she got help from friends, what sort of help did she get from her friends?"
It's just a case of it's just a case of a few individuals or people with rank who think they've go so much power they're gonna press people
Yes I'm sorry to hear that people in rank in your particular case were involved
"Yeah well we've got a job to do if you're a soldier you've got a job to do okay, you've got a bit of training, you've got a job to do"
Right absolutely
"yeah you don't need no distractions, and bullying and bullying"
"I quite agree, I quite agree"
"and racism and all that,distractions"
I quite agree
and if you're gonna send people to Northern Ireland and places like that you want 'em to defend the next soldier?
Well c could I just come in?
But they do.
David Lightbown yes David Lightbown .
Andrew I'll let you back in.
"in a minute,in a minute."
"I I certainly didn't go in in in in with a rank on my shoulder, I went in as a recruit."
But you said
But when I when I when I trained as recruit I trained with a lot of other er lot of other people .
"But that was in different days, this is nineteen ni"
There was no easy way out in my day you w yo y
"One second Andrew, I'll come to you in a sec"
you were fetched in and you did your National Service.
Now when you did
this National Service you served your country for a set period of time.
I actually did three years of that that period of time in in in the Army.
"The majority of people that went through that service all had some recollection of things they didn't enjoy very much but they by and large thoroughly enjoyed their experience in the Army, it livened them up, it made them better men and we have got after all one of the best armies if not the best army in the world, it's got to come from"
I don't think that's
somewhere and it has to come from the training.
Alright Andrew briefly briefly.
Go on.
"Basically I don't disagree with you, aye we have got the best army and I loved my I loved my time in the Army but I'm totally against the way I was treated in the Army."
That doesn't there's  when you're off duty it's great but when you're on duty it's different.
the Army's made me a lot better person.
"What I also want you to do on this is if you can refer to Adrian Bull's book, the Economics of Travel and Tourism, and just go through the relevant chapter on demand."
"It's the Wensley Gate,Group."
"The tape recorder is now running, I hope that it's going to be recording, but let us not erm, be inhibited as a result of that."
"Erm, programmes, erm, haven't got a programme."
No.
"Erm, I haven't got a programme."
Thank you.
"You haven't got a programme, the very last one."
"Wh what, how how very carefully calculated that was."
"Erm, we are today, going to do the Black Sheep of the Family, erm, because erm, erm, doesn't feel that he he's up to doing the one that he thought he would do this week."
That will be postponed probably for a fortnight.
"Can I remind you, erm, looking at that programme, that, erm, healthy eating now appears on, I think it's the, sixteenth of March, and sadly I shall be here on the sixteenth of March."
"I shall be in Leicester at any rate, and I may very well come and join you, to talk with you about healthy eating."
"I was hoping to miss that one, because you might be trying to persuade me that I should erm, partake rather more of healthier food, than of the unhealthy food that I do eat."
"Er, it is."
"Yes, it is it is a project study, and therefore it would be as well, if we were all thinking about it in advance."
It it is in tha the hand-book.
"Er, it's on page a hundred and thirteen."
"And the idea is that as we've done with previous erm, discussions, if each one could come along armed with some information to do with healthy eating, erm, there's a list on page a hundred and seventeen, that might start you off thinking."
"Erm, celery, low fat dairy products, incidents of heart disease for those who have an olive oil rich diet."
"I don't olive oil, that's the trouble."
No.
Formic acid can be helpful to pregnant women.
Well that certainly doesn't apply to me.
No.
No.
Twenty two heaped teaspoons full of sugar every day.
"Well, considering I have none, somebody's having an awful lot."
"Er, and eating will be always one of, and so on, there's a few items there, that you might like to concentrate on, and perhaps, as much as anything, if you have your minds open in the intervening number of weeks."
"If you see an article, a snippet, er, a comment, from a newspaper, from a magazine."
"Cut it out and bring it along, and I think it will all add to our discussion of healthy eating."
"from you than the statement you've just made er and I think you'll be you used the word abhorrent, I think you'll be abhorred by some of the er stories you're about to hear."
"If I can come to you Andrew , you were in the Royal Highland Fl Fusiliers, what"
That's correct.
happened to you?
"Basically  the full time I was in basic training and when I went to the Regimental the Royal Highl Fusiliers Regiment the first battalion, I was physically beaten and mentally tortured er into the same bargain."
Well what do you mean by mentally tortured?
"Well they can physically do it to you with use of fists, use of hands and whatever else they've got and they can mentally do it to you like put you in jail that  or all sorts of things like when I was on sick leave, they came and lifted me."
"Right well t t tell me about the physical abuse, what sort of things were they doing to you Andrew."
Beat ya up.
"N C Os, noncommissioned officers beat ya up, and a above them as well."
You get
So
"in a battle camp, you're supposed to be  learning how to fight in a war and basically they beat ya up, and in camp as well, it happens in camp too."
"And did did you see th w was it widespread, did you see it happening to other people?"
It's very widespread.
Actually I  witnessed a guy being raped in the Army.
"That was by that was by normal recruits but it still happens it, actually the the bullying goes down the line."
"The N C Os bully, the officers bully the N C Os, the N C Os bully the privates and the privates bully the privates."
"It goes down the line, all the way down the line."
It's a nons it's a non
"If you're bullied, you bully somebody else"
Aye.
and so on and so on?
"let me just get back that was abhorrent as a word w has already been used and er should be used again by what you said, you saw s somebody being raped by two soldiers."
Did you try and help that particular soldier?
"I did, I did, I s actually put a stop to it."
That's
So that was a brave thing to do?
"I wouldn't say it was brave it was a normal thing to do, wasn't brave, there was nothing brave about that."
Was just a normal thing to do
You'd expect yeah y you'd expect somebody to do that for you of course.
Of course I would.
I mean it depends on each organization doesn't it?
Sort of two way two way thing you agree or don't agree between yourselves.
I'm in some ways surprised the non-political groups want to affiliate with with the party.
War on Want are er for a long time have been the only probably the only erm  that put their neck on the block as far as social and environmental aspects of the party go.
But you know I agree with you cos that  as a charity.
Yeah they seem to have a lot more to loose than we do.
Yeah.
There's been a lot of trouble lately a lot of problems haven't they.
War on Want didn't they go bankrupt or something.
They did yeah.
There is a possibility that War on Want should  be considered as being relatively high on our list of people we would be willing to affiliate with.
That's something that  not bad at all they do  as well so.
So is this was the national War on Want who contact us or the local contact?
Erm it was a lady who came from Leek.
Oh.
Do we have any feedback from any other local parties or the National Party are they recommending it or they only putting out feelers to local parties and ask what what we feel about it?
No.
associated with for example you're  party.
Oh that's just a mailshot deal.
They quite likely the Green Party got a free mailshot and their communication returned or or even might have got some money from them you never know.
I thought this sort of thing would be something the Green Party nationally should decide that whether in principle we ought to affiliate with.
Yeah but the advice might not have gone amiss and
Yes  surprising that War on Want aren't asking the national party
Yeah.
and instead are mailshotting all the local parties.
I think it may be it may be that  they could perhaps get more money if the local parties affiliated separately but
What about our links formal or informal with other York  branches of other
Yeah I mean this is this is erm more the sort of thing that I I had in mind.
Yeah.
Erm I think I mean we ought to be doing more with the local Friends of the Earth and local Greenpeace I feel.
In the past Greenpeace have always rejected us and er on the grounds that in fact we're a political party.
And Friends of the Earth it's only relatively new it's only been going properly for what two years.
That's all from Region.
"Er, I've also received minutes from the Epping Forest from Redbridge Group and they also have a lobbying workshop erm, that's on the second of March, and they're asking if anybody's interested in that."
Is that an evening?
It doesn't actually say
I think it's
"but, er, probably would be."
If you're interested could follow it up.
"They meet in, don't they meet in Leytonstone or was it Wanstead, somewhere in that area."
Wanstead
"Mm, mm."
"was, was, where they help Islington."
Monday mm.
Would you be interested in it?
"Well I might this, this, the time fitting in with the families, they're, they're likely to come back to"
"Okay, well I'll, I put some information not full details ."
Right.
"Erm, actually there wasn't a lot of detailed stuff, there was erm, materials for gr groups and winter sales"
Do you want to pass that over to Aida please?
"which we have a  erm, there's a bit about release policy and procedures for local groups, er, groups can help their prisoner with mummy or other erm relief, erm on the Christmas family particularly and it's, it's explaining you know how they do it and the best ways to go about it."
"Mm, cos there's a special fund available for that, that's particularly why they"
"anyway they explain all about it, if it would, if we need it."
"Er, there's a mandate workshop."
"Oh they, no, sorry,, they're offering still a mandate workshop for the group, erm, sending a trainer"
I'm the trainer.
"you're the trainer, oh well ."
"I've been very bad on this recently, I've really been too busy or tired, but I have got, I have, today I have had arrived oh not today, the last few days, the new mandate workshop, so"
So you've got to read through it and let .
"I was gonna say, having spent some months or years  well ."
"It's all the new bits in about it, yes mind you, there's always, always been a mandate, the mandate workshop was the very first one that's produced, but this is an updated version and changes ."
"Yeah, have there always been workshops , continue workshops on mandate or?"
"Yes, there's always been a mandate workshop?"
Or just when there  reviews?
I think very often you do need professional help and it isn't possible to do it with family and friends because of the interaction that actually makes it worse.
"So there's a practical suggestion and I, I like, I like Carole's philosophical suggestion that we could start celebrating the diversity of human kind."
"I mean, that's the kind of thing one often hears on this programme, is it wishful thinking or d'you think we could actually achieve it?"
Oh!
Wahey!
Yes?
I think the media have an awful lot to answer for!
Yeah.
"I run one of the self-help groups that one of the ladies mentioned and we looked at an outsize catalogue recently and it went up to size twenty six and in some cases up to a size thirty  and the ladies who modelled the clothes were no bigger than a twelve, possibly a fourteen, but a very shapely fourteen!"
Mm.
Mm.
"So the media, even when anything you do depends on your size,yo your image is all for a woman, your brain or your ability really comes way down the line!"
You have to look good first  before anyone listens to your other abilities!
But looking big and good are not incompatible are they?
"I was just gonna say, I I think we should possibly stop blaming the media or whatever actually happens and perhaps echo what the  the lady earlier said, I think that it's in our hands, we're the women   that could make this happen !"
Yes?
Well I
I was just si Oh sorry!
I'm sorry!
One at a time!!
I was just sitting here wondering why men don't have this image problem?
Because there are an awful lot of overweight men and I don't see any problem with them at all!
They don't seem to have any problems between each other either!
I'm quite concerned that my four year old daughter is after a Sindy doll  and wondering whether perhaps Sindy dolls shouldn't be produced  in erm  such diverse figures as real life?
Well there's an
"Are we, are we providing"
an interesting idea!
our future generation with women with an ideological  figure such as Sindy.
A lot of ideas and certainly worth talking about it.
It's something I hope we'll talk about again.
I hope you've learnt something and I know that I have!
Thanks very much for joining us.
"They'd take a long time to dry wouldn't they, then, on the sticks and that"
stacks of it
"and my father was in the woods before the war and they, he, he looked after the woods and cut the trees down and everything and then they were sent to"
"Oh no, slowly, dried slowly you see"
"Slowly to dry it was always as, as he went up to about a"
"for pupation, yeah"
"I'd like to seen how they did the, the ribbon book out of the heart"
Oh yes
used to do a lot of drawer bottoms out of it
yes
"must of had a knife or something to it, sliced wasn't it?"
"Mind you I'm going, I've got a pub"
"Nice to see there, there was a certain way of cutting the tree"
this is going back
to get the figure into it
"I, a cut"
on the diagonal
Yes
"you see, a diagonal, the"
"raise so you've got a lovely figure in the, on the oak,"
Yeah
but expensive that was
yeah that's right
"cutting waste with it, as I say the ribbon stuff it must it, the georgian furniture you usually see that in"
Yeah
"this wide drawer bottoms you know, beautiful oak that's been sliced"
Yeah
"because that, presumably the heart was easier to cut, I don't know, very hard"
"I wouldn't of thought so, it was"
I wouldn't of thought so
the
I'll have to find out of this
You're a graduate.
I am yes.
Yeah I thought so anyway.
Er I
would have thought that graduates find it more difficult to impart knowledge to people than anybody else.
No I'd I'd I don't I don't believe that that's the case erm
Karen come to the studio please.
Karen come to the studio please.
Karen co sorry I just want to do something go on.
Yeah so okay I'm I'm I'm
I don't think that's the case.
I'm I'm winding you up a little bit but no I mean there's a little method in this .
When are the teachers going to stop being political animals and get down to teaching rather than try to score points off the Government?
Oh we're
Cos anybody can score points off them I mean it's simple.
We we well we'd love to be able to get get on with our job and er wi with far less interference than we receive at the moment but er when government insists on er on interfering to the extent it does an and there have been well I've been reading recently so something like five hundred new powers the Education Secretary has given himself in the in over the last last few years.
Well he's not going to be there for ever.
Decisions are made decisions are made erm there that we and we have to live with the consequences of them.
If they affect education then it's our responsibility to speak up about them.
You see I I think er er probably one of the best erm Ministers of er of er Education that er has been for quite some considerable time and I bet you throw your hands up in horror when I say this you will totally disagree and I'm talking here cos his name's just slipped  out of my mind .
"Who was tha who was that oh for goodness sake tall thin gaunt looking man, always had to have about fifteen spoonfuls of sugar in his coffee whenever I met him?"
S Sir Keith Joseph?
Er you knew you see Sir Keith Joseph.
Now I I remember talking to him for hours once on a programme about education  and this was when he first said what we want is teachers to be accountable.
And I'm a great believer in everybody should be accountable right?
Yes.
We well I've no objections to that to that at all.
"No none of you do now but when he first suggested it everyone was up in arms and he poor old soul I remembered he said, I've had enough change I I believe in this I I've I've tried I'm too old now  and out he walked."
Is there a chocolate machine in the building?
And off he went.
He was addicted to chocolate.
I I I think erm a lot of teachers would now look back on those days with er a certain fondness now bearing in mind what's what's happened since and the the the succession of education secretaries we've had since since then I mean had the only one in recent years who I would say has attempted a genuine dialogue with the teachers and  tried to do something constructive is John McGregor.
Mm
"just wouldn't go in would it, unless it's being stood right down"
Mm
"cut turn half way, the first cut, then turn it over with, you've got to have all the, just got a bit of the bare blade on the bench you see"
Yeah without a guard on it
without a guard and they won't
"mm, mm"
allow that on this stand
No I can understand that I suppose
"but there again it's only hand feed, you've, you got to have a, a machine that can feed on to take this tubing"
"Something to grip it, mm"
We would have to like pull the wood through you see
"what about that erm, what about that other place that er timber place on the way to Kilkern erm we went there, you, oh you went in to ask about some walnut, do you remember when er"
"Well er that's the same, that would be worth thinking this you know"
don't think you'd be very happy you know
"I mean you wouldn't wanna pay  no be only worth a fiver to cut it, to them it's not worth"
"Damaging them, saw, mm"
Well at least we've had a look at the whether we
"right OK, so we've eliminated all that have we?"
Well I mean
What are you gonna do?
I don't know
It's impossible to do by hand
No not impossible
with a good saw
Yeah
and about ten irish navvies
One down below and one above huh
mm
"Try to get some er old door casings rip down from me you know, now, I was thinking of going to North Wales but I know what they'd say cos it, the ones that I got from our Rob's you know the  they're quite clean but of course they've had nails in the, you know, the head like  I made the cab some cabinets you know."
I want them split down that road
Which way?
And then they kept their language  kept the language.
Right.
Okay did anybody get a chance to read the paper which was about  conversation?
I just wondered  what what that came up with as it's conclusion.
W well it might be worth having a read of that.
Er okay what else?
Has anybody got any that I haven't haven't really covered yet?
Mhm.
and how erm  but it probably got a little to do with the way groups actually organize.
Whereas the boys are more  but the tend to give more .
Right.
But the girls tend  more equal responsibility and not .
What differences do you f I mean have you got any specific examples there or?
"No   Er the girls sort of say things like  perhaps ask her, Do you have any  We could get on a bit more so they don't include themselves in what they're going to do."
Whereas the boys  Give me the pie  Get off my steps or something
Mm.
Right.
Is there something  about where one girl was using what would be boys language when
Yeah.
someone else came round to her house she was like you know get off my yard
"Yeah,Yeah, so girls are perfectly capable of using those  when need be"
"Yeah, I mean I The important thing is I think the children do recognize the differences, not that they don't notice the differences, because they're Like you say they're capable of using the other if it if it suits them."
"Er I mean that goes back again to the articles which you might have about the way that parents talk to their children, and you quite often find that then very very quickly the children grow up speaking in a same way as the parent of that sex talked to the them."
"So if a child gets spoken to in a fairly direct way by imagine a female child by her father and the same female child gets spoken to in a not so direct way be her mother, then even of this The child is likely to  both version, she'll grow up using female variety because she's she can affiliate herself with her mother and I mean she knows that is  the variety she's expected to use."
I think  can't really remember I don't know  how father would use different language he's talking to his son or daughter.
Yeah that's true as well.
Er it sort of goes in four ways I mean the fathers talk more directly than the mothers whether or not it's a boy or a girl they're talking to.
"But they do talk more directly to boys than girls, so it's sort of graded in that way."
Okay who wanted to talk briefly about what people are going to write about?
Cos we haven't really sort of said anything.
Has anyone got any I mean I you don't all need to write about the same thing or anything.
Er does everyone want to do a general essay or do people want to do a s a specific thing?
Yes.
so to a certain extent th the human that was introduced in the last few
Mhm.
years has has  is an experiment.
How do you feel about that?
"I, don't mind being used as a guinea pig because I feel that it'll help people in the future."
Up there.
I believe that we have been given the right to have dominion over animals.
"The point I would like to put over is, I've listened to one or two erm, radio programmes, and television programmes about this and I personally would like to have more evidence of what actually happens to the animals."
I don't think us  er er  public people really realize what is going on and I think then they would maybe stand up and be
Mm.
"and be counted, but I think we've tended to stand back and just say  well we know it's going on but what is actually being  done to these"
Mhm.
animals?
Yes?
"Yes, we  that lady over said there were guidelines, there were people that go in and inspect, but there are not enough, it is a known fact, that there are not enough people to go and inspect all the establishments where animal  erm, experimentations are taking place  and, I love animals, and alright, yes,yo you can do ex , some experiments on animals but let's not be cruel!"
"That lady up there said that we have experiments, I'm sure, human  experiments , you know, experiments, sorry, on human people"
Mm.
"but, on human beings, but we're not put through the state that animals are!"
We
Mm.
"don't have great lumps made to grown on us, we don't go through she , severe pain."
"And, which company was it that says, to  do something about pain  you first have to create it."
Mm.
"Ah, I mean that's terrible!"
"I was responsible for researching into the, so called cruelty free products for beauty without cruelty, and it was a real can of worms!"
I was
Yep!
I was sorry I got involved in it at one point!
Erm  cosmetic companies are very devious!
It's what they don't tell you that's important.
"Erm, there is a big problem at the moment with cosmetic labelling, for example, erm just exactly what does cruelty free mean?"
"Er this has been altered quite a lot since then, but you can still see the er gate that was er to the yard of the station."
"Moving on, to ."
"Again, er early nineteen hundreds, and you can see single track coming in from  here, and interesting bit of track work here, erm station up here."
Double track through the station.
"Erm goods shed, er and er siding along here."
So interesting type of track work there.
"Now when the  was opened, er it was decided to er to put in a line, erm just near  to connect with , and pick up some of the trade for the for  Railway, cos the  or the  had already decided to get some from that end as well."
Er going up to erm  and so on.
"So a line was put in, up to Colliery."
"And there you have, not a very good picture, but you can see this was th with the goods shed as per the last  ordnance survey map."
"Slightly altered configuration, but er tracks put in there, erm and er to house quite a lot of wagons and to er allow trains to er to just be held there until they could move up to erm cos that's single track beyond there."
"That was the quite enlarged quite enlarged er sidings, erm these haven't been changed here, but additional sidings on this side er and I say that curve up here."
"Erm just look at that one that er goods shed, that's er that's interesting cos er there's still remains of that there."
There you can see  Station.
Station master's house there.
Erm and the I can never remember the name of that road over there.
Er   o this is  Road down here isn't it?
"Anyhow, erm that's in a cutting there."
And you can see the track layout.
"I say in interesting, if you built that in a model, people wouldn't believe you."
"There's a picture in early B R days, of a I think erm special probably from ."
"And showing that even if the er station isn't actually used for passenger traffic, er it's well kept."
Now let's look down from the bridge.
"And there you see  again in early B R days, er the er the station master's house, and er er and the station itself, over here, the goods shed over there , the various track works coming across, the er line up to round here, and as I say the various sidings that were put in to accommodate the additional er colliery and other traffic."
"But er considering it isn't er used for passengers, it looks in quite good nick, doesn't it really that."
"But I say that er just er look at that, and look at the particular roof line."
"And er the the vent there, the circular vent."
Now that's what it looks like more or less now.
Er looking just er well that picture of that  going through th station on a special.
That's roughly  the same place.
Well just a few yards along.
"Picture from the from the er bridge, and there you can see the goods sheds still there."
So But  was without a a secondary school
Yes.
"for quite a long period, wasn't it ?"
Yes.
"Yes, until Annie  came,m after the war."
Was?
How did the community feel about that??
They felt strongly
?
"They felt strongly about it, but er  was only twelve minutes away, on the railway, quarter of an hour on the bus."
"And of course, in spite of everything that's being said, the thing about  was that because of the two railway stations you could get anywhere in half or three quarters of an hour."
"You could get to I know Graham  went to , which  is way out, other went up the Kimberley and that area, and other went to Sutton."
And everybody could get home very quickly because of the railway stations that were there.
So did you travel to school on the railways?
"We tr I travelled to school on the railway one bit, when they gave us season tickets, because with a scholarship you got your fares paid."
"And then they started paying your bus fare, at the end of the week, and so I decided I could walk."
". Er fourpence return was two mars bars, and quite a lot of us walked."
Were there many boys from  at  ?
"Oh yes, there were Well, all the  erm boys from up to about the fifth form, in the old pupil-teachers training centre went, er  was formed by joining that and  school, they took boys from there ."
.
"And er then there was the new intake of ourselves, and er there were probably fifty or sixty the first year."
"Erm, only three scholarship, but then of course, you got the er governors free places, which were nearly the same, and then the number who were being paid for."
D s So did you notice any sort of class differences within the school?
"Very little, after the first  week ."
"Erm uniform's a great leveller, or a I I'd never had such marvellous clothes."
"Erm I know a friend of mine, and my ambition, then, was to wear a collar and tie and wear half-shoes, as opposed to a jersey and boots."
"Erm now, of course, we'd wear a jersey and boots quite  happily , but er I did get a grant for clothing because otherwise there was no way of goin of accepting a scholarship."
"And erm the immediate reaction, at home, was to say, Well, you can't go."
"And the headmaster said,quietly, Let's talk about it."
"And er so I had clothes from , and er I learnt what clerical colo clerical grey was,and er, also what house shoes were, erm you know, slippers for wearing in school."
"So tt and of course, the other thing I learnt there was that you had dinner the wrong way round, you didn't have your pudding first, to fill you up.."
"So  What other memories do you have of of , then?"
Thanks for your patience.
That was very kind of you Sir James erm .
"Particular example, remember this is all confidential I I'm told so er er it won't go any further than this  room."
got anything
all the time
"So do you think it's something to do with maturity perhaps a child, a child is this wha what do you mean by forgiving?"
"You can forgive or punish at the same time can't you, you can punish somebody and say that is wrong and yet you forgive them, that is you don't hold it against them  but you  later on."
they may get they get sort of get a bad name and perhaps not
No.
No.
"You also have to think of the effect it has on other people, how er if you just let people get away with it, it doesn't mean you hate them, loathe them and damn them  but er you've got to make them realise that  for other people, for everybody."
What do you think er Graham.
what the parents  you know .
one-to-one
Yes .
Martina?
really.
"How then, how then?"
"Christians are supposed to forgive, but what if say it's the mother of somebody who had a child that's been murdered or if somebody has been raped you cannot say that they should forgive you cos they were a Christian."
"There's a lot of talk about forgiving or forgetting isn't there, some people say I can forgive but I can never forget."
Er you might think about some of these parents who have children murdered in the  how much do you think revenge comes into it?
is it?
"It's not that they're in rehabilitation, it's just like seeing  that person is locked away in the prime of their lives  revenge ."
Is this revenge or is this just the stopping other people from suffering really?
Shut up
Anyway
"they ask about school say, but I don't think schools have the authority really to do anything either way about er forgiveness."
"It's like if you fall out with a teacher on the first day of term, if that teacher"
You haven't that chapter for the rest of the year  and say the teacher probably thinks well this child  and
I think forgiveness is  not always
An ideal
forgive thine enemy always remember
"I've bought, I've, I've, as I say, when I pay my  have you got a mother and father?"
". And they ne er never  never answers it direct, never answers it direct."
What's that got to do with it?
"Never comes out with anything like that just,got another one ,answer you."
Can you tell me about the er incident that happened when you went to meet erm Brian  at the council offices?
"Oh yes, at that particular time, I will tell you that once again er, that was er I was supposed to go for an interview and this was er for the er declaration of intent of,wh which was er supposed to er supposed to be given every year to both the Lothian Regional Council and the District ."
"And this is happened all over the country, each area are doing the same thing and all of this  this er produce this declaration of intent and ask the, the head of the  er council to put it to their members and get the support of their members."
"Now the r the reason for us doing that is that if they do accept it, they are duty bound as a council to write to Prime Minister, Prime Minister, direct, saying they support the declaration of intent."
"Cos every, cos really the  should go direct to her, and it as  she's  taken notice of you yet."
"All, all it does it comes round and er er Regional Council, say no we support  she's got to think,."
"Well that's the idea of, anyway we're going back to Brian  and er accepted that he would accept the d the deputation,showing there was three of us, there was the m the president of the area council, myself and the secretary."
Well we er  duly arrived down at quarter to ten as  twenty six of September this year.
"And we went up there and we had just  we'd, we took the labour rooms and er of course we had got a cup of tea with them you know?"
"And in comes Councillor  the leader of the Labour group, you see?"
"Well lads, he says, I'm sorry you'll have to wait another hour."
"Course naturally we, we asked why?"
What was the matter?
"He says er I've just had a phone call from Brian , he can't meet you until eleven o'clock."
"An an of course and naturally I says well why, why is he getting ?"
Is he in the building?
"No, he says, his car's broken down."
"I says what a bloody excuse, I says and his car broke down, shh bloody corporation buses here, why doesn't he use a corporation bus to get in?"
Why doesn't he ph ring for his bloody chauffeur?
Or his k .
Why doesn't he get that?
No.
"No he says er that, that's er that's all I can tell you er that's, he wouldn't  until eleven o'clock,come."
"And er immediately he went there was, somewhere around about eleven o'clock he ."
"Right,that deputation of er old age pensioners."
"So we immediately walk through and  he's all, all ."
"Very pleased to meet you, no no ."
"Now he says er, what is this now, and of course immediately the president says, well you know happens er Mr , can we  says you've read it before, you see?"
"And the miner can only pick up a, a pick and knock the rook and he can tell exactly where er where it's weakest in the rook."
"So, so these thi these things did do, show up when you're d when you're down the mines."
"A ma a magic phase, you can't give it away."
And they didn't ne we didn't need the  if we were a miner.
A mine w a miner could tell another miner by his accent.
Not just by him telling he's a miner he can say er that's a miner.
"What, what did you do erm after the war?"
When you came back to Britain.
"Well I, well er I came back to Britain er I, I was er liberated by General Patton in a, a small place called Erfurt I was flown from Erfurt into Cherbourg, and from Cherbourg into a small place called Amersham which was a reception station for prisoners of war, where we were treated er on entering the camp we were handed a telegram."
All we had to do was sign our name to it.
"And these telegrams were for, to our nearest and next of kin, telling us we were now safely home."
Did erm did you notice any great differences when you came back from the war?
Oh vast vast differences
"To the, to the"
er yes.
Oh vast differences.
"My first experience in going into tramcars er in, in Edinburgh anyway and I suppose that the same thing would have happened er in any country,just gone through the ravages of war, with blackouts and so forth."
The people from the highest paid to the lowest paid were all just one unit.
"And I wish to God that would just come back again, now there people would just treat one of our  as they did it one of  during the war's years."
And I can't see any reason why they can't.
"Why they should, people with a higher  look down their nose at the people who are lower than themselves, I can not figure out."
I think we need another war to get  rid of the er get rid of some of the thing  that's happening at the present day.
So you think the war erm unified the people?
Behind the
Er it definitely it had proved it itself.
"It proved it, the war years proved it to the people."
"Er that they were, they were all just one."
"But nowadays we're not, nowadays we, there's a higher, a middle class and a lower class and a lower lower class."
What erm what kind of employment did you find when you came back from the war?
"Well I, I erm my first employment was in the, was in the building trade with er an old firm in Edinburgh called  and believe me I was not a very fit person then after seven, five years and I was like a rake, I was like a skeleton."
"And I got there and by good luck I got a very good er site agent and after asking me what I'd done, he says it's alright son we'll build you up."
"And he actually treated me like a, more or less a son, the site agent, and he made sure er I gradually  developed my muscles."
"So when, and I would agree with you again, so when are the teachers going to be accountable, when is somebody who is a bad teacher and heck there are quite a few of them, you know it only takes a couple in every school to make it difficult for the rest, going to be got rid of you know you are not up to the mark out."
There there are systems in place in schools already for that and there always have been.
You jest with me now come on we're we're we're being serious Noel if you are a teacher it is almost impossible to sack you.
Almost totally impossible.
That's simply not true.
There there are disciplinary procedures in in all schools erm which are there to be used.
Why are they never used then?
Are all teachers too good to be sacked because it is  it is as rare as erm teeth in chickens.
I think it's I think it's very easy to er to ex exaggerate the problem  to take one anecdotal evidence of of one about one or two cases and maybe about one or two people and say this is a major problem in every school.
Let me put it this way to you Noel
I don't think it is.
Let me put it to you this way you know as well as I do people who really ought to be doing something else other than teaching.
You know that as well as I do and those people don't seem to be given the encouragement to move on to another profession.
I I
Some are some are promoted to head teachers I know and I knew you were going to say that.
I wasn't going to say  that no .
Erm no I I honestly don't think that er that the the problem is as big as as big as you you say it is and I I think the the structures are there to deal with that and if if people had you know if people used them then they would they would work and they  from time to time that they are used and you know it it is not impossible to get rid of rid of a teacher in in the way you are suggesting.
Okay Noel thank you for your er your time and being a good sport this afternoon and I hear you have a little one you had better go back and sort things out.
That's right.
Okay.
Okay thanks.
Thanks a lot Noel bye bye.
Noel  from the er N U T.
"Erm I don't know what this is serious point actually if if you fancy yourself as one of these so called mums and I think it is a little patronizing the er title of a mums' army of teachers, if you think that maybe you could do that and you'd be interested in doing that and you think it's quite a good idea I'd be interested in hearing from you, all right?"
O nine O four serious talk O nine O four six four one six four one erm if you'd like to do that give me a call.
Now where is er where is Rita where are you Rit all right my love all right where's Rita I've got I've got yellow I've got red I've got blue I've got green.
What number is Rita on give me a number because I haven't got white?
Twenty four Okay right if I put that down there  Rita hi.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm fine thanks .
Hang on let me do that again  that's good that isn't it?
"No I can't come, I'm dining with er, Charles and a post-grad."
"So  Gerard's his name, erm, remind me to see about, are you free tomorrow at eleven?"
"Yes, Tony's just dropped that on me"
Oh
from a great height.
"No I'll, I'll speak to you, I'll speak to you later."
"Erm, er, clearly if you're a, a net importer of agriculture, you have benefited from other people's protectionism."
"Okay, and you will suffer as a result of liberalization, and by and large those costs, or those benefits that er, reaped at the moment by those countries are very, very small in comparison to the, er, the costs of protectionism to the rest of the world."
Right okay.
"Tell you what we'll do is er, leave it there now."
"I would recommend you do is look in this book, there's a coup a couple of copies of which is, I mean er, is in the library, right."
"Current Issues in Agricultural Economics er, edited by your lord and master, Professor Rayner and also a chap called David Coleman  okay so, Current Issues in Agricultural Economics by A Rayner and D Coleman."
"But if you look at chapter four in that book, we have the title, Agricultural Trade and the GATT."
"Alright, now the first part of this chapter spells out erm, er, developments in agricultural trade, why it's, why it's fallen in relative terms right."
"It then goes on to look at the costs of protectionism so they're, they're looking at erm, the numerical estimates as to how much erm, protectionism costs,not only for domestic producers and consumers and tax payers, but also for third countries."
"It then goes on to look at erm, why agriculture hasn't been included in the GATT up until now, and prospects for a solution within the GATT."
"This er, although it's not on your reading list, erm, the reading list that Bob  gave to you, er, it, it should be."
"It's essential to erm, to what you've been going through in the last, in the last few lectures."
"Readable, full of erm, empirical evidence about costs of agricultural protection, and what's happened to agricultural prices and I re I do recommend that you have a look at it if you, it's an invaluable  if you look at anything, look at, look at this one article."
"And there should be a couple of er, issues of this book in, in the library, okay, right, well thanks very much."
"Have a very good holiday and er,tomorrow there won't be a normal agri-econ lecture, there'll be a special lecture, but it'll be in the same place, same time."
"Hello, Tim  speaking, I was on my way Charles."
"Okay, I'll see you in a minute."
Bye .
"Right, that's it."
Right.
Got well loads of homework tonight.
Got any merit marks today?
Er  one yeah in maths  ooh er
for the class work  look at that homework I got two wrong    and in science  steady  should be  finish.
Try doing that.
Is there a difference.
"Well, in the definition that we heard, it tends to be associated with, with trying to rid your body of the food that you've consumed during a binge."
Compulsive eating normally doesn't  go to that extent.
"How did you stop  bu bu bulimia, I mean it was"
In the end it was the
thirteen years of binging I mean
Yeah.
wha what effect does that have on you?
"Erm, it it, it makes it very, very difficult to imagine how you'll recover  erm, but in the end it's a personal decision to, to try to achieve self respect, to care for yourself better, to adopt good habits of nutrition and exercise, not dieting, cos diets are the biggest con trick of all  and certainly, to rid your life of people who don't respect and accept you the way you are."
Can you identify why you began doing it?
"I mean, how old were you when you started er  binging?"
Fifteen.
Yes.
Fifteen?
"I was certainly to do with  feeling that I would have to be a little bit slimmer, that I would have to be acceptable to other people, that I would have to change my shape  and at the same time, I could not resist consuming large amounts of food."
"Now, fifteen seems terribly young"
That's right.
"for a girl to start, to start worrying about that kind of thing!"
Is is that a societal pressure?
"I mean is it a  ah,th wi , is there any history of it in the family an and, what did your family, did you family know?"
Families don't generally know.
"And it, it wasn't until many years later that I told anyone at all  that's, that's the thing I was saying about bulimia, it's very secret."
"And in the end, did you, I mean wha , did you get the support of of professionals or or"
Yes.
"Erm, but in the end th o only one had any impact and in general,see seeing a female professional was, I have to say, a lot more helpful than seeing male professionals."
Mm.
Yes?
"Er, my experience is slightly different when erm  when I had been trying to sort of recover, I didn't, I didn't feel as if I've get any help from professionals that I  approached."
"And in fact, I get an awful lot of support from friends  erm, not family because my family aren't, weren't aware of it, erm but I mean, really it came from fre , really close friends that I could sit down and talk to  and that could understand me and accept me, just like what the girl said as well."
Mm mm.
Yes?
"I think my G P actually sent me further down hill into anorexia after I'd lost about, about  when I was seven stone  I went to see her, I'd never seen her before and she said well you look perfectly acc , sociably acceptable to me so I went on to lose two more stone before going back to see her and was admitted to hospital as a medical emergency!"
I know I
That's right
the first time I get up well you see I cheat I have it lightly pencilled in
Well that's
You can do that
that's  because that's
you want to start suddenly you find yourself either
I have I tell you I've done that before now and then that one ends up right down in the bottom corner
and it's it's
It just it just takes the edge off it so it is a good tip actually it's just if you've time beforehand is just even as you were saying producing a thought pattern like this even just doing the first level just in pencil.
I've actually seen erm er been in a workshop as a participant where a chap who was excellent at this had what he did was while while the participants were doing some sort of an exercise he was actually making these tiny notes up in the top corner for himself so that when he when he came to the next sort of section that he wanted he'd he'd got he'd got the odd notes just up there in the corner.
So again that's something you can do but yes good tips thank you Jeff
just doing it in pencil lightly in pencil beforehand
Rolf Harris does that
Yeah he does doesn't he yeah that's right
"I don't do it on that, I do it on a big blackboard"
"that's right, that's right yeah there is that but"
well the way I do it is I I try and avoid the lecture lecturer
"yes,"
because I assume the audience knows as much about control and sub contractors as I do
right
but the idea is to to get their ideas  so that you can tell somebody else how you do it on your side then you can tell somebody else
yeah
"the need, I need to change  information"
yeah
it brings out some interesting ideas
I bet it does
and I  the flipchart
yeah
and that's that's the only way  it's amazing we ever get any sort of
right let me just then talk very briefly about this fella.
Now we're fortunate with with this that if I turn it on it's very quiet but if any of you had and I'm sure Jeff you've probably seen it where you get some older machines and the fan in there rattles like mad and there's nothing worse than having that thing rattling all all the day.
oh can I remember that far back
erm
loss of memory?
yes definitely that erm
loss of common sense certainly.
"would you agree the ninety three of you, is that what characterises being in love, temporary madness?, any other, no well what then?, yes"
"Er yeah, sorry, I write romantic fictions not just lust"
yes
"Being in love I think erm its not something that you have to end it happens to you, its not because er a terribly admire the person I er, your only achievements, its just something that happens and common sense goes out the window."
so you suggest that Sandra might be right?
something like
and
there might be something in it yes
"erm, yes, up there"
"Well I don't agree with that, I think that when your in love with someone you want to be with them all the time, you think about them during the day, you think about them at night, you just want to be with them and usually you like how they look, you like how they talk, they like, you like how they treat you and er to me that's, its wonderful, just"
has
wonderful
how many times has this happened to you?
many times
"many times, at one time I thought it would never happen again, I thought this was it forever, but life isn't like that, things happen and it does change."
yes
"It, it is a form of an obsession and it is an excitement and there's a warmth and there's a funniness about it and it just wonderful, better being in love than not being in love surely."
"mm, yes"
"No I feel er kind a be lost, it depends on what relationship your looking for."
"I think if its the right one its definitely not lust its every minute admiration for them, just to be with that person."
"so, so lust is what you feel for the wrong one?"
That's afterwards
"yes, I, first meet them, then you can say its lust."
there
Can you not start with being in love with someone and end up by loving them?
Yes
it isn't always a drastic ending is it?
"So a again, the idea of perception comes into it, doesn't it."
"It's it's the way,"
", yes."
"Erm, the person is perceived and and and the perception may not be accurate."
"It it that it may be influences, er, at work there."
"Erm, the the the suggestion was then, that the two young men and the the parable of the prodigal of son, started off as insiders, but in turn, they became outsiders in in in in some way."
"Erm, and the final short paragraph of that section refers to the parable of the lost sheep, er, not necessarily of black  in colour, but deviant in behaviour, figuratively a black sheep."
"I'll leave you to to look up that one, and erm, and and read if you want to do."
A section then on Branwell Bronte.
"A short life, you erm, you you you perhaps will be able to contribute from your knowledge of erm, Bronte, particularly of Branwell Bronte."
"Branwell Patrick Bronte, dates eighteen seventeen to eighteen forty-eight."
Was the only son in a family of six.
"From Mrs Gaskill's life of Charlotte Bronte, and from Barbara and Gareth Lloyd-Evans, companion to the Bronte's."
"It seems clear that Branwell had so much potential, he might have been as successful as his sisters."
What went wrong then.
His sisters also had to bear tragedy.
Branwell was only four when his mother died.
"Before he was nine, two of his sisters, Elizabeth and Maria had also died."
How difficult for an imaginative and a sensitive child.
"He was loved and looked up to by his sisters and aunt, and his father unstintingly spent time, energy and money on him."
"Eventually his sisters, especially Charlotte lost patience with him."
"But when he died, the family was anguished by his loss and his unfulfilled talent."
"He painted, he wrote poetry and stores, but he lacked discipline and become an alcoholic."
Charlotte letters showed how bored she was by her limited home environment.
"Was boredom part of Branwell's trouble, too."
"It was Branwell, who suggested that the Harworth parsonage should publish its own magazine, but after the third issue, it was Charlotte who took over the leadership from him."
"In the short period, when Charlotte was away at school, that's January eighteen thirty-one, to May eighteen thirty-two, he was writing well."
"Essentially a creative person, he was unpredictable, and became self-destructive."
"As an artist, Branwell went to London to seek admission to the Royal Academy Schools, but he lost heart, as soon as he arrived, and never even began."
"He became more and more depressed, and sought consolation in the local pub, where he was soon well known as a talkative character."
"Encouraged by his father and several friends, Branwell acquired an artist's studio in Bradford, where, at first, he made an effort, and cultivated influential friends."
"But, sad to say, talking and drinking got the better of him, and his work deteriorated."
"le pool de javelle horse dirt, mm"
I don't know if we're supposed to be talking er French
We weren't
Ah at last home
"So that's basically, I now got a B grade for and that gives"
Mm
"so that's English, and I've gotta get, er he reckons he'll get a B grade for the er lit, but I was so cheesed off with that erm  piece I got today, thirty five and thirty five, one mark off being er an A, he put at the bottom aargh, if only you'd seen the lousy ending, cos he said if I'd got the, an extra couple of sentences it er would of been forty eight, forty, so that's, so annoying, but I've now gotta write an informal letter, I don't know how that comes under informal letter"
"You write to an imaginary friend, you're inviting him down for the summer holidays and you say all that, all about the sort of things that you're planning to do with them, make it up"
Can you put bad spellings in those as it's informal?
"No you cannot, you'll write it like a normal, a formal letter, like you would write to Melanie"
That's not formal
It's informal
it's that use of formal
No an informal letter
You said write like a formal letter
"Well you do, but you don't put, don't put like heading for a business thing and"
Oh
just the normal address and date and dear wh whatever it is
Er
"and then you write, just write a set paragraph just as you would normally."
"see if I can get a grade A for this one, that, if I can get a grade A for the er next two pieces that I'm doing, which I've got to hand in, that could take me to a B grade after that."
"Did you erm, give in a formal letter?"
"No he said don't give them in yet, but do the informal first, so I'll do the informal, we've got to do an informal"
"Well don't talk about it, go and do it"
Yeah I'll do it later
Well do it now you're not doing anything before dinner
Dinner's now
No dinner's in at least twenty minutes at least if you rough
Twenty minutes
"Probably, if you just rough out"
"Yes it's easy enough those  so, I hope they don't get bitchy because most of mine are on, on the computer"
"well then write the song through, write the informal letter by hand"
respect.
I do not think that research has gone as fast as it should!
Mhm.
"And it's going to be a long time before it's going to be possible, so therefore we still have to use animals, I  see no way round it."
Mhm.
And I know that they're using cultures and things but  I still think that we are  a long way from not using animals.
Up there.
"Erm  can I, can I move this conversation on to the"
Yes.
"th th the, the veterinary side?"
Mhm.
"Erm, we've we've covered the fact that animal models don't always reflect the human situation, but if we're going to understand control and eradicate disease in animals, this sort of work must go on."
Could I go back to something the lady here
Yes.
"said about the Animal Procedures Act of nineteen eighty six, erm, I know she's been told about the animals are killed painlessly and that they suffer very little pain, where there's any pain at all, but in fact this act erm which is governed by a committee  only erm  issues guidelines as to what might happen."
No matter how serious an infringement there might be of that act  they are not subject to any sort of criminal offence.
"Sh shall we try and see what the er, what the general feeling on this is?"
Do you think that er  the use of animals in research is ever justified?
"Er, button one for yes, and button two for no."
"Research there being either on behalf of animals themselves, or on behalf of er, of humans."
"Is research on er, the use of animals in research ever justified?"
"And this particular hundred are creeping in with their votes but have decided, seventy fo seventy seven of them say yes, all be it th th th , by far the majority, and twenty three say no."
Could anyone say what the consequences would be if they weren't available for use in er  in the development of human  er  medicines and treatment?
"Well I wouldn't be here because a horse was used for a toxin to provide the anti-toxin for diphtheria  whe , in my days when I was younger there was no toxins as such, vaccination as such and so therefore the horses  were used  for research  to provide the anti-toxins."
"So do you think people who would like to ban the use of animals in research are in, are in cloud cuckoo land do you?"
Yes?
Would any of you twenty three like to defend your position?
Yes?
"Erm, I'm just not sure why any  any person would think that they have more right to life than animals do."
I mean what  what gives you more right to life than an animal does?
Anyone wa
"Just because we have, a so called civilized nation that we live in  that destroys the world, that destroys animals  that destroys the environment we're living in!"
"I, I've never really heard of women attacking lesbian women or women attacking gay men, its usually if there's a if there's a row something or other because the male of the species seems the one who's been, feels very, very threatened at the"
by there own people
"masculinity or, or the lost of a er female companion or something."
Jacky
"Can I er, compound the issue more?"
"mm, mm"
"and, and say there is again disrespect or whatever for, I don't know what to call them transracial relationships"
"mm, mm"
because that's another problem and I think maybe people haven't you know like addressed that.
"can, can I just move on to one other issue that I'd like to look at er, because I think we've covered that reasonably for the moment which is, how, how will you find love?, ninety three people said their, their were in love, seven said they weren't, of those seven were, you've never been in love, was it, have, have you wanted to be?, would any of the seven who voted no at the beginning, yes"
Not really
ah
you didn't fancy it?
"no, I'm too in my, I like my independence too much, yes."
any one else  yes
"I think I was er, I thought I was in love a few times, but erm in retrospect it was lust"
"so that's, that's,"
"thought that half of you being in love was, was lust any way."
"Where, where do you find love?, if their are people out watching this programme tonight who would actually rather be in love"
Love finds you
eh?
love finds you
don't give up hope it finds you
thank you
"Also like, why, why, do people want to find love?, like is it maybe lulling them into a false sense of si security erm and I think that it is really important as like one woman said earlier on that its really important to love yourself first, cos how can you give any body any thing"
"mm, mm"
"I think love is like, when somebody loves you, loves you for just being yourself"
aha
"I, I think to me that would be the greatest"
respects you also
"yeah, no matter who you are."
Sadie
"If you're a psychocentric tourist, you're the type of person who's self inhibited."
You're perhaps a little nervous of change  you haven't got really a desire for adventure or anything too challenging.
You prefer well packaged routine holidays in popular tourism destinations and you're looking at the three Ss or four Ss we should say.
So you're looking at a package holiday resort in Spain  in the main.
"Okay, psychocentrics."
"Again, like to be in the crowds."
"The alternative are what we call alocentrics, these are outgoing people with varied interests."
"They're keen to explore, to find new things and they're likely to want independence."
"And in between these two  we also have something called midcentrics who do bits of both, but these are the two extremes."
So all of you in this room are either a psychocentric or probably an alocentric.
The type of person who goes on this holiday is almost certainly gonna be a psychocentric.
"The type of person who goes on this holiday to destinations for example want somewhere unusual  perhaps to India, is more likely to be an alocentric person cos they're getting away from the crowds."
Okay so psychocentrics and alocentrics.
"So this is what Stanley Clog produced, now we're gonna add two more to this, two that you're all familiar with I'm sure, firstly, sunlust people."
People who chase the sun  beach holidays and there's a lust for a tan.
So for example w I can't remember your name  who's the girl next to you?
Michelle.
"Michelle is obviously a sunlust person in that respect and depending on whether she goes to a main package resort in Spain or perhaps a beach in India, she can either be a psychocentric sunlust person or an alocentric sunlust person."
And the alternative to this is wanderlust.
"The person who wants to explore, keep on the move  and typified by some form of touring holiday."
"Okay so now whenever you look at a package holiday brochure, you should be able to identify the market just using two words  sunlust alocentric, wanderlust psychocentric and so on."
"So if you're looking at a touring holiday in Europe  it's wanderlust probably, and if it's an, a coach tour round Europe it's almost certain to be psychocentric."
"If you're looking for a tour around  Borneo and Indonesia, that's away from the crowds so we can say it's an alocentric wanderlust."
"So it's a very simple way, if you like, for us to define markets fairly accurately."
Okay can everybody understand that?
"Sunlust, wanderlust, psychocentrics and alocentrics."
Right well you'll be doing a lot more of this in your marketing.
Er I've got two handouts which I want you to pick up er now.
One is something sp specifically written on the demand for the tourism product after nineteen ninety one.
Try to highlight those factors or the determinants of demand which were gonna be important in buying the tourism products in nineteen ninety two.
And the second is something on tourism decision making.
"This simply gives you, it's only a two page handout, it gives you some idea of the sort of motivations  from what people have written about them."
"And the idea here was that one would be for incoming goods, and one would be for empty wagons or the other way round, er going out."
Erm and of course the the wagons as I say would would come up right along side that er road.
Now that's a picture which er many of you will be very familiar of with.
Erm and it shows it's er just about the turn of the century that is.
And er there you have a a s a signal.
"Erm the level crossing gates here, 's Mill on the left hand side, erm a er sort of lean to er over the erm sort of loading bay, or unloading bay there."
"Erm a typical  er signal box and a rather pretty little station master's house, there."
"And that I say that picture has appeared on everything, even on china, I think you can buy some at erm  can't you  even with that on it."
It's a very very well known photograph.
"Again, about the turn of the century, erm looking up towards ."
"The track across here, the crossing  gates."
"Er signal box there, the er lower quadrant signal here."
"There's a round spot on the back which was used before they had er a white er sort of a black erm stripe, er vertical stripe erm on the er on it there."
"You can see at the back here, erm a barrow crossing, er which could be used er to get erm heavy items on a on a wheelbarrow, or trolley, over the tracks er from the platforms."
"Erm various lamps, the station b main station building, the s the subsidiary station building there."
"er in the background there's the engine shed, erm and a few er one or two, there's a loco there I think."
Erm one or two bits and pieces anyhow.
"And on the right hand side, there's the goods shed."
"Erm in nineteen fourteen, erm  's, who had a water turbine er as their sort of main motive power for their er milling operations, erm put in or had had, er not only this line, siding, but they had one put in round the back here, erm because that was to provide coal, for steam boilers which were er put in to augment the water power."
"Erm that later on, the signal box that used to be here was moved over to the other side, that's all that's there for."
And er that shows it later on when that one at the back had been taken out.
"Now erm last century er goods came up er the Trent to  er and er by sailing barge er and er this sort of equipment was used to er to collect er items from the holds of these er barges, erm put on wagons, horse-drawn er and er some steam traction engines, er to be transported around."
There's another picture of one of the barges on the Trent.
A steam one.
Now the great er as you can see that is a just pre-first world war advertisement from  's.
"And erm so they were quite major users of the railway services and indeed, I think that there was at least one clerk, from the railway, employed in  's offices, all day, every day at some time."
"There's a picture of er er flour, going out from  's Mill er latter part of er last century, erm going out to  's bakery in the town."
"A steam lorry that  acquired, in the er early part of the century."
Erm obviously er no erm pneumatic tyres or anything on that but er quite er good old wo work horses they were.
No that was er that's a picture of er  's erm er I think before they took that off they've taken that off haven't they now?
"Erm that was when er it had just been erm, well  before they started erm altering it into flats, and so on."
But you can see that in fact the railway line came round and in front actually just in in the front here.
Near that
Say this er I think
mm
"Have you actually got a plan drawn up with measurements, devised to the top and the base as well or are you going to do that when you"
"I got the height of the base, you've seen that"
"yes, yes"
Use that for the base obviously
"Muffin be quiet, what the devil's wrong with him?"
"it's that much bigger so, you know just see how the top one goes and then I can copy that to the bottom"
"Yeah, well you're going to do the base of it bigger aren't you?"
Yes
Erm
"er the only, I'm not quite sure yet how the sides are going to"
"and the door , the glass door he wanted it erm like the lead glass, oh similar to these"
Yes I know he wants it erm
you know
glazing bars
Mm
"there's no way we could use it either of those, panels that were the glass panels that we've got in the garage, no, separate them, I mean it,"
"they're not, they're not solid glass, they're two panes, which could be separated whether of ingenuity and"
What re-cut you mean?
"Well no not, not, well we could get them, I never thought of that"
Cut them they wouldn't be the exact size
"yes, ah that's a point now, I could take them down to erm, what's his name  down the road and ask him, he's very obliging, ask him to cut them"
I don't know it depends er
"I was just thinking rather than having plain which you'd have to pay for anyway a plain piece of glass and, and er putting lead on it yourself  I think that's a brilliant idea that."
"Well the idea is, is it's not so much the lead"
it suppose to be the
"bars, I don't know what they look like without"
"old, old er"
"it's a diamond , it's a diamond pattern isn't it for"
Yeah
Very good er we may come back to that in a moment.
Thank you.
"But listening to you make that case it's very similar to reading the great debate on franchise reform in this House in the last century, when people said we should be included and that people like us should be able to have the vote and put people into Parliament, it's I mean it was just that you were you were making that plea about pro that the Board should be representative as being like  the group who are benefiting."
You've made very powerfully erm and I'm that's a point that we'll take on board.
"When you talk about this split, fifty-fifty, could we go back that way."
Who elects the Chairman?
"Well  that's er  that's another thing that's happened within the British Steel's er scheme, the Chairman seems to be elected in himself or by the company, it's certainly not e elected by the Trustee Board and er  a and we would like to see"
You mean parachuted in is he?
"Yes, he's certainly parachuted in."
all right.
"But who but, but that's describing what happens, how do you think the Chairman should be elected?"
I think
"Even letting you you've all talked about the you know employers are paying money in and so on, we don't want the schemes wound up, er  if I was the the employer, might I not be concerned if you elected a  a chairman that wasn't  erm favourable to me?"
"Er you might er the company might well be concerned about that point, but er I think if the composition of the Board was er correct, that er that possibly wouldn't arise."
What you mean you'd have blocking mechanisms?
Yes.
"Yes, very good, I see the point."
Thanks.
I see no reason additionally why the independent people on the Board should not act to protect the company in the same way as they're trying to help protect the other members .
"Yes, but your colleague has also made the point that the constitution might have a blocking mechanism so that people, both sides, could be satisfied, wasn't it."
"But Post Office and B T management appoint the Chairman of the Trustees, there are four Trustees appointed by the"
Yes.
"Management, four by the Trade Unions and the Chairman is appointed by the management."
Right.
"No, no, the present  the present one was a  I think he was a Chairman of a big building society before he came into the Post Office and they use these  are on three year terms, but er the previous Post Office one er spent nine years as Chairman, spent three yea three terms of three years."
So they're there for three years?
Yes.
Right and er is it a full-time job the Chairmanship?
"Erm I don't know, I don't think it's erm I mean I I think it occupies er  seventy-five percent  of his time, but it isn't full-time."
"No, I was just thinking,we we're, we're debating the in the Commons at the moment, changing the parole board from having part-time members, to having  salaried full-time ones, which are on limited contracts  and that clearly puts those parole board members in a different position to the Home Secretary and one it's ju you just do it because it's a part-time activity, you may get some expenses that you think is important, and I just wanted to get clear whether the Chairman on a limited contract a large part of their work appointed by the employer."
Thanks.
Our Chairman is appointed by the company and is usually a senior management member.
"Well the  miners er were middle of the road, as lots of miners are now, but er probably more middle then because, well, the Colliery Chapel and the Co-op were a way of life."
Mm.
What about ?
", of course, was a chapel man and er I think they saw, or some of them saw him er a in him a way round, out of things, and, of course , he did deals with the collieries to get people back to work, and whilst  families had enjoyed six months in the gardens and doing all sorts of strange things, erm the men mainly wanted to get back to work, because they saw time running out."
Mm.
W was the Strike a period of hardship particularly?
"It was hardship in this, that er, perhaps the hardest time came after it when er, well it was called public assistance then, social security payments had to be payed back."
"All the things that you'd had during the Strike, but things did get left, and er tradesmen were very considerate, there was no chasing for m hard for money and er I know we had an insurance that wasn't paid and we used the book to have an imaginary shilling on a horse each day."
"Which put me off gambling for good, because whilst we won every day, it seemed, we'd lost a lot of money at the end of the year."
"Theoretically we hadn't done, but, of course, we hadn't played anything, but it was good exercise."
Mm.
"Well moving onto social life, what are your childhood memories of of playing and  with your your father and playmates, etc?"
"Well, of course, er f er Fathers and grandfathers er took er the youngster a walk ."
"Er there was walking, there was cricket and er billiards, erm street games, things you can't do now because of traffic."
"But a lot more, I feel sorry for my grandchildren, where they can't have as much fun as I used to have, kicking a tin."
Mm.
Did did church figure as prominently in your early life ?
"Oh cha chapel Later on, I mean er you know when you got to ten, eleven,ch there were so many things at chapel, I mean from learned dissertations, I mean the gentlemen from the University, here."
"Er Prof  and , used to come and talk to the Guilds and things, er the men's meeting."
And er then there were the concerts or the pantomimes or the operettas.
"I always finished up as a bandit, or a pirate, I don't know quite why."
I couldn't sing.
"But equally they did Silas Marner and er Merchant of Venice, a good standard, too."
So is th is a idea of a chapel being more in the community than just religion?
Is that  ?
"Oh yes, it was a very much a community centre, I mean,we played billiards at chapel, and various chapel people had billiard tables un under their dining table and er we u just go and play billiards."
"Going back to the your mining background, erm after the Strike were were your father and grandfather members of both the Nottingham Miners Associa Association and the industrial union?"
"Erm, yes."
My grandfather became involved because  's union er made a big thing out of compensation cases.
"Compensation had to be fought for, it wasn't a matter of right, and a piece of a very small piece of coal fell down the shaft, the onsetter's the man at the bottom, and it  through his hand and he got compensation and then my father was sacked for  the shovel."
"Too much of a coincidence,I'm afraid, to  our minds."
"Do you think the two were connected, then?"
"They had, they had witnessed him casting out demons, they had heard his teaching, they were familiar with Jesus, they had every reason to be, to have faith in him, he says, what has happened to your faith?"
"And very soon they were , he said a moment ago they had taken it from Jesus, they were no longer trusting in him, and they started to trust in themselves in their own ability."
"You see, as long as things were happening their faith was riding high."
"As long as the miracles were flowing, as long as the sight er er was given to the blind people, as long as the lame were walking, as long as th the lepers were being cleansed, they had faith ten feet tall!"
Well when you see things like that happening you can afford to have faith ten feet tall!
It's not difficult to believe!
"And yes certainly, you and I can be like that."
"When everything is going fine for us, and God is in quote, blessing us, when our life is flowing smoothly, it's easy then to have faith, it's easy then to trust, but do you know, those disciples in that boat, they were no safer  after Jesus stilled the storm  than beforehand."
"Their safety had not increased one little bit  granted, they were more comfortable  and granted, they were enjoying themselves more, they felt better, but they were no safer."
"During the past two or three generations  there have been, there has been this, this idea of God's favour being expressed in blessing."
"Very often, we'd link that blessing with  material things, the physical things, the healing, the prosperity  you know God's blesses us just because I'm sick, he heals me."
I can't find that in God's word.
It's not there.
That is not an evidence of his blessing.
"You see  if that's how we're to judge blessing  then what are we to say  to people, to men like  C T Stard who  sacrificed  an inheritance that in today's value, just in the early part of this century, but in today's value be worth millions of pounds  to go to the Congo, and to China, and to India?"
"In later le li years leaving his wife behind him cos she was unable to go, and going to serve his God therein, where is the blessing in that if this is how we take God's blessing?"
"Or  what are we gonna say to men like Hudson Taylor there in China buried his wife, and buried his daughter, and son."
And Judson in Burma burying his whole family within a few short years of getting there.
"Men like Jim Elliott who in seek of the taking of good news of the gospel to the  Indians becomes, as a young man, a martyr."
To men like Teddy Hobson who  in his whole life serving the  the  of the Congolese  ends up as a martyr.
He was cannibalized.
Where is God's blessing in that?
If we equate God's blessing with the nice things that happen to us  then they were not blessed!
And they've given far more than but you or I will ever contemplate doing for God!
"And yet, is that blessing?"
Is that what it really means?
Is that what the bible means by being blessed by God?
"Let me read you two or three verses  the bible has to say about blessing, first of all, the verse in the book of Proverbs  Proverbs chapter ten, verse twenty two."
It sets the scene perhaps  for it said  it is the blessing of the Lord that makes rich  and he adds no sorrow to it .
And we read that and we start thinking of richness in the terms of pounds and pence and material possessions.
"Of course, it's nothing to do with that."
"But as Jesus said, a man's life  does not consist in the, in the abundance of the things he possesses, that's not how you gauge your person's richness."
You were born in India on the mission field  and through your family's experience and your own you've brought to the convenorship of the Board a great personal interest in the overseas church and in international affairs.
For several years here in Edinburgh  you have been the presbytery's World Mission and Unity convenor and then you became the convenor of the Board's local involvement committee which links our congregations to people who work overseas in churches there with whom they serve.
"As the convenor of the Board since nineteen eighty eight you have visited the European work of the Board in Rotterdam, in Paris, in Budapest and in Prague  also in Israel and Egypt  and you have represented the Board at meetings of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches ."
Hugh you have shown throughout all of your work a deep concern for the people working abroad  for our partner churches  and for our ecumenical relations  and the need to keep these matters to the fore of the church and also of our country.
Hugh you and I share the gift of a very unusual christian name.
I understand it's the only way in which these letters are arranged in the anglosaxon language and is often used as an example of such.
It's a very difficult name at times to live up to I'm sure because the word Hugh literally means mind or soul  and it is important that we seek indeed to live up to what our names mean.
You have certainly applied your mind to the work of the Board and you have encouraged its vision and its direction through your intellectual gifts and perceptions and insights.
And you've also brought your soul to bear on the work of the Board and the work of the church.
Within the assembly council I personally valued your contributions  the very courteous and thoughtful way in which you presented these  and the courage with which you expressed at times the stand that you had to take for the interest of the Board.
"And yet above that and beyond that what you were seeking to do was not just to serve the Board of World Mission and Unity, it was to serve what you believed was the good and right for the church of god which you have sought to serve and to support and to take further."
"For that contribution, and for that depth of spirituality within yourself which you have brought to bear for the benefit of the work of this Board and for that of our whole church, we want to thank you very much indeed this morning."
I'm delighted and I'm sure you'll be delighted to hear the advice of the business convenor that we suspend at this point in time.
"And we, we recons we, we, we  we come back to continue our meeting at two o'clock this afternoon."
We adjourn until two o'clock.
She's been dead four years.
Oh!
"It was, it was bad that  she used to  those draws that bad that after so long  you'd see him go all white and then you'd gradually see round the crutch  then so, more"
Yeah but
Right!
I
And then all of a sudden after so long you saw a new Alf.
Mm.
"But, you never  there's never a pair of underpants."
"You might see a pair of  long johns, then long johns, and a pair of socks, but Paul said they've opened windows and Trevor said  it's nearly knocked him off the ladder."
"He said to Paul, you've done, cos, I think first time he painted it, Paul, he had to paint it wi windows shut, they wouldn't open window."
No?
No.
"So I said to Paul, well you've done well getting windows open."
And even nets are down.
"But ah, I've gone in and opened it, it  stinks."
"Er normal practice for the railway was to have the main er part of the buildings on the town side, and you got a er smaller building on the other side of the tracks over there."
There's er part of the er goods shed over there.
"And we've got lamp house, er signal box and the white gate and er woodwork there."
Now that er merely shows that that is a cattle dock.
"A lot of quite a lot o cattle traffic in those days, agriculture and cattle traffic, and the normal practice er in certainly in the last century, er to avoid disease, was to use a lime wash."
"Er they didn't have the er the normal erm antiseptic washes, which sort of came in later on."
Er  Brothers of  were manufacturers of sheep dips and various disinfectants.
"And of course as I say those those were around, but erm the reason that is  all white, is that it was erm er when the cattle had been got out of the way, they er whacked a fair amount of of lime wash all over things er to er to kill any any nasties there."
Erm here you have a handsome cab.
And that cab you'll see in other photographs we've got.
Erm that plied to the  's Head Hotel.
"Er and again, you'll see on one of the  's photographs I've got, it shows, just to the right hand side as you're looking at the front of the main archway, erm it had the legend, Railway, parcels receiving office."
"So if you wanted to er send parcels via the  Railway, anywhere in the country, Then you could take your parcels into er the  's Head er sort of office there, erm and they were ferried down here."
You didn't actually have to come down er with er to the station to .
"Erm a number of er sort of billboards up here, various signals, erm lamps."
"Quite an interesting picture er and for anybody who is interested in sort of modelling this scene,get is right, er that's a very very valuable photograph."
"Erm it's off a er an ordinary postcard that was produced many many years ago,quite common."
Erm round about nineteen O five I think that was.
Now as you let's have a look at er the track layout of the place.
Erm  want to run to about half past eight or
We'll see how we go.
"Erm coming in from er on the A six one two from , er we've come to over the  level crossing there."
Now this is a er an ordinance survey map of about nineteen fifteen.
"And at that time, single track over that level crossing erm and the track became double as one went up past about Close, isn't it now, over here?"
"Erm  's Meadow, Close, erm and er then we've got the double track runs into the station up here, past the cattle pens which you saw those white things on the photograph, various signal posts, the goods shed, there, erm an engine shed, a small engine shed which was built to accommodate, normally only one loco."
"Erm and a little siding by the er track to accommodate erm a loco which was largely used for er coaling purposes, of the locomotive."
And and on the er here you've got erm siding with that that erm circular object is called a wagon turntable.
"And goods wagons that needed to be unloaded, er would be brought into, er at least unloaded erm er perhaps for the distribution of items in the town, would be brought onto that turntable erm and normally horse, purely a horse hook would be er put on er and swung round, and the wagon, or the wagons, a couple of wagons perhaps, would be taken at right angles into that er goods shed for unloading."
And the there was there was a central say walkway or carriageway down the middle there.
"Er well not quite central, erm and the er s wooden staging inside the goods shed, er was at wagon height."
So the er the items could be loa unloaded straight out of their packages and and whatever.
Erm there was also an interesting erm stubby bit of railway track there.
Okay just a rectangle round three three er things that were the highlights for you yesterday the most important things that er came through to you yesterday.
So  he knows what's coming
the eyes don't ya.
Some a lot of you said yesterday that you don't always get in this formal situation having to stand up in front of people.
But what if you have sort of meetings one to one or even even in three or fours.
So you know when you get in a meeting sometimes you've got a point of view on an agenda item and you think how  where am I gonna get support for for my point of view on the meeting?
Or you know you're in a meeting and the chairman  what's your opinion John on this where you what do you think about this?
"A good way of doing it is the Aldershot method, how to your put your point across very very clearly but also succinctly you know short and to the point."
"So if somebody said to me what what were the highlights for you yesterday, Aldershot method tell them what you tell them  just list them."
So what are the three important things for me yesterday were the Aldershot method the arousal curve and the need for audience contact so I told them what I'm gonna tell them.
Now I tell them why if you're gonna tell somebody why why your opinion is something the word because is bound to come into the sentence soon.
So I've said I've listed them well the important points for me were the Aldershot method the arousal curve and the  need for audience content.
The Aldershot method was particularly important for me because I realised that it's something we use every day or we see every day er and it emotionally prepares the audience the listener for what I'm going to say.
"Tell them what you're going to tell them before you tell them, and then summarise it at the end and tell them what you told them."
It's emotionally satisfying it's a very important method to get a point across.
The need for arousal  thought well should I be absolutely calm when I'm giving a presentation but I never am so is it right and now understanding that you need a certain level of arousal to be able to perform at all is is satisfying for me because at least I understand the situation now and able to work with it rather than against it .
And audience content when you're making a presentation I feel that's very important because you need to have feedback as to how well things are going.
If you don't look people in the eye if you don't involve them then they're not with you and if the audience aren't with you then the presentation doesn't .
So for me the three points were the Aldershot method er the importance of understanding arousal and the need for audience contact.
Do you see the Aldershot method there you list then expand on each one saying why and then just summarise by listing again.
Yep.
So can we try that just to from a seated position not from from up the front.
The best thing to do because having said that then I might say Mike what's your opinion what was important to you and and pass it on?
So obviously if Mike's been chosen once or he's done it he doesn't want somebody asking him again.
"So just jot down at the side of the page the other eleven names in the room okay everybody's Tony, Mike, Jeff, Sarah, Bob, Rob, Gordon, John, Tom, Joanne, Mike Dave."
Just jot the other people's names down and then obviously when they've been they've said their piece just strike their name through so you don't go and .
"Tony, Mike, Jeff, Sarah, Bob, Rob, Gordon, John, Tom, Joanne, Mike, Dave."
You should have eleven names down there  Are you alright can you see where have you got to Rob
"Rob yeah Gordon, Rob, Gordon  John Joanne Mike and Dave"
okay right  let's  the meeting.
So you've you've got your three points so remember the er the Aldershot just list what they are then expand briefly on them then list them again and then invite somebody else to to give their er their opinions.
Okay?
I've tried to make them a little bit longer.
Any plans?
"Well I, obviously want to try and attend meetings if and when possible, er I've been to one last week, which basically was er  because I don't feel I'm qualified to get up and  David  got up and spoke very well actually, he was always, at the police not neighbourhood watch, er to do with the cascade telephone system which we found out afterwards, after a three quarters hour debate a man came up to Dave afterwards and showed him a memo which said this cascade system has now ceased in November nineteen ninety-two and that was the the abuse on that particular meeting."
I do intend to er to attend inaugural meetings with each of the C P O s er with a view to looking I mean obviously at some stages you said to me that I would probably have to attend at short notice
Mm
probably by going to these meetings I can pick up the be best practice for ideas which can be passed on to the others
"If anybody hears of any neighbourhood watch group meetings, I think make sure Paul knows about it so he can attend where possible"
Yeah
Like him to go and look at the one at er the at er  which seems to be a successful one
"Well I went to the  last week and I did say that I'd like to go to that one, I'll go to as many as I can"
Yeah
"what I would like and I'm sure it happens with the previous C P O er and I have been notified by telephone and I keep saying to them let me know, but I would like probably a memo from each C P O to say that there is a meeting on this particular night."
Do you mean inaugural meetings
Well an any meetings really because I think if I can er show my face at these meetings it might er I mean I think whether or not it's because of the increase in burglaries or whether it's because of the publicity via David we seem to have had er a hell of a lot of er enquiries about the schemes.
More than normal Tracy ain't it?
Yeah I think so
Yeah
Okay er
It's amazing that he's
"What you saying that for Jed, how long you been saying that for?"
"Yeah I know, but there has ain't there, you know but I say that and I live in an area where there's not a neighbourhood watch scheme and I ain't setting one up to until I retire"
"As crime goes up, people see it as a way of protecting their property don't they"
Yes
seventeen per cent of reported crime is up
mm
"Erm, may I make a comment on neighbourhood watch, I went to er a job the other day, it was a theatre, I was off duty and er I got tapped on the shoulder by my local neighbourhood watch co-ordinator who said, nine months ago I resigned, I wrote a letter to headquarters, I wrote a letter to the divisional commander, and I wrote a letter to the local constable, and nobody's replied to me and they still keep sending me papers are you gonna get your act together, now I I have brought this up before, we never ever have let a neighbourhood watch scheme lapse, it's nothing to do with you, this is all before you came"
no
Er we just kept them on and there's I know quite a few schemes have stopped working but we've still got them written down somewhere
probably now we started it might be well worth while g getting rid of some of these schemes that aren't operating
Are you saying then that when one's lapsed for six months or over a given period of time we should actually go out there and remove the signs
Yeah

Thank you award winners and thank you all  for your contribution to Save The Children Fund.
Now I have some er  parish notices for you all.

"These meetings are  Making the most of the seventy fifth in shops, Involving young people in singing for the seventy fifth, Branches sharing fund raising ideas for the seventy fifth and Small World Theatre extracts from  Moving, a play on the theme of refugees."
Now these are taking place between one and two this afternoon.
"I should say that there are only seventy five seats available for each fringe meeting so  if you want to go hurry on and get your tickets which will be issued at level three information desk on a first come, first served basis."
A colour coded system will be in operation to help you find your way around those fringe meetings.
Now I just want to end this morning session by reminding you to be in your seats by two twenty.
We have a speaker  er  Patricia Routledge in her guise as Mrs Bucket or Mrs Bouquet she would not be very pleased if you were late.
For one of her candle-lit after-lunch speeches.
"Thank you very much for this morning, we'll see you this afternoon."
"interesting as well as a er  edible lunch  er we're very pleased now to start away the afternoon session  and I'm particularly pleased to be able to introduce Patricia Routledge, she's an actress with so many parts in so many media that I'm not going to make any further introduction, but merely to ask her to come up and speak to us."
"When she has finished Sally Barker, branches advisory committee chairman, will make her presentation."
Thank you very much.
"Your Royal Highness, ladies and gentlemen."
It is a particular privilege for me to be here today and part of me feels not totally qualified.
I have over the years  sent my postal order regularly and it wasn't until  two years ago that I became more actively involved in the work of Save The Children fund raising.
"I was invited to give an entertainment at the Bristol Old Vic theatre, the wonderful old Theatre Royal, the oldest extant theatre still being used in the country and one of the oldest in the world, a very beautiful place  erm and I was asked if I would do an entertainment that I have called Come for the Ride which I was persuaded to concoct by my home town of Birkenhead in the North West of England."
I did it there originally and then did it at festivals all over the country.
"I have a particular affection for Bristol and the West country, I'd like you know that, those of you who've come all the way to London from the West and I so I was very happy to have this evening and be able with er an accompanist and musical director, to provide entertainment that would raise money."
I was told early on that it was possible that your Royal Highness would be able to be there and indeed you were and it gave us all  one of the most unforgettable nights.
"I remember after the show you spoke  for twelve minutes without a note and not only that but you came round afterwards and spent eight or ten minutes with us, the artists, which absolutely made our evening."
It seems to me that that attention to the moment is significant of the great work that you do for this particular charity.
"Now I recently have accumulated unto myself, a notoriety that I didn't originally seek."
And certainly didn't expect  but everywhere I go it comes at me.
It gives me great pleasure because people are extremely kind and extremely generous.
.
"Right, I hope, we won't be to long now, perhaps if we could just bring up the item you wanted to mention."
"Yeah, erm, right, yeah, that's all the other items, erm  what's been er been going through my head recently is, is er the, looking at the pattern of the meetings and the way the meetings are arranged and, and how, erm, at the last meeting we had a speaker er and that I think, we all found that quite interesting and the one, one from Central America that things  and I feel we ought to have that much more frequently than we do have er, a, either a speaker or a focus of some sort of meetings erm, so I think that's something I'd like to raise and get the A G M at the next meeting I think similar thing we ought to consider there."
"Erm, quite how we arrange cos this, as Margaret says there's a lot of business to get through on occasions, but er, this, this meeting seems to had a lot, but, you know, er whether we could alternate er a business meeting with a, a, a speaker so I thought functional meeting every two months and a speaker attending er, er the other month, erm, I'm really sussing it open for ideas, what, what do other people feel and"
Maybe we should have speaker on a separate night .
"mm, well, this, or is everybody happy with the, the format as it is? er."
Is it not  but er
Yeah.
"Speaker's a very good idea, but difficult to organise,"
Mm.
"I think a, every so often it'll be very interesting, very sort of, we did try this once didn't we?"
"This, this has cropped up before, oh yes this idea of trying to change this ."
"Michael , Michael  started the ball rolling in my mind, er, yes he, he, I, one thing erm  yesterday, erm one thing he, he started to coming to more meetings last year and erm I think he'd seen one or two people come along and not,"
Mm.
"a couple of new people come along and then, not, not follow up"
"Yes, there can be."
"mm, erm, and he wh you know he is thinking well is this, is that the reason erm, so er, I don't know, you know, er, I, I think perhaps it's worth looking at, perhaps we can all thing about it and have a look at it at the A G M."
"I think, I think it would be a good idea to have, as every sort of maybe every two or three meetings to have something a bit different erm, and we do, we do find if we want to get through the business quickly"
We can.
"we can, we can."
We can.
pressure.
"We can do, we've just got to, I mean we've just got to ask everyone to give a very brief report erm on another occasion and then it can be kept very short, I think though, there are, there are times when, when, you know, we do want to hear what's going on with sort of er networks and campaigns, we do need that time as well don't we, er so we can't, I don't think we can always do it."
"Well I'm, yeah, ern I wondered about sort of Executive Committee and er, I know you're not very keen on that idea and it, it does tend to remove information from the ordinary members, if, if, you have a small group of people dealing with the business and, a, a separate lead."
We have had that in the past haven't we?
We
I can't remember.
"Remember we used to have a prisoner group didn't we, when I first came so that the"
"What groups, yeah groups for particular things on, on the, you know like campaigns or prisoners there were special groups dealing only with this those, they met on there own, not  there weren't any"
Schools groups.
"yes, the schools group, yes, I mean, that, that could operate more, in fact we could have, instead of having just talking about the, about the India one, er instead of having one person  at it, it could be a group of, of three perhaps, er ."
But then they'd still presumably report back to the main group about what they'd been doing.
If they did the same thing again to you?
Maybe.
Maybe.
and the third time?
"Er  it's very hard to keep on forgiving somebody for hurting you in the same way over and over again and in this particular example, three times and that's it."
Just  just  all right.
Don't  more than three times  all right thank you very much for your help there.
"There is another question, how many times do I forgive somebody."
"Should it be as many as seven times  and Jesus had replied both no, no you should be able to forgive forgive them seven times, it should be seventy times   in other words stop thinking about counting and just get on with the forgiving."
And in the prayer that Jesus
he says that we should say God please forgive us as we forgive others.
So how far do you actually want God to forgive you up to three times and then no more  you know it's  it's that kind of er question that we're asking and that we  that I feel that is something we should be thinking about that how far should a Christian go in forgiving.
It's er all this is a fascinating theory or is it a  question in real life.
"I invite you to think about just how far you should go in forgiving others in daily living, whether it's in here or outside."
Another on the second point about how far a Christian organisation like this school should go in showing forgiveness.
You may be familiar with those sorts of stories which say my convent life was hell with the Sisters of Mercy er that kind of story about er church organisations that absolute  not to show er Christian qualities in the way that they are organised is quite true that often Christian organisations do find it hard to show forgiveness.
"So should a school like this one equip for the realities of unforgiveness of the world outside, or should it be much more generous in the way it shows forgiveness  and can a school be organised so that it does actually reflect Christ's teaching on forgiveness."
Is this  the impossible.
I'll be interested to hear what the teachers have to think about that and like you.
Can we just end with a  a short story about the job that I used to do before I did this one.
"When I went to  the first meeting I had been appointed to the job, I went to the first meeting and there in front of me were lots of people who were managing their own schools  and they were organising how to spend money that they had been allocated."
all sorts of managing business and they had to work together and to hold group organisations.
"The person whom I was going to take over the job from said to me at the end of the meeting well what do you think of that meeting  and I must admit I  the answer and luckily somebody else instructed with some other business and I felt I got off the hook here  but in fact that  got dealt with very quickly and he came back to me and said well what did you think of the meeting  and I had to say to him just one word,was the way I put it."
"Because everybody in that meeting was thinking about blaming other people  they were actually trying to say it's not my fault that thing come in, it's not my fault that things are like this, it's somebody else's fault in a different organisation."
"It's not us, it's them."
and then I had to work with these people and I knew that that was the kind of way that they were operating  and I had to teach them by the way I worked  but in fact it was okay to admit that we do make mistakes.
"We have to admit that each one of us could fail in what we were supposed to be doing and in fact  then we could work together, that we could forgive each other and that we could support each other in our work."
In my present job I still try to keep that going.
We do need to be able to show forgiveness in all the things that we do  but it isn't easy and Jesus devotion to is a great challenge to us as to just how far we can go.
So in your groups now I appreciate it and I have asked .
Erm I'd like you to be considering those two points.
First how far a Christian should go in showing forgiveness and second how far a Christian organisation like this school should go in showing forgiveness.
"And I had er had given myself a target of five thousand for Leith so I turned up the next  and made my five thousand in fact I made five thousand and fifty signatures for the h and I believe myself if, if every branch were doing the same as I had been doing then we would have no problem at all in getting a hundred thousand signatures which is our aim."
"And they said so at the er at the district council, went up to district and I asked for the support of the district council and er  probably John  immediately said, you have the full support of the district council for it he says and I'll ensure that you get support with the result I also received four posters direct from the Edinburgh District Council with  John  photograph on it and with the caption st stating every old age pensioner should be signing here."
So that in itself was a great boost for me and it er it helped a lot.
I also got support from er Labour  Labour Party in Leith who sent down two volunteers to help me.
"So it's made a lot, a big difference too."
I also had support from Lance house and from er Leith community centre.
"So I wasn't, I wasn't doing it all on my own, you understand my meaning?"
I weren't doing it all  although I sort of organized it.
"And when I took, I had to report back to area control I was immediate I got immediate applause."
"But I just said I don't want any applause for this at all, I feel that every pensioner, every pensioner should sign it whether they belong to the association or not."
Whether they have a senior citizens' club  with the association.
If they want the free bus passes they've got to  something done about themselves and .
"One of my  in fact was I can remember, I went up when I was first er  paying for  paying for an annual ticket with their bus passes and eight pound for a single ticket for us er for our quarterly ticket."
"I was up there three days campaigning, objecting to this that I'm being charged  and believe me for those three days I stood right in Queen Street, just outside the offices there, and at no, any time during, at any particular time of day, you could have come along to me, and there were still one thousand five hundred people standing there, rain, hail, sleet or blow."
"For their tickets, and I said at the area council if they had turned up like they turned up to pay them thirty pound and eight pound, if they'd turned up at the same time with a petition form what a difference it would"
What kind of erm reaction do you get from the different political parties to your campaign?
"Oh well, well er most of us are b even, even the Tories themselves know, they know that we're fighting for the old people, but do they  we get the same old reply from them, where is the money coming?"
"That's the s o o reply, and that is all cos because of the central go government  support grant who are naturally  younger."
"They're responsible for the, for the present  that they keep, they keep sending us this and that minister,and that."
"But they're, they're the gov they're going to end up in the government."
"They're going to govern the country, they cut the money off from  they cut the  support grant from the, the  from the district council, and still are, still are, and there's going to be even bigger cuts the next year."
Going to be even bigger cuts the ne and it's en there no used to  Lothian Regional Council Hall and district council.
"If the Lothian Regional C Council can't get their money from a from, a central government, where are they going to get it from?"
So erm do you get a lot of support from the Labour Party for your campaign?
"Oh every time, without fear  wherever you are er  Labour's Scottish Commons gives full support to the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association's pensions policy."
"That's from our own, we also have the Trades Union Congress  with the same."
"And that's when I say we have a, a campaign which is going to, it's a demonstration and er and rally in the end of March, of next year."
"When we will be marching off probably from Regents Street, proceeding along Queens er Princes Street ."
And then we've got us a  we're going to the  cinema.
"And that's a, and that's them all over the country, not only Edinburgh, all over the country, in north south east and west and you name it."
"And we have branches, but we could have a lot more because the amount of branches we have, although we have a lot of branches of Scottish Old Age Pensions  we are not  old age pensioners are not united, they're not united, the only way they can be united, if it's a national organization, join your national organization and fight the government."
"You can't do so locally, if you're all working separately."
"erm I think it's important not to see the city as a sort of down-trodden, poor,hard-working, well, I'm sure they were hard-working, but very poor people."
"We're talking about two powerful organisations, both trying to keep their privileges intact."
"erm Undoubtedly the university often won, but that didn't stop the city keeping on trying."
"erm And I think one other citizen should be mentioned, erm which is one John Nixon."
"He didn't actually live in St Aldate's, but he must have been here a lot, because he was mayor in 1636, he was an alderman erm he was very much a leading  in the city, and I think the leader of the opposition to Royal Policies."
"erm And erm when he came back after the war, he actually was so much involved on the parliamentarian side he had to leave Oxford during the war, but when he came back he built a school in the city which was actually in the Guildhall courtyard, it was built round the courtyard, and that remained a free school, for the city's boys right up to the end of the 19th century."
"Right, now, we've talked about very briefly, touched on the division between university and the city, and obviously the erm differences between the King and Parliament exacerbated what happened in the city."
"That's a complicated story I can't really go into at the moment, but was very much to do with the Royal Policies of the 1630s."
Am I blocking your view?
No.
"erm This is quite an interesting cartoon, and really has no connection with either St Aldate's or Oxford, erm but it was actually published in 1642, and it shows the two sides, the Roundheads and the Cavaliers, and what I think is interesting about it is that it does seem to be quite objective, it doesn't seem to be particularly getting at one side or the other, which is very rare for the kind of erm cartoons that were later issued during the war."
"And I've really just put it up erm because erm this is a complicated story but, one does want to be careful I think about seeing the sides as too neat."
"erm Undoubtedly the university erm with it's connections with the aristocracy and the landed gentry and the church was mainly royalist, but that is not to say that it all was."
"One college, New Inn Hall, completely emptied during the war, because erm they were on parliament's side."
"erm The warden of Merton had to get out of Oxford quick when the king arrived, because, and spent the erm war in London, name was Nathaniel Brent, and he was quite an important man in the organisation of the Parliamentary war effort, and Lincoln had rather mixed loyalties, too."
"So even University wasn't completely on one side, and again the City was erm there was this sort of Puritan element that didn't like the King's religious policies, erm there was this general feeling against the University which tended to put them off to the other side, but there are undoubtedly loyal citizens erm citizens loyal to the King."
"And Thomas and John Smith, who I've just mentioned were actually a split family, Thomas Smith was erm so loyal that when the first round of parliament, sorry, when the first Royalist troops came into Oxford, he, as a J P prosecuted some of the citizens who tried to stop them blocking down Botley Bridge as a defence measure."
"Whereas John Smith, a member of the Long Parliament actually was beaten up by those same Royalists troops, so erm because of his parliamentary sympathies."
"erm But he seems to have played things rather cool later on, he disappears at the beginning of the war but comes back into Oxford, and then later, actually sits in the Royalist Parliament,1644, which he certainly wouldn't have done if he was still on parliament's side."
"erm And I think really most citizens, and I daresay, a number of the scholars in the university too, were rather more interested in keeping their heads down, and erm just trying to keep out of it, and where the citizens were concerned, keeping on earning a living."
erm And I think that's an important thing to remember while we're thinking about what happened in St Aldate's.
"Well undoubtedly the first thing that happened in St Aldate's, the most important thing, was after the battle of Edgefield, when the King rode in in state erm in victory he said, though the fact that the battle was indecisive,and it was described by a very royalist writer Anthony Wood, you may have heard of, is a university antiquarian erm very much on the university and royalist side."
‘They came in their full march into the town with about 60 or 70 coloureds borne before them which they'd taken at the Battle of Edgehill from the Parliament's forces.
At Christchurch the university stood to welcome His Majesty.’
"Well he doesn't bother to mention that the king also had an official welcome at Carfax, which was the normal place, what was known as the Penniless Bench, which was at the end of St Martin's Church, only the  of that remains at the moment, now, erm and then was presented with the traditional gift of gloves by the mayor, and the not very generous sum of £520, and just about the same time, Alderman Nixon and 12 others who agreed with him disappeared smartly from Oxford, and weren't to be seen for the rest of the war."
"Now the King chose Oxford for pretty obvious reasons as his headquarters, he'd lost London, he needed a capital and a headquarters, erm and erm Oxford had a delightfully convenient central position, its transport is very easy with the river erm navigable, erm on both sides of it."
"Easy to defend, with its walls still existing, and the two rivers, and of course, with resources, with fuel and war effort, and the kind of buildings where the king could form a court."
"And the best building, though it's not technically part of St Aldate's, was the one he obviously chose as his fort, which was Christchurch."
"So court dominates St Aldate's throughout the war, and I think therefore we should spend just a little time looking at the people involved, erm but not too much."
"This of course is erm one of the famous Van Dyck portraits of Charles before the war, painted in 1636."
"Painted for a bust to be made, so that's why we have the three views, but I think it's very lucky, it means we can sort of walk round Charles, and get our own view of him."
"And perhaps Van Dyck doesn't flatter him in quite the way, flatter's the wrong word, sort of transmutes him in the way that he often does in his very elegant and sophisticated portraits."
"If we start with the Financial Times  well by their standards it's not a good result  er, but again  let's get it in context, the newspaper's trading margin is just, just under ten percent, it's er it's about nine point six percent  er, and on the circulation front  they've done well in market share terms  where we've marginally improved our  our market share in the quality market."
Er  in Europe we've gone up six percent in circulation  and in Japan we're on target there  and under budget.
"In advertisement, er  in the advertisement volume area, again we've increased our market share  amongst the qu er, quality dailies  a marginal increase  er  but  it's nationally we've done very well  and for instance in Europe  we're sixteen percent head, ahead of last year in volume and revenue terms."
"On the cost side, apart from the redundancies I mentioned, well including the redundancies I mentioned  er, the non volume related costs are only three percent ahead of the previous year."
"East India Dock is now  er, virtually fully utilized  printing the Basildon papers in the daytime and the Financial Times at night and the Observer on Saturday night  and we've got high hopes of getting the contract to print   the Japanese er, European edition of the Japanese daily  and that, that will fill the morning slot so that really will be  er, great utilization of, of that er installation."
has been affected on the revenue front  mainly in the medical publishing but to some extent  in the erm  in the financial sector  although we're still absolutely market dominant in that sector  but we've increased the circulation there by ten percent.
"The F T magazines have all increased their market share  and Profile, our electronic, er  erm, information business has grown in revenue terms by twelve percent."
"Turning to Westminster Press  the cost  Westminster Press in a full year  er, will amount to three point eight million pounds  and er ."
"all of our paid fors have  er, done very well  this year in circulation terms  all but two of them have increased their circulation in the first half, despite quite high price rises, for instance the York county newspaper, the weekly there, we have a daily but the weekly there went up by five P  and the weekly in Bath where again we have a daily  that went up by six P."
And every single Westminster Press centre has increased its market share.
Turning to er books  and starting with Longman.
"Well there  as I mentioned a staff reduction of a hundred and ninety two  and significant er staff reduct er cost reduction in other, other areas  we, we analyze every single er publishing unit and where the erm  where they were marginally profitable or less than marginally profitable  er  we've taken appropriate action."
And as I mentioned earlier  Longman expect the cash flow this year to be better than last year despite the  the reduction in profits.
"Last year I told you Alhambra er, was receiving the treatment."
"This year it's on profit, on budget at the half-way stage  and I expect it to be on budget by the end of the year."
"We mentioned a small acquisition in Japan last year,medi on the medical side of Longman, P P S K K  it cost us about four million pounds and we were reckoning on a profit of about half a million a year   pleased to say that its er, its profit looks like getting to a million pounds by the year end."
And English Language Teaching at Longman which is of course the biggest er  biggest profit contributor  erm  their blueprint sale is expected to exceed nine hundred thousand this year.
"Addison Wesley our American college publisher  as Michael mentioned th at the half-way stage their sales were eleven percent ahead of er, last year, and you may remember last year they had record sales and record profits  and er  they're forecasting  er something like fourteen percent a head by the year end in sales terms  and they are expecting to maintain their  their margins  and last year was a very good margin indeed."
Once again there's been great emphasis on  cash maintenance.
"Penguin  the staff reduction there doesn't look particularly er high but then we were reducing staff there last year  and we've er, we've disposed of Smithmark and the travel guides  er, the  warehouse and distribution system is working very well and we've been adding distribu distribution clients there  er  the autumn list looks very strong indeed particularly in the U S especially  and er, we've shipped  er, over two million of Stephen King's latest book  and there's another one due in the autumn and we're expecting to ship about two and a half million of er  of, of that one."
"Er  in the U K we've held our market position and it's been a  a pretty desperate market  we were one of the  few if not the only book seller who refused to er  to yield better discount terms  er, on the threat of er  every, every book seller was every er publisher was threatened with erm not being stocked unless we gave bigger discounts."
"We held our position against that and I'm pleased to say  er, we will continue, we will continue to be stocked."
"Er  our distribution system has got great press recently and it's regarded as one of the three best distribution systems in the U K. One of the things we're trying to do is to pay less for our books, it's very easy to pay very very fancy prices for, for  er  mid-range authors and for them not to earn out, so we're looking for much cheaper books."
A good example is Dances With Wolves which cost us four thousand  as a and has already sold over a hundred and twenty thousand copies.
Penguin continues to try and develop its merchandising  and is quite successful and the latest success is to get the Flower Fairies adopted by Marks and Spencers for their  sleepwear range which will also be marketed in the U S A as well.
Federal and Capital is a small  er  but high quality er  new er newsletter business in the States and er  it's done very well indeed to improve its profits.
"On the entertainments side  er, last year of course we had that one-off benefit with not having to absorb the first quarter's loss  and this year the er  first quarter  was pretty disastrous because we had an er er an er amalgamation of, of A the Gulf War  B the recession  and in London I R A bombing  and that really stopped tourists coming to London  from overseas and from the rest of the U K. But I'm pleased to say that er  we, we're coming back very strongly  and for instance in July  at virtually all of our centres attendances were either up to last year  very nearl very nearly up to last year  or ahead of last year  and er  at Chessington our revenue was thirteen and a half percent up on last year  which I think justifies our investment there."
Some of our competitors in the north have been er  really struggling and erm  offering four pounds off on a seven pound fifty entrance fee  so  bearing that in mind we're v v very confident that we've im improved our market share  in that area too.
"We opened our Amsterdam, our new exhibition in Amsterdam in June  and er, up to now audiences have flocked there  many weeks they've been thirty percent ahead of er  ahead of budget."
Moving on to B Sky B  well it's making excellent progress  by the end of July we had over two point three million homes connected  and over half of those are subscribing to one or two movie channels.
Costs are well down and will continue to fall  and I'm more confident than ever that we're on to a winner.
"If we move to oil  well our oil business obviously operates in a cycle different to our publishing businesses  and er, at the end of the first half it had record sales and profits  fifteen percent ahead in dollar terms  ten percent ahead in, in sterling terms which may surprise you slightly, but I think James probably will talk about that later."
"Then the mink crept up to him and stabbed him to the heart with his knife , and he died without moving ."
"After that he landed on the beach , skinned the wolf , and taking the skin to his cottage , he hung it up before the fire to dry ."
"Not many days later the wolf 's grandmother , who , with the help of her relations , had been searching for him everywhere , entered the cottage to buy some sea-urchins ' eggs , and saw the skin , which she at once guessed to be that of her grandson . '"
I knew he was dead -- I knew it !
I knew it ! '
"she cried , weeping bitterly , till the mink told her rudely that if she wanted to make so much noise she had better do it outside as he liked to be quiet ."
"So , half-blinded by her tears , the old woman went home the way she had come , and running in at the door , she flung herself down in front of the fire ."
` What are you crying for ? '
asked the old wolf and some friends who had been spending the afternoon with him . '
I shall never see my grandson any more ! '
answered she .
"` Mink has killed him , oh !"
oh ! '
"And putting her head down , she began to weep as loudly as ever ."
` There !
there ! '
"said her husband , laying his paw on her shoulder ."
"` Be comforted ; if he IS dead , we will avenge him . '"
And calling to the others they proceeded to talk over the best plan .
"It took them a long time to make up their minds , as one wolf proposed one thing and one another ; but at last it was agreed that the old wolf should give a great feast in his house , and that the mink should be invited to the party ."
And in order that no time should be lost it was further agreed that each wolf should bear the invitations to the guests that lived nearest to him .
"Now the wolves thought they were very cunning , but the mink was more cunning still ; and though he sent a message by a white hare , that was going that way , saying he should be delighted to be present , he determined that he would take his precautions ."
"So he went to a mouse who had often done him a good turn , and greeted her with his best bow . '"
"I have a favour to ask of you , friend mouse , ' said he , ` and if you will grant it I will carry you on my back every night for a week to the patch of maize right up the hill . '"
"` The favour is mine , ' answered the mouse ."
` Tell me what it is that I can have the honour of doing for you . '
"` Oh , something quite easy , ' replied the mink . '"
"I only want you -- between to-day and the next full moon -- to gnaw through the bows and paddles of the wolf people , so that directly they use them they will break ."
But of course you must manage it so that they notice nothing . '
"` Of course , ' answered the mouse , ` nothing is easier ; but as the full moon is to-morrow night , and there is not much time , I had better begin at once . '"
"Then the mink thanked her , and went his way ; but before he had gone far he came back again ."
"` Perhaps , while you are about the wolf 's house seeing after the bows , it would do no harm if you were to make that knot-hole in the wall a little bigger , ' said he ."
"`` Oh , that is the postmaster 's son , '' said Alan disappointedly ."
`` That puts us further off the scent than ever .
The letter was probably dropped in the box at the office and there will consequently be no way of tracing the writer . ''
"`` Well , I ca n't tell you anything more , '' said Emily ."
`` You 'll have to ask Lynde for the truth . ''
This Alan was determined to do whenever he should meet her .
"He did not go to the house with Emily but wandered about the shore , watching for Lynde and not seeing her ."
"At length he went home , a prey to stormy emotions ."
He realized at last that he loved Lynde Oliver .
He wondered how he could have been so long blind to it .
He knew that he must have loved her ever since he had first seen her .
The discovery amazed but did not shock him .
There was no reason why he should not love her -- should not woo and win her for his wife if she cared for him .
She was good and sweet and true .
Anything of doubt in her antecedents could not touch her .
"Probably the world would look upon Captain Anthony as a somewhat undesirable father-in-law for a minister , but that aspect of the question did not disturb Alan ."
"As for the trouble of the letter , he felt sure he would easily be able to clear it away ."
Probably some malicious busybody had become aware of his frequent calls at Four Winds and chose to interfere in his private affairs thus .
For the first time it occurred to him that there had been a certain lack of cordiality among his people of late .
"If it were really so , doubtless this was the reason ."
At any other time this would have been of moment to him .
But now his thoughts were too wholly taken up with Lynde and the estrangement on her part to attach much importance to anything else .
What she thought mattered incalculably more to Alan than what all the people in Rexton put together thought .
"He had the right , like any other man , to woo the woman of his choice and he would certainly brook no outside interference in the matter ."
After a sleepless night he went back to Four Winds in the morning .
Lynde would not expect him at that time and he would have more chance of finding her .
"The result justified his idea , for he met her by the spring ."
Alan felt shocked at the change in her appearance .
She looked as if years of suffering had passed over her .
"Her lips were pallid , and hollow circles under her eyes made them appear unnaturally large ."
He had last left the girl in the bloom of her youth ; he found her again a woman on whom life had laid its heavy hand .
"A burning flood of colour swept over her face as they met , then receded as quickly , leaving her whiter than before ."
"The ground became more and more uneven , full of pits and hillocks ."
"And with every step of the ascent the wind still blew the shriller , and the trees bent before the gusts like fishing-rods ."
"They had just entered one of the clearings , when Dick suddenly clapped down upon his face among the brambles , and began to crawl slowly backward towards the shelter of the grove ."
"Matcham , in great bewilderment , for he could see no reason for this flight , still imitated his companion 's course ; and it was not until they had gained the harbour of a thicket that he turned and begged him to explain ."
"For all reply , Dick pointed with his finger ."
"At the far end of the clearing , a fir grew high above the neighbouring wood , and planted its black shock of foliage clear against the sky ."
For about fifty feet above the ground the trunk grew straight and solid like a column .
"At that level , it split into two massive boughs ; and in the fork , like a mast-headed seaman , there stood a man in a green tabard , spying far and wide ."
"The sun glistened upon his hair ; with one hand he shaded his eyes to look abroad , and he kept slowly rolling his head from side to side , with the regularity of a machine ."
The lads exchanged glances .
"`` Let us try to the left , '' said Dick ."
"`` We had near fallen foully , Jack . ''"
Ten minutes afterwards they struck into a beaten path .
"`` Here is a piece of forest that I know not , '' Dick remarked ."
`` Where goeth me this track ? ''
"`` Let us even try , '' said Matcham ."
"A few yards further , the path came to the top of a ridge and began to go down abruptly into a cup-shaped hollow ."
"At the foot , out of a thick wood of flowering hawthorn , two or three roofless gables , blackened as if by fire , and a single tall chimney marked the ruins of a house ."
`` What may this be ? ''
whispered Matcham .
"`` Nay , by the mass , I know not , '' answered Dick ."
`` I am all at sea .
Let us go warily . ''
"With beating hearts , they descended through the hawthorns ."
"Here and there , they passed signs of recent cultivation ; fruit trees and pot herbs ran wild among the thicket ; a sun-dial had fallen in the grass ; it seemed they were treading what once had been a garden ."
Yet a little farther and they came forth before the ruins of the house .
It had been a pleasant mansion and a strong .
"A dry ditch was dug deep about it ; but it was now choked with masonry , and bridged by a fallen rafter ."
"The two farther walls still stood , the sun shining through their empty windows ; but the remainder of the building had collapsed , and now lay in a great cairn of ruin , grimed with fire ."
Already in the interior a few plants were springing green among the chinks .
"`` Now I bethink me , '' whispered Dick , `` this must be Grimstone ."
It was a hold of one Simon Malmesbury ; Sir Daniel was his bane !
"And for the exposure -- if ye were an ugly hunchback , and the children gecked at you upon the street , ye would count your body cheaper , and an hour of glory worth a life ."
"Howbeit , if ye will , let us ride on and visit the other posts ."
"Sir Richard here , my namesake , he shall still hold this entry , where he wadeth to the ankles in hot blood ."
Him can we trust .
"But mark it , Sir Richard , ye are not yet done ."
The worst is yet to ward .
Sleep not . ''
"He came right up to young Shelton , looking him hard in the eyes , and taking his hand in both of his , gave it so extreme a squeeze that the blood had nearly spurted ."
Dick quailed before his eyes .
"The insane excitement , the courage , and the cruelty that he read therein filled him with dismay about the future ."
"This young duke 's was indeed a gallant spirit , to ride foremost in the ranks of war ; but after the battle , in the days of peace and in the circle of his trusted friends , that mind , it was to be dreaded , would continue to bring forth the fruits of death ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE BATTLE OF SHOREBY -LRB- Concluded -RRB- Dick , once more left to his own counsels , began to look about him ."
The arrow-shot had somewhat slackened .
"On all sides the enemy were falling back ; and the greater part of the market-place was now left empty , the snow here trampled into orange mud , there splashed with gore , scattered all over with dead men and horses , and bristling thick with feathered arrows ."
On his own side the loss had been cruel .
"The jaws of the little street and the ruins of the barricade were heaped with the dead and dying ; and out of the hundred men with whom he had begun the battle , there were not seventy left who could still stand to arms ."
"At the same time , the day was passing ."
"The first reinforcements might be looked for to arrive at any moment ; and the Lancastrians , already shaken by the result of their desperate but unsuccessful onslaught , were in an ill temper to support a fresh invader ."
"There was a dial in the wall of one of the two flanking houses ; and this , in the frosty winter sunshine , indicated ten of the forenoon ."
"Dick turned to the man who was at his elbow , a little insignificant archer , binding a cut in his arm ."
"`` It was well fought , '' he said , `` and , by my sooth , they will not charge us twice . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said the little archer , `` ye have fought right well for York , and better for yourself ."
Never hath man in so brief space prevailed so greatly on the duke 's affections .
That he should have entrusted such a post to one he knew not is a marvel .
"But look to your head , Sir Richard !"
"If ye be vanquished -- ay , if ye give way one foot 's breadth -- axe or cord shall punish it ; and I am set if ye do aught doubtful , I will tell you honestly , here to stab you from behind . ''"
Dick looked at the little man in amaze .
`` You ! ''
he cried .
`` And from behind ! ''
"`` It is right so , '' returned the archer ; `` and because I like not the affair I tell it you ."
"Ye must make the post good , Sir Richard , at your peril ."
"There he sat , lighted up by the flames from the burning house opposite , both hands holding tightly on his red cap , in which lay the treasure ; and now he knew what his heart really valued most -- to whom he really belonged ."
"But when the fire was put out , and the Goblin thought it over -- then -- ' I will divide myself between the two , ' he said . '"
"I can not quite give up the grocer , because of the jam ! '"
And it is just the same with us .
We also can not quite give up the grocer -- because of the jam .
The House in the Wood From the German of Grimm .
A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the borders of a great forest .
"One morning as he was going to his work , he said to his wife , ` Let our eldest daughter bring me my lunch into the wood ; and so that she shall not lose her way , I will take a bag of millet with me , and sprinkle the seed on the path . '"
"When the sun had risen high over the forest , the girl set out with a basin of soup ."
"But the field and wood sparrows , the larks and finches , blackbirds and green finches had picked up the millet long ago , and the girl could not find her way ."
"She went on and on , till the sun set and night came on ."
"The trees rustled in the darkness , the owls hooted , and she began to be very much frightened ."
Then she saw in tile distance a light that twinkled between the trees .
"` There must be people living yonder , ' she thought , ` who will take me in for the night , ' and she began walking towards it ."
Not long afterwards she came to a house with lights in the windows .
"She knocked at the door , and a gruff voice called , ` Come in ! '"
"The girl stepped into the dark entrance , and tapped at the door of the room ."
"` Just walk in , ' cried the voice , and when she opened the door there sat an old gray-haired man at the table ."
"His face was resting on his hands , and his white beard flowed over the table almost down to the ground ."
"By the stove lay three beasts , a hen , a cock , and a brindled cow ."
"The girl told the old man her story , and asked for a night 's lodging ."
"The man said : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"` Duks , ' answered the beasts ; and that must have meant , ` We are quite willing , ' for the old man went on , ` Here is abundance ; go into the back kitchen and cook us a supper . '"
"The girl found plenty of everything in the kitchen , and cooked a good meal , but she did not think of the beasts ."
"She placed the full dishes on the table , sat down opposite the gray-haired man , and ate till her hunger was appeased ."
"When she was satisfied , she said , ` But now I am so tired , where is a bed in which I can sleep ? '"
"The beasts answered : You have eaten with him , You have drunk with him , Of us you have not thought , Sleep then as you ought !"
"Then the old man said , ` Go upstairs , and there you will find a bedroom ; shake the bed , and put clean sheets on , and go to sleep . '"
"The maiden went upstairs , and when she had made the bed , she lay down ."
"After some time the gray-haired man came , looked at her by the light of his candle , and shook his head ."
"And when he saw that she was sound asleep , he opened a trapdoor and let her fall into the cellar ."
"The woodcutter came home late in the evening , and reproached his wife for leaving him all day without food ."
So he bade them farewell and set out .
"For three days he wandered by the most out-of-the-way paths , but no signs of a tower were to be seen anywhere ."
"On the fourth morning it was just the same , and , filled with despair , he flung himself on the ground under a tree and hid his face in his hands ."
"In a little while he heard a rustling over his head , and looking up , he saw a turtle dove watching him with her bright eyes ."
` Oh dove ! '
"cried the boy , addressing the bird in her own language , ` Oh dove !"
"tell me , I pray you , where is the castle of Come-and-never-go ? '"
"` Poor child , ' answered the dove , ` who has sent you on such a useless quest ? '"
"` My good or evil fortune , ' replied the boy , ' I know not which . '"
"` To get there , ' said the dove , ` you must follow the wind , which to-day is blowing towards the castle . '"
"The boy thanked her , and followed the wind , fearing all the time that it might change its direction and lead him astray ."
But the wind seemed to feel pity for him and blew steadily on .
"With each step the country became more and more dreary , but at nightfall the child could see behind the dark and bare rocks something darker still ."
"This was the tower in which dwelt the witch ; and seizing the knocker he gave three loud knocks , which were echoed in the hollows of the rocks around ."
"The door opened slowly , and there appeared on the threshold an old woman holding up a candle to her face , which was so hideous that the boy involuntarily stepped backwards , almost as frightened by the troop of lizards , beetles and such creatures that surrounded her , as by the woman herself ."
` Who are you who dare to knock at my door and wake me ? '
cried she .
"` Be quick and tell me what you want , or it will be the worse for you . '"
"` Madam , ' answered the child , ' I believe that you alone know the way to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and I pray you to show it to me . '"
"` Very good , ' replied the witch , with something that she meant for a smile , ` but to-day it is late ."
To-morrow you shall go .
"Now enter , and you shall sleep with my lizards . ' '"
"I can not stay , ' said he . '"
"I must go back at once , so as to reach the road from which I started before day dawns . '"
"` If I tell you , will you promise me that you will bring me this jar full of the many-coloured water from the spring in the court-yard of the castle ? '"
asked she .
` If you fail to keep your word I will change you into a lizard for ever . ' '
"I promise , ' answered the boy ."
"Then the old woman called to a very thin dog , and said to him : ` Conduct this pig of a child to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and take care that you warn my friend of his arrival . '"
"And the dog arose and shook itself , and set out ."
"At the end of two hours they stopped in front of a large castle , big and black and gloomy , whose doors stood wide open , although neither sound nor light gave sign of any presence within ."
"The dog , however , seemed to know what to expect , and , after a wild howl , went on ; but the boy , who was uncertain whether this was the quarter of an hour when the giant was asleep , hesitated to follow him , and paused for a moment under a wild olive that grew near by , the only tree which he had beheld since he had parted from the dove ."
Then I tell myself ` mere coincidence ' -- ` subconscious memory ' and so forth . ''
"`` I do not see how any memory could remember a thing before it was ever said at all , '' persisted Susan , `` though of course I am not educated like you and the doctor ."
"I would rather not be , if it makes anything as simple as that so hard to believe ."
"But in any case we need not worry over Verdun , even if the Huns get it ."
Joffre says it has no military significance . ''
"`` That old sop of comfort has been served up too often already when reverses came , '' retorted Gertrude ."
`` It has lost its power to charm . ''
`` Was there ever a battle like this in the world before ? ''
"said Mr. Meredith , one evening in mid-April ."
"`` It 's such a titanic thing we ca n't grasp it , '' said the doctor ."
`` What were the scraps of a few Homeric handfuls compared to this ?
The whole Trojan war might be fought around a Verdun fort and a newspaper correspondent would give it no more than a sentence .
I am not in the confidence of the occult powers '' -- the doctor threw Gertrude a twinkle -- `` but I have a hunch that the fate of the whole war hangs on the issue of Verdun .
"As Susan and Joffre say , it has no real military significance ; but it has the tremendous significance of an Idea ."
If Germany wins there she will win the war .
"If she loses , the tide will set against her . ''"
"`` Lose she will , '' said Mr. Meredith : emphatically ."
`` The Idea can not be conquered .
France is certainly very wonderful .
It seems to me that in her I see the white form of civilization making a determined stand against the black powers of barbarism .
I think our whole world realizes this and that is why we all await the issue so breathlessly .
It is n't merely the question of a few forts changing hands or a few miles of blood-soaked ground lost and won . ''
"`` I wonder , '' said Gertrude dreamily , `` if some great blessing , great enough for the price , will be the meed of all our pain ?"
Is the agony in which the world is shuddering the birth-pang of some wondrous new era ?
Or is it merely a futile struggle of ants In the gleam of a million million of suns ?
"We think very lightly , Mr. Meredith , of a calamity which destroys an ant-hill and half its inhabitants ."
Does the Power that runs the universe think us of more importance than we think ants ? ''
"`` You forget , '' said Mr. Meredith , with a flash of his dark eyes , `` that an infinite Power must be infinitely little as well as infinitely great ."
"We are neither , therefore there are things too little as well as too great for us to apprehend ."
To the infinitely little an ant is of as much importance as a mastodon .
"We are witnessing the birth-pangs of a new era -- but it will be born a feeble , wailing life like everything else ."
I am not one of those who expect a new heaven and a new earth as the immediate result of this war .
"till you wondered that it was not out of breath , or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage ."
"`` Now , that bird , '' he would say , `` is , maybe , two hundred years old , Hawkins -- they live forever mostly ; and if anybody 's seen more wickedness , it must be the devil himself ."
"She 's sailed with England , the great Cap'n England , the pirate ."
"She 's been at Madagascar , and at Malabar , and Surinam , and Providence , and Portobello ."
She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships .
"It 's there she learned ` Pieces of eight , ' and little wonder ; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em , Hawkins !"
"She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa , she was ; and to look at her you would think she was a babby ."
"But you smelt powder -- did n't you , cap'n ? ''"
"`` Stand by to go about , '' the parrot would scream ."
"`` Ah , she 's a handsome craft , she is , '' the cook would say , and give her sugar from his pocket , and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on , passing belief for wickedness ."
"`` There , '' John would add , `` you ca n't touch pitch and not be mucked , lad ."
"Here 's this poor old innocent bird o ' mine swearing blue fire , and none the wiser , you may lay to that ."
"She would swear the same , in a manner of speaking , before chaplain . ''"
And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men .
"In the meantime , the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another ."
The squire made no bones about the matter ; he despised the captain .
"The captain , on his part , never spoke but when he was spoken to , and then sharp and short and dry , and not a word wasted ."
"He owned , when driven into a corner , that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew , that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well ."
"As for the ship , he had taken a downright fancy to her ."
"`` She 'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife , sir ."
"But , '' he would add , `` all I say is , we 're not home again , and I do n't like the cruise . ''"
"The squire , at this , would turn away and march up and down the deck , chin in air ."
"`` A trifle more of that man , '' he would say , `` and I shall explode . ''"
"We had some heavy weather , which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA ."
"Every man on board seemed well content , and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise , for it is my belief there was never a ship 's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea ."
"Double grog was going on the least excuse ; there was duff on odd days , as , for instance , if the squire heard it was any man 's birthday , and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy ."
"`` Never knew good come of it yet , '' the captain said to Dr. Livesey ."
"`` Spoil forecastle hands , make devils ."
That 's my belief . ''
"But good did come of the apple barrel , as you shall hear , for if it had not been for that , we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery ."
This was how it came about .
We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after -- I am not allowed to be more plain -- and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night .
"'T was Bennet Hatch that burned it , now five years agone ."
"In sooth , 't was pity , for it was a fair house . ''"
"Down in the hollow , where no wind blew , it was both warm and still ; and Matcham , laying one hand upon Dick 's arm , held up a warning finger ."
`` Hist ! ''
he said .
"Then came a strange sound , breaking on the quiet ."
It was twice repeated ere they recognised its nature .
"It was the sound of a big man clearing his throat ; and just then a hoarse , untuneful voice broke into singing ."
"`` Then up and spake the master , the king of the outlaws : ` What make ye here , my merry men , among the greenwood shaws ? '"
"And Gamelyn made answer -- he looked never adown : ` O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town ! ' ''"
"The singer paused , a faint clink of iron followed , and then silence ."
The two lads stood looking at each other .
"Whoever he might be , their invisible neighbour was just beyond the ruin ."
"And suddenly the colour came into Matcham 's face , and next moment he had crossed the fallen rafter , and was climbing cautiously on the huge pile of lumber that filled the interior of the roofless house ."
"Dick would have withheld him , had he been in time ; as it was , he was fain to follow ."
"Right in the corner of the ruin , two rafters had fallen crosswise , and protected a clear space no larger than a pew in church ."
Into this the lads silently lowered themselves .
"There they were perfectly concealed , and through an arrow-loophole commanded a view upon the farther side ."
"Peering through this , they were struck stiff with terror at their predicament ."
To retreat was impossible ; they scarce dared to breathe .
"Upon the very margin of the ditch , not thirty feet from where they crouched , an iron caldron bubbled and steamed above a glowing fire ; and close by , in an attitude of listening , as though he had caught some sound of their clambering among the ruins , a tall , red-faced , battered-looking man stood poised , an iron spoon in his right hand , a horn and a formidable dagger at his belt ."
"Plainly this was the singer ; plainly he had been stirring the caldron , when some incautious step among the lumber had fallen upon his ear ."
"A little further off , another man lay slumbering , rolled in a brown cloak , with a butterfly hovering above his face ."
"All this was in a clearing white with daisies ; and at the extreme verge , a bow , a sheaf of arrows , and part of a deer 's carcase , hung upon a flowering hawthorn ."
"Presently the fellow relaxed from his attitude of attention , raised the spoon to his mouth , tasted its contents , nodded , and then fell again to stirring and singing . ''"
"` O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town , ' '' he croaked , taking up his song where he had left it ."
"`` O , sir , we walk not here at all an evil thing to do ."
But if we meet with the good king 's deer to shoot a shaft into . ''
"Still as he sang , he took from time to time , another spoonful of the broth , blew upon it , and tasted it , with all the airs of an experienced cook ."
"At length , apparently , he judged the mess was ready ; for taking the horn from his girdle , he blew three modulated calls ."
"The other fellow awoke , rolled over , brushed away the butterfly , and looked about him ."
"`` How now , brother ? ''"
"`` We 'll never get ashore at this rate , '' said I. `` If it 's the only course that we can lie , sir , we must even lie it , '' returned the captain ."
`` We must keep upstream .
"You see , sir , '' he went on , `` if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place , it 's hard to say where we should get ashore , besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs ; whereas , the way we go the current must slacken , and then we can dodge back along the shore . ''"
"`` The current 's less a ` ready , sir , '' said the man Gray , who was sitting in the fore-sheets ; `` you can ease her off a bit . ''"
"`` Thank you , my man , '' said I , quite as if nothing had happened , for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves ."
"Suddenly the captain spoke up again , and I thought his voice was a little changed ."
`` The gun ! ''
said he .
"`` I have thought of that , '' said I , for I made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort ."
"`` They could never get the gun ashore , and if they did , they could never haul it through the woods . ''"
"`` Look astern , doctor , '' replied the captain ."
"We had entirely forgotten the long nine ; and there , to our horror , were the five rogues busy about her , getting off her jacket , as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed ."
"Not only that , but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind , and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad ."
"`` Israel was Flint 's gunner , '' said Gray hoarsely ."
"At any risk , we put the boat 's head direct for the landing-place ."
"By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing , and I could keep her steady for the goal ."
But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door .
I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck .
`` Who 's the best shot ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` Mr. Trelawney , out and away , '' said I. `` Mr. Trelawney , will you please pick me off one of these men , sir ?"
"Hands , if possible , '' said the captain ."
Trelawney was as cool as steel .
He looked to the priming of his gun .
"`` Now , '' cried the captain , `` easy with that gun , sir , or you 'll swamp the boat ."
All hands stand by to trim her when he aims . ''
"The squire raised his gun , the rowing ceased , and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance , and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop ."
"They had the gun , by this time , slewed round upon the swivel , and Hands , who was at the muzzle with the rammer , was in consequence the most exposed ."
"However , we had no luck , for just as Trelawney fired , down he stooped , the ball whistled over him , and it was one of the other four who fell ."
"The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore , and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats ."
"`` Here come the gigs , sir , '' said I. `` Give way , then , '' cried the captain ."
`` We must n't mind if we swamp her now .
"It was because his boat had got wedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice , through which he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle ."
"The fairies had as yet scarcely missed him , for they could not dance , so heavy were their hearts ."
"They forget all the steps when they are sad , and remember them again when they are merry ."
"David tells me that fairies never say , ` We feel happy ' : what they say is , ` We feel dancey . '"
"Well , they were looking very undancey indeed , when sudden laughter broke out among the onlookers , caused by Brownie , who had just arrived and was insisting on her right to be presented to the Duke ."
"Maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared , though she had really no hope ; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie herself , who , however , was absolutely confident ."
"She was led before his grace , and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart , which for convenience ' sake was reached by a little trap-door in his diamond shirt , had begun to say mechanically , ` Cold , qui -- , ' when he stopped abruptly ."
` What 's this ? '
"he cried , and first he shook the heart like a watch , and then he put his ear to it ."
` Bless my soul ! '
"cried the doctor , and by this time of course the excitement among the spectators was tremendous , fairies fainting right and left ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They warned her -RSB- Everybody stared breathlessly at the Duke , who was very much startled , and looked as if he would like to run away ."
` Good gracious me ! '
"the doctor was heard muttering , and now the heart was evidently on fire , for he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth ."
The suspense was awful .
"Then in a loud voice , and bowing low , ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love . '"
You ca n't conceive the effect of it .
"Brownie held out her arms to the Duke and he flung himself into them , the Queen leapt into the arms of the Lord Chamberlain , and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen , for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything ."
"Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place , for if you leap into each other 's arms it is a fairy wedding ."
Of course a clergyman has to be present .
How the crowd cheered and leapt !
"Trumpets brayed , the moon came out , and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring ."
"Most gladsome sight of all , the Cupids plucked the hated fools ' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air ."
And then Maimie went and spoiled everything .
She could n't help it .
"She was crazy with delight over her little friend 's good fortune , so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy , ' O Brownie , how splendid ! '"
"Everybody stood still , the music ceased , the lights went out , and all in the time you may take to say , ` Oh dear ! '"
"An awful sense of her peril came upon Maimie ; too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates ; she heard the murmur of an angry multitude ; she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood , and she uttered a cry of terror and fled ."
How she ran !
and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head .
"Many times she lay down , and then quickly jumped up and ran on again ."
Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the Gardens .
asked Jose .
"But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call the little fish whose life you saved , and she will bring it to you . '"
"So he called to the fish , and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones , and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring , and brought it to Jose in its mouth ."
"Well pleased with all he had done , Jose returned to the palace ; but when the king took the precious objects to Bella-Flor , she declared that she would never open her door till the bandit who had carried her off had been fried in oil . '"
"I am very sorry , ' said the king to Jose , ' I really would rather not ; but you see I have no choice . '"
"While the oil was being heated in the great caldron , Jose went to the stables to inquire of his friend the horse if there was no way for him to escape ."
"` Do not be frightened , ' said the horse ."
"` Get on my back , and I will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration , then rub it all over your skin , and no matter how hot the oil may be you will never feel it . '"
"Jose did not ask any more questions , but did as the horse bade him ; and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil ."
He was left there till Bella-Flor cried that he must be cooked enough .
"Then out came a youth so young and handsome , that everyone fell in love with him , and Bella-Flor most of all ."
"As for the old king , he saw that he had lost the game ; and in despair he flung himself into the caldron , and was fried instead of Jose ."
"Then Jose was proclaimed king , on condition that he married Bella-Flor which he promised to do the next day ."
"But first he went to the stables and sought out the horse , and said to him : ` It is to you that I owe my life and my crown ."
Why have you done all this for me ? '
And the horse answered : ' I am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune .
"And when I saw you in danger of death I begged that I might help you , as you had helped me ."
"For , as I told you , Good deeds bear their own fruit ! '"
"The Bird of Truth -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones , y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-"
"Once upon a time there lived a poor fisher who built a hut on the banks of a stream which , shunning the glare of the sun and the noise of the towns , flowed quietly past trees and under bushes , listening to the songs of the birds overhead ."
"One day , when the fisherman had gone out as usual to cast his nets , he saw borne towards him on the current a cradle of crystal ."
Slipping his net quickly beneath it he drew it out and lifted the silk coverlet .
"Inside , lying on a soft bed of cotton , were two babies , a boy and a girl , who opened their eyes and smiled at him ."
"The man was filled with pity at the sight , and throwing down his lines he took the cradle and the babies home to his wife ."
The good woman flung up her hands in despair when she beheld the contents of the cradle .
"` Are not eight children enough , ' she cried , ` without bringing us two more ?"
How do you think we can feed them ? '
"` You would not have had me leave them to die of hunger , ' answered he , ` or be swallowed up by the waves of the sea ?"
What is enough for eight is also enough for ten . '
The wife said no more ; and in truth her heart yearned over the little creatures .
"Somehow or other food was never lacking in the hut , and the children grew up and were so good and gentle that , in time , their foster-parents loved them as well or better than their own , who were quarrelsome and envious ."
"It did not take the orphans long to notice that the boys did not like them , and were always playing tricks on them , so they used to go away by themselves and spend whole hours by the banks of the river ."
He was all her own and she knew that he found strength and comfort in her sympathy and understanding .
"It was very wonderful to know she meant so much to him -- the knowledge helped her through moments that would otherwise have been unendurable , and gave her power to smile -- and even to laugh a little ."
"When Walter had gone she might indulge in the comfort of tears , but not while he was here ."
"She would not even let herself cry at night , lest her eyes should betray her to him in the morning ."
"On his last evening at home they went together to Rainbow Valley and sat down on the bank of the brook , under the White Lady , where the gay revels of olden days had been held in the cloudless years ."
"Rainbow Valley was roofed over with a sunset of unusual splendour that night ; a wonderful grey dusk just touched with starlight followed it ; and then came moonshine , hinting , hiding , revealing , lighting up little dells and hollows here , leaving others in dark , velvet shadow ."
"`` When I am ` somewhere in France , ' '' said Walter , looking around him with eager eyes on all the beauty his soul loved , `` I shall remember these still , dewy , moon-drenched places ."
The balsam of the fir-trees ; the peace of those white pools of moonshine ; the ` strength of the hills ' -- what a beautiful old Biblical phrase that is .
Rilla !
"Look at those old hills around us -- the hills we looked up at as children , wondering what lay for us in the great world beyond them ."
How calm and strong they are -- how patient and changeless -- like the heart of a good woman .
"Rilla-my-Rilla , do you know what you have been to me the past year ?"
I want to tell you before I go .
"I could not have lived through it if it had not been for you , little loving , believing heart . ''"
Rilla dared not try to speak .
She slipped her hand into Walter 's and pressed it hard .
"`` And when I 'm over there , Rilla , in that hell upon earth which men who have forgotten God have made , it will be the thought of you that will help me most ."
I know you 'll be as plucky and patient as you have shown yourself to be this past year -- I 'm not afraid for you .
"I know that no matter what happens , you 'll be Rilla-my-Rilla -- no matter what happens . ''"
"Rilla repressed tear and sigh , but she could not repress a little shiver , and Walter knew that he had said enough ."
"After a moment of silence , in which each made an unworded promise to each other , he said , `` Now we wo n't be sober any more ."
We 'll look beyond the years -- to the time when the war will be over and Jem and Jerry and I will come marching home and we 'll all be happy again . ''
"`` We wo n't be -- happy -- in the same way , '' said Rilla ."
"`` No , not in the same way ."
Nobody whom this war has touched will ever be happy again in quite the same way .
"But it will be a better happiness , I think , little sister -- a happiness we 've earned ."
"We were very happy before the war , were n't we ?"
"With a home like Ingleside , and a father and mother like ours we could n't help being happy ."
But that happiness was a gift from life and love ; it was n't really ours -- life could take it back at any time .
It can never take away the happiness we win for ourselves in the way of duty .
I 've realised that since I went into khaki .
"In spite of my occasional funks , when I fall to living over things beforehand , I 've been happy since that night in May ."
`` Now you 've done it !
I 'll give you a good thrashing when I get back ! ''
"roared Gus , shaking his fist at Joe , who stood staring , half-pleased , half-scared , at what he had done ."
`` Are you really going to try it ? ''
"asked Gus , as they glided on with increasing speed , and he , too , felt the charm of such a novel adventure , though the consequences bid fair to be serious ."
"`` Yes , I am , '' answered Frank , with the grim look he always wore when his strong will got the upper hand ."
"`` Bill will give it to us , any way , so we may as well have our fun out ."
"If you are afraid , I 'll slow down and you can jump off , '' and his brown eyes sparkled with the double delight of getting his heart 's desire and astonishing his friend at the same time by his skill and coolness ."
`` Go ahead .
"I 'll jump when you do ; '' and Gus calmly sat down again , bound in honor to stand by his mate till the smash came , though rather dismayed at the audacity of the prank ."
`` Do n't you call this just splendid ? ''
"exclaimed Frank , as they rolled along over the crossing , past the bridge , toward the curve , a mile from the station ."
`` Not bad .
They are yelling like mad after us .
"Better go back , if you can , '' said Gus , who was anxiously peering out , and , in spite of his efforts to seem at ease , not enjoying the trip a particle ."
`` Let them yell .
"I started to go to the curve , and I 'll do it if it costs me a hundred dollars ."
"No danger ; there 's no train under twenty minutes , I tell you , '' and Frank pulled out his watch ."
"But the sun was in his eyes , and he did not see clearly , or he would have discovered that it was later than he thought ."
"On they went , and were just rounding the bend when a shrill whistle in front startled both boys , and drove the color out of their cheeks ."
`` It 's the factory train ! ''
"cried Gus , in a husky tone , as he sprang to his feet ."
"`` No ; it 's the five-forty on the other road , '' answered Frank , with a queer thrill all through him at the thought of what might happen if it was not ."
"Both looked straight ahead as the last tree glided by , and the long track lay before them , with the freight train slowly coming down ."
"For an instant , the boys stood as if paralyzed ."
`` Jump ! ''
"said Gus , looking at the steep bank on one side and the river on the other , undecided which to try ."
`` Sit still ! ''
"commanded Frank , collecting his wits , as he gave a warning whistle to retard the on-coming train , while he reversed the engine and went back faster than he came ."
"A crowd of angry men was waiting for them , and Bill stood at the open switch in a towering passion as No. 11 returned to her place unharmed , but bearing two pale and frightened boys , who stepped slowly and silently down , without a word to say for themselves , while the freight train rumbled by on the main track ."
"Frank and Gus never had a very clear idea as to what occurred during the next few minutes , but vaguely remembered being well shaken , sworn at , questioned , threatened with direful penalties , and finally ordered off the premises forever by the wrathful depot-master ."
"Joe was nowhere to be seen , and as the two culprits walked away , trying to go steadily , while their heads spun round , and all the strength seemed to have departed from their legs , Frank said , in an exhausted tone , -- `` Come down to the boat-house and rest a minute . ''"
"The land is still far distant , and without my help you would never get there ."
"Climb on my back , and I will take you where you will . '"
"Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice , and thankfully accepted his friend 's help ."
"But scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell , when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once , but go under the sea , and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there ."
"Uraschimataro agreed willingly , and in another moment they were deep , deep down , with fathoms of blue water above their heads ."
"Oh , how quickly they darted through the still , warm sea !"
"The young man held tight , and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel , but for three days they rushed on , till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace , shining with gold and silver , crystal and precious stones , and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls ."
"But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside , he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within , which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales ."
` Where have you brought me ? '
he asked his guide in a low voice .
"` To the palace of Ringu , the house of the sea god , whose subjects we all are , ' answered the turtle . '"
"I am the first waiting maid of his daughter , the lovely princess Otohime , whom you will shortly see . '"
"Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him , that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next ."
"But the turtle , who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him , went at once to make known his arrival ."
"And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him , and she begged him to stay with her , and in return promised that he should never grow old , neither should his beauty fade ."
` Is not that reward enough ? '
"she asked , smiling , looking all the while as fair as the sun itself ."
"And Uraschimataro said ` Yes , ' and so he stayed there ."
For how long ?
That he only knew later .
"His life passed by , and each hour seemed happier than the last , when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents ."
"He fought against it hard , knowing how it would grieve the princess , but it grew on him stronger and stronger , till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong ."
"Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home , and that he must see his parents once more ."
"The princess was almost frozen with horror , and implored him to stay with her , or something dreadful would be sure to happen ."
"` You will never come back , and we shall meet again no more , ' she moaned bitterly ."
"But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated , ` Only this once will I leave you , and then will I return to your side for ever . '"
"Sadly the princess shook her head , but she answered slowly , ` One way there is to bring you safely back , but I fear you will never agree to the conditions of the bargain . ' '"
"I will do anything that will bring me back to you , ' exclaimed Uraschimataro , looking at her tenderly , but the princess was silent : she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more ."
"Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box , and gave it to Uraschimataro , praying him to keep it carefully , and above all things never to open it ."
"` If you can do this , ' she said as she bade him farewell , ` your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore , and will carry you back to me . '"
"Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart , and swore solemnly to do her bidding ."
"He hid the box safely in his garments , seated himself on the back of the turtle , and vanished in the ocean path , waving his hand to the princess ."
"` Well , I was tired of stooping for the sticks , and was leaning against a tree to rest , when I heard a noise of ` sh - ` sh , among the dead leaves ."
"I thought perhaps it was a wolf , so I stood very still ."
But soon there came past a tall man -- oh !
"twice as tall as father -- with a long red beard and a red tunic fastened with a silver girdle , from which hung a silver-handled knife ."
"Behind him followed a great dog , which looked stronger than any wolf , or even a bear ."
"But why are you so pale , mother ? '"
"` It was the Stalo , ' replied she , her voice trembling ; ` Stalo the man-eater !"
"You did well to hide , or you might never had come back ."
"But , remember that , though he is so tall and strong , he is very stupid , and many a Lapp has escaped from his clutches by playing him some clever trick . '"
"Not long after the mother and son had held this talk , it began to be whispered in the forest that the children of an old man called Patto had vanished one by one , no one knew whither ."
"The unhappy father searched the country for miles round without being able to find as much as a shoe or a handkerchief , to show him where they had passed , but at length a little boy came with news that he had seen the Stalo hiding behind a well , near which the children used to play ."
"The boy had waited behind a clump of bushes to see what would happen , and by-and-by he noticed that the Stalo had laid a cunning trap in the path to the well , and that anybody who fell over it would roll into the water and drown there ."
"And , as he watched , Patto 's youngest daughter ran gaily down the path , till her foot caught in the strings that were stretched across the steepest place ."
"She slipped and fell , and in another instant had rolled into the water within reach of the Stalo ."
"As soon as Patto heard this tale his heart was filled with rage , and he vowed to have his revenge ."
"So he straightway took an old fur coat from the hook where it hung , and putting it on went out into the forest ."
"When he reached the path that led to the well he looked hastily round to be sure that no one was watching him , then laid himself down as if he had been caught in the snare and had rolled into the well , though he took care to keep his head out of the water ."
"Very soon he heard a ` sh - ` sh of the leaves , and there was the Stalo pushing his way through the undergrowth to see what chance he had of a dinner ."
"At the first glimpse of Patto 's head in the well he laughed loudly , crying : ` Ha !"
ha !
This time it is the old ass !
I wonder how he will taste ? '
"And drawing Patto out of the well , he flung him across his shoulders and carried him home ."
"Then he tied a cord round him and hung him over the fire to roast , while he finished a box that he was making before the door of the hut , which he meant to hold Patto 's flesh when it was cooked ."
"In a very short time the box was so nearly done that it only wanted a little more chipping out with an axe ; but this part of the work was easier accomplished indoors , and he called to one of his sons who were lounging inside to bring him the tool ."
"The young man looked everywhere , but he could not find the axe , for the very good reason that Patto had managed to pick it up and hide it in his clothes ."
` Stupid fellow !
what is the use of you ? '
"grumbled his father angrily ; and he bade first one and then another of his sons to fetch him the tool , but they had no better success than their brother . '"
"I must come myself , I suppose ! '"
"said Stalo , putting aside the box ."
"But , meanwhile , Patto had slipped from the hook and concealed himself behind the door , so that , as Stalo stepped in , his prisoner raised the axe , and with one blow the ogre 's head was rolling on the ground ."
"` Spare me a morsel , Ardan son of Gorla , ' asked a raven , fluttering down towards him ."
"` Seek food elsewhere , O bearer of ill-news , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ` it is but little I have for myself . '"
"And he stretched himself out for a few moments , then rose to his feet again ."
"On and on went he till the little birds flew to their nests , and the brightness died out of the sky , and a darkness fell over the earth ."
"On and on , and on , till at last he saw a beam of light streaming from a house and hastened towards it ."
"The door was opened and he entered , but paused when he beheld an old man lying on a bench by the fire , while seated opposite him was a maiden combing out the locks of her golden hair with a comb of silver ."
"` Welcome , fair youth , ' said the old man , turning his head ."
"` Sit down and warm yourself , and tell me how fares the outer world ."
It is long since I have seen it . '
"` All my news is that I am seeking service , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ' I have come from far since sunrise , and glad was I to see the rays of your lamp stream into the darkness . ' '"
"I need someone to herd my three dun cows , which are hornless , ' said the old man ."
"` If , for the space of a year , you can bring them back to me each evening before the sun sets , I will make you payment that will satisfy your soul . '"
But here the girl looked up and answered quickly : ` Ill will come of it if he listens to your offer . '
"` Counsel unsought is worth nothing , ' replied , rudely , Ardan son of Gorla ."
` It would be little indeed that I am fit for if I can not drive three cows out to pasture and keep them safe from the wolves that may come down from the mountains .
"Therefore , good father , I will take service with you at daybreak , and ask no payment till the new year dawns . '"
"Next morning the bell of the deer was not heard amongst the fern before the maiden with the hair of gold had milked the cows , and led them in front of the cottage where the old man and Ardan son of Gorla awaited them ."
"` Let them wander where they will , ' he said to his servant , ` and never seek to turn them from their way , for well they know the fields of good pasture ."
"But take heed to follow always behind them , and suffer nothing that you see , and nought that you hear , to draw you into leaving them ."
"Now go , and may wisdom go with you . '"
"As he ceased speaking he touched one of the cows on her forehead , and she stepped along the path , with the two others one on each side ."
"As he had been bidden , behind them came Ardan son of Gorla , rejoicing in his heart that work so easy had fallen to his lot ."
"At the year 's end , thought he , enough money would lie in his pocket to carry him into far countries where his sister might be , and , in the meanwhile , someone might come past who could give him tidings of her ."
"Thus he spoke to himself , when his eyes fell on a golden cock and a silver hen running swiftly along the grass in front of him ."
In a moment the words that the old man had uttered vanished from his mind and he gave chase .
"They were so near that he could almost seize their tails , yet each time he felt sure he could catch them his fingers closed on the empty air ."
"At length he could run no more , and stopped to breathe , while the cock and hen went on as before ."
"Then he remembered the cows , and , somewhat frightened , turned back to seek them ."
"Luckily they had not strayed far , and were quietly feeding on the thick green grass ."
"Ardan son of Gorla was sitting under a tree , when he beheld a staff of gold and a staff of silver doubling themselves in strange ways on the meadow in front of him , and starting up he hastened towards them ."
"He followed them till he was tired , but he could not catch them , though they seemed ever within his reach ."
"When at last he gave up the quest his knees trembled beneath him for very weariness , and glad was he to see a tree growing close by lade with fruits of different sorts , of which he ate greedily ."
"The sun was by now low in the heavens , and the cows left off feeding , and turned their faces home again , followed by Ardan son of Gorla ."
"At the door of their stable the maiden stood awaiting them , and saying nought to their herd , she sat down and began to milk ."
"But it was not milk that flowed into her pail ; instead it was filled with a thin stream of water , and as she rose up from the last cow the old man appeared outside ."
"` Faithless one , you have betrayed your trust ! '"
he said to Ardan son of Gorla .
` Not even for one day could you keep true !
"Well , you shall have your reward at once , that others may take warning from you . '"
"And waving his wand he touched with it the chest of the youth , who became a pillar of stone ."
"Now Gorla of the Flocks and his wife were full of grief that they had lost a son as well as a daughter , for no tidings had come to them of Ardan their eldest born ."
"At length , when two years and two days had passed since the maiden had led her kids to feed on the mountain and had been seen no more , Ruais , second son of Gorla , rose up one morning , and said : ` Time is long without my sister and Ardan my brother ."
So I have vowed to seek them wherever they may be . '
And his father answered : ` Better it had been if you had first asked my consent and that of your mother ; but as you have vowed so must you do . '
"Then he bade his wife make a cake , but instead she made two , and offered Ruais his choice , as she had done to Ardan ."
"Like Ardan , Ruais chose the large , unblessed cake , and set forth on his way , doing always , though he knew it not , that which Ardan had done ; so , needless is it to tell what befell him till he too stood , a pillar of stone , on the hill behind the cottage , so that all men might see the fate that awaited those who broke their faith ."
"Another year and a day passed by , when Covan the Brown-haired , youngest son of Gorla of the Flocks , one morning spake to his parents , saying : ` It is more than three years since my sister left us ."
"My brothers have also gone , no one know whither , and of us four none remains but I. No , therefore , I long to seek them , and I pray you and my mother to place no hindrance in my way . '"
"And his father answered : ` Go , then , and take our blessing with you . '"
"So the wife of Gorla of the Flocks baked two cakes , one large and one small ; and Covan took the small one , and started on his quest ."
"In the wood he felt hungry , for he had walked far , and he sat down to eat ."
Suddenly a voice behind him cried : ' A bit for me !
a bit for me ! '
And looking round he beheld the black raven of the wilderness .
"` Yes , you shall have a bit , ' said Covan the Brown-haired ; and breaking off a piece he stretched it upwards to the raven , who ate it greedily ."
"Then Covan arose and went forward , till he saw the light from the cottage streaming before him , and glad was he , for night was at hand ."
"` Maybe I shall find some work there , ' he thought , ` and at least I shall gain money to help me in my search ; for who knows how far my sister and my brothers may have wandered ? '"
"The door stood open and he entered , and the old man gave him welcome , and the golden-haired maiden likewise ."
"As happened before , he was offered by the old man to herd his cows ; and , as she had done to his brothers , the maiden counselled him to leave such work alone ."
"But , instead of answering rudely , like both Ardan and Ruais , he thanked her , with courtesy , though he had no mind to heed her ; and he listened to the warnings and words of his new master ."
"Next day he set forth at dawn with the dun cows in front of him , and followed patiently wherever they might lead him ."
"On the way he saw the gold cock and silver hen , which ran even closer to him than they had done to his brothers ."
"Sorely tempted , he longed to give them chase ; but , remembering in time that he had been bidden to look neither to the right nor to the left , with a mighty effort he turned his eyes away ."
"Then the gold and silver staffs seemed to spring from the earth before him , but this time also he overcame ; and though the fruit from the magic tree almost touched his mouth , he brushed it aside and went steadily on ."
"The one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run , and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep ."
She thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night .
"She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket , and tried to pull it over her head ."
And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept .
But it was the fairies .
I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her .
When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as ` Slay her ! '
` Turn her into something extremely unpleasant ! '
"and so on , but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front , and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and demand a boon ."
"Every bride has a right to a boon , and what she asked for was Maimie 's life ."
"` Anything except that , ' replied Queen Mab sternly , and all the fairies echoed , ` Anything except that . '"
"But when they learned how Maimie had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown , they gave three huzzas for the little human , and set off , like an army , to thank her , the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it ."
They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow .
"But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs , it seemed impossible to thank Maimie , for they could not waken her ."
"They went through the form of thanking her -- that is to say , the new King stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome , but she heard not a word of it ."
"They also cleared the snow off her , but soon she was covered again , and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold ."
"` Turn her into something that does not mind the cold , ' seemed a good suggestion of the doctor 's , but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake ."
"` And it might melt , ' the Queen pointed out , so that idea had to be given up ."
"A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot , but though there were so many of them she was too heavy ."
"By this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs , but presently the Cupids had a lovely idea ."
"` Build a house round her , ' they cried , and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do ; in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches , architects were running round Maimie , measuring her ; a bricklayer 's yard sprang up at her feet , seventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation-stone , and the Queen laid it , overseers were appointed to keep the boys off , scaffoldings were run up , the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning-lathes , and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Queen Mab , who rules in the Gardens -RSB- The house was exactly the size of Maimie , and perfectly lovely ."
"One of her arms was extended , and this had bothered them for a second , but they built a verandah round it leading to the front door ."
"The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller , but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof ."
"The fairies , as is their custom , clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness , and they were so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it ."
"So they gave it ever so many little extra touches , and even then they added more extra touches ."
"For instance , two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney ."
"` Now we fear it is quite finished , ' they sighed ."
"But no , for another two ran up the ladder , and tied some smoke to the chimney ."
"` That certainly finishes it , ' they said reluctantly ."
"` Not at all , ' cried a glow-worm ; ` if she were to wake without seeing a night-light she might be frightened , so I shall be her night-light . '"
"` Wait one moment , ' said a china merchant , ` and I shall make you a saucer . '"
"He gave me one look as much as to say , `` Well done , David ! ''"
and off he set again at his top speed .
It grew cooler and even a little darker -LRB- but not much -RRB- with the coming of the night .
"The sky was cloudless ; it was still early in July , and pretty far north ; in the darkest part of that night , you would have needed pretty good eyes to read , but for all that , I have often seen it darker in a winter mid-day ."
Heavy dew fell and drenched the moor like rain ; and this refreshed me for a while .
"When we stopped to breathe , and I had time to see all about me , the clearness and sweetness of the night , the shapes of the hills like things asleep , and the fire dwindling away behind us , like a bright spot in the midst of the moor , anger would come upon me in a clap that I must still drag myself in agony and eat the dust like a worm ."
"By what I have read in books , I think few that have held a pen were ever really wearied , or they would write of it more strongly ."
"I had no care of my life , neither past nor future , and I scarce remembered there was such a lad as David Balfour ."
"I did not think of myself , but just of each fresh step which I was sure would be my last , with despair -- and of Alan , who was the cause of it , with hatred ."
"Alan was in the right trade as a soldier ; this is the officer 's part to make men continue to do things , they know not wherefore , and when , if the choice was offered , they would lie down where they were and be killed ."
"And I dare say I would have made a good enough private ; for in these last hours it never occurred to me that I had any choice but just to obey as long as I was able , and die obeying ."
"Day began to come in , after years , I thought ; and by that time we were past the greatest danger , and could walk upon our feet like men , instead of crawling like brutes ."
"But , dear heart have mercy !"
"what a pair we must have made , going double like old grandfathers , stumbling like babes , and as white as dead folk ."
"Never a word passed between us ; each set his mouth and kept his eyes in front of him , and lifted up his foot and set it down again , like people lifting weights at a country play ; * all the while , with the moorfowl crying `` peep ! ''"
"in the heather , and the light coming slowly clearer in the east ."
* Village fair .
I say Alan did as I did .
"Not that ever I looked at him , for I had enough ado to keep my feet ; but because it is plain he must have been as stupid with weariness as myself , and looked as little where we were going , or we should not have walked into an ambush like blind men ."
It fell in this way .
"We were going down a heathery brae , Alan leading and I following a pace or two behind , like a fiddler and his wife ; when upon a sudden the heather gave a rustle , three or four ragged men leaped out , and the next moment we were lying on our backs , each with a dirk at his throat ."
I do n't think I cared ; the pain of this rough handling was quite swallowed up by the pains of which I was already full ; and I was too glad to have stopped walking to mind about a dirk .
"I lay looking up in the face of the man that held me ; and I mind his face was black with the sun , and his eyes very light , but I was not afraid of him ."
I heard Alan and another whispering in the Gaelic ; and what they said was all one to me .
"Then the dirks were put up , our weapons were taken away , and we were set face to face , sitting in the heather ."
"`` They are Cluny 's men , '' said Alan ."
`` We couldnae have fallen better .
"We 're just to bide here with these , which are his out-sentries , till they can get word to the chief of my arrival . ''"
"Now Cluny Macpherson , the chief of the clan Vourich , had been one of the leaders of the great rebellion six years before ; there was a price on his life ; and I had supposed him long ago in France , with the rest of the heads of that desperate party ."
"Even tired as I was , the surprise of what I heard half wakened me ."
"`` What , '' I cried , `` is Cluny still here ? ''"
"`` Ay , is he so ! ''"
"She slept peacefully till midnight , when there was such a noise in the house that she awoke ."
"Everything trembled and shook ; the animals sprang up and dashed themselves in terror against the wall ; the beams swayed as if they would be torn from their foundations , it seemed as if the stairs were tumbling down , and then the roof fell in with a crash ."
"Then all became still , and as no harm came to the maiden she lay down again and fell asleep ."
"But when she awoke again in broad daylight , what a sight met her eyes !"
"She was lying in a splendid room furnished with royal splendour ; the walls were covered with golden flowers on a green ground ; the bed was of ivory and the counterpane of velvet , and on a stool near by lay a pair of slippers studded with pearls ."
"The maiden thought she must be dreaming , but in came three servants richly dressed , who asked what were her commands ."
"` Go , ' said the maiden , ' I will get up at once and cook the old man 's supper for him , and then I will feed the pretty cock and hen and the brindled cow . '"
"But the door opened and in came a handsome young man , who said , ' I am a king 's son , and was condemned by a wicked witch to live as an old man in this wood with no company but that of my three servants , who were transformed into a cock , a hen , and a brindled cow ."
The spell could only be broken by the arrival of a maiden who should show herself kind not only to men but to beasts .
"You are that maiden , and last night at midnight we were freed , and this poor house was again transformed into my royal palace ."
As they stood there the king 's son told his three servants to go and fetch the maiden 's parents to be present at the wedding feast .
` But where are my two sisters ? '
asked the maid . '
"I shut them up in the cellar , but in the morning they shall be led forth into the forest and shall serve a charcoal burner until they have improved , and will never again suffer poor animals to go hungry . '"
"Uraschimataro and the Turtle From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- ."
"There was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast , and supported themselves by fishing ."
"They had only one child , a son , who was their pride and joy , and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long , and never felt tired or discontented with their lot ."
"This son 's name was Uraschimataro , which means in Japanese , ` Son of the island , ' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman , minding neither wind nor weather ."
"Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro , and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents , ` If your son goes on being so rash , one day he will try his luck once too often , and the waves will end by swallowing him up . '"
"But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks , and as he was really very clever in managing a boat , the old people were very seldom anxious about him ."
"One beautiful bright morning , as he was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat , he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle ."
"He was delighted with his prize , and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home , when suddenly the turtle found its voice , and tremblingly begged for its life ."
"` After all , ' it said , ` what good can I do you ?"
"I am so young and small , and I would so gladly live a little longer ."
"Be merciful and set me free , and I shall know how to prove my gratitude . '"
"Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured , and besides , he could never bear to say no , so he picked up the turtle , and put it back into the sea ."
"Years flew by , and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea ."
"But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks , there arose a fierce whirlwind , which shattered his boat to pieces , and she was sucked under by the waves ."
Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate .
"But he was a powerful swimmer , and struggled hard to reach the shore ."
"Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him , and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said : ' I am the turtle whose life you once saved ."
I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude .
"There was no way , think , plan , worry as she might ."
And if she could not !
"Marcella remembered Patty 's face and the doctor 's look , and her heart sank like lead ."
"Patty was growing weaker every day instead of stronger , and the weather was getting hotter ."
"Oh , if Patty were to -- to -- but Marcella could not complete the sentence even in thought ."
If they were not so desperately poor !
Marcella 's bitterness overflowed her soul at the thought .
Everywhere around her were evidences of wealth -- wealth often lavishly and foolishly spent -- and she could not get money enough anywhere to save her sister 's life !
"She almost felt that she hated all those smiling , well-dressed people who thronged the streets ."
"By the time she reached the store , poor Marcella 's heart was seething with misery and resentment ."
"Three years before , when Marcella had been sixteen and Patty nine , their parents had died , leaving them absolutely alone in the world except for their father 's half-sister , Miss Gibson , who lived in Canning and earned her livelihood washing and mending for the hands employed in the big factory nearby ."
"She had grudgingly offered the girls a home , which Marcella had accepted because she must ."
"She obtained a position in one of the Canning stores at three dollars a week , out of which she contrived to dress herself and Patty and send the latter to school ."
"Her life for three years was one of absolute drudgery , yet until now she had never lost courage , but had struggled bravely on , hoping for better times in the future when she should get promotion and Patty would be old enough to teach school ."
But now Marcella 's courage and hopefulness had gone out like a spent candle .
"She was late at the store , and that meant a fine ; her head ached , and her feet felt like lead as she climbed the stairs to her department -- a hot , dark , stuffy corner behind the shirtwaist counter ."
"It was warm and close at any time , but today it was stifling , and there was already a crowd of customers , for it was the day of a bargain sale ."
The heat and noise and chatter got on Marcella 's tortured nerves .
"She felt that she wanted to scream , but instead she turned calmly to a waiting customer -- a big , handsome , richly dressed woman ."
Marcella noted with an ever-increasing bitterness that the woman wore a lace collar the price of which would have kept Patty in the country for a year .
She was Mrs. Liddell -- Marcella knew her by sight -- and she was in a very bad temper because she had been kept waiting .
For the next half hour she badgered and worried Marcella to the point of distraction .
Nothing suited her .
"Pile after pile , box after box , of shirtwaists did Marcella take down for her , only to have them flung aside with sarcastic remarks ."
Mrs. Liddell seemed to hold Marcella responsible for the lack of waists that suited her ; her tongue grew sharper and sharper and her comments more trying .
"Then she mislaid her purse , and was disagreeable about that until it turned up ."
Marcella shut her lips so tightly that they turned white to keep back the impatient retort that rose momentarily to her lips .
"The insolence of some customers was always trying to the sensitive , high-spirited girl , but today it seemed unbearable ."
"Her head throbbed fiercely with the pain of the ever-increasing ache , and -- what was the lady on her right saying to a friend ?"
"`` Yes , she had typhoid , you know -- a very bad form ."
"She rallied from it , but she was so exhausted that she could n't really recover , and the doctor said -- '' `` Really , '' interrupted Mrs. Liddell 's sharp voice , `` may I ask you to attend to me , if you please ?"
"No doubt gossip may be very interesting to you , but I am accustomed to having a clerk pay some small attention to my requirements ."
She was not in the least cold .
"She was wearing a russet-coloured pelisse and had the hood over her head , so that nothing of her showed except her dear little face and her curls ."
The rest of her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a ball .
She was about forty round the waist .
"There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk , where Maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk ."
"They moved in a jerky sort of way certainly , but that was because they used crutches ."
"An elderberry hobbled across the walk , and stood chatting with some young quinces , and they all had crutches ."
The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs .
"They were quite familiar objects to Maimie , but she had never known what they were for until to-night ."
-LSB- Illustration : There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk -RSB- She peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy .
He was a street boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees .
"The way he did it was this : he pressed a spring in the trunks and they shut like umbrellas , deluging the little plants beneath with snow . '"
"O you naughty , naughty child ! '"
"Maimie cried indignantly , for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears ."
"Fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot , but a chrysanthemum heard her , and said so pointedly , ` Hoity-toity , what is this ? '"
that she had to come out and show herself .
Then the whole vegetable kingdom was rather puzzled what to do .
"-LSB- Illustration : An afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow -RSB- ` Of course it is no affair of ours , ' a spindle-tree said after they had whispered together , ` but you know quite well you ought not to be here , and perhaps our duty is to report you to the fairies ; what do you think yourself ? ' '"
"I think you should not , ' Maimie replied , which so perplexed them that they said petulantly there was no arguing with her . '"
"I would n't ask it of you , ' she assured them , ` if I thought it was wrong , ' and of course after this they could not well carry tales ."
"They then said , ` Well-a-day , ' and ` Such is life , ' for they can be frightfully sarcastic ; but she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches , and she said good-naturedly , ` Before I go to the fairies ' ball , I should like to take you for a walk one at a time ; you can lean on me , you know . '"
"At this they clapped their hands , and she escorted them up the Baby Walk and back again , one at a time , putting an arm or a finger round the very frail , setting their leg right when it got too ridiculous , and treating the foreign ones quite as courteously as the English , though she could not understand a word they said ."
"They behaved well on the whole , though some whimpered that she had not taken them as far as she took Nancy or Grace or Dorothy , and others jagged her , but it was quite unintentional , and she was too much of a lady to cry out ."
"So much walking tired her , and she was anxious to be off to the ball , but she no longer felt afraid ."
"The reason she felt no more fear was that it was now night-time , and in the dark , you remember , Maimie was always rather strange ."
"They were now loth to let her go , for , ` If the fairies see you , ' they warned her , ` they will mischief you -- stab you to death , or compel you to nurse their children , or turn you into something tedious , like an evergreen oak . '"
"As they said this they looked with affected pity at an evergreen oak , for in winter they are very envious of the evergreens ."
"` Oh , la ! '"
"replied the oak bitingly , ` how deliciously cosy it is to stand here buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked creatures shivering . '"
"This made them sulky , though they had really brought it on themselves , and they drew for Maimie a very gloomy picture of the perils that would face her if she insisted on going to the ball ."
"-LSB- Illustration : She ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid -RSB- She learned from a purple filbert that the court was not in its usual good temper at present , the cause being the tantalising heart of the Duke of Christmas Daisies ."
"He was an Oriental fairy , very poorly of a dreadful complaint , namely , inability to love , and though he had tried many ladies in many lands he could not fall in love with one of them ."
"` That does n't matter , ' said Peter , as if he were the only person present who knew all about it , though he was really the one who knew least ."
` What we need is just a nice motherly person . '
` Oh dear ! '
"Wendy said , ` you see I feel that is exactly what I am . '"
"` It is , it is , ' they all cried ; ` we saw it at once . '"
"` Very well , ' she said , ' I will do my best ."
"Come inside at once , you naughty children ; I am sure your feet are damp ."
And before I put you to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella . '
"In they went ; I do n't know how there was room for them , but you can squeeze very tight in the Neverland ."
And that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy .
"By and by she tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the trees , but she herself slept that night in the little house , and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword , for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl ."
"The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness , with a bright light showing through its blinds , and the chimney smoking beautifully , and Peter standing on guard ."
"After a time he fell asleep , and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy ."
"Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed , but they just tweaked Peter 's nose and passed on ."
-LSB- Illustration : PETER ON GUARD -RSB- CHAPTER VII THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees .
"Hook , you remember , had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece , but this was ignorance , for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down , and no two of the boys were quite the same size ."
"Once you fitted , you drew in your breath at the top , and down you went at exactly the right speed , while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately , and so wriggled up ."
"Of course , when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them , and then nothing can be more graceful ."
"But you simply must fit , and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes : the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you , while you have to be made to fit the tree ."
"Usually it is done quite easily , as by your wearing too many garments or too few ; but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape , Peter does some things to you , and after that you fit ."
"Once you fit , great care must be taken to go on fitting , and this , as Wendy was to discover to her delight , keeps a whole family in perfect condition ."
"Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try , but John had to be altered a little ."
After a few days ' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well .
And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground ; especially Wendy .
"It consisted of one large room , as all houses should do , with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing , and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour , which were used as stools ."
"A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room , but every morning they sawed the trunk through , level with the floor ."
"By tea-time it was always about two feet high , and then they put a door on top of it , the whole thus becoming a table ; as soon as they cleared away , they sawed off the trunk again , and thus there was more room to play ."
"There was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it , and across this Wendy stretched strings , made of fibre , from which she suspended her washing ."
"The bed was tilted against the wall by day , and let down at 6.30 , when it filled nearly half the room ; and all the boys except Michael slept in it , lying like sardines in a tin ."
"There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal , when all turned at once ."
"Michael should have used it also ; but Wendy would have a baby , and he was the littlest , and you know what women are , and the short and the long of it is that he was hung up in a basket ."
"It was rough and simple , and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances ."
His sons were so frightened at the sight that they all ran away .
And in this manner Patto avenged his dead children .
"But though Stalo was dead , his three sons were still living , and not very far off either ."
"They had gone to their mother , who was tending some reindeer on the pastures , and told her that by some magic , they knew not what , their father 's head had rolled from his body , and they had been so afraid that something dreadful would happen to them that they had come to take refuge with her ."
The ogress said nothing .
"Long ago she had found out how stupid her sons were , so she just sent them out to milk the reindeer , while she returned to the other house to bury her husband 's body ."
"Now , three days ' journey from the hut on the pastures two brothers Sodno dwelt in a small cottage with their sister Lyma , who tended a large herd of reindeer while they were out hunting ."
"Of late it had been whispered from one to another that the three young Stalos were to be seen on the pastures , but the Sodno brothers did not disturb themselves , the danger seemed too far away ."
"Unluckily , however , one day , when Lyma was left by herself in the hut , the three Stalos came down and carried her and the reindeer off to their own cottage ."
"The country was very lonely , and perhaps no one would have known in which direction she had gone had not the girl managed to tie a ball of thread to the handle of a door at the back of the cottage and let it trail behind her ."
"Of course the ball was not long enough to go all the way , but it lay on the edge of a snowy track which led straight to the Stalos ' house ."
When the brothers returned from their hunting they found both the hut and the sheds empty .
Loudly they cried : ` Lyma !
Lyma ! '
"But no voice answered them ; and they fell to searching all about , lest perchance their sister might have dropped some clue to guide them ."
"At length their eyes dropped on the thread which lay on the snow , and they set out to follow it ."
"On and on they went , and when at length the thread stopped the brothers knew that another day 's journey would bring them to the Stalos ' dwelling ."
"Of course they did not dare to approach it openly , for the Stalos had the strength of giants , and besides , there were three of them ; so the two Sodnos climbed into a big bushy tree which overhung a well ."
"` Perhaps our sister may be sent to draw water here , ' they said to each other ."
"But it was not till the moon had risen that the sister came , and as she let down her bucket into the well , the leaves seemed to whisper ` Lyma !"
Lyma ! '
"The girl started and looked up , but could see nothing , and in a moment the voice came again ."
"` Be careful -- take no notice , fill your buckets , but listen carefully all the while , and we will tell you what to do so that you may escape yourself and set free the reindeer also . '"
"So Lyman bent over the well lower than before , and seemed busier than ever ."
"` You know , ' said her brother , ` that when a Stalo finds that anything has been dropped into his food he will not eat a morsel , but throws it to his dogs ."
"Now , after the pot has been hanging some time over the fire , and the broth is nearly cooked , just rake up the log of wood so that some of the ashes fly into the pot ."
"The Stalo will soon notice this , and will call you to give all the food to the dogs ; but , instead , you must bring it straight to us , as it is three days since we have eaten or drunk ."
That is all you need do for the present . '
"Then Lyma took up her buckets and carried them into the house , and did as her brothers had told her ."
"They were so hungry that they ate the food up greedily without speaking , but when there was nothing left in the pot , the eldest one said : ` Listen carefully to what I have to tell you ."
"After the eldest Stalo has cooked and eaten a fresh supper , he will go to bed and sleep so soundly that not even a witch could wake him ."
"You can hear him snoring a mile off , and then you must go into his room and pull off the iron mantle that covers him , and put it on the fire till it is almost red hot ."
"And whether you are a lady or only a little boy who wants a baby-sister , always take pains to write your address clearly ."
You ca n't think what a lot of babies Solomon has sent to the wrong house .
"Shelley 's boat , when opened , completely puzzled Solomon , and he took counsel of his assistants , who having walked over it twice , first with their toes pointed out , and then with their toes pointed in , decided that it came from some greedy person who wanted five ."
They thought this because there was a large five printed on it .
` Preposterous ! '
"cried Solomon in a rage , and he presented it to Peter ; anything useless which drifted upon the island was usually given to Peter as a plaything ."
"But he did not play with his precious bank-note , for he knew what it was at once , having been very observant during the week when he was an ordinary boy ."
"With so much money , he reflected , he could surely at last contrive to reach the Gardens , and he considered all the possible ways , and decided -LRB- wisely , I think -RRB- to choose the best way ."
"But , first , he had to tell the birds of the value of Shelley 's boat ; and though they were too honest to demand it back , he saw that they were galled , and they cast such black looks at Solomon , who was rather vain of his cleverness , that he flew away to the end of the island , and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings ."
"Now Peter knew that unless Solomon was on your side , you never got anything done for you in the island , so he followed him and tried to hearten him ."
-LSB- Illustration : ` Preposterous ! '
cried Solomon in a rage -RSB- Nor was this all that Peter did to gain the powerful old fellow 's good-will .
You must know that Solomon had no intention of remaining in office all his life .
"He looked forward to retiring by and by , and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump in the Figs which had taken his fancy , and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking ."
"It was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had been cast upon the island , and at the time I speak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs , thirty-four nuts , sixteen crusts , a pen-wiper , and a boot-lace ."
"When his stocking was full , Solomon calculated that he would be able to retire on a competency ."
Peter now gave him a pound .
He cut it off his bank-note with a sharp stick .
"This made Solomon his friend for ever , and after the two had consulted together they called a meeting of the thrushes ."
You will see presently why thrushes only were invited .
"The scheme to be put before them was really Peter 's , but Solomon did most of the talking , because he soon became irritable if other people talked ."
"He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building , and this put them into good-humour at once , as it was meant to do ; for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests ."
"Other birds , said Solomon , omitted to line their nests with mud , and as a result they did not hold water ."
"Here he cocked his head as if he had used an unanswerable argument ; but , unfortunately , a Mrs. Finch had come to the meeting uninvited , and she squeaked out , ` We do n't build nests to hold water , but to hold eggs , ' and then the thrushes stopped cheering , and Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water ."
"` Consider , ' he said at last , ` how warm the mud makes the nest . '"
"` Consider , ' cried Mrs. Finch , ` that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned . '"
"The thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this , but again he was perplexed ."
"` Try another drink , ' suggested Mrs. Finch pertly ."
"Kate was her name , and all Kates are saucy ."
"-LSB- Illustration : For years he had been quietly filling his stocking -RSB- Solomon did try another drink , and it inspired him ."
"` If , ' said he , ' a finch 's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces , but a thrush 's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan 's back . '"
How the thrushes applauded !
"Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother , with Redruth for a guard ; and then both come full speed to Bristol ."

"He leaves his wife to manage the inn ; and as she is a woman of colour , a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife , quite as much as the health , that sends him back to roving ."

"Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him ; but such was not the squire 's pleasure , and the squire 's pleasure was like law among them all ."
Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble .
"The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow , and there I found my mother in good health and spirits ."
"The captain , who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort , was gone where the wicked cease from troubling ."
"The squire had had everything repaired , and the public rooms and the sign repainted , and had added some furniture -- above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar ."
He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone .
"It was on seeing that boy that I understood , for the first time , my situation ."
"I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me , not at all of the home that I was leaving ; and now , at sight of this clumsy stranger , who was to stay here in my place beside my mother , I had my first attack of tears ."
"I am afraid I led that boy a dog 's life , for as he was new to the work , I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down , and I was not slow to profit by them ."
"The night passed , and the next day , after dinner , Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road ."
"I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born , and the dear old Admiral Benbow -- since he was repainted , no longer quite so dear ."
"One of my last thoughts was of the captain , who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat , his sabre-cut cheek , and his old brass telescope ."
Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight .
The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath .
"I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman , and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air , I must have dozed a great deal from the very first , and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage , for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs , and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time ."
`` Where are we ? ''
I asked .
"`` Bristol , '' said Tom ."
`` Get down . ''
Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner .
"Thither we had now to walk , and our way , to my great delight , lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations ."
"In one , sailors were singing at their work , in another there were men aloft , high over my head , hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider 's ."
"`` In honour , I do , '' said Dick ."
"`` Hear , then , '' she continued ; `` Ye would make but a sad friar , methinks ; and since I am to dispose of you at pleasure , I will even take you for my husband ."
"Nay , now , no words ! ''"
cried she .
`` They will avail you nothing .
"For see how just it is , that you who deprived me of one home , should supply me with another ."
"And as for Joanna , she will be the first , believe me , to commend the change ; for , after all , as we be dear friends , what matters it with which of us ye wed ?"
Not one whit ! ''
"`` Madam , '' said Dick , `` I will go into a cloister , an ye please to bid me ; but to wed with anyone in this big world besides Joanna Sedley is what I will consent to neither for man 's force nor yet for lady 's pleasure ."
"Pardon me if I speak my plain thoughts plainly ; but where a maid is very bold , a poor man must even be the bolder . ''"
"`` Dick , '' she said , `` ye sweet boy , ye must come and kiss me for that word ."
"Nay , fear not , ye shall kiss me for Joanna ; and when we meet , I shall give it back to her , and say I stole it ."
"And as for what ye owe me , why , dear simpleton , methinks ye were not alone in that great battle ; and even if York be on the throne , it was not you that set him there ."
"But for a good , sweet , honest heart , Dick , y ' are all that ; and if I could find it in my soul to envy your Joanna anything , I would even envy her your love . ''"
"CHAPTER VI -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS -LRB- concluded -RRB- : DICK AND JOAN The horses had by this time finished the small store of provender , and fully breathed from their fatigues ."
"At Dick 's command , the fire was smothered in snow ; and while his men got once more wearily to saddle , he himself , remembering , somewhat late , true woodland caution , chose a tall oak and nimbly clambered to the topmost fork ."
Hence he could look far abroad on the moonlit and snow-paven forest .
"On the south-west , dark against the horizon , stood those upland , heathy quarters where he and Joanna had met with the terrifying misadventure of the leper ."
And there his eye was caught by a spot of ruddy brightness no bigger than a needle 's eye .
He blamed himself sharply for his previous neglect .
"Were that , as it appeared to be , the shining of Sir Daniel 's camp-fire , he should long ago have seen and marched for it ; above all , he should , for no consideration , have announced his neighbourhood by lighting a fire of his own ."
But now he must no longer squander valuable hours .
"The direct way to the uplands was about two miles in length ; but it was crossed by a very deep , precipitous dingle , impassable to mounted men ; and for the sake of speed , it seemed to Dick advisable to desert the horses and attempt the adventure on foot ."
"Ten men were left to guard the horses ; signals were agreed upon by which they could communicate in case of need ; and Dick set forth at the head of the remainder , Alicia Risingham walking stoutly by his side ."
"The men had freed themselves of heavy armour , and left behind their lances ; and they now marched with a very good spirit in the frozen snow , and under the exhilarating lustre of the moon ."
"The descent into the dingle , where a stream strained sobbing through the snow and ice , was effected with silence and order ; and on the further side , being then within a short half mile of where Dick had seen the glimmer of the fire , the party halted to breathe before the attack ."
"In the vast silence of the wood , the lightest sounds were audible from far ; and Alicia , who was keen of hearing , held up her finger warningly and stooped to listen ."
"All followed her example ; but besides the groans of the choked brook in the dingle close behind , and the barking of a fox at a distance of many miles among the forest , to Dick 's acutest hearkening , not a breath was audible ."
"`` But yet , for sure , I heard the clash of harness , '' whispered Alicia ."
"`` Madam , '' returned Dick , who was more afraid of that young lady than of ten stout warriors , `` I would not hint ye were mistaken ; but it might well have come from either of the camps . ''"
`` It came not thence .
"It came from westward , '' she declared ."
Aunt Susanna came down the next day and told Margaret that she would send her to college .
Also she commissioned Laura to paint her a water-color for her dining-room and said she 'd pay her five dollars for it .
"Kate and I were rather left out in the cold in this distribution of favors , but when you come to reflect that Laura and Magsie had really cooked that dinner , it was only just ."
"Anyway , Aunt Susanna has never since insinuated that we ca n't cook , and that is as much as we deserve ."
By Grace of Julius Caesar Melissa sent word on Monday evening that she thought we had better go round with the subscription list for cushioning the church pews on Tuesday .
I sent back word that I thought we had better go on Thursday .
"I had no particular objection to Tuesday , but Melissa is rather fond of settling things without consulting anyone else , and I do n't believe in always letting her have her own way ."
"Melissa is my cousin and we have always been good friends , and I am really very fond of her ; but there 's no sense in lying down and letting yourself be walked over ."
We finally compromised on Wednesday .
"I always have a feeling of dread when I hear of any new church-project for which money will be needed , because I know perfectly well that Melissa and I will be sent round to collect for it ."
"People say we seem to be able to get more than anybody else ; and they appear to think that because Melissa is an unencumbered old maid , and I am an unencumbered widow , we can spare the time without any inconvenience to ourselves ."
"Well , we have been canvassing for building funds , and socials , and suppers for years , but it is needed now ; at least , I have had enough of it , and I should think Melissa has , too ."
"We started out bright and early on Wednesday morning , for Jersey Cove is a big place and we knew we should need the whole day ."
"We had to walk because neither of us owned a horse , and anyway it 's more nuisance getting out to open and shut gates than it is worth while ."
"It was a lovely day then , though promising to be hot , and our hearts were as light as could be expected , considering the disagreeable expedition we were on ."
"I was waiting at my gate for Melissa when she came , and she looked me over with wonder and disapproval ."
I could see she thought I was a fool to dress up in my second best flowered muslin and my very best hat with the pale pink roses in it to walk about in the heat and dust ; but I was n't .
"All my experience in canvassing goes to show that the better dressed and better looking you are the more money you 'll get -- that is , when it 's the men you have to tackle , as in this case ."
"If it had been the women , however , I would have put on the oldest and ugliest things , consistent with decency , I had ."
"This was what Melissa had done , as it was , and she did look fearfully prim and dowdy , except for her front hair , which was as soft and fluffy and elaborate as usual ."
I never could understand how Melissa always got it arranged so beautifully .
Nothing particular happened the first part of the day .
"Some few growled and would n't subscribe anything , but on the whole we did pretty well ."
"If it had been a missionary subscription we should have fared worse ; but when it was something touching their own comfort , like cushioning the pews , they came down handsomely ."
"We reached Daniel Wilson 's by noon , and had to have dinner there ."
"We did n't eat much , although we were hungry enough -- Mary Wilson 's cooking is a by-word in Jersey Cove ."
"No wonder Daniel is dyspeptic ; but dyspeptic or not , he gave us a big subscription for our cushions and told us we looked younger than ever ."
"Daniel is always very complimentary , and they say Mary is jealous ."
"When we left the Wilson 's Melissa said , with an air of a woman nerving herself to a disagreeable duty : `` I suppose we might as well go to Isaac Appleby 's now and get it over . ''"
I agreed with her .
I had been dreading that call all day .
It is n't a very pleasant thing to go to a man you have recently refused to marry and ask him for money ; and Melissa and I were both in that predicament .
`` What made you take such a long walk ?
"You look as tired as if you 'd been ten miles , '' said Jill , hoping to discover the length of the trip ."
`` Had to .
"Four or five miles is n't much , only my leg bothered me ; '' and Jack gave the ailing member a slap , as if he had found it much in his way that day ; for , though he had given up the crutches long ago , he rather missed their support sometimes ."
"Then , with a great yawn , he stretched himself out to bask in the blaze , pillowing his head on his arms ."
"`` Dear old thing , he looks all used up ; I wo n't plague him with talking ; '' and Jill began to sing , as she often did in the twilight ."
"By the time the first song ended a gentle snore was heard , and Jack lay fast asleep , worn out with the busy week and the walk , which had been longer and harder than any one guessed ."
"Jill took up her knitting and worked quietly by firelight , still wondering and guessing what the secret could be ; for she had not much to amuse her , and little things were very interesting if connected with her friends ."
"Presently Jack rolled over and began to mutter in his sleep , as he often did when too weary for sound slumber ."
Jill paid no attention till he uttered a name which made her prick up her ears and listen to the broken sentences which followed .
"Only a few words , but she dropped her work , saying to herself , -- `` I do believe he is talking about the secret ."
"Now I shall find out , and he will tell me himself , as I said he would . ''"
"Much pleased , she leaned and listened , but could make no sense of the confused babble about `` heavy boots ; '' `` All right , old fellow ; '' `` Jerry 's off ; '' and `` The ink is too thick . ''"
"The slam of the front door woke Jack , and he pulled himself up , declaring that he believed he had been having a nap ."
"`` I wish you 'd have another , '' said Jill , greatly disappointed at the loss of the intelligence she seemed to be so near getting ."
`` Floor is too hard for tired bones .
Guess I 'll go to bed and get rested up for Monday .
"I 've worked like fury this week , so next I 'm going in for fun ; '' and , little dreaming what hard times were in store for him , Jack went off to enjoy his warm bath and welcome bed , where he was soon sleeping with the serene look of one whose dreams were happy , whose conscience was at rest ."
"* * * * * `` I have a few words to say to you before you go , '' said Mr. Acton , pausing with his hand on the bell , Monday afternoon , when the hour came for dismissing school ."
"The bustle of putting away books and preparing for as rapid a departure as propriety allowed , subsided suddenly , and the boys and girls sat as still as mice , while the hearts of such as had been guilty of any small sins began to beat fast ."
"`` You remember that we had some trouble last winter about keeping the boys away from the saloon , and that a rule was made forbidding any pupil to go to town during recess ? ''"
"began Mr. Acton , who , being a conscientious man as well as an excellent teacher , felt that he was responsible for the children in school hours , and did his best to aid parents in guarding them from the few temptations which beset them in a country town ."
"A certain attractive little shop , where confectionery , baseballs , stationery , and picture papers were sold , was a favorite loafing place for some of the boys till the rule forbidding it was made , because in the rear of the shop was a beer and billiard saloon ."
"A wise rule , for the picture papers were not always of the best sort ; cigars were to be had ; idle fellows hung about there , and some of the lads , who wanted to be thought manly , ventured to pass the green baize door `` just to look on . ''"
"A murmur answered the teacher 's question , and he continued , `` You all know that the rule was broken several times , and I told you the next offender would be publicly reprimanded , as private punishments had no effect ."
"I am sorry to say that the time has come , and the offender is a boy whom I trusted entirely ."
"It grieves me to do this , but I must keep my promise , and hope the example will have a good effect . ''"
"Mr. Acton paused , as if he found it hard to go on , and the boys looked at one another with inquiring eyes , for their teacher seldom punished , and when he did , it was a very solemn thing ."
"Several of these anxious glances fell upon Joe , who was very red and sat whittling a pencil as if he dared not lift his eyes ."
`` He 's the chap .
Wo n't he catch it ? ''
"whispered Gus to Frank , for both owed him a grudge ."
"I 'll watch the door , for I wo n't have any more ridiculous boys tearing in to disturb my lady . ''"
"Mrs. Pecq often called this good neighbor `` my lady '' when speaking of her , for Mrs. Minot was a true gentlewoman , and much pleasanter to live with than the titled mistress had been ."
"Joe scudded away as if the constable was after him , and presently Frank was seen slowly approaching with an unusually sober face and a pair of very dirty hands ."
"`` Thank heaven , he 's safe ! ''"
"and , softly opening the door , Mrs. Pecq actually hustled the young master into the ante-room as unceremoniously as she had hustled Joe ."
"`` I beg pardon , but the parlor is full of company , and that fool of a Joe came roaring in with a cock-and-bull story that gave me quite a turn ."
"What is it , Mr. Frank ? ''"
"she asked eagerly , seeing that something was amiss ."
"He told her in a few words , and she was much relieved to find that no harm had been done ."
"`` Ah , the danger is to come , '' said Frank , darkly , as he went away to wash his hands and prepare to relate his misdeeds ."
"It was a very bad quarter of an hour for the poor fellow , who so seldom had any grave faults to confess ; but he did it manfully , and his mother was so grateful for the safety of her boy that she found it difficult to be severe enough , and contented herself with forbidding any more visits to the too charming No. 11 ."
`` What do you suppose will be done to me ? ''
"asked Frank , on whom the idea of imprisonment had made a deep impression ."
"`` I do n't know , dear , but I shall go over to see Mr. Burton right after tea ."
He will tell us what to do and what to expect .
Gus must not suffer for your fault . ''
"`` He 'll come off clear enough , but Joe must take his share , for if he had n't opened that confounded switch , no harm would have been done ."
"But when I saw the way clear , I actually could n't resist going ahead , '' said Frank , getting excited again at the memory of that blissful moment when he started the engine ."
"Here Jack came hurrying in , having heard the news , and refused to believe it from any lips but Frank 's ."
"When he could no longer doubt , he was so much impressed with the daring of the deed that he had nothing but admiration for his brother , till a sudden thought made him clap his hands and exclaim exultingly , -- `` His runaway beats mine all hollow , and now he ca n't crow over me !"
Wo n't that be a comfort ?
The good boy has got into a scrape .
Hooray ! ''
"This was such a droll way of taking it , that they had to laugh ; and Frank took his humiliation so meekly that Jack soon fell to comforting him , instead of crowing over him ."
"Jill thought it a most interesting event ; and , when Frank and his mother went over to consult Mr. Burton , she and Jack planned out for the dear culprit a dramatic trial which would have convulsed the soberest of judges ."
"His sentence was ten years ' imprisonment , and such heavy fines that the family would have been reduced to beggary but for the sums made by Jill 's fancy work and Jack 's success as a champion pedestrian ."
"They found such comfort and amusement in this sensational programme that they were rather disappointed when Frank returned , reporting that a fine would probably be all the penalty exacted , as no harm had been done , and he and Gus were such respectable boys ."
"What would happen to Joe , he could not tell , but he thought a good whipping ought to be added to his share ."
"Of course , the affair made a stir in the little world of children ; and when Frank went to school , feeling that his character for good behavior was forever damaged , he found himself a lion , and was in danger of being spoiled by the admiration of his comrades , who pointed him out with pride as `` the fellow who ran off with a steam-engine . ''"
"But an interview with Judge Kemble , a fine of twenty-five dollars , and lectures from all the grown people of his acquaintance , prevented him from regarding his escapade as a feat to boast of ."
"He discovered , also , how fickle a thing is public favor , for very soon those who had praised began to tease , and it took all his courage , patience , and pride to carry him through the next week or two ."
"The lads were never tired of alluding to No. 11 , giving shrill whistles in his ear , asking if his watch was right , and drawing locomotives on the blackboard whenever they got a chance ."
"As Tony made no answer , she sat up , whereupon her head hit the roof , and it opened like the lid of a box , and to her bewilderment she saw all around her the Kensington Gardens lying deep in snow ."
"As she was not in the nursery she wondered whether this was really herself , so she pinched her cheeks , and then she knew it was herself , and this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great adventure ."
"She remembered now everything that had happened to her from the closing of the gates up to her running away from the fairies , but however , she asked herself , had she got into this funny place ?"
"She stepped out by the roof , right over the garden , and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night ."
It so entranced her that she could think of nothing else .
"`` Oh , you darling , oh , you sweet , oh , you love ! ''"
she cried .
"Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house , or maybe it now knew that its work was done , for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller ; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking , yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now ."
"It always remained as complete as ever , but it became smaller and smaller , and the garden dwindled at the same time , and the snow crept closer , lapping house and garden up ."
"Now the house was the size of a little dog 's kennel , and now of a Noah 's Ark , but still you could see the smoke and the door-handle and the roses on the wall , every one complete ."
"The glow-worm fight was waning too , but it was still there ."
"`` Darling , loveliest , do n't go ! ''"
"Maimie cried , falling on her knees , for the little house was now the size of a reel of thread , but still quite complete ."
"But as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself , and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse of snow ."
"Maimie stamped her foot naughtily , and was putting her fingers to her eyes , when she heard a kind voice say , `` Do n't cry , pretty human , do n't cry , '' and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully ."
She knew at once that he must be Peter Pan .
"Lock-out Time It is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies , and almost the only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever there are children ."
"Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens , and at that time there was not a fairy in the place ; then the children were admitted , and the fairies came trooping in that very evening ."
"They ca n't resist following the children , but you seldom see them , partly because they live in the daytime behind the railings , where you are not allowed to go , and also partly because they are so cunning ."
"They are not a bit cunning after Lock-out , but until Lock-out , my word !"
"When you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well , and you remember a good deal about them in your babyhood , which it is a great pity you ca n't write down , for gradually you forget , and I have heard of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy ."
"Very likely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens , they were standing looking at a fairy all the time ."
The reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else .
This is one of their best tricks .
"They usually pretend to be flowers , because the court sits in the Fairies ' Basin , and there are so many flowers there , and all along the Baby Walk , that a flower is the thing least likely to attract attention ."
"They dress exactly like flowers , and change with the seasons , putting on white when lilies are in and blue for blue-bells , and so on ."
"They like crocus and hyacinth time best of all , as they are partial to a bit of colour , but tulips -LRB- except white ones , which are the fairy-cradles -RRB- they consider garish , and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips for days , so that the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time to catch them ."
"When they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively , but if you look and they fear there is no time to hide , they stand quite still , pretending to be flowers ."
"Then , after you have passed without knowing that they were fairies , they rush home and tell their mothers they have had such an adventure ."
"The Fairy Basin , you remember , is all covered with ground-ivy -LRB- from which they make their castor-oil -RRB- , with flowers growing in it here and there ."
"Most of them really are flowers , but some of them are fairies ."
"You never can be sure of them , but a good plan is to walk by looking the other way , and then turn round sharply ."
"Jack folded his arms and departed like a warrior borne from the battle-field , to be chaffed unmercifully for a `` pepper-pot , '' while Gus made him comfortable in his own room ."
`` I heard once of a boy who threw a fork at his brother and put his eye out .
"But he did n't mean to , and the brother forgave him , and he never did so any more , '' observed Jill , in a pensive tone , wishing to show that she felt all the dangers of impatience , but was sorry for the culprit ."
`` Did the boy ever forgive himself ? ''
asked Mrs. Minot .
"`` No , 'm ; I suppose not ."
"But Jack did n't hit Frank , and feels real sorry , I know . ''"
"`` He might have , and hurt him very much ."
"Our actions are in our own hands , but the consequences of them are not ."
"Remember that , my dear , and think twice before you do anything . ''"
"`` Yes , 'm , I will ; '' and Jill composed herself to consider what missionaries usually did when the natives hurled tomahawks and boomerangs at one another , and defied the rulers of the land ."
"Mrs. Minot wrote one page of a new letter , then stopped , pushed her papers about , thought a little , and finally got up , saying , as if she found it impossible to resist the yearning of her heart for the naughty boy , -- `` I am going to see if Jack is covered up , he is so helpless , and liable to take cold ."
Do n't stir till I come back . ''
"`` No , 'm , I wo n't . ''"
"Away went the tender parent to find her son studying Caesar for dear life , and all the more amiable for the little gust which had blown away the temporary irritability ."
"The brothers were often called `` Thunder and Lightning , '' because Frank lowered and growled and was a good while clearing up , while Jack 's temper came and went like a flash , and the air was all the clearer for the escape of dangerous electricity ."
"Of course Mamma had to stop and deliver a little lecture , illustrated by sad tales of petulant boys , and punctuated with kisses which took off the edge of these afflicting narratives ."
"Jill meantime meditated morally on the superiority of her own good temper over the hasty one of her dear playmate , and just when she was feeling unusually uplifted and secure , alas !"
"like so many of us , she fell , in the most deplorable manner ."
"Glancing about the room for something to do , she saw a sheet of paper lying exactly out of reach , where it had fluttered from the table unperceived ."
"At first her eye rested on it as carelessly as it did on the stray stamp Frank had dropped ; then , as if one thing suggested the other , she took it into her head that the paper was Frank 's composition , or , better still , a note to Annette , for the two corresponded when absence or weather prevented the daily meeting at school ."
`` Would n't it be fun to keep it till he gives back Jack 's stamps ?
"It would plague him so if it was a note , and I do believe it is , for compo 's do n't begin with two words on one side ."
"I 'll get it , and Jack and I will plan some way to pay him off , cross thing ! ''"
"Forgetting her promise not to stir , also how dishonorable it was to read other people 's letters , Jill caught up the long-handled hook , often in use now , and tried to pull the paper nearer ."
"It would not come at once , for a seam in the carpet held it , and Jill feared to tear or crumple it if she was not very careful ."
"The hook was rather heavy and long for her to manage , and Jack usually did the fishing , so she was not very skilful ; and just as she was giving a particularly quick jerk , she lost her balance , fell off the sofa , and dropped the pole with a bang ."
"`` Oh , my back ! ''"
"was all she could think or say as she felt the jar all through her little body , and a corresponding fear in her guilty little mind that someone would come and find out the double mischief she had been at ."
"For a moment she lay quite still to recover from the shock , then as the pain passed she began to wonder how she should get back , and looked about her to see if she could do it alone ."
"She thought she could , as the sofa was near and she had improved so much that she could sit up a little if the doctor would have let her ."
"She was gathering herself together for the effort , when , within arm 's reach now , she saw the tempting paper , and seized it with glee , for in spite of her predicament she did want to tease Frank ."
"No service was too humble , and Tommy and Ned came to blows before they could decide which should have the honor of blacking her little boots ."
"Nan was especially benefited by a week in the society of a well-bred lady , though such a very small one ; for Bess would look at her with a mixture of wonder and alarm in her great blue eyes when the hoyden screamed and romped ; and she shrunk from her as if she thought her a sort of wild animal ."
Warm-hearted Nan felt this very much .
"She said at first , `` Pooh !"
I do n't care ! ''
"But she did care , and was so hurt when Bess said , `` I love my tuzzin best , tause she is twiet , '' that she shook poor Daisy till her teeth chattered in her head , and then fled to the barn to cry dismally ."
In that general refuge for perturbed spirits she found comfort and good counsel from some source or other .
Perhaps the swallows from their mud-built nests overhead twittered her a little lecture on the beauty of gentleness .
"However that might have been , she came out quite subdued , and carefully searched the orchard for a certain kind of early apple that Bess liked because it was sweet and small and rosy ."
"Armed with this peace-offering , she approached the little Princess , and humbly presented it ."
"To her great joy it was graciously accepted , and when Daisy gave Nan a forgiving kiss , Bess did likewise , as if she felt that she had been too severe , and desired to apologize ."
"After this they played pleasantly together , and Nan enjoyed the royal favor for days ."
"To be sure she felt a little like a wild bird in a pretty cage at first , and occasionally had to slip out to stretch her wings in a long flight , or to sing at the top of her voice , where neither would disturb the plump turtle-dove Daisy , nor the dainty golden canary Bess ."
"But it did her good ; for , seeing how every one loved the little Princess for her small graces and virtues , she began to imitate her , because Nan wanted much love , and tried hard to win it ."
"Not a boy in the house but felt the pretty child 's influence , and was improved by it without exactly knowing how or why , for babies can work miracles in the hearts that love them ."
"Poor Billy found infinite satisfaction in staring at her , and though she did not like it she permitted without a frown , after she had been made to understand that he was not quite like the others , and on that account must be more kindly treated ."
"Dick and Dolly overwhelmed her with willow whistles , the only thing they knew how to make , and she accepted but never used them ."
"Rob served her like a little lover , and Teddy followed her like a pet dog ."
"Jack she did not like , because he was afflicted with warts and had a harsh voice ."
"Stuffy displeased her because he did not eat tidily , and George tried hard not to gobble , that he might not disgust the dainty little lady opposite ."
Ned was banished from court in utter disgrace when he was discovered tormenting some unhappy field-mice .
"Goldilocks could never forget the sad spectacle , and retired behind her veil when he approached , waving him away with an imperious little hand , and crying , in a tone of mingled grief and anger , `` No , I tar n't love him ; he tut the poor mouses ' little tails off , and they queeked ! ''"
"Daisy promptly abdicated when Bess came , and took the humble post of chief cook , while Nan was first maid of honor ; Emil was chancellor of the exchequer , and spent the public monies lavishly in getting up spectacles that cost whole ninepences ."
"Franz was prime minister , and directed her affairs of state , planned royal progresses through the kingdom , and kept foreign powers in order ."
"Demi was her philosopher , and fared much better than such gentlemen usually do among crowned heads ."
"Dan was her standing army , and defended her territories gallantly ; Tommy was court fool , and Nat a tuneful Rizzio to this innocent little Mary ."
"Uncle Fritz and Aunt Jo enjoyed this peaceful episode , and looked on at the pretty play in which the young folk unconsciously imitated their elders , without adding the tragedy that is so apt to spoil the dramas acted on the larger stage ."
"`` They teach us quite as much as we teach them , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
`` Bless the dears !
"they never guess how many hints they give us as to the best way of managing them , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` I think you were right about the good effect of having girls among the boys .
"Nan has stirred up Daisy , and Bess is teaching the little bears how to behave better than we can ."
"` Mumps one pound , that is what I have put down , but I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings -- do n't speak -- measles one five , German measles half a guinea , makes two fifteen six -- do n't waggle your finger -- whooping-cough , say fifteen shillings ' -- and so on it went , and it added up differently each time ; but at last Wendy just got through , with mumps reduced to twelve six , and the two kinds of measles treated as one ."
"There was the same excitement over John , and Michael had even a narrower squeak ; but both were kept , and soon you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom 's Kindergarten school , accompanied by their nurse ."
"Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so , and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours ; so , of course , they had a nurse ."
"As they were poor , owing to the amount of milk the children drank , this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog , called Nana , who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her ."
"She had always thought children important , however , and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens , where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators , and was much hated by careless nursemaids , whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses ."
She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse .
How thorough she was at bath-time ; and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry .
Of course her kennel was in the nursery .
She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking round your throat .
"She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf , and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs , and so on ."
"It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school , walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved , and butting them back into line if they strayed ."
"On John 's footer days she never once forgot his sweater , and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain ."
There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom 's school where the nurses wait .
"They sat on forms , while Nana lay on the floor , but that was the only difference ."
"They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves , and she despised their light talk ."
"She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling 's friends , but if they did come she first whipped off Michael 's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding , and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John 's hair ."
"No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly , and Mr. Darling knew it , yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked ."
He had his position in the city to consider .
Nana also troubled him in another way .
He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him . '
"I know she admires you tremendously , George , ' Mrs. Darling would assure him , and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father ."
"Lovely dances followed , in which the only other servant , Liza , was sometimes allowed to join ."
"Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid 's cap , though she had sworn , when engaged , that she would never see ten again ."
The gaiety of those romps !
"And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling , who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss , and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it ."
There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan .
Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children 's minds .
"It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning , repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day ."
"If you could keep awake -LRB- but of course you ca n't -RRB- you would see your own mother doing this , and you would find it very interesting to watch her ."
It is quite like tidying up drawers .
"You would see her on her knees , I expect , lingering humorously over some of your contents , wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up , making discoveries sweet and not so sweet , pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten , and hurriedly stowing that out of sight ."
"When you wake in the morning , the naughtinesses and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind ; and on the top , beautifully aired , are spread out your prettier thoughts , ready for you to put on ."
"To be easily pleased , for instance , and always to be really doing something , and to think that whatever he was doing was a thing of vast importance ."
"Peter became very clever at helping the birds to build their nests ; soon he could build better than a wood-pigeon , and nearly as well as a blackbird , though never did he satisfy the finches , and he made nice little water-troughs near the nests and dug up worms for the young ones with his fingers ."
"He also became very learned in bird-lore , and knew an east-wind from a west-wind by its smell , and he could see the grass growing and hear the insects walking about inside the tree-trunks ."
But the best thing Solomon had done was to teach him to have a glad heart .
"All birds have glad hearts unless you rob their nests , and so as they were the only kind of heart Solomon knew about , it was easy to him to teach Peter how to have one ."
"Peter 's heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long , just as the birds sing for joy , but , being partly human , he needed in instrument , so he made a pipe of reeds , and he used to sit by the shore of the island of an evening , practising the sough of the wind and the ripple of the water , and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon , and he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived , and they would say to each other , `` Was that a fish leaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish on his pipe ? ''"
"and sometimes he played the birth of birds , and then the mothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg ."
"If you are a child of the Gardens you must know the chestnut-tree near the bridge , which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts , but perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way ."
"It is because Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come , and the chestnut being so near , hears him and is cheated ."
"But as Peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he sometimes fell into sad thoughts and then the music became sad also , and the reason of all this sadness was that he could not reach the Gardens , though he could see them through the arch of the bridge ."
"He knew he could never be a real human again , and scarcely wanted to be one , but oh , how he longed to play as other children play , and of course there is no such lovely place to play in as the Gardens ."
"The birds brought him news of how boys and girls play , and wistful tears started in Peter 's eyes ."
Perhaps you wonder why he did not swim across .
The reason was that he could not swim .
"He wanted to know how to swim , but no one on the island knew the way except the ducks , and they are so stupid ."
"They were quite willing to teach him , but all they could say about it was , `` You sit down on the top of the water in this way , and then you kick out like that . ''"
"Peter tried it often , but always before he could kick out he sank ."
"What he really needed to know was how you sit on the water without sinking , and they said it was quite impossible to explain such an easy thing as that ."
"Occasionally swans touched on the island , and he would give them all his day 's food and then ask them how they sat on the water , but as soon as he had no more to give them the hateful things hissed at him and sailed away ."
Once he really thought he had discovered a way of reaching the Gardens .
"A wonderful white thing , like a runaway newspaper , floated high over the island and then tumbled , rolling over and over after the manner of a bird that has broken its wing ."
"Peter was so frightened that he hid , but the birds told him it was only a kite , and what a kite is , and that it must have tugged its string out of a boy 's hand , and soared away ."
"After that they laughed at Peter for being so fond of the kite , he loved it so much that he even slept with one hand on it , and I think this was pathetic and pretty , for the reason he loved it was because it had belonged to a real boy ."
"To the birds this was a very poor reason , but the older ones felt grateful to him at this time because he had nursed a number of fledglings through the German measles , and they offered to show him how birds fly a kite ."
So six of them took the end of the string in their beaks and flew away with it ; and to his amazement it flew after them and went even higher than they .
"Peter screamed out , `` Do it again ! ''"
"and with great good nature they did it several times , and always instead of thanking them he cried , `` Do it again ! ''"
which shows that even now he had not quite forgotten what it was to be a boy .
"At last , with a grand design burning within his brave heart , he begged them to do it once more with him clinging to the tail , and now a hundred flew off with the string , and Peter clung to the tail , meaning to drop off when he was over the Gardens ."
"But the kite broke to pieces in the air , and he would have drowned in the Serpentine had he not caught hold of two indignant swans and made them carry him to the island ."
After this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise .
"Nevertheless , Peter did reach the Gardens at last by the help of Shelley 's boat , as I am now to tell you ."
`` I took a vow upon me that I wouldnae carry it .
"Doubtless it 's a great privation ; but when I think upon the martyrs , not only to the Scottish Covenant but to other points of Christianity , I think shame to mind it . ''"
"As soon as we had eaten -LRB- and porridge and whey was the best of the good man 's diet -RRB- he took a grave face and said he had a duty to perform by Mr. Campbell , and that was to inquire into my state of mind towards God ."
I was inclined to smile at him since the business of the snuff ; but he had not spoken long before he brought the tears into my eyes .
"There are two things that men should never weary of , goodness and humility ; we get none too much of them in this rough world among cold , proud people ; but Mr. Henderland had their very speech upon his tongue ."
"And though I was a good deal puffed up with my adventures and with having come off , as the saying is , with flying colours ; yet he soon had me on my knees beside a simple , poor old man , and both proud and glad to be there ."
"Before we went to bed he offered me sixpence to help me on my way , out of a scanty store he kept in the turf wall of his house ; at which excess of goodness I knew not what to do ."
"But at last he was so earnest with me that I thought it the more mannerly part to let him have his way , and so left him poorer than myself ."
"CHAPTER XVII THE DEATH OF THE RED FOX The next day Mr. Henderland found for me a man who had a boat of his own and was to cross the Linnhe Loch that afternoon into Appin , fishing ."
"Him he prevailed on to take me , for he was one of his flock ; and in this way I saved a long day 's travel and the price of the two public ferries I must otherwise have passed ."
"It was near noon before we set out ; a dark day with clouds , and the sun shining upon little patches ."
"The sea was here very deep and still , and had scarce a wave upon it ; so that I must put the water to my lips before I could believe it to be truly salt ."
"The mountains on either side were high , rough and barren , very black and gloomy in the shadow of the clouds , but all silver-laced with little watercourses where the sun shone upon them ."
"It seemed a hard country , this of Appin , for people to care as much about as Alan did ."
There was but one thing to mention .
"A little after we had started , the sun shone upon a little moving clump of scarlet close in along the water-side to the north ."
"It was much of the same red as soldiers ' coats ; every now and then , too , there came little sparks and lightnings , as though the sun had struck upon bright steel ."
"I asked my boatman what it should be , and he answered he supposed it was some of the red soldiers coming from Fort William into Appin , against the poor tenantry of the country ."
"Well , it was a sad sight to me ; and whether it was because of my thoughts of Alan , or from something prophetic in my bosom , although this was but the second time I had seen King George 's troops , I had no good will to them ."
At last we came so near the point of land at the entering in of Loch Leven that I begged to be set on shore .
"My boatman -LRB- who was an honest fellow and mindful of his promise to the catechist -RRB- would fain have carried me on to Balachulish ; but as this was to take me farther from my secret destination , I insisted , and was set on shore at last under the wood of Lettermore -LRB- or Lettervore , for I have heard it both ways -RRB- in Alan 's country of Appin ."
"This was a wood of birches , growing on a steep , craggy side of a mountain that overhung the loch ."
"It had many openings and ferny howes ; and a road or bridle track ran north and south through the midst of it , by the edge of which , where was a spring , I sat down to eat some oat-bread of Mr. Henderland 's and think upon my situation ."
"Here I was not only troubled by a cloud of stinging midges , but far more by the doubts of my mind ."
"What I ought to do , why I was going to join myself with an outlaw and a would-be murderer like Alan , whether I should not be acting more like a man of sense to tramp back to the south country direct , by my own guidance and at my own charges , and what Mr. Campbell or even Mr. Henderland would think of me if they should ever learn my folly and presumption : these were the doubts that now began to come in on me stronger than ever ."
"As I was so sitting and thinking , a sound of men and horses came to me through the wood ; and presently after , at a turning of the road , I saw four travellers come into view ."
The way was in this part so rough and narrow that they came single and led their horses by the reins .
"The first was a great , red-headed gentleman , of an imperious and flushed face , who carried his hat in his hand and fanned himself , for he was in a breathing heat ."
"The second , by his decent black garb and white wig , I correctly took to be a lawyer ."
"The third was a servant , and wore some part of his clothes in tartan , which showed that his master was of a Highland family , and either an outlaw or else in singular good odour with the Government , since the wearing of tartan was against the Act ."
"If I had been better versed in these things , I would have known the tartan to be of the Argyle -LRB- or Campbell -RRB- colours ."
"This servant had a good-sized portmanteau strapped on his horse , and a net of lemons -LRB- to brew punch with -RRB- hanging at the saddle-bow ; as was often enough the custom with luxurious travellers in that part of the country ."
"I had little welcome when I came , and less kindness while I stayed ; but at least I was watched as I went away ."
"Alan and I went slowly forward upon our way , having little heart either to walk or speak ."
"The same thought was uppermost in both , that we were near the time of our parting ; and remembrance of all the bygone days sate upon us sorely ."
"We talked indeed of what should be done ; and it was resolved that Alan should keep to the county , biding now here , now there , but coming once in the day to a particular place where I might be able to communicate with him , either in my own person or by messenger ."
"In the meanwhile , I was to seek out a lawyer , who was an Appin Stewart , and a man therefore to be wholly trusted ; and it should be his part to find a ship and to arrange for Alan 's safe embarkation ."
"No sooner was this business done , than the words seemed to leave us ; and though I would seek to jest with Alan under the name of Mr. Thomson , and he with me on my new clothes and my estate , you could feel very well that we were nearer tears than laughter ."
"We came the by-way over the hill of Corstorphine ; and when we got near to the place called Rest-and-be-Thankful , and looked down on Corstorphine bogs and over to the city and the castle on the hill , we both stopped , for we both knew without a word said that we had come to where our ways parted ."
"Here he repeated to me once again what had been agreed upon between us : the address of the lawyer , the daily hour at which Alan might be found , and the signals that were to be made by any that came seeking him ."
"Then I gave what money I had -LRB- a guinea or two of Rankeillor 's -RRB- so that he should not starve in the meanwhile ; and then we stood a space , and looked over at Edinburgh in silence ."
"`` Well , good-bye , '' said Alan , and held out his left hand ."
"`` Good-bye , '' said I , and gave the hand a little grasp , and went off down hill ."
"Neither one of us looked the other in the face , nor so long as he was in my view did I take one back glance at the friend I was leaving ."
"But as I went on my way to the city , I felt so lost and lonesome , that I could have found it in my heart to sit down by the dyke , and cry and weep like any baby ."
It was coming near noon when I passed in by the West Kirk and the Grassmarket into the streets of the capital .
"The huge height of the buildings , running up to ten and fifteen storeys , the narrow arched entries that continually vomited passengers , the wares of the merchants in their windows , the hubbub and endless stir , the foul smells and the fine clothes , and a hundred other particulars too small to mention , struck me into a kind of stupor of surprise , so that I let the crowd carry me to and fro ; and yet all the time what I was thinking of was Alan at Rest-and-be-Thankful ; and all the time -LRB- although you would think I would not choose but be delighted with these braws and novelties -RRB- there was a cold gnawing in my inside like a remorse for something wrong ."
_BOOK_TITLE_ : Robert_Louis_Stevenson___The_Black_Arrow.txt.out
"PROLOGUE -- JOHN AMEND-ALL On a certain afternoon , in the late springtime , the bell upon Tunstall Moat House was heard ringing at an unaccustomed hour ."
"Far and near , in the forest and in the fields along the river , people began to desert their labours and hurry towards the sound ; and in Tunstall hamlet a group of poor country-folk stood wondering at the summons ."
"Tunstall hamlet at that period , in the reign of old King Henry VI. , wore much the same appearance as it wears to-day ."
"A score or so of houses , heavily framed with oak , stood scattered in a long green valley ascending from the river ."
"At the foot , the road crossed a bridge , and mounting on the other side , disappeared into the fringes of the forest on its way to the Moat House , and further forth to Holywood Abbey ."
"Half-way up the village , the church stood among yews ."
On every side the slopes were crowned and the view bounded by the green elms and greening oak-trees of the forest .
"Hard by the bridge , there was a stone cross upon a knoll , and here the group had collected -- half a dozen women and one tall fellow in a russet smock -- discussing what the bell betided ."
"An express had gone through the hamlet half an hour before , and drunk a pot of ale in the saddle , not daring to dismount for the hurry of his errand ; but he had been ignorant himself of what was forward , and only bore sealed letters from Sir Daniel Brackley to Sir Oliver Oates , the parson , who kept the Moat House in the master 's absence ."
"But now there was the noise of a horse ; and soon , out of the edge of the wood and over the echoing bridge , there rode up young Master Richard Shelton , Sir Daniel 's ward ."
"He , at the least , would know , and they hailed him and begged him to explain ."
"He drew bridle willingly enough -- a young fellow not yet eighteen , sun-browned and grey-eyed , in a jacket of deer 's leather , with a black velvet collar , a green hood upon his head , and a steel cross-bow at his back ."
"The express , it appeared , had brought great news ."
A battle was impending .
"Sir Daniel had sent for every man that could draw a bow or carry a bill to go post-haste to Kettley , under pain of his severe displeasure ; but for whom they were to fight , or of where the battle was expected , Dick knew nothing ."
"Sir Oliver would come shortly himself , and Bennet Hatch was arming at that moment , for he it was who should lead the party ."
"Molly fancied she washed and dressed him well enough ; but to-day she seemed to see more clearly , and sighed as she thought of the hard job in store for her if she gave him the thorough washing he needed , and combed out that curly mop of hair ."
`` I 'll clear up first and do that by and by .
"I ought to have a nice little tub and good towels , like Mrs. Minot , and I will , too , if I buy them myself , '' she said , piling up cups with an energy that threatened destruction to handles ."
"Miss Bat , who was trailing about the kitchen , with her head pinned up in a little plaid shawl , was so surprised by the demand for a pan of hot water and four clean towels , that she nearly dropped her snuff-box , chief comfort of her lazy soul ."
`` What new whimsey now ?
"Generally , the dishes stand round till I have time to pick 'em up , and you are off coasting or careering somewhere ."
"Well , this tidy fit wo n't last long , so I may as well make the most of it , '' said Miss Bat , as she handed out the required articles , and then pushed her spectacles from the tip of her sharp nose to her sharper black eyes for a good look at the girl who stood primly before her , with a clean apron on and her hair braided up instead of flying wildly about her shoulders ."
`` Umph ! ''
"was all the comment that Miss Bat made on this unusual neatness , and she went on scraping her saucepans , while Molly returned to her work , very well pleased with the effect of her first step , for she felt that the bewilderment of Miss Bat would be a constant inspiration to fresh efforts ."
"An hour of hard work produced an agreeable change in the abode of the native , for the table was cleared , room swept and dusted , fire brightened , and the holes in the sofa-covering were pinned up till time could be found to mend them ."
"To be sure , rolls of lint lay in corners , smears of ashes were on the stove hearth , and dust still lurked on chair rounds and table legs ."
"But too much must not be expected of a new convert , so the young missionary sat down to rest , well pleased and ready for another attempt as soon as she could decide in what direction it should be made ."
"She quailed before Boo as she looked at the unconscious innocent peacefully playing with the spotted dog , now bereft of his tail , and the lone sausage with which he was attempting to feed the hungry animal , whose red mouth always gaped for more ."
"`` It will be an awful job , and he is so happy I wo n't plague him yet ."
"Guess I 'll go and put my room to rights first , and pick up some clean clothes to put on him , if he is alive after I get through with him , '' thought Molly , foreseeing a stormy passage for the boy , who hated a bath as much as some people hate a trip across the Atlantic ."
"Up she went , and finding the fire out felt discouraged , thought she would rest a little more , so retired under the blankets to read one of the Christmas books ."
"The dinner-bell rang while she was still wandering happily in `` Nelly 's Silver Mine , '' and she ran down to find that Boo had laid out a railroad all across her neat room , using bits of coal for sleepers and books for rails , over which he was dragging the yellow sled laden with a dismayed kitten , the tailless dog , and the remains of the sausage , evidently on its way to the tomb , for Boo took bites at it now and then , no other lunch being offered him ."
`` Oh dear !
"why ca n't boys play without making such a mess , '' sighed Molly , picking up the feathers from the duster with which Boo had been trying to make a `` cocky-doo '' of the hapless dog ."
"`` I 'll wash him right after dinner , and that will keep him out of mischief for a while , '' she thought , as the young engineer unsuspiciously proceeded to ornament his already crocky countenance with squash , cranberry sauce , and gravy , till he looked more like a Fiji chief in full war-paint than a Christian boy ."
"`` I want two pails of hot water , please , Miss Bat , and the big tub , '' said Molly , as the ancient handmaid emptied her fourth cup of tea , for she dined with the family , and enjoyed her own good cooking in its prime ."
`` What are you going to wash now ? ''
"`` Boo -- I 'm sure he needs it enough ; '' and Molly could not help laughing as the victim added to his brilliant appearance by smearing the colors all together with a rub of two grimy hands , making a fine `` Turner '' of himself ."
"`` Now , Maria Louisa Bemis , you ai n't going to cut up no capers with that child !"
"The idea of a hot bath in the middle of the day , and him full of dinner , and croupy into the bargain !"
"Wet a corner of a towel at the kettle-spout and polish him off if you like , but you wo n't risk his life in no bath-tubs this cold day . ''"
"Miss Bat 's word was law in some things , so Molly had to submit , and took Boo away , saying , loftily , as she left the room , -- `` I shall ask father , and do it to-night , for I will not have my brother look like a pig . ''"
`` My patience !
"how the Siamese do leave their things round , '' she exclaimed , as she surveyed her room after making up the fire and polishing off Boo ."
"`` I 'll put things in order , and then mend up my rags , if I can find my thimble ."
"Now , let me see ; '' and she went to exploring her closet , bureau , and table , finding such disorder everywhere that her courage nearly gave out ."
"She had clothes enough , but all needed care ; even her best dress had two buttons off , and her Sunday hat but one string ."
"His age is one week , and though he was born so long ago he has never had a birthday , nor is there the slightest chance of his ever having one ."
The reason is that he escaped from being a human when he was seven days old ; he escaped by the window and flew back to the Kensington Gardens .
"If you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape , it shows how completely you have forgotten your own young days ."
"When David heard this story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to escape , but I told him to think back hard , pressing his hands to his temples , and when he had done this hard , and even harder , he distinctly remembered a youthful desire to return to the tree-tops , and with that memory came others , as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as soon as his mother was asleep , and how she had once caught him half-way up the chimney ."
"All children could have such recollections if they would press their hands hard to their temples , for , having been birds before they were human , they are naturally a little wild during the first few weeks , and very itchy at the shoulders , where their wings used to be ."
So David tells me .
"-LSB- Illustration : The fairies have their tiffs with the birds -RSB- I ought to mention here that the following is our way with a story : First I tell it to him , and then he tells it to me , the understanding being that it is quite a different story ; and then I retell it with his additions , and so we go on until no one could say whether it is more his story or mine ."
"In this story of Peter Pan , for instance , the bald narrative and most of the moral reflections are mine , though not all , for this boy can be a stern moralist ; but the interesting bits about the ways and customs of babies in the bird-stage are mostly reminiscences of David 's , recalled by pressing his hands to his temples and thinking hard ."
"Well , Peter Pan got out by the window , which had no bars ."
"Standing on the ledge he could see trees far away , which were doubtless the Kensington Gardens , and the moment he saw them he entirely forgot that he was now a little boy in a nightgown , and away he flew , right over the houses to the Gardens ."
"It is wonderful that he could fly without wings , but the place itched tremendously , and -- and -- perhaps we could all fly if we were as dead-confident-sure of our capacity to do it as was bold Peter Pan that evening ."
"He alighted gaily on the open sward , between the Baby 's Palace and the Serpentine , and the first thing he did was to lie on his back and kick ."
"He was quite unaware already that he had ever been human , and thought he was a bird , even in appearance , just the same as in his early days , and when he tried to catch a fly he did not understand that the reason he missed it was because he had attempted to seize it with his hand , which , of course , a bird never does ."
"He saw , however , that it must be past Lock-out Time , for there were a good many fairies about , all too busy to notice him ; they were getting breakfast ready , milking their cows , drawing water , and so on , and the sight of the water-pails made him thirsty , so he flew over to the Round Pond to have a drink ."
"He stooped and dipped his beak in the pond ; he thought it was his beak , but , of course , it was only his nose , and therefore , very little water came up , and that not so refreshing as usual , so next he tried a puddle and he fell flop into it ."
"When a real bird falls in flop , he spreads out his feathers and pecks them dry , but Peter could not remember what was the thing to do , and he decided rather sulkily to go to sleep on the weeping-beech in the Baby Walk ."
"At first he found some difficulty in balancing himself on a branch , but presently he remembered the way , and fell asleep ."
"He awoke long before morning , shivering , and saying to himself , ' I never was out on such a cold night ' ; he had really been out on colder nights when he was a bird , but , of course , as everybody knows , what seems a warm night to a bird is a cold night to a boy in a nightgown ."
"Peter also felt strangely uncomfortable , as if his head was stuffy ; he heard loud noises that made him look round sharply , though they were really himself sneezing ."
"There was something he wanted very much , but , though he knew he wanted it , he could not think what it was ."
"What he wanted so much was his mother to blow his nose , but that never struck him , so he decided to appeal to the fairies for enlightenment ."
They are reputed to know a good deal .
"-LSB- Illustration : When he heard Peter 's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip -RSB- There were two of them strolling along the Baby Walk , with their arms round each other 's waists , and he hopped down to address them ."
"The fairies have their tiffs with the birds , but they usually give a civil answer to a civil question , and he was quite angry when these two ran away the moment they saw him ."
"Another was lolling on a garden chair , reading a postage-stamp which some human had let fall , and when he heard Peter 's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip ."
To Peter 's bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from him .
"A band of workmen , who were sawing down a toadstool , rushed away , leaving their tools behind them ."
A milkmaid turned her pail upside down and hid in it .
Soon the Gardens were in an uproar .
"Crowds of fairies were running this way and that , asking each other stoutly who was afraid ; lights were extinguished , doors barricaded , and from the grounds of Queen Mab 's palace came the rub-a-dub of drums , showing that the royal guard had been called out ."
"A regiment of Lancers came charging down the Broad Walk , armed with holly-leaves , with which they jag the enemy horribly in passing ."
"Peter heard the little people crying everywhere that there was a human in the Gardens after Lock-out Time , but he never thought for a moment that he was the human ."
"""Who run?"" inquired Wolfe."
"""The French! The French!"" came the reply."
"""Now God be praised,"" said Wolfe, ""I die happy."""
"Montcalm had a similar experience. He was fatally wounded. ""They run!"
"They run!"" he heard some one say."
"""Who run?"" exclaimed Montcalm, wetting his lips with a lemonade-glass of cognac."
"""We do,"" replied the man."
"""Then so much the better,"" said Montcalm, as his eye lighted up, ""for I shall not live to see Quebec surrendered."""
This shows what can be done without a rehearsal; also how the historian has to control himself in order to avoid lying.
"The death of these two brave men is a beautiful and dramatic incident in the history of our country, and should be remembered by every school-boy, because neither lived to write articles criticising the other."
"Five days later the city capitulated. An attempt was made to recapture it, but it was not successful. Canada fell into the hands of the English, and from the open Polar Sea to the Mississippi the English flag floated."
What an empire!
What a game-preserve!
"Florida was now ceded to the already cedy crown of England by Spain, and brandy-and-soda for the wealthy and bitter beer became the drink of the poor."
"Pontiac's War was brought on by the Indians, who preferred the French occupation to that of the English. Pontiac organized a large number of tribes on the spoils plan, and captured eight forts. He killed a great many people, burned their dwellings, and drove out many more, but at last his tribes made trouble, as there were not spoils enough to go around, and his army was conquered. He was killed in 1769 by an Indian who received for his trouble a barrel of liquor, with which he began to make merry. He remained by the liquor till death came to his relief."
"The heroism of an Indian who meets his enemy single-handed in that way, and, though greatly outnumbered, dies with his face to the foe, is deserving of more than a passing notice."
"The French and Indian War cost the Colonists sixteen million dollars, of which the English repaid only five million. The Americans lost thirty thousand men, none of whom were replaced. They suffered every kind of horror and barbarity, written and unwritten, and for years their taxes were two-thirds of their income; and yet they did not murmur."
"These were the fathers and mothers of whom we justly brag. These were the people whose children we are. What are inherited titles and ancient names many times since dishonored, compared with the heritage of uncomplaining suffering and heroism which we boast of to-day because those modest martyrs were working people, proud that by the sweat of their brows they wrung from a niggardly soil the food they ate, proud also that they could leave the plough to govern or to legislate, able also to survey a county or rule a nation."
CHAPTER XII.
PERSONALITY OF WASHINGTON.
It would seem that a few personal remarks about George Washington at this point might not be out of place. Later on his part in this history will more fully appear.
"The author points with some pride to a study of Washington's great act in crossing the Delaware, from a wax-work of great accuracy. The reader will avoid confusing Washington with the author, who is dressed in a plaid suit and on the shore, while Washington may be seen in this end of the boat with the air of one who has just discovered the location of a glue-factory on the side of the river."
"A directory of Washington's head-quarters has been arranged by the author of this book, and at a reunion of the general's body-servants to be held in the future the work will be on sale."
The name of George Washington has always had about it a glamour that made him appear more in the light of a god than a tall man with large feet and a mouth made to fit an old-fashioned full-dress pumpkin pie.
"George Washington's face has beamed out upon us for many years now, on postage-stamps and currency, in marble and plaster and in bronze, in photographs of original portraits, paintings, and stereoscopic views. We have seen him on horseback and on foot, on the war-path and on skates, playing the flute, cussing his troops for their shiftlessness, and then, in the solitude of the forest, with his snorting war-horse tied to a tree, engaged in prayer."
"We have seen all these pictures of George, till we are led to believe that he did not breathe our air or eat American groceries. But George Washington was not perfect. I say this after a long and careful study of his life, and I do not say it to detract the very smallest iota from the proud history of the Father of his Country. I say it simply that the boys of America who want to become George Washingtons will not feel so timid about trying it."
"When I say that George Washington, who now lies so calmly in the lime-kiln at Mount Vernon, could reprimand and reproach his subordinates, at times, in a way to make the ground crack open and break up the ice in the Delaware a week earlier than usual, I do not mention it in order to show the boys of our day that profanity will make them resemble George Washington. That was one of his weak points, and no doubt he was ashamed of it, as he ought to have been. Some poets think that if they get drunk and stay drunk they will resemble Edgar A. Poe and George D. Prentice. There are lawyers who play poker year after year and get regularly skinned because they have heard that some of the able lawyers of the past century used to come home at night with poker-chips in their pockets."
"“Nothing is wanting, not even a hair, Be sure the Devil himself is there.”"
"Then it was Jergli’s turn to speak,"
"“If it be not, it’s at least his mother, Or else it’s the Devil’s own step-brother.”"
"And now Marli had a bright thought, and said to Veitli,"
"“Advance, Veitli, advance, advance, And I behind will hold the lance.”"
"Veitli, however, did not attend to that, and Jackli said,"
"“Tis Schulz’s place the first to be, No one deserves that honor but he.”"
"Then Master Schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,"
"“Then let us boldly advance to the fight, And thus we shall show our valour and might.”"
"Hereupon they all together set on the dragon. Master Schulz crossed himself and prayed for God’s assistance, but as all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer to the enemy, he screamed “Oho! oho! ho! ho! ho!” in the greatest anguish. This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted swiftly away. When Master Schulz saw her thus flying from the field of battle, he cried in his joy."
"“Quick, Veitli, quick, look there, look there, The monster’s nothing but a hare!”"
"But the Swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and came to the Moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are few bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in boats. As the seven Swabians did not know this, they called to a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to know how people contrived to get across. The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted, and he said “What? what?” in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves. Master Schulz thought he was saying, “Wade, wade through the water,” and as he was the first, began to set out and went into the moselle. It was not long before he sank in the mud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was blown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down beside it, and croaked “Wat, wat, wat.” The other six on the opposite side heard that, and said, “Oho, comrades, Master Schulz is calling us; if he can wade across, why cannot we?” So they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and were drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of them, and not one of the Swabian allies ever reached home again."
120 The Three Apprentices
"There were once three apprentices, who had agreed to keep always together while travelling, and always to work in the same town. At one time, however, their masters had no more work to give them, so that at last they were in rags, and had nothing to live on. Then one of them said, “What shall we do? We cannot stay here any longer, we will travel once more, and if we do not find any work in the town we go to, we will arrange with the innkeeper there, that we are to write and tell him where we are staying, so that we can always have news of each other, and then we will separate.” And that seemed best to the others also."
"They went forth, and met on the way a richly-dressed man who asked who they were. “We are apprentices looking for work; Up to this time we have kept together, but if we cannot find anything to do we are going to separate.” “There is no need for that,” said the man, “if you will do what I tell you, you shall not want for gold or for work; nay, you shall become great lords, and drive in your carriages!” One of them said, “If our souls and salvation be not endangered, we will certainly do it.” “They will not,” replied the man, “I have no claim on you.” One of the others had, however, looked at his feet, and when he saw a horse’s foot and a man’s foot, he did not want to have anything to do with him. The Devil, however, said, “Be easy, I have no designs on you, but on another soul, which is half my own already, and whose measure shall but run full.” As they were now secure, they consented, and the Devil told them what he wanted. The first was to answer, “All three of us,” to every question; the second was to say, “For money,” and the third, “And quite right too!” They were always to say this, one after the other, but they were not to say one word more, and if they disobeyed this order, all their money would disappear at once, but so long as they observed it, their pockets would always be full. As a beginning, he at once gave them as much as they could carry, and told them to go to such and such an inn when they got to the town. They went to it, and the innkeeper came to meet them, and asked if they wished for anything to eat? The first replied, “All three of us.” “Yes,” said the host, “that is what I mean.” The second said, “For money.” “Of course,” said the host. The third said, “And quite right too!”"
"“Certainly it is right,” said the host."
"Good meat and drink were now brought to them, and they were well waited on. After the dinner came the payment, and the innkeeper gave the bill to the one who said, “All three of us,” the second said, “For money,”"
"and the third, “and quite right too!” “Indeed it is right,” said the host, “all three pay, and without money I can give nothing.” They, however, paid still more than he had asked. The lodgers, who were looking on, said, “These people must be mad.” “Yes, indeed they are,”"
"said the host, “they are not very wise.” So they stayed some time in the inn, and said nothing else but, “All three of us,” “For money,” and “And quite right too!” But they saw and knew all that was going on. It so happened that a great merchant came with a large sum of money, and said, “Sir host, take care of my money for me, here are three crazy apprentices who might steal it from me.” The host did as he was asked."
"As he was carrying the trunk into his room, he felt that it was heavy with gold. Thereupon he gave the three apprentices a lodging below, but the merchant came up-stairs into a separate apartment. When it was midnight, and the host thought that all were asleep, he came with his wife, and they had an axe and struck the rich merchant dead; and after they had murdered him they went to bed again. When it was day there was a great outcry; the merchant lay dead in bed bathed in blood. All the guests ran at once but the host said, “The three crazy apprentices have done this;” the lodgers confirmed it, and said, “It can have been no one else.” The innkeeper, however, had them called, and said to them, “Have you killed the merchant?” “All three of us,” said the first, “For money,” said the second; and the third added, “And quite right too!”"
"“There now, you hear,” said the host, “they confess it themselves.”"
"They were taken to prison, therefore, and were to be tried. When they saw that things were going so seriously, they were after all afraid, but at night the Devil came and said, “Bear it just one day longer, and do not play away your luck, not one hair of your head shall be hurt.”"
"The next morning they were led to the bar, and the judge said, “Are you the murderers?” “All three of us.” “Why did you kill the merchant?”"
"“For money.” “You wicked wretches, you have no horror of your sins?”"
"“And quite right too!” “They have confessed, and are still stubborn,”"
"said the judge, “lead them to death instantly.” So they were taken out, and the host had to go with them into the circle. When they were taken hold of by the executioner’s men, and were just going to be led up to the scaffold where the headsman was standing with naked sword, a coach drawn by four blood-red chestnut horses came up suddenly, driving so fast that fire flashed from the stones, and someone made signs from the window with a white handkerchief. Then said the headsman, “It is a pardon coming,” and “Pardon! pardon!” was called from the carriage also. Then the Devil stepped out as a very noble gentleman, beautifully dressed, and said, “You three are innocent; you may now speak, make known what you have seen and heard.” Then said the eldest, “We did not kill the merchant, the murderer is standing there in the circle,” and he pointed to the innkeeper. “In proof of this, go into his cellar, where many others whom he has killed are still hanging.” Then the judge sent the executioner’s men thither, and they found it was as the apprentices said, and when they had informed the judge of this, he caused the innkeeper to be led up, and his head was cut off. Then said the Devil to the three, “Now I have got the soul which I wanted to have, and you are free, and have money for the rest of your lives.”"
121 The King’s Son Who Feared Nothing
"There was once a King’s son, who was no longer content to stay at home in his father’s house, and as he had no fear of anything, he thought, “I will go forth into the wide world, there the time will not seem long to me, and I shall see wonders enough.” So he took leave of his parents, and went forth, and on and on from morning till night, and whichever way his path led it was the same to him. It came to pass that he got to the house of a giant, and as he was so tired he sat down by the door and rested. And as he let his eyes roam here and there, he saw the giant’s playthings lying in the yard. These were a couple of enormous balls, and nine-pins as tall as a man. After a while he had a fancy to set the nine-pins up and then rolled the balls at them, and screamed and cried out when the nine-pins fell, and had a merry time of it. The giant heard the noise, stretched his head out of the window, and saw a man who was not taller than other men, and yet played with his nine-pins. “Little worm,” cried he, “why art thou playing with my balls? Who gave thee strength to do it?” The King’s son looked up, saw the giant, and said, “Oh, thou blockhead, thou thinkest indeed that thou only hast strong arms, I can do everything I want to do.” The giant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration, and said, “Child of man, if thou art one of that kind, go and bring me an apple of the tree of life.” “What dost thou want with it?” said the King’s son. “I do not want the apple for myself,” answered the giant, “but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it. I have travelled far about the world and cannot find the tree.” “I will soon find it,” said the King’s son, “and I do not know what is to prevent me from getting the apple down.” The giant said, “Thou really believest it to be so easy! The garden in which the tree stands is surrounded by an iron railing, and in front of the railing lie wild beasts, each close to the other, and they keep watch and let no man go in.” “They will be sure to let me in,” said the King’s son. “Yes, but even if thou dost get into the garden, and seest the apple hanging to the tree, it is still not thine; a ring hangs in front of it, through which any one who wants to reach the apple and break it off, must put his hand, and no one has yet had the luck to do it.” “That luck will be mine,” said the King’s son."
"Then he took leave of the giant, and went forth over mountain and valley, and through plains and forests, until at length he came to the wondrous garden."
"The beasts lay round about it, but they had put their heads down and were asleep. Moreover, they did not awake when he went up to them, so he stepped over them, climbed the fence, and got safely into the garden. There, in the very middle of it, stood the tree of life, and the red apples were shining upon the branches. He climbed up the trunk to the top, and as he was about to reach out for an apple, he saw a ring hanging before it; but he thrust his hand through that without any difficulty, and gathered the apple. The ring closed tightly on his arm, and all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his veins. When he had come down again from the tree with the apple, he would not climb over the fence, but grasped the great gate, and had no need to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud crash. Then he went out, and the lion which had been lying down before, was awake and sprang after him, not in rage and fierceness, but following him humbly as its master."
"The King’s son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and said, “Seest thou, I have brought it without difficulty.” The giant was glad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his bride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished. She was a beautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his arm, she said, “I shall never believe that thou hast brought the apple, until I see the ring on thine arm.” The giant said, “I have nothing to do but go home and fetch it,” and thought it would be easy to take away by force from the weak man, what he would not give of his own free will. He therefore demanded the ring from him, but the King’s son refused it. “Where the apple is, the ring must be also,” said the giant; “if thou wilt not give it of thine own accord, thou must fight with me for it.”"
"They wrestled with each other for a long time, but the giant could not get the better of the King’s son, who was strengthened by the magical power of the ring. Then the giant thought of a stratagem, and said, “I have got warm with fighting, and so hast thou. We will bathe in the river, and cool ourselves before we begin again.” The King’s son, who knew nothing of falsehood, went with him to the water, and pulled off with his clothes the ring also from his arm, and sprang into the river."
"However, the suggestion was not acted on. The Colonial soldiers declined to put on a bright red coat and a pill-box cap, that kept falling off in battle, thus delaying the carnage, but preferred to wear homespun which was of a neutral shade, and shoot their enemy from behind stumps. They said it was all right to dress up for a muster, but they preferred their working-clothes for fighting. After the war a statistician made the estimate that nine per cent. of the British troops were shot while ascertaining if their caps were on straight.[4]"
"General Israel Putnam was known as the champion rough rider of his day, and once when hotly pursued rode down three flights of steps, which, added to the flight he made from the English soldiers, made four flights. Putnam knew not fear or cowardice, and his name even to-day is the synonyme for valor and heroism."
CHAPTER XV.
"BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, LL.D., PH.G., F.R.S., ETC."
"It is considered advisable by the historian at this time to say a word regarding Dr. Franklin, our fellow-townsman, and a journalist who was the Charles A. Dana of his time."
"Franklin's memory will remain green when the names of the millionaires of to-day are forgotten. Coextensive with the name of E. Rosewater of the Omaha Bee we will find that of Benjamin Franklin, whose bust sits above the fireplace of the writer at this moment, while a large Etruscan hornet is making a phrenological examination of same."
But let us proceed to more fully mark out the life and labors of this remarkable man.
"Benjamin Franklin, formerly of Boston, came very near being an only child. If seventeen children had not come to bless the home of Benjamin's parents they would have been childless. Think of getting up in the morning and picking out your shoes and stockings from among seventeen pairs of them!"
"Imagine yourself a child, gentle reader, in a family where you would be called upon every morning to select your own cud of spruce gum from a collection of seventeen similar cuds stuck on a window-sill! And yet Benjamin Franklin never murmured or repined. He desired to go to sea, and to avoid this he was apprenticed to his brother James, who was a printer."
"It is said that Franklin at once took hold of the great Archimedean lever, and jerked it early and late in the interests of freedom."
"It is claimed that Franklin, at this time, invented the deadly weapon known as the printer's towel. He found that a common crash towel could be saturated with glue, molasses, antimony, concentrated lye, and roller-composition, and that after a few years of time and perspiration it would harden so that ""A Constant Reader"" or ""Veritas"" could be stabbed with it and die soon."
"Many believe that Franklin's other scientific experiments were productive of more lasting benefit to mankind than this, but I do not agree with them."
"His paper was called the New England Courant. It was edited jointly by James and Benjamin Franklin, and was started to supply a long-felt want."
"Benjamin edited it a part of the time, and James a part of the time. The idea of having two editors was not for the purpose of giving volume to the editorial page, but it was necessary for one to run the paper while the other was in jail."
"In those days you could not sass the king, and then, when the king came in the office the next day and stopped his paper and took out his ad., put it off on ""our informant"" and go right along with the paper. You had to go to jail, while your subscribers wondered why their paper did not come, and the paste soured in the tin dippers in the sanctum, and the circus passed by on the other side."
"How many of us to-day, fellow-journalists, would be willing to stay in jail while the lawn festival and the kangaroo came and went? Who of all our company would go to a prison-cell for the cause of freedom while a double-column ad. of sixteen aggregated circuses, and eleven congresses of ferocious beasts, fierce and fragrant from their native lair, went by us?"
"At the age of seventeen Ben got disgusted with his brother, and went to Philadelphia and New York, where he got a chance to ""sub"" for a few weeks and then got a regular ""sit."""
"Franklin was a good printer, and finally got to be a foreman. He made an excellent foreman, sitting by the hour in the composing-room and spitting on the stove, while he cussed the make-up and press-work of the other papers. Then he would go into the editorial rooms and scare the editors to death with a wild shriek for more copy."
He knew just how to conduct himself as a foreman so that strangers would think he owned the paper.
"In 1730, at the age of twenty-four, Franklin married, and established the Pennsylvania Gazette. He was then regarded as a great man, and almost every one took his paper."
"Franklin grew to be a great journalist, and spelled hard words with great fluency. He never tried to be a humorist in any of his newspaper work, and everybody respected him."
"Along about 1746 he began to study the habits and construction of lightning, and inserted a local in his paper in which he said that he would be obliged to any of his readers who might notice any new or odd specimens of lightning, if they would send them in to the Gazette office for examination."
"Every time there was a thunderstorm Franklin would tell the foreman to edit the paper, and, armed with a string and an old door-key, he would go out on the hills and get enough lightning for a mess."
"In 1753 Franklin was made postmaster of the Colonies. He made a good Postmaster-General, and people say there were fewer mistakes in distributing their mail then than there have ever been since. If a man mailed a letter in those days, old Ben Franklin saw that it went to where it was addressed."
"Franklin frequently went over to England in those days, partly on business and partly to shock the king. He liked to go to the castle with his breeches tucked in his boots, figuratively speaking, and attract a great deal of attention."
"Sherman's army of sixty thousand, after a month's rest at Savannah, started north to unite with Grant in the final blow. ""Before it was terror, behind it ashes."""
"Columbia was captured February 17, and burned, without Sherman's authority, the night following. Charleston was evacuated the next day."
"Johnston was recalled to take command, and opposed the march of Sherman, but was driven back after fierce engagements at Bentonville and Averysboro. On March 25 Lee decided to attack Grant, and, while the latter was busy, get out of Richmond and join Johnston, but when this battle, known as the attack on Fort Steadman, was over, Grant's hold was tighter than ever."
"Sheridan attacked Lee's rear with a heavy force, and at Five Forks, April 1, the surprised garrison was defeated with five thousand captured. The next day the entire Union army advanced, and the line of Confederate intrenchments was broken. On the following day Petersburg and Richmond were evacuated, but Mr. Davis was not there. He had gone away. Rather than meet General Grant and entertain him when there was no pie in the house, he and the Treasury had escaped from the haunts of man, wishing to commune with nature for a while. He was captured at Irwinsville, Georgia, under peculiar and rather amusing circumstances."
"He was never punished, with the exception perhaps that he published a book and did not realize anything from it."
"Lee fled to the westward, but was pursued by the triumphant Federals, especially by Sheridan, whose cavalry hung on his flanks day and night."
"Food failed the fleeing foe, and the young shoots of trees for food and the larger shoots of the artillery between meals were too much for that proud army, once so strong and confident."
Let us not dwell on the particulars.
"As Sheridan planted his cavalry squarely across Lee's path of retreat, the worn but heroic tatters of a proud army prepared to sell themselves for a bloody ransom and go down fighting, but Grant had demanded their surrender, and, seeing back of the galling, skirmishing cavalry solid walls of confident infantry, the terms of surrender were accepted by General Lee, and April 9 the Confederate army stacked its arms near Appomattox Court-House."
"The Confederate war debt was never paid, for some reason or other, but the Federal debt when it was feeling the best amounted to two billion eight hundred and forty-four million dollars. One million men lost their lives."
Was it worth while?
"In the midst of the general rejoicing, President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre, April 14. The assassin was captured in a dying condition in a burning barn, through a crack in the boarding of which he had been shot by a soldier named Boston Corbett. He died with no sympathetic applause to soothe the dull, cold ear of death."
"West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863, and Nevada in 1864."
"The following chapters will be devoted to more peaceful details, while we cheerfully close the sorrowful pages in which we have confessed that, with all our greatness as a nation, we could not stay the tide of war."
CHAPTER XXIX.
"TOO MUCH LIBERTY IN PLACES AND NOT ENOUGH ELSEWHERE. THOUGHTS ON THE LATE WAR WHO IS THE BIGGER ASS, THE MAN WHO WILL NOT FORGIVE AND FORGET, OR THE MAWKISH AND MOIST-EYED SNIVELLER WHO WANTS TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME?"
"When Patrick Henry put his old cast-iron spectacles on the top of his head and whooped for liberty, he did not know that some day we should have more of it than we knew what to do with. He little dreamed that the time would come when we should have more liberty than we could pay for."
"When Mr. Henry sawed the air and shouted for liberty or death, I do not believe that he knew the time would come when Liberty would stand on Bedloe's Island and yearn for rest and change of scene."
"It seems to me that we have too much liberty in this country in some ways. We have more liberty than we have money. We guarantee that every man in America shall fill himself up full of liberty at our expense, and the less of an American he is the more liberty he can have. Should he desire to enjoy himself, all he needs is a slight foreign accent and a willingness to mix up with politics as soon as he can get his baggage off the steamer. The more I study American institutions the more I regret that I was not born a foreigner, so that I could have something to say about the management of our great land. If I could not be a foreigner, I believe I should prefer to be a policeman or an Indian not taxed."
"I am often led to ask, in the language of the poet, ""Is civilization a failure, and is the Caucasian played out?"""
"Almost every one can have a good deal of fun in America except the American. He seems to be so busy paying his taxes that he has very little time to vote, or to mingle in society's giddy whirl, or to mix up with the nobility. That is the reason why the alien who rides across the United States in the ""Limited Mail"" and writes a book about us before breakfast wonders why we are always in a hurry. That also is the reason why we have to throw our meals into ourselves with such despatch, and hardly have time to maintain a warm personal friendship with our families."
"We do not care much for wealth, but we must have freedom, and freedom costs money. We have advertised to furnish a bunch of freedom to every man, woman, and child who comes to our shores, and we are going to deliver the goods whether we have any left for ourselves or not."
"What would the great world beyond the seas say to us if some day the blue-eyed Oriental, with his heart full of love for our female seminaries and our old women's homes, should land upon our coasts and crave freedom in car-load lots but find that we were using all the liberty ourselves? But what do we want of liberty, anyhow? What could we do with it if we had it? It takes a man of leisure to enjoy liberty, and we have no leisure whatever. It is a good thing to keep in the house for the use of guests, but we don't need it for ourselves."
"Therefore we have a statue of Liberty Enlightening the World, because it shows that we keep Liberty on tap winter and summer. We want the whole broad world to remember that when it gets tired of oppression it can come here to America and oppress us. We are used to it, and we rather like it. If we don't like it, we can get on the steamer and go abroad, where we may visit the effete monarchies and have a high old time."
"The sight of the Goddess of Liberty standing there in New York harbor night and day, bathing her feet in the rippling sea, is a good thing. It is first-rate. It may also be productive of good in a direction that many have not thought of. As she stands there day after day, bathing her feet in the broad Atlantic, perhaps some moss-grown alien landing on our shore and moving toward the Far West may fix the bright picture in his so-called mind, and, remembering how, on his arrival in New York, he saw Liberty bathing her feet with impunity, he may be led in after-years to try it on himself."
More citizens and less voters will some day be adopted as the motto of the Republic.
"One reference to the late war, and I will close. I want to refer especially to the chronic reconciler who when war was declared was not involved in it, but who now improves every opportunity, especially near election-time, to get out a tired olive-branch and make a tableau of himself. He is worse than the man who cannot forgive or forget."
"The growth of reconciliation between the North and the South is the slow growth of years, and the work of generations. When any man, North or South, in a public place takes occasion to talk in a mellow and mawkish way of the great love he now has for his old enemy, watch him. He is getting ready to ask a favor. There is a beautiful, poetic idea in the reunion of two contending and shattered elements of a great nation."
"There is something beautifully pathetic in the picture of the North and the South clasped in each other's arms and shedding a torrent of hot tears down each other's backs as it is done in a play, but do you believe that the aged mothers on either side have learned to love the foe with much violence yet? Do you believe that the crippled veteran, North or South, now passionately loves the adversary who robbed him of his glorious youth, made him a feeble ruin, and mowed down his comrades with swift death? Do you believe that either warrior is so fickle that he has entirely deserted the cause for which he fought? Even the victor cannot ask that."
"“I must do everything thou biddest me,” said the little man. “Good,”"
said the soldier; “then in the first place help me out of this well.”
"The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry."
"When he was above, he said to the little man, “Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.” In a short time she, with frightful cries, came riding by, as swift as the wind on a wild tom-cat, nor was it long after that before the little man re-appeared."
"“It is all done,” said he, “and the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?” inquired the dwarf. “At this moment, none,” answered the soldier; “Thou canst return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon thee.” “Nothing more is needed than that thou shouldst light thy pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before thee at once.” Thereupon he vanished from his sight."
"The soldier returned to the town from which he had come. He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsomely as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black mannikin and said, “I have served the King faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.” “What am I to do?” asked the little man. “Late at night, when the King’s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for me.” The mannikin said, “That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.” When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the mannikin carried in the princess. “Aha! art thou there?” cried the soldier, “get to thy work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.” When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said, “Pull off my boots for me,” and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the mannikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed."
"Next morning when the princess arose, she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream. “I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,” said she, “and taken into a soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.”"
"“The dream may have been true,” said the King, “I will give thee a piece of advice. Fill thy pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in it, and then if thou art carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.” But unseen by the King, the mannikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty mannikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until cock-crow."
"Next morning the King sent his people out to seek the track, but it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying, “It must have rained peas, last night.” “We must think of something else,” said the King; “keep thy shoes on when thou goest to bed, and before thou comest back from the place where thou art taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.” The black mannikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him."
"“Do what I bid thee,” replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed."
"Next morning the King had the entire town searched for his daughter’s shoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him, “Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.”"
"His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black mannikin. “Have no fear,” said the latter to his master. “Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.” Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favor of the King. “What is it?”"
"asked the King. “That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.” “Thou mayst smoke three,” answered the King, “but do not imagine that I will spare thy life.” Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the mannikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said, “What does my lord command?” “Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the King who has treated me so ill.”"
"Then the mannikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The King was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and the princess to wife."
117 The Wilful Child
"Once upon a time there was a child who was willful, and would not do at her mother wished. For this reason God had no pleasure in her, and let her become ill, and no doctor could do her any good, and in a short time she lay on her death-bed. When she had been lowered into her grave, and the earth was spread over her, all at once her arm came out again, and stretched upwards, and when they had put it in and spread fresh earth over it, it was all to no purpose, for the arm always came out again. Then the mother herself was obliged to go to the grave, and strike the arm with a rod, and when she had done that, it was drawn in, and then at last the child had rest beneath the ground."
118 The Three Army-Surgeons
"Three army-surgeons who thought they knew their art perfectly, were travelling about the world, and they came to an inn where they wanted to pass the night. The host asked whence they came, and whither they were going? “We are roaming about the world and practising our art.”"
"“Just show me for once in a way what you can do,” said the host. Then the first said he would cut off his hand, and put it on again early next morning; the second said he would tear out his heart, and replace it next morning; the third said he would cut out his eyes and heal them again next morning. “If you can do that,” said the innkeeper, “you have learnt everything.” They, however, had a salve, with which they rubbed themselves, which joined parts together, and they carried the little bottle in which it was, constantly with them. Then they cut the hand, heart and eyes from their bodies as they had said they would, and laid them all together on a plate, and gave it to the innkeeper. The innkeeper gave it to a servant who was to set it in the cupboard, and take good care of it. The girl, however, had a lover in secret, who was a soldier. When therefore the innkeeper, the three army-surgeons, and everyone else in the house were asleep, the soldier came and wanted something to eat. The girl opened the cupboard and brought him some food, and in her love forgot to shut the cupboard-door again; She seated herself at the table by her lover, and they chattered away together. While she sat so contentedly there, thinking of no ill luck, the cat came creeping in, found the cupboard open, took the hand and heart and eyes of the three army-surgeons, and ran off with them. When the soldier had done eating, and the girl was taking away the things and going to shut the cupboard she saw that the plate which the innkeeper had given her to take care of, was empty. Then she said in a fright to her lover, “Ah, miserable girl, what shall I do? The hand is gone, the heart and the eyes are gone too, what will become of me in the morning?” “Be easy,” said he, “I will help thee out of thy trouble there is a thief hanging outside on the gallows, I will cut off his hand. Which hand was it?” “The right one.” Then the girl gave him a sharp knife, and he went and cut the poor sinner’s right hand off, and brought it to her. After this he caught the cat and cut its eyes out, and now nothing but the heart was wanting. “Have you not been killing, and are not the dead pigs in the cellar?” said he. “Yes,” said the girl. “That’s well,” said the soldier, and he went down and fetched a pig’s heart. The girl placed all together on the plate, and put it in the cupboard, and when after this her lover took leave of her, she went quietly to bed."
"In the morning when the three army-surgeons got up, they told the girl she was to bring them the plate on which the hand, heart, and eyes were lying. Then she brought it out of the cupboard, and the first fixed the thief’s hand on and smeared it with his salve, and it grew to his arm directly. The second took the cat’s eyes and put them in his own head."
"The third fixed the pig’s heart firm in the place where his own had been, and the innkeeper stood by, admired their skill, and said he had never yet seen such a thing as that done, and would sing their praises and recommend them to everyone. Then they paid their bill, and travelled farther."
"As they were on their way, the one with the pig’s heart did not stay with them at all, but wherever there was a corner he ran to it, and rooted about in it with his nose as pigs do. The others wanted to hold him back by the tail of his coat, but that did no good; he tore himself loose, and ran wherever the dirt was thickest. The second also behaved very strangely; he rubbed his eyes, and said to the others, “Comrades, what is the matter? I don’t see at all. Will one of you lead me, so that I do not fall.” Then with difficulty they travelled on till evening, when they reached another inn. They went into the bar together, and there at a table in the corner sat a rich man counting money. The one with the thief’s hand walked round about him, made a sudden movement twice with his arm, and at last when the stranger turned away, he snatched at the pile of money, and took a handful from it. One of them saw this, and said, “Comrade, what art thou about? Thou must not steal shame on thee!” “Eh,” said he, “but how can I stop myself? My hand twitches, and I am forced to snatch things whether I will or not.”"
"After this, they lay down to sleep, and while they were lying there it was so dark that no one could see his own hand. All at once the one with the cat’s eyes awoke, aroused the others, and said. “Brothers, just look up, do you see the white mice running about there?” The two sat up, but could see nothing. Then said he, “Things are not right with us, we have not got back again what is ours. We must return to the innkeeper, he has deceived us.” They went back therefore, the next morning, and told the host they had not got what was their own again; that the first had a thief’s hand, the second cat’s eyes, and the third a pig’s heart. The innkeeper said that the girl must be to blame for that, and was going to call her, but when she had seen the three coming, she had run out by the backdoor, and not come back. Then the three said he must give them a great deal of money, or they would set his house on fire. He gave them what he had, and whatever he could get together, and the three went away with it. It was enough for the rest of their lives, but they would rather have had their own proper organs."
119 The Seven Swabians
"Seven Swabians were once together. The first was Master Schulz; the second, Jackli; the third, Marli; the fourth, Jergli; the fifth, Michal; the sixth, Hans; the seventh, Veitli: all seven had made up their minds to travel about the world to seek adventures, and perform great deeds. But in order that they might go in security and with arms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable that they should have one solitary, but very strong, and very long spear made for them."
"This spear all seven of them took in their hands at once; in front walked the boldest and bravest, and that was Master Schulz; all the others followed in a row, and Veitli was the last. Then it came to pass one day in the hay-making month (July), when they had walked a long distance, and still had a long way to go before they reached the village where they were to pass the night, that as they were in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet flew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing manner. Master Schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped the spear, and a cold perspiration broke out over his whole body. “Hark! hark!” cried he to his comrades, “Good heavens! I hear a drum.” Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and who perceived some kind of a smell, said, “Something is most certainly going on, for I taste powder and matches.” At these words Master Schulz began to take to flight, and in a trice jumped over a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of a rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the handle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous blow. “Oh dear! Oh dear!”"
screamed Master Schulz. “Take me prisoner; I surrender! I surrender!”
"The other six all leapt over, one on the top of the other, crying, “If you surrender, I surrender too! If you surrender, I surrender too!” At length, as no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that they had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not be known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they all swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one of them accidentally spoke of it. Then they journeyed onwards. The second danger which they survived cannot be compared with the first. Some days afterwards, their path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting sleeping in the sun. Her ears were standing straight up, and her great glassy eyes were wide open. All of them were alarmed at the sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together as to what it would be the least dangerous to do. For if they were to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and swallow them whole. So they said, “We must go through a great and dangerous struggle. Boldly ventured, is half won,” and all seven grasped the spear, Master Schulz in front, and Veitli behind. Master Schulz was always trying to keep the spear back, but Veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted to dash forward and cried,"
"“Strike home, in every Swabian’s name, Or else I wish ye may be lame.”"
"But Hans knew how to meet this, and said,"
"“Thunder and lightning, it’s fine to prate, But for dragon-hunting thou’rt aye too late.”"
"Michal cried,"
"“No,” replied the man, “but I must not remove the bandage, for whatsoever I look at with my eyes, splits to pieces, my glance is so powerful. If you can use that, I shall be glad to serve you.” “Come with me,” replied the King’s son, “I can make use of thee.” They journeyed onwards and found a man who was lying in the hot sunshine, trembling and shivering all over his body, so that not a limb was still. “How canst thou shiver when the sun is shining so warm?” said the King’s son. “Alack,” replied the man, “I am of quite a different nature. The hotter it is, the colder I am, and the frost pierces through all my bones; and the colder it is, the hotter I am. In the midst of ice, I cannot endure the heat, nor in the midst of fire, the cold.” “Thou art a strange fellow,” said the prince, “but if thou wilt enter my service, follow me.” They travelled onwards, and saw a man standing who made a long neck and looked about him, and could see over all the mountains. “What art thou looking at so eagerly?” said the King’s son. The man replied, “I have such sharp eyes that I can see into every forest and field, and hill and valley, all over the world.”"
"The prince said, “Come with me if thou wilt, for I am still in want of such an one.”"
"And now the King’s son and his six servants came to the town where the aged Queen dwelt. He did not tell her who he was, but said, “If you will give me your beautiful daughter, I will perform any task you set me.” The sorceress was delighted to get such a handsome youth as this into her net, and said, “I will set thee three tasks, and if thou art able to perform them all, thou shalt be husband and master of my daughter.” “What is the first to be?” “Thou shalt fetch me my ring which I have dropped into the Red Sea.” So the King’s son went home to his servants and said, “The first task is not easy. A ring is to be got out of the Red Sea. Come, find some way of doing it.” Then the man with the sharp sight said, “I will see where it is lying,” and looked down into the water and said, “It is sticking there, on a pointed stone.”"
"The Tall One carried them thither, and said, “I would soon get it out, if I could only see it.” “Oh, is that all!” cried the Stout One, and lay down and put his mouth to the water, on which all the waves fell into it just as if it had been a whirlpool, and he drank up the whole sea till it was as dry as a meadow. The Tall One stooped down a little, and brought out the ring with his hand. Then the King’s son rejoiced when he had the ring, and took it to the old Queen. She was astonished, and said, “Yes, it is the right ring. Thou hast safely performed the first task, but now comes the second. Dost thou see the meadow in front of my palace? Three hundred fat oxen are feeding there, and these must thou eat, skin, hair, bones, horns and all, and down below in my cellar lie three hundred casks of wine, and these thou must drink up as well, and if one hair of the oxen, or one little drop of the wine is left, thy life will be forfeited to me.” “May I invite no guests to this repast?” inquired the prince, “no dinner is good without some company.”"
"The old woman laughed maliciously, and replied, “Thou mayst invite one for the sake of companionship, but no more.”"
"The King’s son went to his servants and said to the Stout One, “Thou shalt be my guest to-day, and shalt eat thy fill.” Hereupon the Stout One stretched himself out and ate the three hundred oxen without leaving one single hair, and then he asked if he was to have nothing but his breakfast. He drank the wine straight from the casks without feeling any need of a glass, and he licked the last drop from his finger-nails. When the meal was over, the prince went to the old woman, and told her that the second task also was performed. She wondered at this and said, “No one has ever done so much before, but one task still remains,” and she thought to herself, “Thou shalt not escape me, and wilt not keep thy head on thy shoulders! This night,” said she, “I will bring my daughter to thee in thy chamber, and thou shalt put thine arms round her, but when you are sitting there together, beware of falling asleep. When twelve o’clock is striking, I will come, and if she is then no longer in thine arms, thou art lost.” The prince thought, “The task is easy, I will most certainly keep my eyes open.” Nevertheless he called his servants, told them what the old woman had said, and remarked, “Who knows what treachery lurks behind this? Foresight is a good thing keep watch, and take care that the maiden does not go out of my room again.” When night fell, the old woman came with her daughter, and gave her into the princes’s arms, and then the Tall One wound himself round the two in a circle, and the Stout One placed himself by the door, so that no living creature could enter. There the two sat, and the maiden spake never a word, but the moon shone through the window on her face, and the prince could behold her wondrous beauty. He did nothing but gaze at her, and was filled with love and happiness, and his eyes never felt weary. This lasted until eleven o’clock, when the old woman cast such a spell over all of them that they fell asleep, and at the self-same moment the maiden was carried away."
"Then they all slept soundly until a quarter to twelve, when the magic lost its power, and all awoke again. “Oh, misery and misfortune!” cried the prince, “now I am lost!” The faithful servants also began to lament, but the Listener said, “Be quiet, I want to listen.” Then he listened for an instant and said, “She is on a rock, three hundred leagues from hence, bewailing her fate. Thou alone, Tall One, canst help her; if thou wilt stand up, thou wilt be there in a couple of steps.”"
"“Yes,” answered the Tall One, “but the one with the sharp eyes must go with me, that we may destroy the rock.” Then the Tall One took the one with bandaged eyes on his back, and in the twinkling of an eye they were on the enchanted rock. The Tall One immediately took the bandage from the other’s eyes, and he did but look round, and the rock shivered into a thousand pieces. Then the Tall One took the maiden in his arms, carried her back in a second, then fetched his companion with the same rapidity, and before it struck twelve they were all sitting as they had sat before, quite merrily and happily. When twelve struck, the aged sorceress came stealing in with a malicious face, which seemed to say, “Now he is mine!” for she believed that her daughter was on the rock three hundred leagues off. But when she saw her in the prince’s arms, she was alarmed, and said, “Here is one who knows more than I do!” She dared not make any opposition, and was forced to give him her daughter."
"But she whispered in her ear, “It is a disgrace to thee to have to obey common people, and that thou art not allowed to choose a husband to thine own liking.”"
"On this the proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger, and she meditated revenge. Next morning she caused three hundred great bundles of wood to be got together, and said to the prince that though the three tasks were performed, she would still not be his wife until some one was ready to seat himself in the midst of the wood, and bear the fire. She thought that none of his servants would let themselves be burnt for him, and that out of love for her, he himself would place himself upon it, and then she would be free. But the servants said, “Every one of us has done something except the Frosty One, he must set to work,” and they put him in the middle of the pile, and set fire to it. Then the fire began to burn, and burnt for three days until all the wood was consumed, and when the flames had burnt out, the Frosty One was standing amid the ashes, trembling like an aspen leaf, and saying, “I never felt such a frost during the whole course of my life; if it had lasted much longer, I should have been benumbed!”"
"As no other pretext was to be found, the beautiful maiden was now forced to take the unknown youth as a husband. But when they drove away to church, the old woman said, “I cannot endure the disgrace,” and sent her warriors after them with orders to cut down all who opposed them, and bring back her daughter. But the Listener had sharpened his ears, and heard the secret discourse of the old woman. “What shall we do?”"
"said he to the Stout One. But he knew what to do, and spat out once or twice behind the carriage some of the sea-water which he had drunk, and a great sea arose in which the warriors were caught and drowned. When the sorceress perceived that, she sent her mailed knights; but the Listener heard the rattling of their armour, and undid the bandage from one eye of Sharp-eyes, who looked for a while rather fixedly at the enemy’s troops, on which they all sprang to pieces like glass. Then the youth and the maiden went on their way undisturbed, and when the two had been blessed in church, the six servants took leave, and said to their master, “Your wishes are now satisfied, you need us no longer, we will go our way and seek our fortunes.”"
"Half a league from the palace of the prince’s father was a village near which a swineherd tended his herd, and when they came thither the prince said to his wife, “Do you know who I really am? I am no prince, but a herder of swine, and the man who is there with that herd, is my father. We two shall have to set to work also, and help him.” Then he alighted with her at the inn, and secretly told the innkeepers to take away her royal apparel during the night. So when she awoke in the morning, she had nothing to put on, and the innkeeper’s wife gave her an old gown and a pair of worsted stockings, and at the same time seemed to consider it a great present, and said, “If it were not for the sake of your husband I should have given you nothing at all!” Then the princess believed that he really was a swineherd, and tended the herd with him, and thought to herself, “I have deserved this for my haughtiness and pride.” This lasted for a week, and then she could endure it no longer, for she had sores on her feet. And now came a couple of people who asked if she knew who her husband was. “Yes,” she answered, “he is a swineherd, and has just gone out with cords and ropes to try to drive a little bargain.” But they said, “Just come with us, and we will take you to him,” and they took her up to the palace, and when she entered the hall, there stood her husband in kingly raiment. But she did not recognize him until he took her in his arms, kissed her, and said, “I suffered much for thee and now thou, too, hast had to suffer for me.” And then the wedding was celebrated, and he who has told you all this, wishes that he, too, had been present at it."
135 The White Bride and the Black One
"A woman was going about the unenclosed land with her daughter and her step-daughter cutting fodder, when the Lord came walking towards them in the form of a poor man, and asked, “Which is the way into the village?” “If you want to know,” said the mother, “seek it for yourself,” and the daughter added, “If you are afraid you will not find it, take a guide with you.” But the step-daughter said, “Poor man, I will take you there, come with me.” Then God was angry with the mother and daughter, and turned his back on them, and wished that they should become as black as night and as ugly as sin. To the poor step-daughter, however, God was gracious, and went with her, and when they were near the village, he said a blessing over her, and spake, “Choose three things for thyself, and I will grant them to thee.” Then said the maiden, “I should like to be as beautiful and fair as the sun,” and instantly she was white and fair as day. “Then I should like to have a purse of money which would never grow empty.” That the Lord gave her also, but he said, “Do not forget what is best of all.” Said she, “For my third wish, I desire, after my death, to inhabit the eternal kingdom of Heaven.” That also was granted unto her, and then the Lord left her."
"When the step-mother came home with her daughter, and they saw that they were both as black as coal and ugly, but that the step-daughter was white and beautiful, wickedness increased still more in their hearts, and they thought of nothing else but how they could do her an injury. The step-daughter, however, had a brother called Reginer, whom she loved much, and she told him all that had happened. Once on a time Reginer said to her, “Dear sister, I will take thy likeness, that I may continually see thee before mine eyes, for my love for thee is so great that I should like always to look at thee.” Then she answered, “But, I pray thee, let no one see the picture.” So he painted his sister and hung up the picture in his room; he, however, dwelt in the King’s palace, for he was his coachman. Every day he went and stood before the picture, and thanked God for the happiness of having such a dear sister. Now it happened that the King whom he served, had just lost his wife, who had been so beautiful that no one could be found to compare with her, and on this account the King was in deep grief. The attendants about the court, however, remarked that the coachman stood daily before this beautiful picture, and they were jealous of him, so they informed the King. Then the latter ordered the picture to be brought to him, and when he saw that it was like his lost wife in every respect, except that it was still more beautiful, he fell mortally in love with it. He caused the coachman to be brought before him, and asked whom the portrait represented? The coachman said it was his sister, so the King resolved to take no one but her as his wife, and gave him a carriage and horses and splendid garments of cloth of gold, and sent him forth to fetch his chosen bride. When Reginer came on this errand, his sister was glad, but the black maiden was jealous of her good fortune, and grew angry above all measure, and said to her mother, “Of what use are all your arts to us now when you cannot procure such a piece of luck for me?” “Be quiet,” said the old woman, “I will soon divert it to you,” and by her arts of witchcraft, she so troubled the eyes of the coachman that he was half-blind, and she stopped the ears of the white maiden so that she was half-deaf. Then they got into the carriage, first the bride in her noble royal apparel, then the step-mother with her daughter, and Reginer sat on the box to drive."
"When they had been on the way for some time the coachman cried,"
"“Cover thee well, my sister dear, That the rain may not wet thee, That the wind may not load thee with dust, That thou may’st be fair and beautiful When thou appearest before the King.”"
"The bride asked, “What is my dear brother saying?” “Ah,” said the old woman, “he says that you ought to take off your golden dress and give it to your sister.” Then she took it off, and put it on the black maiden, who gave her in exchange for it a shabby grey gown. They drove onwards, and a short time afterwards, the brother again cried,"
"“Cover thee well, my sister dear, That the rain may not wet thee, That the wind may not load thee with dust, That thou may’st be fair and beautiful When thou appearest before the King.”"
"The bride asked, “What is my dear brother saying?” “Ah,” said the old woman, “he says that you ought to take off your golden hood and give it to your sister.” So she took off the hood and put it on her sister, and sat with her own head uncovered. And they drove on farther. After a while, the brother once more cried,"
"“Cover thee well, my sister dear, That the rain may not wet thee, That the wind may not load thee with dust, That thou may’st be fair and beautiful When thou appearest before the King.”"
"The bride asked, “What is my dear brother saying?” “Ah,” said the old woman, “he says you must look out of the carriage.” They were, however, just on a bridge, which crossed deep water. When the bride stood up and leant forward out of the carriage, they both pushed her out, and she fell into the middle of the water. At the same moment that she sank, a snow-white duck arose out of the mirror-smooth water, and swam down the river. The brother had observed nothing of it, and drove the carriage on until they reached the court. Then he took the black maiden to the King as his sister, and thought she really was so, because his eyes were dim, and he saw the golden garments glittering. When the King saw the boundless ugliness of his intended bride, he was very angry, and ordered the coachman to be thrown into a pit which was full of adders and nests of snakes. The old witch, however, knew so well how to flatter the King and deceive his eyes by her arts, that he kept her and her daughter until she appeared quite endurable to him, and he really married her."
"One evening when the black bride was sitting on the King’s knee, a white duck came swimming up the gutter to the kitchen, and said to the kitchen-boy, “Boy, light a fire, that I may warm my feathers.” The kitchen-boy did it, and lighted a fire on the hearth. Then came the duck and sat down by it, and shook herself and smoothed her feathers to rights with her bill. While she was thus sitting and enjoying herself, she asked, “What is my brother Reginer doing?” The scullery-boy replied, “He is imprisoned in the pit with adders and with snakes.”"
"Then she asked, “What is the black witch doing in the house?” The boy answered, “She is loved by the King and happy.”"
"“May God have mercy on him,” said the duck, and swam forth by the sink."
"The next night she came again and put the same questions, and the third night also. Then the kitchen-boy could bear it no longer, and went to the King and discovered all to him. The King, however, wanted to see it for himself, and next evening went thither, and when the duck thrust her head in through the sink, he took his sword and cut through her neck, and suddenly she changed into a most beautiful maiden, exactly like the picture, which her brother had made of her. The King was full of joy, and as she stood there quite wet, he caused splendid apparel to be brought and had her clothed in it. Then she told how she had been betrayed by cunning and falsehood, and at last thrown down into the water, and her first request was that her brother should be brought forth from the pit of snakes, and when the King had fulfilled this request, he went into the chamber where the old witch was, and asked, What does she deserve who does this and that? and related what had happened. Then was she so blinded that she was aware of nothing and said, “She deserves to be stripped naked, and put into a barrel with nails, and that a horse should be harnessed to the barrel, and the horse sent all over the world.” All of which was done to her, and to her black daughter. But the King married the white and beautiful bride, and rewarded her faithful brother, and made him a rich and distinguished man."
136 Iron John
"There was once on a time a King who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. “Perhaps some accident has befallen him,” said the King, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away. Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said, “Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until ye have found all three.” But of these also, none came home again, and of the pack of hounds which they had taken with them, none were seen more. From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for many years, when a strange huntsman announced himself to the King as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The King, however, would not give his consent, and said, “It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with thee no better than with the others, and thou wouldst never come out again.” The huntsman replied, “Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.”"
"The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under, When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There was great astonishment over the wild man; the King, however, had him put in an iron cage in his court-yard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the Queen herself was to take the key into her keeping. And from this time forth every one could again go into the forest with safety."
"The King had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the court-yard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran thither and said, “Give me my ball out.” “Not till thou hast opened the door for me,” answered the man. “No,” said the boy, “I will not do that; the King has forbidden it,” and ran away. The next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said, “Open my door,” but the boy would not. On the third day the King had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said, “I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.” Then the wild man said, “It lies under thy mother’s pillow, thou canst get it there.” The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him, “Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!”"
"The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the King came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the Queen how that had happened? She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The King sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court."
"""There were domes of white blossoms where swelled the white tent;   There were ploughs in the track where the war-wagons went;   There were songs where they lifted up Rachel's lament."""
"October 8, 1871, occurred the great fire in Chicago, raging for forty-eight hours and devastating three thousand acres of the city."
"Twenty-five thousand buildings were burned, and two hundred million dollars' worth of property. One hundred thousand people lost their houses, and over seven and one-half millions of dollars were raised for those who needed it, all parts of the world uniting to improve the joyful opportunity to do good, without a doubt of its hearty appreciation."
"Boston also had a seventy-million dollar fire in the heart of the wholesale trade, covering sixty acres; and in the prairie and woods fires of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, many people lost not only their homes but their lives. Fifteen hundred people perished in Wisconsin alone."
"In 1871 the damage done by the Alabama, a British-built ship, and several other cruisers sent out partly to facilitate the cotton trade and partly to do a little fighting when a Federal vessel came that way, was assessed at fifteen million five hundred thousand dollars against Great Britain by the arbitrators who met at Geneva, Switzerland, and the northwestern boundary line between the United States and British America was settled by arbitration, the Emperor of Germany acting as arbitrator and deciding in favor of America."
"This showed that people who have just wound up a big war have often learned some valuable sense; not two billion dollars' worth, perhaps, but some."
"San Domingo was reported for sale, and a committee looked at it, priced it, etc., but Congress decided not to buy it."
"The Liberal Republican party, or that element of the original party which was opposed to the administration, nominated Horace Greeley, of New York, while the old party renominated General Grant for the term to succeed himself. The latter was elected, and Mr. Greeley did not long survive his defeat."
"The Modoc Indians broke loose in the early part of Grant's second term, and, leaping from their lava-beds early in the morning, Shacknasty Jim and other unlaundried children of the forest raised merry future punishment, and the government, always kind, always loving and sweet toward the red brother, sent a peace commission with popcorn balls and a gentle-voiced parson to tell Shacknasty James and Old Stand-up-and-Sit-down that the white father at Washington loved them and wanted them all to come and spend the summer at his house, and also that by sin death came into the world, and that we were all primordial germs at first, and that we should look up, not down, look out, not in, look forward, not backward, and lend a hand."
"It was at this moment that Early-to-Bed-and Early-to-Rise-Black Hawk and Shacknasty James, thinking that this thing had gone far enough, killed General Canby and wounded both Mr. Meacham and Rev. Dr. Thomas, who had never had an unkind thought toward the Modocs in their lives."
"The troops then allowed their ill temper to get the best of them, and asked the Modocs if they meant anything personal by their action, and, learning that they did, the soldiers did what with the proper authority they would have done at first, bombarded the children of the forest and mussed up their lava-beds so that they were glad to surrender."
"In 1873 a panic occurred after the failure of Jay Cooke & Co., of Philadelphia, and a money stringency followed, the Democrats attributing it a good deal to the party in power, just as cheap Republicans twenty years later charged the Democratic administration with this same thing."
"Inconsistency of this kind keeps good men, like the writer, out of politics, and turns their attention toward the contemplation of a better land."
"In 1875 Centennial Anniversaries began to ripen and continued to fall off the different branches of government, according to the history of events so graphically set forth in the preceding pages. They were duly celebrated by a happy and self-made people. The Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876 was a marked success in every way, nearly ten millions of people having visited it, who claimed that it was well worth the price of admission."
"Aside from the fact that these ten millions of people had talked about it to millions of folks at home, or thought they had, the Exposition was a boon to every one, and thousands of Americans went home with a knowledge of their country that they had never had before, and pointers on blowing out gas which saved many lives in after-years."

CLOSING CHRONICLES.
"In 1876 the peaceful Sioux took an outing, having refused to go to their reservation in accordance with the treaty made with the Great Father at Washington, D. C., and regular troops were sent against them."
"General Custer, with the 7th Regiment, led the advance, and General Terry aimed for the rear of the children of the forest up the Big Horn."
"Here, on the 25th of June, without assistance, and with characteristic courage, General Custer attacked the enemy, sending Colonel Reno to fall on the rear of the village."
"Scarcely enough of Custer's own command with him at the time lived long enough to tell the story of the battle. General Custer, his two brothers, and his nephew were among the dead. Reno held his ground until reinforced, but Custer's troops were exterminated."
"It is said that the Sioux rose from the ground like bunch-grass and swarmed up the little hill like a pest of grasshoppers, mowing down the soldiers with the very newest and best weapons of warfare, and leaving nothing at last but the robbed and mutilated bodies lying naked in the desolate land of the Dakotah."
"The Fenimore Cooper Indian is no doubt a brave and highly intellectual person, educated abroad, refined and cultivated by foreign travel, graceful in the grub dance or scalp walk-around, yet tender-hearted as a girl, walking by night fifty-seven miles in a single evening to warn his white friends of danger. The Indian introduced into literature was a bronze Apollo who bathed almost constantly and only killed white people who were unpleasant and coarse. He dressed in new and fresh buckskins, with trimming of same, and his sable hair hung glossy and beautiful down the coppery billows of muscles on his back."
"The real Indian has the dead and unkempt hair of a busted buggy-cushion filled with hen feathers. He lies, he steals, he assassinates, he mutilates, he tortures. He needs Persian powder long before he needs the theology which abler men cannot agree upon. We can, in fact, only retain him as we do the buffalo, so long as he complies with the statutes. But the red brother is on his way to join the cave-bear, the three-toed horse, and the ichthyosaurus in the great fossil realm of the historic past. Move on, maroon brother, move on!"
"Rutherford B. Hayes and William A. Wheeler were nominated in the summer of 1876, and so close was the fight against Samuel J. Tilden and Thomas A. Hendricks that friends of the latter to this day refer to the selection of Hayes and Wheeler by a joint Electoral Commission to whom the contested election was referred, as a fraud and larceny on the part of the Republican party. It is not the part of an historian, who is absolutely destitute of political principles, to pass judgment. Facts have crept into this history, it is true, but no one could regret it more than the author; yet there has been no bias or political prejudice shown, other than that reflected from the historical sources whence information was necessarily obtained."
"Hayes was chosen, and gave the country an unruffled, unbiased administration, devoid of frills, and absolutely free from the appearance of hostility to any one. He was one of the most conciliatory Presidents ever elected by Republican votes or counted in by a joint Electoral Commission."
"He withdrew all troops from the South, and in several Southern States things wore a Democratic air at once."
"In 1873 Congress demonetized silver, and quite a number of business-men were demonetized at the same time; so in 1878 silver was made a legal tender for all debts. As a result, in 1879 gold for the first time in seventeen years sold at par."
"Many a time he thought he had found it, but then it seemed to him to be, after all, too little. Then it came into his mind, what an easy life his wife had, for she stayed at home in a cool room and enjoyed herself. This really did vex him, and before he was aware, he said, “I just wish she was sitting there on this saddle, and could not get off it, instead of my having to drag it along on my back.” And as the last word was spoken, the saddle disappeared from his back, and he saw that his second wish had been fulfilled. Then he really did feel warm. He began to run and wanted to be quite alone in his own room at home, to think of something really large for his last wish. But when he arrived there and opened the parlour-door, he saw his wife sitting in the middle of the room on the saddle, crying and complaining, and quite unable to get off it. So he said, “Do bear it, and I will wish for all the riches on earth for thee, only stay where thou art.” She, however, called him a fool, and said, “What good will all the riches on earth do me, if I am to sit on this saddle? Thou hast wished me on it, so thou must help me off.” So whether he would or not, he was forced to let his third wish be that she should be quit of the saddle, and able to get off it, and immediately the wish was fulfilled. So he got nothing by it but vexation, trouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily, quietly, and piously until their happy death."
"88 The Singing, Springing Lark"
"There was once on a time a man who was about to set out on a long journey, and on parting he asked his three daughters what he should bring back with him for them. Whereupon the eldest wished for pearls, the second wished for diamonds, but the third said, “Dear father, I should like a singing, soaring lark.” The father said, “Yes, if I can get it, you shall have it,” kissed all three, and set out. Now when the time had come for him to be on his way home again, he had brought pearls and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for a singing, soaring lark for the youngest, and he was very unhappy about it, for she was his favorite child. Then his road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a splendid castle, and near the castle stood a tree, but quite on the top of the tree, he saw a singing, soaring lark. “Aha, you come just at the right moment!” he said, quite delighted, and called to his servant to climb up and catch the little creature. But as he approached the tree, a lion leapt from beneath it, shook himself, and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled. “He who tries to steal my singing, soaring lark,” he cried, “will I devour.” Then the man said, “I did not know that the bird belonged to thee. I will make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself with a large sum of money, only spare my life.” The lion said, “Nothing can save thee, unless thou wilt promise to give me for mine own what first meets thee on thy return home; and if thou wilt do that, I will grant thee thy life, and thou shalt have the bird for thy daughter, into the bargain.” But the man hesitated and said, “That might be my youngest daughter, she loves me best, and always runs to meet me on my return home.” The servant, however, was terrified and said, “Why should your daughter be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or dog?” Then the man allowed himself to be over-persuaded, took the singing, soaring lark, and promised to give the lion whatsoever should first meet him on his return home."
"When he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was no other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up, kissed and embraced him, and when she saw that he had brought with him a singing, soaring lark, she was beside herself with joy. The father, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said, “My dearest child, I have bought the little bird dear. In return for it, I have been obliged to promise thee to a savage lion, and when he has thee he will tear thee in pieces and devour thee,” and he told her all, just as it had happened, and begged her not to go there, come what might. But she consoled him and said, “Dearest father, indeed your promise must be fulfilled. I will go thither and soften the lion, so that I may return to thee safely.” Next morning she had the road pointed out to her, took leave, and went fearlessly out into the forest. The lion, however, was an enchanted prince and was by day a lion, and all his people were lions with him, but in the night they resumed their natural human shapes. On her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle."
"When night came, the lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding was celebrated with great magnificence. They lived happily together, remained awake at night, and slept in the daytime. One day he came and said, “To-morrow there is a feast in thy father’s house, because your eldest sister is to be married, and if thou art inclined to go there, my lions shall conduct thee.” She said, “Yes, I should very much like to see my father again,” and went thither, accompanied by the lions."
"There was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that she had been torn in pieces by the lion, and had long ceased to live."
"But she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she was, remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then went back again to the forest. When the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again invited to the wedding, she said to the lion, “This time I will not be alone, thou must come with me.” The lion, however, said that it was too dangerous for him, for if when there a ray from a burning candle fell on him, he would be changed into a dove, and for seven years long would have to fly about with the doves. She said, “Ah, but do come with me, I will take great care of thee, and guard thee from all light.” So they went away together, and took with them their little child as well. She had a chamber built there, so strong and thick that no ray could pierce through it; in this he was to shut himself up when the candles were lit for the wedding-feast. But the door was made of green wood which warped and left a little crack which no one noticed. The wedding was celebrated with magnificence, but when the procession with all its candles and torches came back from church, and passed by this apartment, a ray about the breadth of a hair fell on the King’s son, and when this ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant, and when she came in and looked for him, she did not see him, but a white dove was sitting there. The dove said to her, “For seven years must I fly about the world, but at every seventh step that you take I will let fall a drop of red blood and a white feather, and these will show thee the way, and if thou followest the trace thou canst release me.” Thereupon the dove flew out at the door, and she followed him, and at every seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather fell down and showed her the way."
"So she went continually further and further in the wide world, never looking about her or resting, and the seven years were almost past; then she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered, and yet they were so far from it! Once when they were thus moving onwards, no little feather and no drop of red blood fell, and when she raised her eyes the dove had disappeared. And as she thought to herself, “In this no man can help thee,” she climbed up to the sun, and said to him, “Thou shinest into every crevice, and over every peak, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?” “No,” said the sun, “I have seen none, but I present thee with a casket, open it when thou art in sorest need.” Then she thanked the sun, and went on until evening came and the moon appeared; she then asked her, “Thou shinest the whole night through, and on every field and forest, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?”"
"“No,” said the moon, “I have seen no dove, but here I give thee an egg, break it when thou art in great need.” She thanked the moon, and went on until the night wind came up and blew on her, then she said to it, “Thou blowest over every tree and under every leaf, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?” “No,” said the night wind, “I have seen none, but I will ask the three other winds, perhaps they have seen it.” The east wind and the west wind came, and had seen nothing, but the south wind said, “I have seen the white dove, it has flown to the Red Sea, where it has become a lion again, for the seven years are over, and the lion is there fighting with a dragon; the dragon, however, is an enchanted princess.” The night wind then said to her, “I will advise thee; go to the Red Sea, on the right bank are some tall reeds, count them, break off the eleventh, and strike the dragon with it, then the lion will be able to subdue it, and both then will regain their human form. After that, look round and thou wilt see the griffin which is by the Red Sea; swing thyself, with thy beloved, on to his back, and the bird will carry you over the sea to your own home. Here is a nut for thee, when thou are above the center of the sea, let the nut fall, it will immediately shoot up, and a tall nut-tree will grow out of the water on which the griffin may rest; for if he cannot rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you across, and if thou forgettest to throw down the nut, he will let you fall into the sea.”"
"Then she went thither, and found everything as the night wind had said."
"She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh, struck the dragon therewith, whereupon the lion overcame it, and immediately both of them regained their human shapes. But when the princess, who had before been the dragon, was delivered from enchantment, she took the youth by the arm, seated herself on the griffin, and carried him off with her. There stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was again forsaken. She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and said, “Still I will go as far as the wind blows and as long as the cock crows, until I find him,” and she went forth by long, long roads, until at last she came to the castle where both of them were living together; there she heard that soon a feast was to be held, in which they would celebrate their wedding, but she said, “God still helps me,”"
"and opened the casket that the sun had given her. A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself. So she took it out and put it on, and went up into the castle, and everyone, even the bride herself, looked at her with astonishment. The dress pleased the bride so well that she thought it might do for her wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale? “Not for money or land,” answered she, “but for flesh and blood.”"
"The bride asked her what she meant by that, so she said, “Let me sleep a night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.” The bride would not, yet wanted very much to have the dress; at last she consented, but the page was to give the prince a sleeping-draught. When it was night, therefore, and the youth was already asleep, she was led into the chamber; she seated herself on the bed and said, “I have followed after thee for seven years. I have been to the sun and the moon, and the four winds, and have enquired for thee, and have helped thee against the dragon; wilt thou, then quite forget me?” But the prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind were whistling outside in the fir-trees. When therefore day broke, she was led out again, and had to give up the golden dress. And as that even had been of no avail, she was sad, went out into a meadow, sat down there, and wept. While she was sitting there, she thought of the egg which the moon had given her; she opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve chickens all of gold, and they ran about chirping, and crept again under the old hen’s wings; nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world! Then she arose, and drove them through the meadow before her, until the bride looked out of the window. The little chickens pleased her so much that she immediately came down and asked if they were for sale. “Not for money or land, but for flesh and blood; let me sleep another night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.”"
"The bride said, “Yes,” intending to cheat her as on the former evening."
"But when the prince went to bed he asked the page what the murmuring and rustling in the night had been? On this the page told all; that he had been forced to give him a sleeping-draught, because a poor girl had slept secretly in the chamber, and that he was to give him another that night. The prince said, “Pour out the draught by the bed-side.” At night, she was again led in, and when she began to relate how ill all had fared with her, he immediately recognized his beloved wife by her voice, sprang up and cried, “Now I really am released! I have been as it were in a dream, for the strange princess has bewitched me so that I have been compelled to forget thee, but God has delivered me from the spell at the right time.” Then they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they feared the father of the princess, who was a sorcerer, and they seated themselves on the griffin which bore them across the Red Sea, and when they were in the midst of it, she let fall the nut. Immediately a tall nut-tree grew up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried them home, where they found their child, who had grown tall and beautiful, and they lived thenceforth happily until their death."
89 The Goose-Girl
"There was once upon a time an old Queen whose husband had been dead for many years, and she had a beautiful daughter. When the princess grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance. When the time came for her to be married, and she had to journey forth into the distant kingdom, the aged Queen packed up for her many costly vessels of silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and silver; and cups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart. She likewise sent her maid in waiting, who was to ride with her, and hand her over to the bridegroom, and each had a horse for the journey, but the horse of the King’s daughter was called Falada, and could speak. So when the hour of parting had come, the aged mother went into her bedroom, took a small knife and cut her finger with it until it bled, then she held a white handkerchief to it into which she let three drops of blood fall, gave it to her daughter and said, “Dear child, preserve this carefully, it will be of service to you on your way.”"
"So they took a sorrowful leave of each other; the princess put the piece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away to her bridegroom. After she had ridden for a while she felt a burning thirst, and said to her waiting-maid, “Dismount, and take my cup which thou hast brought with thee for me, and get me some water from the stream, for I should like to drink.” “If you are thirsty,” said the waiting-maid, “get off your horse yourself, and lie down and drink out of the water, I don’t choose to be your servant.” So in her great thirst the princess alighted, bent down over the water in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup. Then she said, “Ah, Heaven!” and the three drops of blood answered, “If thy mother knew, her heart would break.” But the King’s daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horse again. She rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sun scorched her, and she was thirsty once more, and when they came to a stream of water, she again cried to her waiting-maid, “Dismount, and give me some water in my golden cup,” for she had long ago forgotten the girl’s ill words. But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily, “If you wish to drink, drink as you can, I don’t choose to be your maid.” Then in her great thirst the King’s daughter alighted, bent over the flowing stream, wept and said, “Ah, Heaven!” and the drops of blood again replied, “If thy mother knew this, her heart would break.” And as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, the handkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, and floated away with the water without her observing it, so great was her trouble. The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she rejoiced to think that she had now power over the bride, for since the princess had lost the drops of blood, she had become weak and powerless. So now when she wanted to mount her horse again, the one that was called Falada, the waiting-maid said, “Falada is more suitable for me, and my nag will do for thee” and the princess had to be content with that. Then the waiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the princess exchange her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes; and at length she was compelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would not say one word of this to any one at the royal court, and if she had not taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot. But Falada saw all this, and observed it well."
"The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the true bride the bad horse, and thus they traveled onwards, until at length they entered the royal palace. There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and the prince sprang forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from her horse, and thought she was his consort. She was conducted upstairs, but the real princess was left standing below. Then the old King looked out of the window and saw her standing in the courtyard, and how dainty and delicate and beautiful she was, and instantly went to the royal apartment, and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who was standing down below in the courtyard, and who she was? “I picked her up on my way for a companion; give the girl something to work at, that she may not stand idle.” But the old King had no work for her, and knew of none, so he said, “I have a little boy who tends the geese, she may help him.” The boy was called Conrad, and the true bride had to help him to tend the geese. Soon afterwards the false bride said to the young King, “Dearest husband, I beg you to do me a favour.” He answered, “I will do so most willingly.” “Then send for the knacker, and have the head of the horse on which I rode here cut off, for it vexed me on the way.” In reality, she was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the King’s daughter. Then she succeeded in making the King promise that it should be done, and the faithful Falada was to die; this came to the ears of the real princess, and she secretly promised to pay the knacker a piece of gold if he would perform a small service for her. There was a great dark-looking gateway in the town, through which morning and evening she had to pass with the geese: would he be so good as to nail up Falada’s head on it, so that she might see him again, more than once. The knacker’s man promised to do that, and cut off the head, and nailed it fast beneath the dark gateway."
"Early in the morning, when she and Conrad drove out their flock beneath this gateway, she said in passing,"
"“Alas, Falada, hanging there!”"
"Then the head answered,"
"“Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!"
"If this your tender mother knew, Her heart would surely break in two.”"
"Then they went still further out of the town, and drove their geese into the country. And when they had come to the meadow, she sat down and unbound her hair which was like pure gold, and Conrad saw it and delighted in its brightness, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs. Then she said,"
"“Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say, Blow Conrad’s little hat away, And make him chase it here and there, Until I have braided all my hair, And bound it up again.”"
"And there came such a violent wind that it blew Conrad’s hat far away across country, and he was forced to run after it. When he came back she had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again, and he could not get any of it. Then Conrad was angry, and would not speak to her, and thus they watched the geese until the evening, and then they went home."
"Next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway, the maiden said,"
"“Alas, Falada, hanging there!”"
"Falada answered,"
"“Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!"
"If this your tender mother knew, Her heart would surely break in two.”"
"“Heart alive! What can one desire more?” said the servant to himself, and went merrily onwards. Soon afterwards he met a Jew with a long goat’s-beard, who was standing listening to the song of a bird which was sitting up at the top of a tree. “Good heavens,” he was exclaiming, “that such a small creature should have such a fearfully loud voice! If it were but mine! If only someone would sprinkle some salt upon its tail!”"
"“If that is all,” said the servant, “the bird shall soon be down here;”"
"And taking aim he pulled the trigger, and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes. “Go, you rogue,” he said to the Jew, “and fetch the bird out for yourself!”"
"“Oh!” said the Jew, “leave out the rogue, my master, and I will do it at once. I will get the bird out for myself, as you really have hit it.” Then he lay down on the ground, and began to crawl into the thicket."
"When he was fast among the thorns, the good servant’s humor so tempted him that he took up his fiddle and began to play. In a moment the Jew’s legs began to move, and to jump into the air, and the more the servant fiddled the better went the dance. But the thorns tore his shabby coat from him, combed his beard, and pricked and plucked him all over the body. “Oh dear,” cried the Jew, “what do I want with your fiddling?"
"Leave the fiddle alone, master; I do not want to dance.”"
"But the servant did not listen to him, and thought, “You have fleeced people often enough, now the thorn-bushes shall do the same to you;”"
"and he began to play over again, so that the Jew had to jump higher than ever, and scraps of his coat were left hanging on the thorns. “Oh, woe’s me! cried the Jew; I will give the gentleman whatsoever he asks if only he leaves off fiddling a purse full of gold.” “If you are so liberal,” said the servant, “I will stop my music; but this I must say to your credit, that you dance to it so well that it is quite an art;”"
and having taken the purse he went his way.
"The Jew stood still and watched the servant quietly until he was far off and out of sight, and then he screamed out with all his might, “You miserable musician, you beer-house fiddler! wait till I catch you alone, I will hunt you till the soles of your shoes fall off! You ragamuffin! just put five farthings in your mouth, and then you may be worth three halfpence!” and went on abusing him as fast as he could speak. As soon as he had refreshed himself a little in this way, and got his breath again, he ran into the town to the justice."
"“My lord judge,” he said, “I have come to make a complaint; see how a rascal has robbed and ill-treated me on the public highway! a stone on the ground might pity me; my clothes all torn, my body pricked and scratched, my little all gone with my purse, good ducats, each piece better than the last; for God’s sake let the man be thrown into prison!”"
"“Was it a soldier,” said the judge, “who cut you thus with his sabre?”"
"“Nothing of the sort!” said the Jew; “it was no sword that he had, but a gun hanging at his back, and a fiddle at his neck; the wretch may easily be known.”"
"So the judge sent his people out after the man, and they found the good servant, who had been going quite slowly along, and they found, too, the purse with the money upon him. As soon as he was taken before the judge he said, “I did not touch the Jew, nor take his money; he gave it to me of his own free will, that I might leave off fiddling because he could not bear my music.” “Heaven defend us!” cried the Jew, “his lies are as thick as flies upon the wall.”"
"But the judge also did not believe his tale, and said, “This is a bad defence, no Jew would do that.” And because he had committed robbery on the public highway, he sentenced the good servant to be hanged. As he was being led away the Jew again screamed after him, “You vagabond! you dog of a fiddler! now you are going to receive your well-earned reward!” The servant walked quietly with the hangman up the ladder, but upon the last step he turned round and said to the judge, “Grant me just one request before I die.”"
"“Yes, if you do not ask your life,” said the judge. “I do not ask for life,” answered the servant, “but as a last favor let me play once more upon my fiddle.” The Jew raised a great cry of “Murder! murder! for goodness’ sake do not allow it! Do not allow it!” But the judge said, “Why should I not let him have this short pleasure? it has been granted to him, and he shall have it.” However, he could not have refused on account of the gift which had been bestowed on the servant."
"Then the Jew cried, “Oh! woe’s me! tie me, tie me fast!” while the good servant took his fiddle from his neck, and made ready. As he gave the first scrape, they all began to quiver and shake, the judge, his clerk, and the hangman and his men, and the cord fell out of the hand of the one who was going to tie the Jew fast. At the second scrape all raised their legs, and the hangman let go his hold of the good servant, and made himself ready to dance. At the third scrape they all leaped up and began to dance; the judge and the Jew being the best at jumping. Soon all who had gathered in the market-place out of curiosity were dancing with them; old and young, fat and lean, one with another. The dogs, likewise, which had run there got up on their hind legs and capered about; and the longer he played, the higher sprang the dancers, so that they knocked against each other’s heads, and began to shriek terribly."
"At length the judge cried, quite out of breath, “I will give you your life if you will only stop fiddling.” The good servant thereupon had compassion, took his fiddle and hung it round his neck again, and stepped down the ladder. Then he went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground panting for breath, and said, “You rascal, now confess, whence you got the money, or I will take my fiddle and begin to play again.” “I stole it, I stole it!” cried he; “but you have honestly earned it.” So the judge had the Jew taken to the gallows and hanged as a thief."
111 The Skilful Huntsman
"There was once a young fellow who had learnt the trade of locksmith, and told his father he would now go out into the world and seek his fortune. “Very well,” said the father, “I am quite content with that,”"
"and gave him some money for his journey. So he travelled about and looked for work. After a time he resolved not to follow the trade of locksmith any more, for he no longer liked it, but he took a fancy for hunting. Then there met him in his rambles a huntsman dressed in green, who asked whence he came and whither he was going? The youth said he was a locksmith’s apprentice, but that the trade no longer pleased him, and he had a liking for huntsmanship, would he teach it to him? “Oh, yes,” said the huntsman, “if thou wilt go with me.” Then the young fellow went with him, bound himself to him for some years, and learnt the art of hunting. After this he wished to try his luck elsewhere, and the huntsman gave him nothing in the way of payment but an air-gun, which had, however, this property, that it hit its mark without fail whenever he shot with it. Then he set out and found himself in a very large forest, which he could not get to the end of in one day. When evening came he seated himself in a high tree in order to escape from the wild beasts. Towards midnight, it seemed to him as if a tiny little light glimmered in the distance. Then he looked down through the branches towards it, and kept well in his mind where it was. But in the first place he took off his hat and threw it down in the direction of the light, so that he might go to the hat as a mark when he had descended. Then he got down and went to his hat, put it on again and went straight forwards. The farther he went, the larger the light grew, and when he got close to it he saw that it was an enormous fire, and that three giants were sitting by it, who had an ox on the spit, and were roasting it. Presently one of them said, “I must just taste if the meat will soon be fit to eat,” and pulled a piece off, and was about to put it in his mouth when the huntsman shot it out of his hand. “Well, really,” said the giant, “if the wind has not blown the bit out of my hand!” and helped himself to another. But when he was just about to bite into it, the huntsman again shot it away from him. On this the giant gave the one who was sitting next him a box on the ear, and cried angrily, “Why art thou snatching my piece away from me?” “I have not snatched it away,” said the other, “a sharpshooter must have shot it away from thee.” The giant took another piece, but could not, however, keep it in his hand, for the huntsman shot it out. Then the giant said, “That must be a good shot to shoot the bit out of one’s very mouth, such an one would be useful to us.” And he cried aloud, “Come here, thou sharpshooter, seat thyself at the fire beside us and eat thy fill, we will not hurt thee; but if thou wilt not come, and we have to bring thee by force, thou art a lost man!” On this the youth went up to them and told them he was a skilled huntsman, and that whatever he aimed at with his gun, he was certain to hit. Then they said if he would go with them he should be well treated, and they told him that outside the forest there was a great lake, behind which stood a tower, and in the tower was imprisoned a lovely princess, whom they wished very much to carry off. “Yes,” said he, “I will soon get her for you.” Then they added, “But there is still something else, there is a tiny little dog, which begins to bark directly any one goes near, and as soon as it barks every one in the royal palace wakens up, and for this reason we cannot get there; canst thou undertake to shoot it dead?” “Yes,” said he, “that will be a little bit of fun for me.” After this he got into a boat and rowed over the lake, and as soon as he landed, the little dog came running out, and was about to bark, but the huntsman took his air-gun and shot it dead. When the giants saw that, they rejoiced, and thought they already had the King’s daughter safe, but the huntsman wished first to see how matters stood, and told them that they must stay outside until he called them. Then he went into the castle, and all was perfectly quiet within, and every one was asleep. When he opened the door of the first room, a sword was hanging on the wall which was made of pure silver, and there was a golden star on it, and the name of the King, and on a table near it lay a sealed letter which he broke open, and inside it was written that whosoever had the sword could kill everything which opposed him. So he took the sword from the wall, hung it at his side and went onwards: then he entered the room where the King’s daughter was lying sleeping, and she was so beautiful that he stood still and, holding his breath, looked at her. He thought to himself, “How can I give an innocent maiden into the power of the wild giants, who have evil in their minds?” He looked about further, and under the bed stood a pair of slippers, on the right one was her father’s name with a star, and on the left her own name with a star."
"She wore also a great neck-kerchief of silk embroidered with gold, and on the right side was her father’s name, and on the left her own, all in golden letters. Then the huntsman took a pair of scissors and cut the right corner off, and put it in his knapsack, and then he also took the right slipper with the King’s name, and thrust that in. Now the maiden still lay sleeping, and she was quite sewn into her night-dress, and he cut a morsel from this also, and thrust it in with the rest, but he did all without touching her. Then he went forth and left her lying asleep undisturbed, and when he came to the gate again, the giants were still standing outside waiting for him, and expecting that he was bringing the princess. But he cried to them that they were to come in, for the maiden was already in their power, that he could not open the gate to them, but there was a hole through which they must creep. Then the first approached, and the huntsman wound the giant’s hair round his hand, pulled the head in, and cut it off at one stroke with his sword, and then drew the rest of him in. He called to the second and cut his head off likewise, and then he killed the third also, and he was well pleased that he had freed the beautiful maiden from her enemies, and he cut out their tongues and put them in his knapsack. Then thought he, “I will go home to my father and let him see what I have already done, and afterwards I will travel about the world; the luck which God is pleased to grant me will easily find me.”"
"But when the King in the castle awoke, he saw the three giants lying there dead. So he went into the sleeping-room of his daughter, awoke her, and asked who could have killed the giants? Then said she, “Dear father, I know not, I have been asleep.” But when she arose and would have put on her slippers, the right one was gone, and when she looked at her neck-kerchief it was cut, and the right corner was missing, and when she looked at her night-dress a piece was cut out of it. The King summoned his whole court together, soldiers and every one else who was there, and asked who had set his daughter at liberty, and killed the giants? Now it happened that he had a captain, who was one-eyed and a hideous man, and he said that he had done it. Then the old King said that as he had accomplished this, he should marry his daughter. But the maiden said, “Rather than marry him, dear father, I will go away into the world as far as my legs can carry me.” But the King said that if she would not marry him she should take off her royal garments and wear peasant’s clothing, and go forth, and that she should go to a potter, and begin a trade in earthen vessels. So she put off her royal apparel, and went to a potter and borrowed crockery enough for a stall, and she promised him also that if she had sold it by the evening, she would pay for it. Then the King said she was to seat herself in a corner with it and sell it, and he arranged with some peasants to drive over it with their carts, so that everything should be broken into a thousand pieces. When therefore the King’s daughter had placed her stall in the street, by came the carts, and broke all she had into tiny fragments."
"She began to weep and said, “Alas, how shall I ever pay for the pots now?” The King had, however, wished by this to force her to marry the captain; but instead of that, she again went to the potter, and asked him if he would lend to her once more. He said, “No,” she must first pay for the things she had already had. Then she went to her father and cried and lamented, and said she would go forth into the world. Then said he, “I will have a little hut built for thee in the forest outside, and in it thou shalt stay all thy life long and cook for every one, but thou shalt take no money for it.” When the hut was ready, a sign was hung on the door whereon was written, “To-day given, to-morrow sold.” There she remained a long time, and it was rumored about the world that a maiden was there who cooked without asking for payment, and that this was set forth on a sign outside her door. The huntsman heard it likewise, and thought to himself, “That would suit thee. Thou art poor, and hast no money.” So he took his air-gun and his knapsack, wherein all the things which he had formerly carried away with him from the castle as tokens of his truthfulness were still lying, and went into the forest, and found the hut with the sign, “To-day given, to-morrow sold.” He had put on the sword with which he had cut off the heads of the three giants, and thus entered the hut, and ordered something to eat to be given to him. He was charmed with the beautiful maiden, who was indeed as lovely as any picture. She asked him whence he came and whither he was going, and he said, “I am roaming about the world.” Then she asked him where he had got the sword, for that truly her father’s name was on it. He asked her if she were the King’s daughter. “Yes,” answered she. “With this sword,” said he, “did I cut off the heads of three giants.” And he took their tongues out of his knapsack in proof. Then he also showed her the slipper, and the corner of the neck-kerchief, and the bit of the night-dress. Hereupon she was overjoyed, and said that he was the one who had delivered her. On this they went together to the old King, and fetched him to the hut, and she led him into her room, and told him that the huntsman was the man who had really set her free from the giants. And when the aged King saw all the proofs of this, he could no longer doubt, and said that he was very glad he knew how everything had happened, and that the huntsman should have her to wife, on which the maiden was glad at heart. Then she dressed the huntsman as if he were a foreign lord, and the King ordered a feast to be prepared. When they went to table, the captain sat on the left side of the King’s daughter, but the huntsman was on the right, and the captain thought he was a foreign lord who had come on a visit."
"When they had eaten and drunk, the old King said to the captain that he would set before him something which he must guess. “Supposing any one said that he had killed the three giants and he were asked where the giants’ tongues were, and he were forced to go and look, and there were none in their heads, how could that happen?” The captain said, “Then they cannot have had any.” “Not so,” said the King. “Every animal has a tongue,” and then he likewise asked what any one would deserve who made such an answer? The captain replied, “He ought to be torn in pieces.”"
"Then the King said he had pronounced his own sentence, and the captain was put in prison and then torn in four pieces; but the King’s daughter was married to the huntsman. After this he brought his father and mother, and they lived with their son in happiness, and after the death of the old King he received the kingdom."
112 The Flail From Heaven
"A countryman was once going out to plough with a pair of oxen. When he got to the field, both the animals’ horns began to grow, and went on growing, and when he wanted to go home they were so big that the oxen could not get through the gateway for them. By good luck a butcher came by just then, and he delivered them over to him, and made the bargain in this way, that he should take the butcher a measure of turnip-seed, and then the butcher was to count him out a Brabant thaler for every seed. I call that well sold! The peasant now went home, and carried the measure of turnip-seed to him on his back. On the way, however, he lost one seed out of the bag. The butcher paid him justly as agreed on, and if the peasant had not lost the seed, he would have had one thaler the more. In the meantime, when he went on his way back, the seed had grown into a tree which reached up to the sky. Then thought the peasant, “As thou hast the chance, thou must just see what the angels are doing up there above, and for once have them before thine eyes.” So he climbed up, and saw that the angels above were threshing oats, and he looked on. While he was thus watching them, he observed that the tree on which he was standing, was beginning to totter; he peeped down, and saw that someone was just going to cut it down. “If I were to fall down from hence it would be a bad thing,” thought he, and in his necessity he did not know how to save himself better than by taking the chaff of the oats which lay there in heaps, and twisting a rope of it. He likewise snatched a hoe and a flail which were lying about in heaven, and let himself down by the rope. But he came down on the earth exactly in the middle of a deep, deep hole. So it was a real piece of luck that he had brought the hoe, for he hoed himself a flight of steps with it, and mounted up, and took the flail with him as a token of his truth, so that no one could have any doubt of his story."
113 The Two Kings’ Children
"There was once on a time a King who had a little boy of whom it had been foretold that he should be killed by a stag when he was sixteen years of age, and when he had reached that age the huntsmen once went hunting with him. In the forest, the King’s son was separated from the others, and all at once he saw a great stag which he wanted to shoot, but could not hit. At length he chased the stag so far that they were quite out of the forest, and then suddenly a great tall man was standing there instead of the stag, and said, “It is well that I have thee. I have already ruined six pairs of glass skates with running after thee, and have not been able to get thee.” Then he took the King’s son with him, and dragged him through a great lake to a great palace, and then he had to sit down to table with him and eat something. When they had eaten something together the King said, “I have three daughters, thou must keep watch over the eldest for one night, from nine in the evening till six in the morning, and every time the clock strikes, I will come myself and call, and if thou then givest me no answer, to-morrow morning thou shall be put to death, but if thou always givest me an answer, thou shalt have her to wife.”"
"When the young folks went to the bed-room there stood a stone image of St. Christopher, and the King’s daughter said to it, “My father will come at nine o’clock, and every hour till it strikes three; when he calls, give him an answer instead of the King’s son.” Then the stone image of St. Christopher nodded its head quite quickly, and then more and more slowly till at last it stood still. The next morning the King said to him, “Thou hast done the business well, but I cannot give my daughter away. Thou must now watch a night by my second daughter, and then I will consider with myself, whether thou canst have my eldest daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and when I call thee, answer me, and if I call thee and thou dost not reply, thy blood shall flow.” Then they both went into the sleeping-room, and there stood a still larger stone image of St. Christopher, and the King’s daughter said to it, “If my father calls, do you answer him.” Then the great stone image of St. Christopher again nodded its head quite quickly and then more and more slowly, until at last it stood still again. And the King’s son lay down on the threshold, put his hand under his head and slept. The next morning the King said to him, “Thou hast done the business really well, but I cannot give my daughter away; thou must now watch a night by the youngest princess, and then I will consider with myself whether thou canst have my second daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and when I call thee answer me, and if I call thee and thou answerest not, thy blood shall flow for me.”"
"Then they once more went to the sleeping-room together, and there was a much greater and much taller image of St. Christopher than the two first had been. The King’s daughter said to it, “When my father calls, do thou answer.” Then the great tall stone image of St. Christopher nodded quite half an hour with its head, until at length the head stood still again. And the King’s son laid himself down on the threshold of the door and slept. The next morning the King said, “Thou hast indeed watched well, but I cannot give thee my daughter now; I have a great forest, if thou cuttest it down for me between six o’clock this morning and six at night, I will think about it.” Then he gave him a glass axe, a glass wedge, and a glass mallet. When he got into the wood, he began at once to cut, but the axe broke in two, then he took the wedge, and struck it once with the mallet, and it became as short and as small as sand. Then he was much troubled and believed he would have to die, and sat down and wept."

"“Can't you say, 'Thank you?' “ said the matron."
"“Thank you, sir,” said Unity Blake."
Even in those three words her accent was unmistakably cockney--as
"unmistakably cockney as the coarse-featured, snub-nosed, common little"
"face. In happier, freer conditions she would have done her skimpy hair"
"up in patent curlers and worn a hat with a purple feather, and joined"
heartily in the raucous merriment of her comrades at the pickle-factory.
"Here, however, she was lying, poor little devil, thought Risca, warped"

unutterable cruelty. In her eyes flickered the patient apprehension of
the ill-treated dog.
"“I hope you will soon get better,” he said, with sickening knowledge of"
that which lay hidden beneath the rough bedclothes.
"“Yes, sir,” said Unity."
"“It 's chiefly her nerves now,” said the matron. “She hollers out of"
"nights, so she can't be put into the dormitory.”"
“Do you like the things I send you?” asked John.
"“Yes, sir.”"
“Is there anything special you'd like to have?”
"“No, sir.”"

XXIII
The sun has returned. Not darkly glowing and regal--more than that:
"imperial, because it is flaming. This you do not understand, my friend,"
whatever the language in which it is dished up for you. But I say there is
an imperial sun in the sky.
"It's a good day for going to the woods; it is sweeping time, for the woods"
are full of yellow things that have come suddenly into being. A short time
"ago they were not there, or I did not see them, or they had the earth's"
"own complexion. There is something unborn about them, like embryos in an"
"early stage. But if I whirl them about, they are miracles of fulfillment."
"Here are fungi of every sort, mushrooms and puffballs. How close is the"
"poisonous mushroom to the happy family of the edible mushroom, and how"
innocently it stands there! Yet it is deadly. What magnificent cunning! A
"spurious fruit, a criminal, habitual vice itself, but preening in splendor"
"and brilliance, a very cardinal of fungi. I break off a morsel to chew; it"
"is good and soft on the tongue, but I am a coward and spit it out again."
Was it not the poisonous mushroom that drove men berserker? But in the
"dawn of our own day, we die of a hair in the throat."
"""Stand aside,"" Peasley ordered, gruffly; but the other held his ground,"
"saying, quietly:"
"""I warn you. I am desperate."""
"""Shall I stop her, sir?"" the quartermaster asked from the shadows of"
the wheel-house.
"""No!"" Emerson commanded, sharply, and in the glow from the"
"binnacle-light they saw he had drawn his revolver, while on the instant"
"up from the void beneath heaved the massive figure of Big George Balt,"
"a behemoth, more colossal and threatening than ever in the dim light."
"Rumbling curses as he came, he leaped up the pilot-house steps,"
"wrenched open the door, and with one sweep of his hairy paw flung the"
"helmsman from his post, panting,"
"""Keep her going, Cap', or I'll run them down!"""
"""We stood by you, old man,"" Emerson urged; ""you stand by us. They can't"
"make you stop. They can't come aboard."""
"The launch was abreast of them now, and skimming along so close that"
one might have tossed a biscuit aboard of her. For an instant Captain
Peasley hesitated; then Emerson saw the ends of his bristly mustache
rise above an expansive grin as he winked portentously. But his voice
was convincingly loud and wrathful as he replied:
"""What do you mean, sir? I'll have my blooming ship libelled for this."""
"""I'll make good your losses,"" Emerson volunteered, quickly, realizing"
that other ears were open.
pillowed on her arm. Her hair spread as in a dusky halo beneath it.
Her bosom moved with the rhythmic calm of dreamless sleep. Her lips
were parted in a smile. One hand was hid in the dark folds of her
robe.
"Francesco knelt with upturned face, his eyes shut to the sky. He"
seemed like one faint with pain; his lips moved as in prayer. A
hundred inarticulate pleadings surged heavenward from his heart.
Again he bent over her and watched the pure girlish face as she slept.
A strange calm fell for a time upon him; his eyes never wavered from
the white arm and the glimmering hair. Vast awe held him in thrall. He
"was as one who broods tearless and amazed over the dead, calm face of"
one beloved above all on earth.
"Hours passed and Francesco found no sustenance, save in prayer. The"
unuttered yearnings of a world seemed molten in his soul. The moon
waned. The stars grew dim. Strange sounds stirred in the forest-deeps;
the mysterious breathing of a thousand trees. Life ebbed and flowed
with the sigh of a moon-stupored sea. Visions blazed in the night-sky
and faded away.
Hours passed. Neither sleeper nor watcher stirred. The night grew
faint. The water flickered in the mere. The very stars seemed to gaze
upon the destinies of two wearied souls.
Far and faint came the quaver of a bird's note. Gray and mysterious
stood the forest spires. Light! Light at last! Spears of amber darting
in the east. A shudder seemed to shake the universe. The great vault
kindled. The sky grew luminous with gold.
It was the dawn.

The repulsive creature outside made an authoritative gesture. He
"seemed to be beckoning to them, his huge dull eyes glaring"
threateningly at the same moment.
"""Our beanpole friend is suggesting that we get out of the shell and"
"stay awhile,"" said Dex with grim humor. ""They seem anxious to"
"entertain us--_ouch!_"""
"As the two men made no move to obey the beckoning gesture, the"
"creature had raised the tube again; and again the sharp, unpleasant"
shock shot through them.
"""What the devil are we going to do?"" exclaimed Brand. ""If we go out in"
that mob of nightmare things--it's going to be messy. As long as we
"stay in the shell we have some measure of protection."""
"""Not much protection when they can sting us through metal and glass at"
"will,"" growled Dex. ""Do you suppose they can turn the juice on harder?"
"Or is that bee-sting their best effort?"""
"As though in direct answer to his words, the blob-like face of the"
being who seemed in authority convulsed with anger and he raised the
tube again. This time the shock that came from it was sufficient to
throw the two men to the floor.
"""Well, we can't stay in the ship, that's certain,"" said Brand. ""I"
"guess there's only one thing to do."""
"Dex nodded. ""Climb out of here and take as many of these skinny"
"horrors with us into hell as we can,"" he agreed."
"Once more the shock stung them, as a reminder not to keep their"
The Captain in such cases put on a serious face and began speaking with
"killing irony on the theme of weakness of character, of the animal"
"delight of intoxication, and on such subjects as suited the occasion."
One must do him justice: he was captivated by his role of mentor and
"moralist, but the lodgers dogged him, and, listening sceptically to his"
"exhortations to repentance, would whisper aside to each other:"
"""Cunning, skilful, shifty rogue!  I told you so, but you would not"
"listen.  It's your own fault!"""
"""His honour is really a good soldier.  He goes first and examines the"
"road behind him!"""
The teacher then hunted here and there till he found his friend again
"in some corner, and grasping his dirty coat, trembling and licking his"
"dry lips, looked into his face with a deep, tragic glance, without"
articulate words.
"""Can't you?"" asked the Captain sullenly."
The teacher answered by bowing his head and letting it fall on his
"breast, his tall, thin body trembling the while."
"""Wait another day ... perhaps you will be all right then,"" proposed"
"Kuvalda.  The teacher sighed, and shook his head hopelessly."
The Captain saw that his friend's thin body trembled with the thirst
"for the poison, and took some money from his pocket."
"""In the majority of cases it is impossible to fight against fate,"" said"
"he, as if trying to justify himself before someone. But if the teacher"
"Terence, who was stationed on the after-bridge, felt a faint shock as"
the five thousand tons vessel literally cut the luckless submarine in
twain. For a brief instant the lieutenant caught sight of the
"after-portion of the ""U"" boat, as, rendered buoyant by the trapped"
"air, it drifted past. Then amidst a smother of foam and oil the"
wreckage vanished.
"""The eleventh to my certain knowledge,"" remarked the commander, as"
coolly as if he were reckoning up the score at an athletic meeting.
"""Any damage for'ard, Mr. Black?"""
"""No, sir; all as tight as a bottle as far as I can see,"" replied the"
"carpenter, who immediately after the impact had hurried below to see"
"if any plates had been ""started."""
A little later in the afternoon several of the ward-room officers
"were enjoying their cups of tea and biscuits, when the"
staff-paymaster entered.
"""Well, Staggles, what's the shortage?"" asked the commander"
facetiously.
"The accountant officer eyed his tormentor reproachfully, as if that"
officer were responsible for his former discomfiture.
"""One pound three shillings and threepence--and two tins of condensed"
"milk,"" he announced stiffly. ""According to paragraph 445 of the"
Admiralty Instructions there will have to be two separate reports on
"the shortage."""

It wanted all the self-control at their command to keep the lookout
"men's attention from the comic scene to a duty of a serious nature,"
while the gun's crews temporarily forgot their duties to watch the
encounter between the mascot and the staff-paymaster.
"""Catch it--oh, you rotten butterfingers!"" groaned the accountant"
"officer to the assistant-paymaster, who, missing a coin thrown by the"

"""Here, ship's steward, nip below and open a tin of condensed. That"

"""You're condoning an offence, Staggles,"" said the commander in an"
"undertone, with a humorous gleam in his eye."
Another coin tinkled on the deck. The commander promptly placed his
foot on it to check its career towards the side.
"""Where did that go?"" asked the staff-paymaster, who, curiously"
"enough, had a miserly regard for any money except his own, which he"
spent liberally.

Crane droned on. The Vice-President of the United States looked down on
the top of Senator Crane's massive head and became fruitfully
preoccupied with thoughts of his own.
"Then, quite suddenly, the line of Crane's exposition changed. The"
Vice-President wasn't quite sure at what precise point this had come
about. He wasn't aware of the change until some very strange words
penetrated:
""" ... so, therefore, it has become starkly apparent that the American"
people have been denied the information which would have made them
"aware of their own deadly danger. Invasion from space is now imminent."""
"The Vice-President tensed. Had the stupid idiot gone mad? Or had he, the"
"Vice-President, been in a fog when vital, top-secret information had"
been made public?
"He banged the gavel down hard, for want of a better gesture, and was"
"grateful when a tall, dignified man with a look of deepest concern on"
his face rose from behind his desk out on the floor.
"""Will the Senator yield to his distinguished colleague from"
"Pennsylvania?"""
"Crane turned, scowling. ""I will yield to no man on matters of grave"
"import."" With that he turned and continued with his revelations. ""The"
people of this nation have been deprived of the knowledge that the

that held him to his seat.
"""Boat's done for, sir,"" announced one of the would-be crew. Such was"
the case. The explosion of a shell had wrenched her keel and
garboards out of her.
"""Then overboard with that!"" ordered Terence, indicating a Carley"
"life-buoy, which, though scorched by the blast of the shells, was"
still practically intact.
"The Carley life-buoy is a ""new departure"" in life-saving appliances"
on board ships of the Royal Navy. It is a glorified edition of an
"ordinary buoy, but elongated in shape and provided with gratings, and"
capable of being propelled by oars.
Half a dozen bluejackets seized the huge buoy and slung it overboard.
Held by means of a line it floated alongside the cruiser until
Terence and three men clambered into it.

Noll opened the window.
There came from the street below the hoarse cry of a prostitute.
"He went into the room, lit a candle, and sat down at his desk."
Everything in the place whispered of Betty this night.
He wrote a letter:
gridded with radio location finders so accurate that the position of
two ships a hundred yards apart shows a hundred yards of difference in
absolute position in the loran.
Some day in the distant future space would be solid-gridded with
infrawave navigation signals. Then the space coordinates of any
spacecraft could be found to a fine degree of precision. But now all
that Wilson and his nav-techs could do was to keep sighting the fixed
"stars, and from them compute their position."
"This sort of space navigation was good enough to keep a ship on course,"
"but far from precise enough to pinprick a true position. But, after"
"all, a crude positioning in the middle of interstellar space is good"
enough. One literally has cubic light years to float around in. Once
"the spacecraft begins to approach a destination, the space positioning"
can be made.
"Again, few spacecraft pause in mid-flight between stars long enough to"
"care about their interstellar position. After all, space flight does"
provide a mode of travel where the destination lies within eyesight.
"Or rather, it has lain within eyesight ever since it became commonly"
"accepted that these ultimate destinations were places, instead of holes"
poked in an inverted ceramic bowl.
"Then, in the middle of the communications confusion, came a call from"
one of Commander Hatch's scout flights.
"""Pilot Logan, Flight Eighteen, to Commander Hatch. Report."""
"""Hatch to Logan. Go ahead. Find something, Will?"""
"Will Logan said, ""Solid target detected on radar, Commander. Approached"
The late-night security team had listened sympathetically. They had no
objection if Androv wanted to roll a stair-truck under the fuselage of
"_Daedalus /, _then climb into the underbay and inspect turbo pumps in"
"the dead of night. Everybody knew he was eccentric. No, make that"
insane. You'd have to be to want to ride a rocket. They'd just waved
"him in. After all, the classified avionics in the forward bays were"
secured.
He smiled grimly to think that he'd been absolutely right. Hangar
Control was getting lax about security in these waning days before the
big test. It always happened after a few months of mechanics trooping
in and out.
That also explained why he now had a full set of magnetic access cards
"for all the sealed forward bays. Just as he'd figured, the mechanics"
were now leaving them stuffed in the pockets of the coveralls they kept
in their lockers in the changing room.
Time to get started.
"There was, naturally, double security, with a massive airlock port"
"opening onto a pressure bay, where three more secure ports sealed the"
"avionics bays themselves. The airlock port was like an airplane door,"
"double reinforced to withstand the near vacuum of space, and in the"
center was a green metallic slot for a magnetic card.
"He began trying cards, slipping them into the slot. The first, the"
"second, the third, the fourth, and then, payoff. The three green diodes"
above the lock handle flashed.
"He quickly shoved down the grip and pushed. The door eased inward, then"
"rotated to the side, opening onto the pressure bay."
The duke's features were hard as steel. Yet he read the other's humor
and joined him with the zest of the hour.
"""You smile once more!"" said the grim lord of the woods, turning to the"
slender form in the saddle.
"""I shall smile in the hour when the Frangipani lies at my feet,"""
"Francesco replied with heaving chest. ""It is good to be strong!"""
"The duke's horsemen were scouring ahead, keeping cover, scanning the"
"horizon for the Provencals. By noon they had left the open land,"
plunged up hills covered thick with woods. The duke's squadrons sifted
"through, and he halted them in the woods under the brow of the hill."
"Below lay a broad valley running north and south, chequered with"
pine-thickets and patches of brushwood. On a hill in the centre stood
a ruined tower. Towards the south a broad loop of the river closed the
"valley, while all around on the misty hills shimmered the giants of"
"the forest, mysterious and silent. The duke's outriders had fallen"
back and taken cover in the thickets. Down the valley could be seen a
"line of spears, glittering snake-like towards the tower on the hill."
"Companies of horse were crossing the river, pushing up the slopes,"
mass on mass. In the midst of the flickering shields and spears blew a
great banner with the Fleur-de-Lis.
"It was a contingent of Charles of Anjou, which had been on the march"
since dawn. They had thrown their advance guard across the river and
"were straggling up the green slopes, while the main host crossed the"
ford.
The sound of a clarion re-echoed from crag to crag: and down towards
She made him a formal bow and was leaving the room; but his voice
stopped her.
"“Your anxiety cannot be very great, or you would wait to learn whether"
your suspicions are baseless or not.”
"She paused, in a dignified attitude, with her hand on the back of a"
"chair, while he adjusted his gold pince-nez and ran through the list."
"“You are right so far,” he said coldly. “The names are identical.”"
They parted at the door. The Canon walked back to his hotel with anger
"in his heart. In spite of cumulative evidence, the theory that his"
cousin had insinuated was prima facie preposterous. It was important
"enough, however, to need some investigation. But the feeling uppermost"
in his mind was indignation with Mrs. Winstanley. He was too shrewd a
man not to have perceived long ago her jealousy of Yvonne; but beyond
"keeping a watchful eye lest his wife should receive hurt, he had not"
"condescended to take it into serious consideration. Now, beneath her"
impressive manner he clearly divined the desire to inflict on Yvonne
"a deadly injury. To have leaped at such a conclusion, to have sought"
"subsequent proof from the Visitors’ List, argued malicious design. He"
could never forgive her.
Still the matter had to be cleared up at once. On his arrival at the
"Océan, he went forthwith to Yvonne’s room, and entered on receiving an"
acknowledgment of his knock. She was standing in the light of the window
"by the toilet table, doing her hair. The rest of the room was in the"
shadow of the gathering evening.
"“Well,” she said, without turning, “are they coming?”"
"“Ah, yes, to be sure. Poor little Unity! You must bring her to see me"
"sometimes. Give me notice, and I 'll make her some of my cream-puffs."
Children are always so fond of them. _You_ ought to remember my
cream-puffs.”
"“Good heavens!” he cried, with a gesture that set the dog barking."
“There 's no question of cream-puffs. Can't you see what I'm driving at?
I want you to come and keep house for me and help me to look after the
child.”
"He rose, and his great form towered so threateningly over her that Dandy"
barked at him with a toy terrier's furious and impotent rage.
“I come and live with you?” gasped Miss Lindon.

"“Yes,” said John, turning away and lumbering back to the fireplace. The"
"dog, perceiving that he had struck terror into the heart of his enemy,"
"dismissed him with a scornful snarl, and curled himself up by the side"
of his stupefied mistress.
"It was done; the proposal had been made, according to the demands of his"
"pig-headedness. Now that he had made it, he realized its insanity. He"
contrasted this home of flim-flammeries and its lap-dogs and canaries
and old-maidish futilities with his own tobacco-saturated and
paper-littered den; this life of trivialities with his own fighting
career; this incapacity to grasp essentials with his own realization of
the conflict of world-forces. The ludicrous incongruity of a partnership
between the two of them in so fateful a business as the healing of a
human soul appealed to his somewhat dull sense of humour. The whole idea
was preposterous. In his saturnine way he laughed.
enthusiasms.
"And the faces that pass, with lingering glance out of the dusk, the"
pale sweet faces of thy beautiful women and the handsome figures of a
"vigorous race, how much larger vastnesses are in the communion of these"
eyes than in wide empty spaces of unthinking continents!
The mystic dusk turns thy many habitations to a thousand shadowy
"palaces, thy very vulgarities to dulcet musicalities. What comedies are"
in the making in thy wide hospitable lap to-night! what tragedies! what
heroic strivings! what bemeaning indecencies! what crimes!
Thy very mud holds something of dark mysterious lustre--being that
which is trod out of thy pageant and thy history.
"He only loves thee best who, being divorced from thee, comes to"

"familiarity, but hears in the hollows of his reverent ears the æolian"
whisperings of thy large significance....
"The sound of footsteps ceased to rouse the echoes in the empty street,"
as Noll came to a halt before Netherby Gomme’s doorway. He hesitated
for a moment; ran up the steps; and rang the bell.
"The smoky twilight that held the place was passing into sooty darkness,"
turning the staid street of lodging-houses into a way of fairy
"habitations, the lemon flames of gas-lamps showing a sweeping curve"
of light down its long length to the far rumble of the city’s distant
traffic.
A key coughed in its wards as it shot back the bolts of the lock; and
"They were bound hand and foot. At a piping cry from the leader,"
several of the gangling figures picked them up in reedy arms and began
"to walk across the square, away from the ship. Brand noticed that his"
bearers' arms trembled with his weight: and sensed the flabbiness of
the substance that took the place in them of good solid muscle.
Physically these things were soft and ineffectual indeed. They had
only the ominous tubes with which to fight.
"The eery procession, with the bound Earthmen carried in the lead,"
wound toward a great building fringing the square. In through the high
"arched entrance of this building they went, and up a sloping incline"
"to its tower-top. Here, in a huge bare room, the two were"
unceremoniously dumped to the floor.
"While three of the things stood guard with the mysterious tubes,"
"another unbound them. A whole shower of high pitched, piping syllables"
"was hurled at them, speech which sounded threatening and contemptuous"
"but was otherwise, of course, entirely unintelligible, and then the"
"creatures withdrew. The heavy metal door was slammed shut, and they"
were alone.
"Brand drew a long breath, and began to feel himself all over for"
broken bones. He found none; he was still nerve-wracked from that last
"terrific shock, but otherwise whole and well."
"""Are you hurt, Dex?"" he asked solicitously."
"""I guess not,"" replied Dex, getting uncertainly to his feet. ""And I'm"
wondering why. It seems to me the brutes were uncommonly considerate
"of us--and I'm betting the reason is one we won't like!"""
"Brand shrugged. ""I guess we'll find out their intentions soon enough."
"Pteropods, a suborder of the gastropods, appeared in this age."
Their papery shells of carbonate of lime are found in great
numbers from this time on.
"Cephalopods, the most highly organized of the mollusks, started"
"into existence, so far as the record shows, toward, the end of the"
"Cambrian, with the long extinct ORTHOCERAS (STRAIGHTHORN) and the"
"allied genera of its family. The Orthoceras had a long, straight,"
"and tapering shell, divided by cross partitions into chambers. The"
"animal lived in the ""body chamber"" at the larger end, and walled"
off the other chambers from it in succession during the growth of
"the shell. A central tube, the SIPHUNCLE, passed through from the"
body chamber to the closed tip of the cone.
"The seashells, both brachiopods and mollusks, are in some respects"
the most important to the geologist of all fossils. They have been
"so numerous, so widely distributed, and so well preserved because"
"of their durable shells and their station in growing sediments,"
that better than any other group of organisms they can be used to
correlate the strata of different regions and to mark by their
slow changes the advance of geological time.
CLIMATE. The life of Cambrian times in different countries
"contains no suggestion of any marked climatic zones, and as in"
later periods a warm climate probably reached to the polar
regions.
CHAPTER XVII
"the river played the whirlwind, with dust and clangor and the shriek"
of steel. Spears went down like trampled corn. The battle streamed
"down the bloody slope, for nothing could stand that furious charge."
"The river shut in the broken host, for the ford was narrow, not easy"
"of passage. From the north came the thundering ranks of horse, and on"
"the south the waters were calm and clear. The Provencals, streaming"
"like smoke blown from a fire by a boisterous wind, were hurled in rout"
"upon the water. They were hurled over the banks, slain in the"
"shallows, drowned in struggling to cross at the ford. Some few hundred"
"reached the southern bank, and scattered fast for the sanctuary of the"
woods.
In less than half an hour from the first charge the duke's men had won
the day. They gave no quarter; slew all who stood.
"The duke rode back up the hill, Francesco by his side, amid the cheers"
of his men.
"Southwest they rode towards the sea, their hundred lances aslant under"
the autumnal sky. They were as men challenging a kingdom with their
"swords, and they tossed their shields in the face of fate. The"
audacity of the venture set the hot blood spinning in their hearts.
To free Conradino from Anjou's clutches; to hurl damnation in the
mouth of the Provencals.

"its scabbard; he had tasted blood, and was hot for the conflict."
"On the fourth day they came upon the ruins of Ninfa, a town set upon a"
hill in a wooded valley. Vultures flapped heavenward as they rode into
"the gate; lean, red-eyed curs snarled and slinked about the streets."

It was not much after seven when we came to Mandas. Mandas is a junction
where these little trains sit and have a long happy chat after their
arduous scramble over the downs. It had taken us somewhere about five
hours to do our fifty miles. No wonder then that when the junction at
last heaves in sight everybody bursts out of the train like seeds from
"an exploding pod, and rushes somewhere for something. To the station"
"restaurant, of course. Hence there is a little station restaurant that"
"does a brisk trade, and where one can have a bed."
A quite pleasant woman behind the little bar: a brown woman with brown
"parted hair and brownish eyes and brownish, tanned complexion and tight"
"brown velveteen bodice. She led us up a narrow winding stone stair, as"
"up a fortress, leading on with her candle, and ushered us into the"
"bedroom. It smelled horrid and sourish, as shutup bedrooms do. We threw"
open the window. There were big frosty stars snapping ferociously in
heaven.
"The room contained a huge bed, big enough for eight people, and quite"
clean. And the table on which stood the candle actually had a cloth. But
"imagine that cloth! I think it had been originally white: now, however,"
it was such a web of time-eaten holes and mournful black inkstains and
poor dead wine stains that it was like some 2000 B.C. mummy-cloth. I
wonder if it could have been lifted from that table: or if it was
mummified on to it! I for one made no attempt to try. But that
"table-cover impressed me, as showing degrees I had not imagined.--A"

MARCH OF WORLD TRAGEDY
In the meantime the Embodiment of World Tragedy is marching with giant
strides. Brief will be his hesitation whether he will choose to step
"first to the East or to the West. Already across the Atlantic, they are"
preparing for the dreaded visitation. In the farthest East they have
long been prepared. We alone are not ready. Pity for our helplessness
"will not stay the impending disaster, rather provoke it. When that"
"comes, as assuredly it will unless we are prepared to resist, havoc will"
be let loose and horrors perpetrated before which the imagination quails
back in dismay.
I have tried to lay before you as dispassionately as I could the issues
"involved. But some of you may cry out and say, we can not live in cold"
scientific and philosophic abstractions. Emotion is more to us than pure
reasoning. We cannot stay in this indecision which is paralysing our
wills and crushing the soul out of us. The world is offering their best
and behold them marching to be immolated so that by the supreme offering
of death they might win safety and honor for their motherland. There is
no time for wavering. We too will throw in our lot with those who are
fighting. They say that by our lives we shall win for our birth-land an
honoured place in their federation. We shall trust them. We shall stand
by their side and fight for our home and homeland. And let Providence
shape the Issue.
"Francesco climbed from the valley as the day came with splendor, a"
glow of molten gold streaming from the east. Wood and hillside
"glimmered in a smoking mist, dew-bespangled, wonderful. As the sun"
"rose, the sea stretched sudden into the arch of the west, a great"
"expanse of liquid gold. A mysterious lustre hovered over the cliffs,"
waves of light bent like saffron mist upon San Nicandro.
The dawn-light found an echo in Francesco's face. He came that
"morning the ransomer, the champion, defeated in life and hope and"
"happiness, yet with head erect, as if defying Fate. His manhood smote"
"him like the deep-throated cry of a great bell, majestic and solemn."
"The towers on the cliff were haloed with magic hues. Life, glory, joy,"
lay locked in the gray stone walls. His heart sang in him; his eyes
were afire.
As he walked his horse with a hollow thunder of hoof over the narrow
"bridge, he took his horn and blew a blast thereon. There was a sense"
"of desolation, a lifelessness about the place that smote his senses"
with a strange fear. The walls stared void against the sky. There was
"no stir, no sound within, no watchful faces at portal or wicket. Only"
the gulls circled from the cliffs and the sea made its moan along the
strand.
"Francesco sat in the saddle and looked from wall to belfry, from tower"
"to gate. There was something tragic about the place, the silence of a"
"sacked town, the ghostliness of a ship sailing the seas with a dead"
"crew upon her decks. Francesco's glance rested on the open postern, an"
empty gash in the great gate. His face darkened and his eyes lost
their sanguine glow. There was something betwixt death and worse than
death in all this calm.
"This wood was never quite dark, it was so full of these lights that"
flickered aimlessly.
There were men in this wood who wandered to and fro. The wood was full
of them.
They did not know whither they went; they did not know whither they
"wished to go. Only this they knew, that they could never keep still;"
"for the keeper of this wood was Time. He was armed with a keen whip, and"
kept driving them on and on; there was no rest.
"Many of these when they first came loved the wood. The glades, they"
"said, were very beautiful, the flowers very sweet. They wandered down"
"the broad roads into the glades, and tried to lie upon the moss and love"
the flowers; but Time would not let them. Just for a few moments they
"could have peace, and then they must on and on. But they did not care."
"'The forest is full of glades,' they said; 'if we cannot live in one, we"
"can find another.' And so they went on finding others and others, and"
each one pleased them less.
Some few there were who did not go to the glades at all. 'They are very
"beautiful,' they said, 'but these roads that pass through them, whither"
do they lead? Round and round and round again. There is no peace there.
"Time rules in those glades, Time with his whip and goad, and there is no"
"peace. What we want is rest. And those lights,' they said, 'they are"
"wandering lights, like the summer lightning far down in the South,"
moving hither and thither. We care not for such lights. Our light is
firm and clear. What we desire is peace; we do not care to wander for
"ever round this forest, to see for ever those shifting lights.'"
"And so they would not go down the winding roads, but essayed the path"
"upon the cliffs. 'It is narrow,' they said, 'it has no flowers, it is"
Doome took an early opportunity to draw me aside and to whisper to me
the grave disappointment it must be to all who respected him if they
"should discover the real Don Juan, begged me not to expose him, and"
pointed out the serious loss of prestige he must suffer in the eyes of
the British Public; so we sat down together on a sofa and pitied him
for his decencies.
"Luddy, luddy! how the homely virtues will persist!"
"The idol of our youth, the dark, mysteriously wicked man--with feet of"
"honest clay and a clean simple heart after all! Even prolific, and----"
"Well, damn romance, say I...."
"Oh, and more!"
Even the gods fall out--drift apart.
Aubrey and the O’Myre go different ways--Aubrey in pain that O’Myre
has now discovered that there is no great work of art without a moral
"purpose--Aubrey holding that Aubrey himself is sufficient purpose. He,"
"Aubrey, avers that he has found himself--nothing matters after that."
He must back to Paris. There the women have secular lips and voices
of brocade and understand being loved. Tiens! He will in future give
his splendid talents to attack the Philistinic brutality of strength
and the barbarity of the over-rated glory in mere outdoor delight
that to-day holds England in poisonous embrace; in all the pride of
"effeminacy he withdraws into the palace of his Egoism, where he is"
"lord--back to Paris--_there_ are mirrors, where he may reflect upon"
"himself, take himself up by the roots and dwell upon his own image!"
"""There is no skepticism so offensive as that which doubts the facts of"
honest and careful observation; no Infidelity so gross as that which

Appendix V.
"Since I have recorded this incident of my lecture in Chicago, it is"
peculiarly fitting and pleasant to be able to give the following
extract from the review of the first edition of this book printed in the
_Chicago Times_. No great daily paper would have dared to print such a
comment a few years ago. To-day it is stated as a matter quite beyond
controversy:
"""She takes considerable pains to show _what one would think"
"need scarcely be insisted upon in our day_, that the morals of"
"civilization--morals in general, indeed--are not at all based in or"
"dependent upon religion, certainly not on Christianity, since the"
"so-called 'golden rule' the highest principle of morality, antedates"
"Christianity a thousand years."""
ADDRESS TO THE CLERGY AND OTHERS.
Up to the present time I have tried to reply personally to each one
"who has favored me with a letter of thanks, criticism, or praise of the"
"little book, ""Men, Women, and Gods, and Other Lectures,"" just published,"
burst into a roar of laughter. For the moment the _gamin_ in him was
uppermost--the same curly-pated rascal who had climbed walls and stolen
apples from the market-women's stalls of Tortosa thirty years ago.
"""You are a brave fellow,"" cried the general, ""and I would to Heaven that"
your royal cousin had more of your spirit. Are all of your company of
"the same warlike kidney?"""
"""I trust I am afraid of no man on the field of honour,"" answered the"
"loyal little Frenchman, throwing out his chest. ""Yet I speak but the"
truth when I aver that there is not one of my companions who could not
"say grace and eat me up afterwards!"""
Among the letters which had formed part of Rollo's credentials there was
"one superscribed ""_To be opened in the camp of General Cabrera_."""
"Cabrera now dismissed the firing party with a wave of his hand, the"
officer in command exchanging an encouraging nod with Rollo. Then he
summoned that young man to approach. Rollo threw away the last inch of
"his cigarette, and going up easily, saluted the general with his usual"
self-possession.
"""Well, colonel,"" said the latter, ""I little thought to exchange"
civilities with you again; but for that you have to thank this young
lady. The fortune of war once more! But if young men will entrust
"precious papers to pretty girls, they must have a fund of gratitude upon"
"which to draw--that is, when the ladies arrive in time. On this occasion"
it was most exactly done. Yet you must have lived through some very
"crowded moments while you faced the muzzles of yonder rifles!"""
And he pointed to the lane down which the firing party was defiling.
"with willows growing round it. In the field beyond, a cow was grazing"
peacefully. The sky seemed a deeper blue through the willow-branches.
The tender green of the grass was wonderfully refreshing to the eyes.
The cow had a beautiful coat of glossy brown that shone in the sunlight.
I abandoned myself to the charm of the little idyll that was spread out
before me and forgot the war once again.
"And then all at once a gigantic, plume-shaped, sepia coloured mass rose"
"towering out of the ground. There was a rending, deafening, double"
thunder-clap that seemed to split my head. For a moment I was dazed and
my ears sang. Then I looked up--the black mass was thinning and
collapsing. The cow had disappeared.
I walked into the yard full of rage and bitterness. All the men had left
the sheds and were flocking into the road. Some were strolling along in
"leisurely fashion, some were walking with hurried steps, some were"
"running, some were laughing and talking, some looked startled, some"
"looked anxious, and some were very pale."
"We crossed the road and the railway. Then, traversing several fields, we"
"came to a halt and waited. We waited for nearly an hour, but nothing"
happened and we gradually straggled back to the yard.
Some of us walked to the spot where the shell had burst. There was a
"huge hole, edged by a ring of heaped-up earth, and loose mould and"
grassy sods lay scattered all round. Here and there lay big lumps of
bleeding flesh. The cow had been blown to bits. The larger pieces had
"already been collected by the farmer, who had covered them with a"
tarpaulin sheet from which a hoof protruded.
"The next day, at about the same hour, the dark cloud again rose from the"
ground and the double explosion followed. We again abandoned the yard
"persisted until the fourth day, when the patient was brought"
"down to Orange River, and the signs were as follows."
"Considerable pain in left half of abdomen, pulse 110, fair"
"strength, temperature 101°. Some general distension of abdomen"
with complete disappearance of hepatic dulness. Some movement
"of right half of abdomen, left half immobile, dulness extending"
from the flank as far forwards as linea semilunaris. An
"incision was made in left linea semilunaris, and Oj blood"
evacuated from the left loin. There was no lymph on the
intestines nor sign of inflammation. No perforation was
"discovered in either stomach or intestine, but on two coils of"
"jejunum there were deep slits 3/4 inch long, extending through"
"both peritoneal and muscular coats. Beyond these wounds, on"
"other coils oval patches of ecchymosis, due to direct bruising,"
were present. The peritoneal cavity was sponged free of all
blood and irrigated with boiled water; no bleeding point was
"discovered, and the abdomen was closed."
The next morning the patient was comfortable; temperature
"100.2°, pulse 100. Tongue clean and moist; he vomited once"
during the night.
"Some bloody discharge had collected in the dressing, and at the"
"lower angle of wound there was a local swelling, apparently in"
the abdominal wall. The flank was resonant.
"During the afternoon the patient became faint, and when seen at"
"6 P.M. was in a state of collapse, in which he shortly died."
Death was apparently due to renewal of the previous hæmorrhage.
No _post-mortem_ examination was made.
But he would not be persuaded. He said he was _dying_ to go out and see
the fun.
"At the word ""fun"" I felt a sudden and violent contraction of all my"
muscles. I had an almost irresistible impulse to stand up and strike him
across the face. But I was in a public restaurant and I controlled
myself. He did not seem to notice anything.
The conversation drifted away from the war and became commonplace. I
"tried to relate a few of my experiences, but somehow or other they"
seemed unsuited to the occasion.
"I had set out with the intention of destroying a mouldering, tottering"
"edifice built up of illusions and ignorant prejudices, and I found"
"myself face to face with towering, strong, unshakable walls, strong and"
"unshakable precisely because it was built of illusions, lies, and"
prejudices.
"I felt the burden of war descending upon me with all its crushing,"
annihilating weight. I fought a losing fight against the conviction
that for the rest of my leave I would be able to talk of nothing else
and think of nothing else but the war. If only I could talk to someone
"who would understand, that at least would bring relief!"
"I longed to see my two friends, although I felt some anxiety lest they"
"might have changed, or rather lest they might not have changed with me."
It was in the evening of my first day that we met. At first the one
embarrassed me a little by his apparent cold aloofness. But his caustic
observations on the war soon made it clear that he had stood the test. I
"realized, from the hatred that lay behind them, that he had suffered as"
much as many a soldier in the trenches.
ranks of library editions that no one reads. These stiff and formal
"backs, these ornamental edges, these dandified and dyed airs, repel me"
from my ancient friendships. The intimacy of years is broken--frozen.
"They open no longer eagerly at the old accustomed places, stained"
"with frequent thumbings, where my own hand cut the dear intimate"
leaves--they are deckle-edged and bedamned and horrible which were wont
to be delightfully impertinent. I cannot find my way in the old garden
"that I loved--the old dog-ears are smoothed out, gone--my pencillings"
"erased, their whisperings mute, they nudge my elbow no more. These, my"
one-time boon companions snub me; give me but the flabby handshake of
"necessity. They open their houses to me mincingly, and yawn affected"
"utterance. They no longer tickle me in the ribs, touching me on the"
"sleeve, nor beckon; they do not chuckle familiarly--nor brood with"
me upon the roll and march of the great significancies. Their new
clothes are insistent--upon them as upon me. They smell of the oil of
respectability like gagged Sunday-school children. We know each other
no longer--except with formal bow and elaborate etiquette--as when a
royal person enters the room of entertainment and puts good-fellowship
to the rout.”
"He made a pause, and, passing his gaunt hand over his brow, he added"
sadly:
“I have come home to find myself in a strange land.... Shining-faced
respectability has usurped my chair.... My kingdom has slipped from
me.... The flowers in my garden are dead.”
Noll patted him on the back:
"“Tut, tut, man--you have come into a new kingdom.”"
He heard Julia’s voice upon the stair; and he saw that the other had
and found. I am now within five thousand yards of what appears to be
"Lifeship One."""
"The entire fleet went silent, except for the detector ship, the scout"
"craft, and Wilson's flagship."
"Allison asked, ""Was that our target, Logan?"""
the habits of a lifetime which keeps the mind clear and the nerve
"firm. Lois went on quietly preparing some sandwiches, which in all"
"probability would never be eaten, and Mrs. Carmichael resigned martial"
occupation for the cutting-out of a baby's pinafore for an East-end
child whom she had under her special patronage. But her mind was
"active and, stern, self-opinionated martinet that she was, she could"
not altogether crush the regrets that swarmed up in this last
reckoning up of her life's activity. Better had her charity and
interest been centered on the dirty little children whom she had
indignantly tolerated on her compound! Better for them all would it
have been had each one of them sought to win the love and respect of
"the subject race! Then, perhaps, they would not have been deserted in"
this last hour of peril.
Mrs. Carmichael glanced at Beatrice Cary with a fresh pricking of
"conscience. What, after all, had she done to deserve the chief"
condemnation? She had played with fire. Had they not all played with
"fire? She had looked upon a native as a toy fit to play with, to break"
"and throw away. Did they not all, behind their seeming tolerance and"
"Christian principles, hide an equal depreciation? Was she even as bad"
"as some? How many men revealed to their syces their darkest moods,"
their lowest passions? How many women were to their ayahs subjects for
"contemptuous Bazaar gossip. They were all to blame, and this was the"
"harvest, the punishment for the neglect of a heavy responsibility. The"

"about, while over everything were sifted scraps of white paper in"
seemingly endless quantity. It was these torn scraps that roused Bob’s
"indignation. He seemed to know intuitively, without the evidence of the"
"limp, empty book covers here and there, that the foreman had taken time"
to tear into shreds every record and paper connected with the drive
"which he possessed. Time books, scalers’ measurements--everything--had"
been destroyed practically beyond the possibility of reconstruction.
There would be no accurate way now by which the firm could figure their
profits or costs or labor charges. The very paying of the drive crew
would be a matter of guesswork.
“Jove!” exclaimed Bainbridge through his clenched teeth. “I didn’t know
a man could be so rotten!”
"He stared at the wreck for a minute longer, and then turned over with"
"his foot the square, wooden box which lay upset in the middle of the"
mess. Apparently it had served Schaeffer as a receptacle for these same
"records. It was quite empty, but underneath lay something which brought"
"a thoughtful, questioning expression into the searcher’s face, and made"
him stoop to pick it up.
"“Thirty-eight caliber,” he murmured, staring at the freshly opened"
pasteboard box which had contained fifty cartridges. “Hum!”
"Presently he let it drop again. He did not move for a space, but stood"
"staring at the ground with that same odd, thoughtful pucker in his"
forehead.
"There was nothing surprising in the fact of Schaeffer’s being armed,"
Neither was it strange for a man in the riverman’s position to carry off
his ammunition loose instead of in the box. That was not the point. It

Probably I enjoy the hayfield as much as you do; but I enjoy quite
"other scents and sensations as well, and I take the former for granted,"
"and write my poem, for a change, about the latter. There is no"
necessary difference in artistic value between a good poem about a
flower in the hedge and a good poem about the scent in a sachet. I am
always charmed to read beautiful poems about nature in the country.
"Only, personally, I prefer town to country; and in the town we have to"
"find for ourselves, as best we may, the _décor_ which is the town"
equivalent of the great natural _décor_ of fields and hills. Here it is
that artificiality comes in; and if any one sees no beauty in the
"effects of artificial light, in all the variable, most human, and yet"
"most factitious town landscape, I can only pity him, and go on my own"
way.
"That is, if he will let me. But he tells me that one thing is right and"
the other is wrong; that one is good art and the other is bad; and I
"listen in amazement, sometimes not without impatience, wondering why an"
"estimable personal prejudice should be thus exalted into a dogma, and"
"uttered in the name of art. For in art there can be no prejudices, only"
"results. If we arc to save people’s souls by the writing of verses,"
"well and good. But if not, there is no choice but to admit an absolute"
"freedom of choice. And if Patchouli pleases one, why not Patchouli?"

CHAPTER I
PARENTAGE AND EARLY YEARS
"""I was born when my country was perishing. Thirty thousand French"
"vomited upon our coasts, drowning the throne of Liberty in waves of"
"blood, such was the sight which struck my eyes."" This passionate"
"utterance, penned by Napoleon Buonaparte at the beginning of the"
"French Revolution, describes the state of Corsica in his natal year."
The words are instinct with the vehemence of the youth and the
extravagant sentiment of the age: they strike the keynote of his
career. His life was one of strain and stress from his cradle to his
grave.
In his temperament as in the circumstances of his time the young
Buonaparte was destined for an extraordinary career. Into a tottering
civilization he burst with all the masterful force of an Alaric. But
"he was an Alaric of the south, uniting the untamed strength of his"
island kindred with the mental powers of his Italian ancestry. In his
"personality there is a complex blending of force and grace, of animal"
"passion and mental clearness, of northern common sense with the"
promptings of an oriental imagination; and this union in his nature of
seeming opposites explains many of the mysteries of his life.
"Fortunately for lovers of romance, genius cannot be wholly analyzed,"
even by the most adroit historical philosophizer or the most exacting
champion of heredity. But in so far as the sources of Napoleon's power
"can be measured, they may be traced to the unexampled needs of mankind"
"called to their action stations when a faint buzzing, immediately"
"becoming louder and louder, announced that the raiders were"
approaching the town and harbour of Dover.
"Searchlights flashed skywards, while from beneath the old castle on"
the lofty chalk cliffs half a dozen intrepid British airmen ascended
to meet the foe. Already the anti-aerial guns were stabbing the
"darkness with lurid spurts of flame, while their shells, bursting"
"perilously close to the hostile aeroplanes, caused the calculating"
Teutons to think better of the attempt.
It was an easy matter to steal over an unfortified town or village
and drop explosives; but for once the Germans were to learn the
"wisdom of discrimination. Higher and higher they banked, until"
catching a glimpse of the British seaplanes as they passed through
the path of one of the searchlights they precipitately turned tail.
"""'Sunderland' and destroyer flotilla to proceed in support of"
"seaplanes,"" came the signal."
Hastily the pins of the mooring shackle were knocked out. Steam was
"already raised, and in a very few minutes the light cruiser and her"
attendant destroyers were slipping between the heads of the detached
breakwater and the Admiralty Pier.
But swift as were the light cruisers the seaplanes were quicker.
"Already they were five or six miles out to sea, their position being"
revealed by the flashes of the light guns as they exchanged shots
with the fugitive Taubes.
Suddenly with a dazzling flash a bomb exploded hardly twenty feet
"from the ""Sunderland's"" starboard quarter. Five seconds later another"
"""IPV _Arcturus_, Breckenridge,"" from the chief pilot."
"""You have been on my ray almost a minute. Why are you not correcting"
"course and acceleration?"""
"""Doctor Stevens is computing us and has full control of course and"
"acceleration,"" replied Breckenridge. ""He will answer you."""
"""I am changing neither course nor acceleration because you are not"
"in position,"" declared Stevens, crisply, ""Please give me your present"
"supposed location, and your latest precision goniometer bearings on the"
"sun, the moon, Mars, Venus, and your Tellurian reference limb, with"
"exact time of observations, gyroscope zero-planes, and goniometer"
"factors!"""
"""Correct at once or I shall report you to the Observatory,"" E2 answered"
"loftily, paying no attention to the demand for proof of position."
"""Be sure you do that, guy--and while you're at it report that your"
station hasn't taken a precision bearing in a month. Report that you've
"been muddling along on radio loop bearings, and that you don't know"
"where you are, within seven thousand kilometers. And speaking of"
reporting--I know already that a lot of you astronomical guessers
"have only the faintest possible idea of where you really are, _plus_,"
"_minus_, or lateral; and if you don't get yourselves straightened out"
"before we get to W41, I'm going to make a report on my own account that"
"will jar some of you birds loose from your upper teeth!"" He unplugged"
"with a vicious jerk, and turned to the pilot with a grin."
"""Guess that'll hold him for a while, won't it?"""
"""He'll report us, sure,"" remonstrated Breckenridge. The older man was"
"All the way up Channel a rigorous watch was maintained, for hostile"
submarines had made their presence unpleasantly felt off Prawle
"Point, the Bill of Portland, and south of the Royal Sovereign"
"Lightship. The cruiser pelted under forced draught, steering a"
zig-zag course in order to baffle the carefully-planned calculations
"of the lurking tigers of the deep, while the guns were manned and"
trained abeam ready to be laid upon the first suspicious object
resembling a periscope.
"Being the first day of the month the ship's company was to be paid,"
and soon after six bells final preparations for the solemn rite were
in progress.
"At a quarter to one two ""G's""--the officers' call--sounded, and the"
"first hundred men, mustering by open list, assembled in the Port"
"Battery. On the quarter-deck tables were placed in position, on each"
of which were teak trays divided into small compartments by brass
strips. In each of these divisions a man's monthly pay and allowance
money had already been placed and checked by the paymaster and his
staff.
"Owing to the conditions of war-time the captain was not present, his"
duty of superintending the payment being taken by the commander. At
"the tables stood the staff-paymaster, the R.N.R. assistant-paymaster,"
and the chief writer.
"The staff-paymaster glanced at the commander, indicating that all was"
"in readiness. The commander gave the word to carry on, and the"
disbursing of coin began.
The assistant-paymaster called the men's names from a book. Each
"seaman stepped briskly forward to the chalk line, removed his cap,"
"A figure went to and fro by the water's brim, a figure pale in the"
"moonlight, as the form of the restless dead. The man kneeling in the"
bracken pressed his hands over his breast; his face seemed to start
"out of the gloom as the face of one who struggles in the sea,"
"submerged, yet desperate."
"Francesco saw the woman halt beside the mere. He saw her bend, take"
"water in her palms and dash it in her face. Standing in the moonlight,"
"she smoothed her hair between her fingers, her hands shining white as"
ivory against the dark bosom of her dress. She seemed to murmur to
"herself the while, words wistful and full of woe. Once she thrust her"
"hands to the sky and cried: ""Francesco! Francesco!"" The man kneeling"
in the shadows quivered like a wind-shaken reed.
The moon climbed higher and the woman by the mere spread her cloak
upon a patch of heather and laid herself thereon. Not a sound broke
"the silence; the woods were mute, the air lifeless as the steely"
water. An hour passed. The figure on the heather lay still as an
"effigy on a tomb. The man in the bracken cast one look at the stars,"
then crossed himself and crept out into the moonlight.
"Holding the scabbard of his sword, he skirted the mere with shimmering"
"armor, went down upon his knees and crawled slowly over the grass."
Hours seemed to elapse before the black patch of heather spread crisp
"and dry beneath his hands. Breathing through dilated nostrils, he"
trembled like one who creeps to stab a sleeping friend. The moonlight
"seemed to shower sparks upon him, as with supernatural glory. Tense"
anguish seemed to fill the night with sound.
Two more paces and he was close at the woman's side. The heather
"crackled beneath his knees. He held his breath, crept nearer, and"
knelt so near that he could have kissed Ilaria's face. Her head lay
*       *       *       *       *
All the stations so far had had wire netting over the windows. This
means malaria-mosquitoes. The malaria climbs very high in Sardinia. The
"shallow upland valleys, moorland with their intense summer sun and the"
"riverless, boggy behaviour of the water breed the pest inevitably. But"
"not very terribly, as far as one can make out: August and September"
being the danger months. The natives don't like to admit there is any
"malaria: a tiny bit, they say, a tiny bit. As soon as you come to the"
_trees_ there is no more. So they say. For many miles the landscape is
"moorland and down-like, with no trees. But wait for the trees. Ah, the"
woods and forests of Gennargentu: the woods and forests higher up: no
malaria there!
"The little engine whisks up and up, around its loopy curves as if it"
were going to bite its own tail: we being the tail: then suddenly dives
over the sky-line out of sight. And the landscape changes. The famous
"woods begin to appear. At first it is only hazel-thickets, miles of"
"hazel-thickets, all wild, with a few black cattle trying to peep at us"
out of the green myrtle and arbutus scrub which forms the undergrowth;
"and a couple of rare, wild peasants peering at the train. They wear the"
"black sheepskin tunic, with the wool outside, and the long stocking"
caps. Like cattle they too peer out from between deep bushes. The myrtle
"scrub here rises man-high, and cattle and men are smothered in it. The"
big hazels rise bare above. It must be difficult getting about in these
parts.
"Sometimes, in the distance one sees a black-and-white peasant riding"
"lonely across a more open place, a tiny vivid figure. I like so much the"
proud instinct which makes a living creature distinguish itself from its
background. I hate the rabbity khaki protection-colouration. A
"black-and-white peasant on his pony, only a dot in the distance beyond"
"discovered embrace all the leading types of invertebrate life, and"
are so varied that we must believe that their lines of descent
stretch far back into the pre-Cambrian past.
"PLANTS. No remains of plants have been found in Cambrian strata,"
"except some doubtful markings, as of seaweed."
"SPONGES. The sponges, the lowest of the multicellular animals,"
were represented by several orders. Their fossils are recognized
"by the siliceous spicules, which, as in modern sponges, either"
were scattered through a mass of horny fibers or were connected in
a flinty framework.
COELENTERATES. This subkingdom includes two classes of interest to
"the geologist,--the HYDROZOA, such as the fresh-water hydra and"
"the jellyfish, and the CORALS. Both classes existed in the"
Cambrian.
The Hydrozoa were represented not only by jellyfish but also by
"the GRAPTOLITE, which takes its name from a fancied resemblance of"
some of its forms to a quill pen. It was a composite animal with a
"horny framework, the individuals of the colony living in cells"
"strung on one or both sides along a hollow stem, and communicating"
by means of a common flesh in this central tube. Some graptolites
"were straight, and some curved or spiral; some were single"
"stemmed, and others consisted of several radial stems united."
Graptolites occur but rarely in the Upper Cambrian. In the
"Ordovician and Silurian they are very plentiful, and at the close"
"of the Silurian they pass out of existence, never to return."
"CORALS are very rarely found in the Cambrian, and the description"
of their primitive types is postponed to later chapters treating
"They indicate whether in any region the climate was tropical,"
"temperate, or arctic. Since species spread slowly from some center"
of dispersion where they originate until some barrier limits their
"migration farther, the occurrence of the same species in rocks of"
the same system in different countries implies the absence of such
barriers at the period. Thus in the collection of antarctic
fossils referred to on page 294 there were shallow-water marine
shells identical in species with Mesozoic shells found in India
and in the southern extremity of South America. Since such
organisms are not distributed by the currents of the deep sea and
"cannot migrate along its bottom, we infer a shallow-water"
"connection in Mesozoic times between India, South America, and the"
antarctic region. Such a shallow-water connection would be offered
along the marginal shelf of a continent uniting these now widely
separated countries.
CHAPTER XV
THE PRE-CAMBRIAN SYSTEMS
THE EARTH'S BEGINNINGS. The geological record does not tell us of
"the beginnings of the earth. The history of the planet, as we have"
"every reason to believe, stretches far back beyond the period of"
"the oldest stratified rocks, and is involved in the history of the"
"solar system and of the nebula,--the cloud of glowing gases or of"
"cosmic dust,--from which the sun and planets are believed to have"
been derived.
"the train. In vain. The train inexorably pursues its course. Prancing,"
she reaches one end of the platform as we leave the other end. Then she
"realizes it is not going to stop for her. And then, oh horror, her long"
arms thrown out in wild supplication after the retreating train: then
flung aloft to God: then brought down in absolute despair on her head.
"And this is the last sight we have of her, clutching her poor head in"
agony and doubling forward. She is left--she is abandoned.
The poor fat husband has been all the time on the little outside
"platform at the end of the carriage, holding out his hand to her and"
shouting frenzied scolding to her and frenzied yells for the train to
stop. And the train has not stopped. And she is left--left on that
God-forsaken station in the waning light.
"So, his face all bright, his eyes round and bright as two stars,"
"absolutely transfigured by dismay, chagrin, anger and distress, he comes"
"and sits in his seat, ablaze, stiff, speechless. His face is almost"
beautiful in its blaze of conflicting emotions. For some time he is as
if unconscious in the midst of his feelings. Then anger and resentment
"crop out of his consternation. He turns with a flash to the long-nosed,"
"insidious, Phoenician-looking guard. Why couldn't they stop the train"
"for her! And immediately, as if someone had set fire to him, off flares"
the guard. Heh!--the train can't stop for every person's convenience!
The train is a train--the time-table is a time-table. What did the old
woman want to take her trips down the line for? Heh! She pays the
penalty for her own inconsiderateness. Had _she_ paid for the
train--heh? And the fat man all the time firing off his unheeding and
"unheeded answers. One minute--only one minute--if he, the conductor had"
"told the driver! if he, the conductor, had shouted! A poor woman! Not"
another train! What was she going to do! Her ticket? And no money. A
poor woman--
that this was the man he hated. He simply felt an overwhelming
"thankfulness that some one had come at last, and obeyed orders"
mechanically and without question.
"But as his peavey gripped the end of that troublesome log, there"
suddenly flamed into Curly’s mind--temptation. Bainbridge stood below
"him, perched perilously on the very face of the jam. A little"
thrust--the tiniest movement of the riverman’s arm--would send him
"plunging into the stream, while another movement would suffice to drop"
one of the looser logs upon him. There were no witnesses; the whole
"affair would pass as an unfortunate accident. A chance like this, so"
"easy, so absolutely safe, would never come again."
"“Now!” broke in the crisp voice of the lumberman. “Hard over, boy."
Toward me--all you know how!”
Curly’s muscles strained as he threw every ounce of strength into the
pull. The key log creaked and groaned as if agony but was thrust
"gradually forward. Curly felt it moving faster and faster, and"
instinctively he prepared for that backward leap which would carry him
out of reach of the treacherous avalanche of falling logs.
A second later his peavey was torn from his hands by the sudden collapse
of half the face of the jam. The logs at his side vanished in the
"unexpected rush, but that on which he stood remained firm for a precious"
moment. Below him he saw Bainbridge whirl like a cat and grasp for
"something solid. Instantly he bent over, reaching out both callous,"
"muscular hands, and as swiftly Bob gripped them. There was a heave, an"
"upward scramble, another crash as the remainder of the jam disappeared"
"into the foaming water. But the two men had leaped in time, and a moment"
later they were standing together on the bank.
"handkerchief edged with lace, unfolded it, and with the most ineffable"
"gesture in the world wiped the place the lady's hand had touched. Then,"
"with the same abiding calm, he restored the cambric to his pocket, bowed"
"low to the Queen, and lounged majestically towards the door."
Maria Cristina watched him at first with a haughty and unmoved
"countenance. Her hands clenched themselves close to her side, as if she"
wished the blow had been bestowed with the shut rather than with the
open digits.
"But as her husband (for so he really was, though the relationship was"
"not acknowledged till many years after, and at the feet of the Holy"
"Father himself in the Vatican) approached the door, opened it, and was"
"on the point of departing without once turning round, Cristina suddenly"
"broke into a half hysterical cry, ran after him, threw her arms tenderly"
"about his neck, and burst out weeping on his broad bosom."
"The gentleman, without betraying the least emotion, patted her"
"tolerantly on the shoulder, and murmured some words in her ear, at the"
same time looking over her head at the men of the company with a sort of
half-comic apology.
"""Oh! Fernando, forgive me,"" she cried, ""life of my life--the devil must"
have possessed me! I will cut off the wicked hand that did the deed.
"Give me a knife, good people--to strike the best and handsomest--oh, it"
"was wicked--cruel, diabolical!"""
"Whatever may have been the moral qualities of the royal blow, Rollo felt"
that in their present circumstances time enough had been given to its
"consideration, so he interposed."
"""Your Majesty, the gipsies may be upon us at any moment. It would be as"
"The ledge was narrow, and as the bunch clung together where the leader"
"and his opponent still struggled, one of them slipped over the edge of"
the declivity and started downward. Naturally he caught hold of the
"first object within his reach, and this happened to be the shoe of the"
"outlaw nearest to him. This man, in turn, caught another, and two more"
"tried to pull up the falling ones, with the result that in about half a"
minute five of the half-breeds were rolling and tumbling heels over head
down the rocky slope.
"The boys were not far out of their path, but they managed to elude the"
downrushing bodies as they swung by. Notwithstanding the gravity of the
"situation, the boys shrieked with laughter as the clumsy fellows went"
"tumbling down, uttering vicious curses at the boys, at the mountain and"
at each other.
“I wish I had a gun now!” shouted Frank.
As he spoke a formidable weapon which seemed to be half revolver and
"half sawed-off shotgun, flew out of the hands of one of the involuntary"
acrobats and landed against Frank’s side with a great thud.
Frank seized the weapon and backed away. By this time the leader was on
his feet shouting wrathful commands for the boys to return.
"“Easy, now,” Frank shouted, moving away to the south. “If any of you"
"ginks lift a finger until we get into the timber line, I’ll empty this"
load of slugs into the thick of you.”
"The leader, more daring than the others, sprang down the slope, his"
great boots scattering fragments of rock and sending them hurtling down
upon the heads of the half-breeds below. Frank was about to fire when
the man lost his balance and joined the procession of those making for
"fall into the Gulf of Perdition, unless God interposes.”"
"Now, apart from the folly of this story, we must condemn it on moral"
grounds. Could we imagine a lower standard of a Deity than that
presented here to the child?
To-day the teacher would commend Jane for a laudable interest in
"botany, but might add a word of caution about choosing inclined planes"
"as a hunting-ground for specimens and a popular, lucid explanation of"
the inexorable law of gravity.
Here we have an instance of applying a moral when we have finished our
"story, but there are many stories where nothing is left to chance in"
"this matter, and where there is no means for the child to use ingenuity"
or imagination in making out the meaning for himself.
Henry Morley has condemned the use of this method as applied to Fairy
Stories. He says: “Moralising in a Fairy Story is like the snoring of
Bottom in Titania's lap.”
"But I think this applies to all stories, and most especially to those"
by which we do wish to teach something.
"John Burroughs says in his article,[22] “Thou shalt not preach”:"
“Didactic fiction can never rank high. Thou shalt not preach or teach;
"though shalt pourtray and create, and have ends as universal as"
nature.... What Art demands is that the Artist's personal convictions
"and notions, his likes and dislikes, do not obtrude themselves at all;"
"that good and evil stand judged in his work by the logic of events,"
"as they do in nature, and not by any special pleading on his part. He"
does not hold a brief for either side; he exemplifies the working of
The stereo pattern in the Information Center of Commodore Ted Wilson's
flagship was slowly being filled with the hazy white that indicated
"that these volumes had been combed carefully. As he watched, he could"
"see how the search was progressing, and it was painfully obvious that"
the search was not going good at all.
The flights of spacecraft in set patterns back and forth through the
stereo had covered nearly all of the truncated space cone. The random
search ships were slowly cutting secondary lines through the regions
already covered. There was a green sphere combing the stereo pattern
"now, indicating the new infrawave detector ship and its expected volume"
of detector coverage.
Space was filled to overflowing with the fast patter of the
"communications officers, using infrawave for talks between flights, and"
ordinary radio for talks between ships of the same flight.
Wilson had appointed Chief Communications Officer Haggerty to police
"the bands. Haggerty had done a fine job, removing the howling confusion"
and interference caused from too many calls on the same channel. But
the result was still a high degree of constant call and reply and
"cross talk. Most of the chatter came from the infrawave detector ship,"
sending the scout craft flitting hither and thither on the trail of
spurious responses.
It was almost impossible to grasp the extent of the operation. Only in
"the stereo pattern could anybody begin to follow the complex operation,"
and those who watched the stereo knew that their pattern was only an
idealized space map of what they hoped was going on.
It was worse than combing the area of an ocean from maps that contained
a neat grid of cross rules. Much worse. For the uncharted ocean is
the creative energy.... The great artist works _in_ and _through_ and
_from_ moral ideas; his works are indirectly a criticism of life. He
"is moral without having a moral. The moment a moral obtrudes itself,"
that moment he begins to fall from grace as an artist.... The great
distinction of Art is that it aims to see life steadily and to see it
whole.... It affords the one point of view whence the world appears
harmonious and complete.”
"It would seem, then, from this passage, that it is of _moral_"
importance to put things dramatically.
In Froebel's “Mother Play” he demonstrates the educational value of
"stories, emphasising that their highest use consists in their ability"
"to enable the child, through _suggestion_, to form a pure and noble"
idea of what a man may be or do. The sensitiveness of a child's mind
"is offended if the moral is forced upon him, but if he absorbs it"
"unconsciously, he has received its influence for all time."
To me the idea of pointing out the moral of the story has always seemed
as futile as tying a flower on to a stalk instead of letting the flower
"_grow out_ of the stalk, as Nature intended. In the first case, the"
"flower, showy and bright for the moment, soon fades away. In the second"
"instance, it develops slowly, coming to perfection in fulness of time"
because of the life within.
"X.--Lastly, the element to avoid is _that which rouses emotions which"
cannot be translated into action_.
"Mr. Earl Barnes, to whom all teachers owe a debt of gratitude for the"
"inspiration of his education views, insists strongly on this point."
"The sole effect of such stories is to produce a form of hysteria,"
"fortunately short-lived, but a waste of force which might be directed"
one comes to fill the place.” And she went to her desk at once and hung
the black turban hat with the gold-green macaw wing in its accustomed
place.
He who has been denied the spectacle of a busy Manhattan broker during
a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology.
The poet sings of the “crowded hour of glorious life.” The broker’s
"hour is not only crowded, but the minutes and seconds are hanging to"
all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms.
And this day was Harvey Maxwell’s busy day. The ticker began to reel
"out jerkily its fitful coils of tape, the desk telephone had a chronic"
attack of buzzing. Men began to throng into the office and call at him
"over the railing, jovially, sharply, viciously, excitedly. Messenger"
boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams. The clerks in the
office jumped about like sailors during a storm. Even Pitcher’s face
relaxed into something resembling animation.
On the Exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and
"glaciers and volcanoes, and those elemental disturbances were"
reproduced in miniature in the broker’s offices. Maxwell shoved his
chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a
"toe dancer. He jumped from ticker to ’phone, from desk to door with the"
trained agility of a harlequin.
In the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became
suddenly aware of a high-rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding
"canopy of velvet and ostrich tips, an imitation sealskin sacque and a"
"string of beads as large as hickory nuts, ending near the floor with a"
silver heart. There was a self-possessed young lady connected with
these accessories; and Pitcher was there to construe her.
"wildly, a bell in terror. Yellow gleams streaked the fretted waters,"
"and again the trumpet challenged the dark walls, like the cry of a"
sea-bird driven by the storm.
The duke and Francesco looked meaningly at each other. The sound
needed no words to christen it; they knew that the Pisans had
"attacked. They heard the roar and the cries from the rampart, the"
cataractine thunder of a distant battle.
"Pushing on more swiftly as the woods thinned, the din grew more"
"definite, more human, more sinister in detail. It stirred the blood,"
"challenged the courage, racked conjecture with the infinite chaos it"
portended. Victory and despair were trammelled up together in its
sullen roar; life and death seemed to swell it with the wind sound of
"their wings. It was stupendous, chaotic, a tempest cry of steel and"
passions inflamed.
The duke's face kindled to the sound as he shouted to his men to
"gallop on. Yet another furlong, and the spectral trunks dwindled, the"
"sombre boughs seemed to mingle with the clouds, while gray, indefinite"
"before them, engulfing the lightnings of heaven, loomed the great"
"swell of the Tyrrhene, dark and restless under the thunderclouds, that"
came nearer and nearer. Ghostly the plains of Torre del Greco
"stretched towards the Promontory of Circé, and, solitary and"
"impregnable, the Castello of Astura rose upon its chalk-cliffs, white"
in the lightnings which hissed around its summit.
"The duke's men had come up, forming a wide semicircle around the"
"leaders. At their feet opened a deep ravine, leading into the plain;"
"half a furlong beyond, although it seemed less than a lance's throw"
"across, rose the castle of the Frangipani, washed by the waves of the"
"Tyrrhene. The Pisans had attacked the southern acclivity, and the"

"Erasmus never felt happy, was never content. This may perhaps surprise"
"us for a moment, when we think of his cheerful, never-failing energy, of"
his gay jests and his humour. But upon reflection this unhappy feeling
tallies very well with his character. It also proceeds from his general
attitude of warding off. Even when in high spirits he considers himself
"in all respects an unhappy man. 'The most miserable of all men, the"
"thrice-wretched Erasmus,' he calls himself in fine Greek terms. His life"
"'is an Iliad of calamities, a chain of misfortunes. How can anyone envy"
_me_?' To no one has Fortune been so constantly hostile as to him. She
"has sworn his destruction, thus he sang in his youth in a poetical"
complaint addressed to Gaguin: from earliest infancy the same sad and
hard fate has been constantly pursuing him. Pandora's whole box seems to
have been poured out over him.
This unhappy feeling takes the special form of his having been charged
"by unlucky stars with Herculean labour, without profit or pleasure to"
himself:[16] troubles and vexations without end. His life might have
been so much easier if he had taken his chances. He should never have
left Italy; or he ought to have stayed in England. 'But an immoderate
love of liberty caused me to wrestle long with faithless friends and
inveterate poverty.' Elsewhere he says more resignedly: 'But we are
driven by fate'.
That immoderate love of liberty had indeed been as fate to him. He had
always been the great seeker of quiet and liberty who found liberty late
"and quiet never. By no means ever to bind himself, to incur no"
obligations which might become fetters--again that fear of the
entanglements of life. Thus he remained the great restless one. He was
"never truly satisfied with anything, least of all with what he produced"
"himself. 'Why, then, do you overwhelm us with so many books', someone at"
bleeding spot.
_Empyema._--I may here add the little that I have to say on this
subject. During the whole campaign the single case of primary empyema
"that I saw was the one recorded below, which deserves special mention as"
illustrating the disadvantage of extracting bullets on the field. Under
the conditions which necessarily accompanied this operation the
"ensurance of asepsis was impossible, and the additional wound no doubt"
proved the source of infection.
"(152) _Entry_, at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid"
"muscle, 2 inches above the clavicle; the bullet came to the"
"surface beneath the skin over the fifth rib, in the nipple line"
"of the right side. There was never any hæmoptysis, but the"
patient suffered with some dyspnoea throughout. After a three
"days' stay in the Field hospital, where the subcutaneous bullet"
"was removed, the patient was transported by wagon and train to"
"the Base, a journey of about 600 miles."
"On the fifth day pus escaped from the extraction wound, and"
"when the case was examined at the Base, the temperature was"
"101°, the pulse over 100, the respirations 30, and the whole"
"side of the chest was dull, with the exception of a patch of"
boxy resonance over the apex anteriorly. On the following day
"the chest was drained, and a considerable amount of pus"
"evacuated, which was mixed with breaking-down blood-clot. A"
fortnight later a second operation had to be performed to
"improve the drainage, and the patient made a tedious recovery."
The following case well illustrates the symptoms in a severe case of
"hæmothorax, and empyema following aspiration:--"
"would simply ask those who agitate and cry the Yellow Peril, the means"
"they would suggest for the adopting of their propaganda, if their words"
are not to be empty ones.
"Suppose any country wanted to subjugate Japan, and should want to send"
"an army to fight on the soil of Japan, what number of men do they think"
"would suffice? No general in the whole world would, I am sure, be bold"
enough to undertake the task with under one million men. I have reason
"to believe even that number would not suffice, but for a moment let it"
be that number. What country in the world can send that number over the
"broad ocean? Germany, France, England, or America? Russia seems to have"
"the greatest chance, being nearer to Japan. But her experience is"
already known.
"Suppose the idea of a land campaign be abandoned, and only a fleet be"
"sent to intimidate Japan by sea battles, or by harassing her commerce."
There would certainly be a better chance for any of the Occidental
"fleets than for the armies, in coping with the forces of Japan. Above"
"all, I frankly admit that England would be the most formidable foe in"
"that respect. But excepting England, is there any other country that can"
say with certainty that it can easily crush the Japanese navy? Is it
Germany? is it France? or is it--America?
"But supposing our navy were crushed; what next? It would, of course, be"
"a very ugly thing for us, but it would not mean the subjection of Japan."
"Our sea-coast towns may be bombarded, our commerce may be harassed, but"
"Japan will still subsist within her soil, for she can live without"
"depending on any other country for food. And, besides, disturbance of"
commerce would not be a loss only to her.
"Moreover, any country which should embark on such an enterprise would"
"have need to think it over twice (or, indeed, three or four times)"
"Mediterranean. But coal, he had found, had risen to a ruinous price in"
consequence of a recent strike among the miners in England; and for even
"the most trifling repairs he would have to wait at least a week, because"
the dock-yard people were already working over-time to make way for a
man-of-war. Credit of any sort was not to be had. His portage-bill bade
fair to swamp his insufficient cash resources--even although three of
his now scanty crew had already deserted. And who could foretell what
might happen to him if they should get wagging their tongues too freely
"in some wine-shop ashore! While, as if for climax, the Customs'"
authorities had been displaying a most suspicious interest in him and
"his ship. Under such circumstances, even a saint might have been"
"pardoned, as he pointed out, for showing a temper something short of"
seraphic.
"""And you've been doing me good turns--by your way of it--for some time"
"past,"" he continued, in a stifled, vehement whisper lest his voice"
"should still reach the receding boat. ""Though--"" He waved a claw-like"
"hand about him, words again failing him to describe adequately his"
"sufferings in consequence, as who should say, ""See the result for"
"yourself."""
"Slyne sat down on the sofa opposite him, not even condescending to"
"glance, in response to that invitation, round the squalid,"
"poverty-stricken little cabin. ""Never mind about some time past,"" he"
"advised, more pacifically. ""You'll never get rich quick yesterday."
"To-day's when _I'm_ going to make my pile. And I meant to let you in--"""
"""To another hole,"" Captain Dove concluded sceptically. ""I only wish"
"you'd show me some sure way out of the one I'm in."""
"Slyne looked his annoyance at that further interruption, and made as if"
"to rise, but did no more than draw his gold cigarette-case from its"
PREFACE
The aim of this book is to serve as a companion to the _Mennonite
"Hymnary_. It seeks to explain, as far as possible, the origin of the"
words and music of every hymn in the _Hymnary_.
"The great lyrics of the church, contributed by every age since the days"
"of the apostles, are a precious heritage, and a source of inspiration"
and power. This work is intended to foster an understanding of and love
"for our hymns, new and old, and to stimulate the time-honored and"
blessed practice of congregational singing in the church today.
The _Handbook_ may be found useful as an aid (1) in the private study of
hymns or their use in family devotions; (2) in selecting suitable hymns
for the many and varied services of public worship; (3) in preparing
special music services or hymn sings where such occasions are planned to
improve the singing in the church; (4) for study groups in hymnology in
churches and schools. The historical development of hymnology may be
followed in the brief “Introduction to Our Hymns and Tunes.”
The author has endeavored to make the work as comprehensive as possible
without overburdening the reader with too many details. Many hymns have
"interesting stories connected with their origin and use while others,"
"equally valuable, were just written, without drama or incident, the poet"
"scarcely knowing how or why, except that the Inner Voice spoke. The"
apocryphal tales which have been circulated concerning some hymns have
been studiously avoided. The aim has been to include only such material
as seems to bear genuine marks of authenticity. The bibliography of
given to wickedness.
Down in the shady angle of the little orchard the old gipsy found a
"little garden of flowers, geranium and white jasmine, perhaps planted to"
"cast into the rude coffin of a neighbour, _Yerba Luisa_, or lemon"
"verbena for the decoctions of a simple pharmacopoeia, on the outskirts"
of these a yet smaller plot had been set aside. It was edged with white
"stones from the hillside, and many coloured bits of broken crockery"
decorated it. A rose-bush in the midst had been broken down by some
"hasty human foot, or perhaps by a bullock or other large trespassing"
animal. There were nigh a score of rose-buds upon it--all now parched
"and dead, and the whole had taken on the colour of the soil."
La Giralda stood a moment before laying her burden down. She had the
strong heart of her ancient people. The weakness of tears had not
"visited her eyes for years--indeed, not since she was a girl, and had"
"cried at parting from her first sweetheart, whom she never saw again. So"
she looked apparently unmoved at the pitiful little square of cracked
"earth, edged with its fragments of brown and blue pottery, and at the"
"broken rose-bush lying as if also plague-stricken across it, dusty,"
"desolate, and utterly forlorn. Yet, as we have said, was her heart by no"
"means impervious to feeling. She had wonderful impulses, this parched"
mahogany-visaged Giralda.
"""It is the little one's own garden--I will lay her here!"" she said to"
herself.
So without another word she departed in search of mattock and spade. She
"found them easily and shortly, for the hireling servants of the house"
"had fled in haste, taking nothing with them. In a quarter of an hour the"
"hole was dug. The rose-tree, being in the way, was dragged out and"
"thrown to one side. La Giralda, who began to think of her donkey and"
"in places on the sea floor, secreting stony masses composed of"
"thin, close, concentric layers, connected by vertical rods. The"
Stromatopora are among the chief limestone builders of the
Silurian and Devonian periods.
"CORALS developed along several distinct lines, like modern corals"
"they secreted a calcareous framework, in whose outer portions the"
"polyps lived. In the Ordovician, corals were represented chiefly"
"by the family of the CHOETETES, all species of which are long"
since extinct. The description of other types of corals will be
"given under the Silurian, where they first became abundant."
"ECHINODERMS. The cystoid reaches its climax, but there appear now"
"two higher types of echinoderms,--the crinoid and the starfish."
"The CRINOID, named from its resemblance to the lily, is like the"
"cystoid in many respects, but has a longer stem and supports a"
"crown of plumose arms. Stirring the water with these arms, it"
creates currents by which particles of food are wafted to its
"mouth. Crinoids are rare at the present time, but they grew in the"
greatest profusion in the warm Ordovician seas and for long ages
thereafter. In many places the sea floor was beautiful with these
"graceful, flowerlike forms, as with fields of long-stemmed lilies."
"Of the higher, free-moving classes of the echinoderms, starfish"
"are more numerous than in the Cambrian, and sea urchins make their"
appearance in rare archaic forms.
CRUSTACEANS. Trilobites now reach their greatest development and
more than eleven hundred species have been described from the
rocks of this period. It is interesting to note that in many
species the segments of the thorax have now come to be so shaped
that they move freely on one another. Unlike their Cambrian
"ancestors, many of the Ordovician trilobites could roll themselves"
"""I don't believe he will,"" I observed, laughing. ""There will be a sham"
Dawson in the office and the genuine article will be out on the
"rampage. He is a man who couldn't sit still, not even if you tied him"
"in his chair and sealed the knots."""
We spent a pleasant hour pulling Dawson to pieces and leaving to him
"not a rag of virtue, except intense professional zeal. We exchanged"
"experiences of him, those of the chief assistant being particularly"
rich and highly flavoured. It appeared that Dawson when off duty loved
to occupy the platform at meetings of his religious connection and to
"hold forth to the elect. The privilege of ""sitting under him"" had been"
"enjoyed more than once by the assistant, who retailed to us extracts"
"from Dawson's favourite sermon on ""Truth."" His views upon Truth were"
"unbending as armour plate. ""Under no circumstances, not to save"

"penalties for a lapse from virtue, not even to preserve one's country"
"from the attacks of an enemy, was it permissible to a Peculiar Baptist"

"""He made me shiver,"" said the chief assistant, ""and he drove me to"
thinking of one or two little deceptions of my own. When Dawson
"preaches, his eyes blaze, his voice breaks, and he will fall on his"

can't look at him then and not believe that he means every word he

"""No, it is not,"" said I. ""Dawson in the pulpit, or on the tub--or"
whatever platform he uses--is absolutely genuine. He is the finest

The new constitution of 1791 was also a source of discord. In its
"jealousy of the royal authority, the National Assembly seized very"
many of the executive functions of government. The results were
"disastrous. Laws remained without force, taxes went uncollected, the"
"army was distracted by mutinies, and the monarchy sank slowly into the"
"gulf of bankruptcy and anarchy. Thus, in the course of three years,"
"the revolutionists goaded the clergy to desperation, they were about"
"to overthrow the monarchy, every month was proving their local"
"self-government to be unworkable, and they themselves split into"
factions that plunged France into war and drenched her soil by
organized massacres.

We know very little about the impression made on the young Buonaparte
by the first events of the Revolution. His note-book seems even to
show that he regarded them as an inconvenient interference with his
plans for Corsica. But gradually the Revolution excites his interest.
"In September, 1789, we find him on furlough in Corsica sharing the"
hopes of the islanders that their representatives in the French
National Assembly will obtain the boon of independence. He exhorts
"his compatriots to favour the democratic cause, which promises a"
speedy deliverance from official abuses. He urges them to don the new
"tricolour cockade, symbol of Parisian triumph over the old monarchy;"
"to form a club; above all, to organize a National Guard. The young"
"officer knew that military power was passing from the royal army, now"
"honeycombed with discontent, to the National Guard. Here surely was"
Corsica's means of salvation. But the French governor of Corsica
"intervenes. The club is closed, and the National Guard is dispersed."
Thereupon Buonaparte launches a vigorous protest against the tyranny
"altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek, nor subdued the"
arch though resolute curve of her lips.
A tall young man came striding through the park along the path near
which she sat. Behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit-case. At sight
"of the young lady, the man’s face changed to red and back to pale"
"again. He watched her countenance as he drew nearer, with hope and"
"anxiety mingled on his own. He passed within a few yards of her, but he"
saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence.
Some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at
one side. The boy dropped the suit-case and stared at him with
"wondering, shrewd eyes. The young man took out his handkerchief and"
"wiped his brow. It was a good handkerchief, a good brow, and the young"
man was good to look at. He said to the boy:
“I want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench. Tell
"her I am on my way to the station, to leave for San Francisco, where I"
"shall join that Alaska moose-hunting expedition. Tell her that, since"
"she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her, I take this"
"means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice, for the sake"
of what has been. Tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not
"deserved such treatment, without giving him her reasons or a chance to"
explain is contrary to her nature as I believe it to be. Tell her that
"I have thus, to a certain degree, disobeyed her injunctions, in the"
"hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done. Go, and tell her"
that.”
The young man dropped a half-dollar into the boy’s hand. The boy looked
"at him for a moment with bright, canny eyes out of a dirty, intelligent"
"face, and then set off at a run. He approached the lady on the bench a"
"little doubtfully, but unembarrassed. He touched the brim of the old"
"enlarged, the stall of the enemy will be diminished."
"If the outside of the right ear is destroyed, the land will yield to"
the enemy's land.
"If the right ear of the foetus lies near the cheek[58], the enemy"
"will prevail against the power of the king, the king will be without"
"counsellors, a ruler will not inhabit the land, or the son of the"
king of universal sway[59] will be king.
"If the left ear of the foetus lies near the cheek, an enemy will be"
installed in the royal palace.
"If the right ear of the foetus lies near the jaw, birth of a"
"demon[60] in my land, or in the house of the man[61]."
"If the left ear of the foetus lies near the jaw, birth of a demon in"
"the enemy's land, or the land of the enemy will perish."
The guiding principle of the interpretation in these instances is the
natural association of the right as your side and the left with the
"enemy's side. A defect on the right side is unfavorable to you, i. e., to"
the king or to the country or to the individual in whose household the
"birth occurs, while the same defect on the left side is unfavorable to the"
"enemy and, therefore, favorable to you. The principle is quite"
consistently carried out even to the point that if the sign itself is
"favorable, it is only when it is found on the right side that it is"
"favorable to you, while its occurrence on the left side is favorable to"
the enemy.
"Defects of any kind appear to be unfavorable, whereas an excess of organs"
"and parts are in many instances favorable, though with a considerable"
"it than anybody else except God 'lmighty. If the fish hug the shore,"
"then we're up against it, but I think they strike in about here; that's"
"why I chose this site. We can't tell, though, till the run starts. All"
"we can do now is see that them people keep their distance."""
"The ""lead"" of a salmon-trap consists of a row of web-hung piling that"
"runs out from the shore for many hundred feet, forming a high, stout"
fence that turns the schools of fish and leads them into cunningly
"contrived enclosures, or ""pounds,"" at the outer extremity, from which"
"they are ""brailed"" as needed. These corrals are so built that once the"
fish are inside they cannot escape. The entire structure is devised
"upon the principle that the salmon will not make a short turn, but will"
swim as nearly as possible in a straight line. It looked to Boyd as if
"Marsh, by blocking the line of progress above and below, had virtually"
"destroyed the efficiency of the new trap, rendering the cost of its"
construction a total loss.
"""Sometimes you can cork a trap and sometimes you can't,"" Balt went on."
"""It all depends on the currents, the lay of the bars, and a lot of"
things we don't know nothing about. I've spent years in trying to
"locate the point where them fish strike in, and I think it's just below"
"here. It'll all depend on how good I guessed."""
"""Exactly! And if you guessed wrong--"""
"""Then we'll fish with nets, like we used to before there was any traps."""
"That evening, when he had seen the night-shift started, Emerson decided"
"to walk up to Cherry's house, for he was worried over the day's"
developments and felt that an hour of the girl's society might serve to
clear his thoughts. His nerves were high-strung from the tension of the
"past weeks, and he knew himself in the condition of an athlete trained"
That is part of our belief; that is the strongest part of our belief;
"and that is the hope that all fervent Christians have, that those they"

I think it may truly be said that our Western creeds are all directed at
"the hour of death, as the great and final test of that creed."
And now think of Buddhism; it is a creed of life. In life you must win
"your way to salvation by urgent effort, by suffering, by endurance. On"
"your death-bed you can do nothing. If you have done well, then it is"
"well; if ill, then you must in future life try again and again till you"
"succeed. A life is not washed, a soul is not made fit for the dwelling"
"of eternity, in a moment."
Repentance to a Buddhist is but the opening of the eyes to see the path
to righteousness; it has no virtue in itself. To have seen that we are
sinners is but the first step to cleansing our sin; in itself it cannot
purify.
"As well ask a robber of the poor to repent, and suppose thereby that"
those who have suffered from his guilt are compensated for the evil done
"to them by his repentance, as to ask a Buddhist to believe that a sinner"
can at the last moment make good to his own soul all the injuries caused
to that soul by the wickedness of his life.
Or suppose a man who has destroyed his constitution by excess to be by
the very fact of acknowledging that excess restored to health.
The Buddhist will not have that at all. A man is what he makes himself;
"and that making is a matter of terrible effort, of unceasing endeavour"

The megaphone man raised his instrument of torture; the inside of the
great automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee
drinker. The top-riders nervously clung to the seats; the old lady from
"Valparaiso, Indiana, shrieked to be put ashore. But, before a wheel"
"turns, listen to a brief preamble through the cardiaphone, which shall"
point out to you an object of interest on life’s sightseeing tour.
Swift and comprehensive is the recognition of white man for white man

mother and babe; unhesitatingly do master and dog commune across the
slight gulf between animal and man; immeasurably quick and sapient are
the brief messages between one and one’s beloved. But all these
instances set forth only slow and groping interchange of sympathy and
thought beside one other instance which the Rubberneck coach shall
disclose. You shall learn (if you have not learned already) what two
beings of all earth’s living inhabitants most quickly look into each
other’s hearts and souls when they meet face to face.

tell the biggest lie--won by the palmer's statement that he has never

"'great toe of the Trinity', his 'buttock-bone of Pentecost', and the"
rest. One of the raciest passages occurs in the Pardoner's relation of
the wonders he has performed in the execution of his office. Amongst
other deeds of note is the bringing back of a certain woman from hell to
earth. For this purpose the Pardoner visited the lower regions in
person--so he says--and brought her out in triumph with the full and
joyful consent of Lucifer.

As for that day there meetly fell.

With sothery[48] butter their bodies anointed;

"During the next fortnight the sailing-ships began to assemble, standing"
in under a great spread of canvas to berth close alongside the two
"steamships; for, once the ice had moved north, there was no further"
"obstacle to their coming, and the harbor was soon livened with puffing"
"tugs, unwieldy lighters, and fleets of smaller vessels. Where, but a"
"short time before, the brooding silence had been undisturbed save for"
"the plaint of wolf-dogs and the lazy voices of natives, a noisy army"
was now at work. The bustle of a great preparation arose; languid
smoke-wreaths began to unfurl above the stacks of the canneries; the
stamp and clank of tin-machines re-echoed; hammer and saw maintained a
never-ceasing hubbub. Down at the new plant scows were being launched
while yet the pitch was warm on their seams; buildings were rising
"rapidly, and a crew had gone up the river to get out a raft of piles."
"On the morning after the arrival of the last ship, Emerson and his"
companions were treated to a genuine surprise. Cherry had come down to
the site as usual--she could not let a day go by without visiting the
"place--and Clyde, after a tardy breakfast, had just come ashore. They"
"were watching Big George direct the launching of a scow, when all of a"
"sudden they heard a familiar voice behind them cry, cheerfully:"
"gnashing of teeth ... save your teeth, or else you will not be able to"
protect yourself.  Here are twenty kopecks.  Go and buy a bottle of
"vodki for five kopecks, hot tripe or lungs, one pound of bread and two"
cucumbers.  When we have lived off our drunken headache we will think
"of the condition of affairs ..."""
"As a rule the consideration of the ""condition of affairs"" lasted some"
"two or three days, and only when the Captain had not a farthing left of"
the three roubles or five roubles given him by his grateful customer
did he say:
"""You came!  Do you see?  Now that we have drunk everything with you,"
"you fool, try again to regain the path of virtue and soberness.  It has"
"been truly said that if you do not sin, you will not repent, and, if"
"you do not repent, you shall not be saved.  We have done the first, and"
to repent is useless.  Let us make direct for salvation.  Go to the
"river and work, and if you think you cannot control yourself, tell the"
"contractor, your employer, to keep your money, or else give it to me."
"When you get sufficient capital, I will get you a pair of trousers and"
other things necessary to make you seem a respectable and hard-working
"man, persecuted by fate.  With decent-looking trousers you can go far."
"Now then, be off!"""
"Then the client would go to the river to work as a porter, smiling the"
while over the Captain's long and wise speeches. He did not distinctly
"understand them, but only saw in front of him two merry eyes, felt"
"their encouraging influence, and knew that in the loquacious Captain he"
had an arm that would assist him in time of need.
"And really it happened very often that, for a month or so, some"
"ticket-of-leave client, under the strict surveillance of the Captain,"
had the opportunity of raising himself to a condition better than that
"ledge, while his body caught in the bushes, hung a moment, then dashed"
after its comrades below.
"Just then the end of a rope fell dangling by their side, let down from"
"the ramparts above. The duke tried to grasp it, but it shifted beyond"
"the gap. Down the rope came a man, then another; they both gained a"
"foothold on the narrow ledge. No sooner were their feet on it, than"
the duke sent them headlong to the bottom. Then grasping the rope
"without waiting to see if a third or fourth were coming down, he"
"shouted to Francesco to follow. Perilous as was the task, it was no"
"more so than to follow the steep and narrow goat's trail, and in a"
brief space of time they swung into a courtyard which was deserted.
"Anticipating no attack on this side, the defenders of Astura had"
"turned their whole attention to the southern slope, where the Pisans"
were scaling the walls. The roar of the conflict seemed to grow with
"the roar of the hurricane, and, as one by one the duke's men leaped"
"into the dark square, and the muster was complete, Count Rupert turned"
to Francesco.
"""I feared lest they might clean out the nest before our arrival,"" he"
"said, then, pointing to a distant glare of torches, he gave the word."
They caught the unwary defenders in the rear. No quarter was to be
given; the robber brood of Astura was to be exterminated.
"""Conradino!"" was the password, and above the taunts and cries of"
"Frangipani's hirelings it filled the night with its clamor, rode on"
"the wings of the storm, like the war-cry of a thousand demons."
Notwithstanding the fact that a few of the most daring among the Pisan
"admiral's men had scaled the ramparts and, leaping into the"
"Frangipani's stronghold, had tried to pave a way for those lagging"
"behind, their companions-in-arms were in dire straits. For those of"
"Everywhere the smooth dark trunks converged upon one another, sending"
up a tangle of boughs that glittered in the soft sheen of the
"sunlight. Withered bracken stood in thin silence, and here and there a"
dead bough lay like a snake with its head raised to strike.
"The silence was immense, and yet it was a stillness that suggested"
"sounds. It resembled the silence of a huge cavern, out of which came"
strange whisperings; innumerable crepitations seemed to come from the
"dead leaves. Francesco fancied he could hear the trees breathing, and"
from afar he caught the wild note of a bird.
The sun was low when they came at last to the edge of the forest and
saw a hill rise steeply against the sky. It was covered with silver
"birches, whose stems looked like white threads in the level light of"
the setting sun. And rising against the sky-line from amidst the
fretwork of birch-boughs Francesco saw the well-remembered outlines of
the ruined tower wherein he had spent a memorable night.
"The valley before them was flooded with golden light, and, as they"
"crossed it, Francesco felt a curious desire for physical pain,"
"something fierce and tangible to struggle with, to drown the"
ever-pulsing memory of the woman who had gone from him.
As the dusk deepened they went scrambling up the hillside amid the
"birches, whose white stems glimmered upwards into the blue gloom of"
"the twilight. Francesco's thoughts climbed ahead of him, hurrying to"
deal with the unknown dangers that might be awaiting him. He had to
"dismount, pull his steed after him; but the scramble upwards gave him"
the sense of effort and struggle that he needed. It was like scaling a
"wall to come to grips with an enemy, whose wild eyes and sword-points"
showed between the crenelations.

proposition in pursuing them that is to be found in hunting the tiger or
"the grizzly. They are practically harmless, and in the Bayano region"
"wholly so, as there are no domestic animals upon which they can prey. It"
"is true their teeth and skins have a certain value in the market, but it"
is not for these the tourist kills them. Most of those slain for “sport”
sink instantly and cannot be recovered.

However if you visit Crocodile Creek with a typical party you will be
given a very fair imitation of a lively skirmish in actual war. From
"every part of the deck, from the roof of the cabin, and from the pilot"
house shots ring out from repeating rifles in a fierce desire to kill.
The Emersonian doctrine of compensation is often given illustration by
the killing of one of the hunters in the eagerness to get at the quarry.
In fact that is one of the commonest accidents of the tourist season in
Panama.
[Illustration: MAHOGANY TREES WITH ORCHIDS]
"Crocodile Creek is a deep, sluggish black stream, almost arched over by"
the boughs of the thick forest along the shores. Here and there the
jungle is broken by a broad shelving beach on which the ungainly beasts
"love to sun themselves, and to which the females resort to deposit their"
eggs. At the sound of a voice or a paddle in the stream the awkward
"brutes take to the water in terror, for there are few animals more"
"timid than they. When in the water the crocodile floats lazily,"
displaying only three small bumps above the surface--the nostrils and
the horny protruberances above the eyes. Once the pool in which they
float is disturbed they sink to the bottom and lurk there for hours.

Luther was a born music lover and a musician of adequate training.
Moreover he possessed a remarkable gift for writing hymns in clear
thought to bring the Word of God home to the hearts of the common
people. He and his followers put songs on the lips of the German people
and they sang themselves into the Reformation. So effective were these
songs that his enemies in the Roman church declared that “Luther’s songs
have damned more souls than all his books and speeches.”
_Chorales._ The word “chorale” (“choral” in German) refers to the hymn
"tunes of Lutheran Protestantism, though in common usage the term"
includes the words associated with the tunes. The melodies had much to
do with the popularity of the songs. They came from various sources.
Many of them were original compositions by Luther and others; some were
borrowed from the hymn books of the Bohemian Brethren; a considerable
number were adaptations of plainsongs used in the Catholic Church; still
others were adopted from beloved folksongs. Luther was an eclectic in
his choice of music. He used any tune from any source that suited his
purpose. Many thousands of chorales came into existence in Germany
during his time and the two centuries that followed. The hundreds still
in use represent the best in church music today. They are characterized
"by a plain melody, a strong harmony, and a stately rhythm; all of which"
adapts them well for effective congregational singing.
The chorales at first did not have the regular rhythms that they later
"took on. The steady progression of even notes, invariable in Bach’s day,"
"had come only gradually into use. Some of the recent hymnbooks, in the"
"interest of greater variety of rhythm, are returning to the original"
“rhythmic chorales.”
Though _unison_ singing has been widely practiced and is advocated today
"by some good authorities in church music, Luther encouraged part"
"Petrol was, at the moment, the most important of our needs; we had,"
"therefore, to carry with us all we should require, making allowance"
"at the same time for mishaps. Moreover, we had to take enough food"
"and water to last Allan, Allah-dad and myself for five or six days."
"As regards personal luggage we travelled absolutely light, leaving"
"all kit to follow at a slower pace on camels, together with my horse,"
"Galahad. I had some compunction in leaving the latter behind, but my"
"orders were concise and urgent--to reach Robat, endeavour to get into"
"touch with all our scattered posts, and effect a combination against"
the Raiders at the earliest possible moment.
"A start was made very early in the morning, but the first day's"
journey proved disappointing. Instead of doing the ninety miles
"planned, we only accomplished thirty. The track was even worse than I"
"had expected, for we constantly ran into sand-hills, and had to dig"
the car out. I have never done so much digging in my life as I did on
"that journey to Robat. Sand-hills were, however, only a portion of"
"our afflictions, for, in addition, there were many water pools and"
small shallow lakes--due to recent rain--which had to be taken at a
"rush, or somehow circumvented."
"So serious, at last, did our rate of progress become that, as we"
"approached what seemed to be the hundredth of these wide, shallow"
"pools, I lost patience and ordered Allan to drive straight through."
"He attempted to carry out the order, but about half-way we sank up"
to the axle and stuck. No power on earth would induce the car to
"budge another inch, and, though we all three got out into the water,"
"and lugged, pushed and dragged at the wretched car, no impression"
could be made upon her.
"a dogma of the most tremendous kind, and an undogmatic Creed is"
as senseless as a statue without shape or a picture without
colour. Unsectarian means un-Christian.“--From _Freethinking
"and Plainspeaking_ (pp. 122-4), by Leslie Stephen. (Longmans,"
London.)
The considerations which seemed to compel the clearheaded author of
this extract to his own well-known intellectual position no longer
"apply. In England, at any rate, the Church is not bound down to any"
"mechanical theory of the inspiration of the Bible, and accepts all the"
discoveries of Modern Physical Science without misgiving. Such books
as the late Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Temple) gave us in his
Bampton Lectures have long ago shown the futility of attempting to map
out the exact terms of a reconciliation between the claims of science
"and religion, but they have shown that religion and science are _not_"
destructive and contradictory of each other.
"“The same principles are found in each. The principle of evolution,"
"for instance, is as evident in the gradual development of religion as"
in the age-long process by which the natural world was created; the
order and beauty and regular succession manifest in Nature can be
traced also in the spiritual universe. The revelation which was
formerly held to be violation of law is seen to be a revelation of
"higher law. The great postulate of science, the uniformity of Nature,"
is not infringed.”
"We know now that there are laws of the Universe which, if we knew more"
"about them, would tell us how it was that a Virgin could conceive and"
bear a Son. It is not to us an inconceivable superstition that “The
Son of Man” should have in His own person powers of which the
"rudimentary signs can be traced in all humanity, manifesting"
themselves from time to time. The day is long past when the
"distance--hair up and teeth bared. The feeling is spontaneous,"
"unpredictable, and the usual result is fight."
"Up to this time she had not seen me, or even known of my insignificant"
"existence; but suddenly, as though it were a sally of banter whose blade"
"he parried in the nick of time, her laughter-bathed eyes darted past him"
and squarely met my own; her lips sobered into a half parted expression
"of interest and, some strange thought--perhaps unbidden--coming into her"
"mind, sent the blood surging to her cheeks. As quickly as this happened"
"it had gone, and again she seemed to be absorbing the attention of her"
_vis-à-vis_.
"Once, years ago in the Dolomites, I thoughtlessly struck my staff upon a"
"piece of rock when, lo, a wonderful tone arose therefrom. And the memory"
"of that rich, unbidden sound was re-awakened now as the contact of our"
glances stirred something which thrilled me with a maddening sense of
harmony. As an E string vibrates when another E is struck somewhere near
"to it, so my being vibrated with each tilt of her head, each movement of"
her lips. Yet however much I conjured the magnet of my will to make her
"look again, she successfully, if coquettishly, resisted."
The Spanish waiter came up softly to refill my glass; an attention I
"permitted, murmuring happily:"
"""Right, kiddo! Stay me with flagons, comfort me with champagne, for my"
"heart is faint with love!""--only Solomon didn't sing it quite like"
"that, the fickle old dog, nor did my waiter understand me, which was"
just as well.
Engrossed with watching her I saw a new look come into her face as she
quickly whispered something across the table. Her _vis-à-vis_ turned
"impatiently as a man approached them, who to my surprise was the yacht"
moderate. Meanwhile the smouldering quarrel with Lee assumed ever more
hateful forms. In vain did Erasmus's English friends attempt to restrain
"their young, ambitious compatriot. Erasmus on his part irritated him"
furtively. He reveals in this whole dispute a lack of self-control and
dignity which shows his weakest side. Usually so anxious as to decorum
"he now lapses into invectives: The British adder, Satan, even the old"
taunt ascribing a tail to Englishmen has to serve once more. The points
at issue disappear altogether behind the bitter mutual reproaches. In
"his unrestrained anger, Erasmus avails himself of the most unworthy"
weapons. He eggs his German friends on to write against Lee and to
"ridicule him in all his folly and brag, and then he assures all his"
English friends: 'All Germany is literally furious with Lee; I have the
greatest trouble in keeping them back'.
Alack! Germany had other causes of disturbance: it is 1520 and the three
great polemics of Luther were setting the world on fire.
Though one may excuse the violence and the petty spitefulness of Erasmus
"in this matter, as resulting from an over-sensitive heart falling"
"somewhat short in really manly qualities, yet it is difficult to deny"
that he failed completely to understand both the arguments of his
adversaries and the great movements of his time.
It was very easy for Erasmus to mock the narrow-mindedness of
conservative divines who thought that there would be an end to faith in
Holy Scripture as soon as the emendation of the text was attempted.
"'""They correct the Holy Gospel, nay, the Pater Noster itself!"" the"
preacher exclaims indignantly in the sermon before his surprised
"congregation. As if I cavilled at Matthew and Luke, and not at those"
"who, out of ignorance and carelessness, have corrupted them. What do"
people wish? That the Church should possess Holy Scripture as correct as
"possible, or not?' This reasoning seemed to Erasmus, with his passionate"
of being borne upwards. Piéron has also noted this sensation at the moment
"of death from disease in a number of cases, usually accompanied by a sense"
"of well-being.[129] The cases he describes were mostly tuberculous, and"
"included individuals of both sexes, and of atheistic as well as religious"
"belief. In all, the last sensation to which expression was given was"
"one of flying, of moving upwards. In some death was peaceful, in others"
"painful. In one case a girl died clasping the iron bars of the bed, in"
"horror of being borne upwards. Piéron, no doubt rightly, associates this"
sensation with the similar sensation of rising and floating common in
"dreams, and with the feeling of moving upwards and resting on the air"
experienced by persons in the ecstatic state. In all these cases alike
"life is being concentrated in the brain and central organs, while the"
outlying districts of the body are becoming numb and dead.
In this way it comes about that out of dreams and of dream-like waking
"states, one of the most permanent of human spiritual conceptions has been"
"evolved. To float, to rise into the air, to fly up to heaven, has always"
seemed to man to be the final climax of spiritual activity. The angel is
the most ethereal creature the human imagination can conceive. Browning's
"cry to his 'lyric love, half angel and half bird,' pathetically crude as"
"poetry, is sound as psychology. The prophets and divine heroes of the race"
have constantly seemed to their devout followers to disappear at last by
"floating up into the sky, like Elijah, who went up 'by a whirlwind into"
"heaven.' St. Peter once thought he saw his Master walking on the waves,"
and the last vision of Jesus in the Gospels reveals him rising into
the air. For it is in the world of dreams that the human soul has its
"indestructible home, and in the attempt to realise these dreams lies a"
large part of our business in life.

"Recognizing in the officers' quarry the supposed figure of Emerson, the"
"hated cause of all this strife, the strikers gave vent to a great shout"
"of rage and triumph, and surged forward across the wide street,"
carrying the police before them with irresistible force.
In a moment it became not a question of keeping the entrance to the
"wharf, but of protecting the life of the prisoner, and the policemen"
"rallied with their backs to the wall, their clubs working havoc with"
the heads that came within striking distance.
"Scarcely had Boyd reached Big George, when a wing of the besieging army"
swept in through the unguarded entrance and down the dock like an
"avalanche, leaving behind them the battling officers and the hungry"
pack clamoring for the prisoner.
"""Drop that freight, and get aboard the best way you can!"" Boyd yelled"
"at the fishermen, and with a bound was out into the open crying to"
Captain Peasley on the bridge:
"""Here they come! Cast off, for God's sake!"""
Instantly a wild cry of rage and defiance rose from the clotted rigging
"and upper works of _The Bedford Castle_. Down the fishermen swarmed,"
"ready to over-flow the sides of the ship, but, with a sharp order to"
"George, Boyd ran up the gang-plank and rushed along the rail to a"
"commanding position in the path of his men, where, drawing his"
"revolver, he roared at them to keep back, threatening the first to go"
"ashore. His lungs were bursting from his sprint, and it was with"
difficulty that his voice rose above the turmoil; but he presented such
"a figure of determination that the men paused, and then the steamship"
"whistle interrupted opportunely, with a deafening blast."
"Unusual words, proper names, and figures should be written out with the"
greatest care and distinctness by the author.
"It is for the common advantage of the author, the publisher, and the"
printer that the author or the editor read all proofs promptly.
ESTIMATING THE MANUSCRIPT
The usual procedure in making a book is as follows: When the publisher
"sends the manuscript to the printer, a request goes with it for a"
"sample page, set to a size and in a type which will make a volume of"
the desired number of pages. A novel is supposed to run from 320 pages
to 400 pages. The first thing to be done is to estimate the number of
"words in the manuscript, and this is accomplished by averaging the"
"number of words in say thirty lines, and then multiplying by the number"
"of lines on a page. No allowance is made for fractional lines, as these"
"also occur in the printed page. If the manuscript is carefully written,"
"each page will contain the same number of lines, so the total number"
"of words may be found by multiplying the number of words on the page,"
"as arrived at above, by the total number of pages in the manuscript."
This explains the importance of having a standard number of lines on
each page.[32] No allowance is made for fractional pages at the end of
"chapters, as there are also fractional pages in the printed book, and"
it averages up.
"The front matter has to be estimated separately, with allowance for"
"the blanks on the reverse of bastard-title, dedication, etc.,[33] but"
"the usual number of pages is eight. Then, again, an allowance of half"
a page for each chapter sinkage[34] has to be made. Suppose we have a
"manuscript of 90,000 words, with 24 chapters: A type page of 280 words"
"gives us 322 pages, to which we add 8 pages for front and 12 pages"
"But the dog only made a splash in the water with her paws, and then"
"turned and ran after me. The boatmen laughed and resumed their poling,"
and I passed on. In the still morning across the still water I could
"hear every word, but I hardly took any note; I have heard it so often."
Only now when I come to write on this subject do I remember.
It has been inculcated in us from childhood that it is a manly thing to
"be indifferent to pain--not to our own pain only, but to that of all"
"others. To be sorry for a hunted hare, to compassionate the wounded"
"deer, to shrink from torturing the brute creation, has been accounted by"
"us as namby-pamby sentimentalism, not fit for man, fit only for a"
squeamish woman. To the Burman it is one of the highest of all virtues.
He believes that all that is beautiful in life is founded on compassion
and kindness and sympathy--that nothing of great value can exist without
"them. Do you think that a Burmese boy would be allowed to birds'-nest,"
"or worry rats with a terrier, or go ferreting? Not so. These would be"
crimes.
That this kindness and compassion for animals has very far-reaching
"results no one can doubt. If you are kind to animals, you will be kind,"
"too, to your fellow-man. It is really the same thing, the same feeling"
in both cases. If to be superior in position to an animal justifies you
"in torturing it, so it would do with men. If you are in a better"
"position than another man, richer, stronger, higher in rank, that"
would--that does often in our minds--justify ill-treatment and contempt.
Our innate feeling towards all that we consider inferior to ourselves is
scorn; the Burman's is compassion. You can see this spirit coming out in
"every action of their daily life, in their dealings with each other, in"
"their thoughts, in their speech. 'You are so strong, have you no"
"compassion for him who is weak, who is tempted, who has fallen?' How"
often have I heard this from a Burman's lips! How often have I seen him
"who, of his own accord, does better things than human laws require? What"
arrogance it is to bind by institutions a man who is clearly led by the
inspirations of the divine spirit!
In Erasmus we already find the beginning of that optimism which judges
"upright man good enough to dispense with fixed forms and rules. As More,"
"in _Utopia_, and Rabelais, Erasmus relies already on the dictates of"
"nature, which produces man as inclined to good and which we may follow,"
provided we are imbued with faith and piety.
In this line of confidence in what is natural and desire of the simple
"and reasonable, Erasmus's educational and social ideas lie. Here he is"
far ahead of his times. It would be an attractive undertaking to discuss
Erasmus's educational ideals more fully. They foreshadow exactly those
"of the eighteenth century. The child should learn in playing, by means"
"of things that are agreeable to its mind, from pictures. Its faults"
should be gently corrected. The flogging and abusive schoolmaster is
Erasmus's abomination; the office itself is holy and venerable to him.
Education should begin from the moment of birth. Probably Erasmus
"attached too much value to classicism, here as elsewhere: his friend"
Peter Gilles should implant the rudiments of the ancient languages in
"his two-year-old son, that he may greet his father with endearing"
stammerings in Greek and Latin. But what gentleness and clear good sense
shines from all Erasmus says about instruction and education!
The same holds good of his views about marriage and woman. In the
problem of sexual relations he distinctly sides with the woman from deep
conviction. There is a great deal of tenderness and delicate feeling in
his conception of the position of the girl and the woman. Few characters
of the _Colloquies_ have been drawn with so much sympathy as the girl
with the lover and the cultured woman in the witty conversation with the
abbot. Erasmus's ideal of marriage is truly social and hygienic. Let us
to such a futile little house; he could have smashed in the former with
"a blow of his fist, and he could have jumped into the latter through the"
first-floor windows. With his great bulk he felt himself absurdly out
of scale. The tragedy looming huge in his mind was also absurdly out
of scale with his errand. The house was one of a row of twenty
"perky, gabled, two-storied little villas, each coyly shrinking to"
"the farthermost limit of its tiny front garden, and each guarding the"
"privacy of its interior by means of muslin curtains at the windows, tied"
"back by ribbons, the resultant triangle of transparency being obscured"
by a fat-leafed plant. The terrace bore the name of “Tregarthion
"Villas,” and the one inhabited by Miss Lindon was called “The Oaks.” It"
was a sham little terrace full of sham little gentilities. John hated
it. What could have induced his mother's sister to inhabit such a sphere
of flimsiness?
"Flimsiness, also, met him inside, when he was shown through a"
bamboo-furnished passage into a gimcrack little drawing-room. He tried
"several chairs dubiously with his hand, shook his head, and seated"
himself on a couch. Everything in the room seemed flimsy and futile.
He had the impression that everything save a sham spinning-wheel and a
half-solved jig-saw puzzle on the little table was draped in muslin and
"tied up with pink ribbons. A decrepit black-and-tan terrier, disturbed"
"in his slumbers in front of the fire, barked violently. A canary in a"
cage by the window sang in discordant emulation. John poised his hat and
"stick on the curved and slippery satin-covered couch, and they fell with"
a clatter to the floor. The frown deepened on his brow. Why had he come
to this distracting abode of mindlessness? He wished he had brought
Herold gyved and manacled. What with the dog and the canary and the
"doll's-house furniture, the sensitive and fastidious one would have gone"
mad. He would have gloated over his ravings. It would have served him
right.
"London, with its subdued lights, lay all around me. It had not changed"
"since I saw it last, and yet I felt it ought to have changed. The reason"
was that I had changed. And then I began to fear that I had changed
beyond the power of recovery. The oppressive sensation that I was in a
dream forced itself upon me. I felt that there was only one reality in
the whole world--the war. Would I ever escape from the war? It would
"come to an end some day, and I would leave the army, but would not the"
war obsess me until the end of my life? Would I ever be myself again?
But this was not the way to enjoy my leave! I began to feel
disappointed at not being so happy as I had expected to be. Why was I
not full of rapture? Why did not every object fill me with delight? But
I ought to have known that habitual discontent and bitterness and revolt
"are not shaken off in a few hours or a few days, and that they persist"
even after their immediate cause has been removed.
I looked round at the other people sitting on the 'bus. I had visited
"foreign countries in former years, but never before had I felt that I"
"was amongst complete strangers. There are moments when a dog, a horse,"
or a bird fills us with a sense of the uncanny--its mind is an insoluble
"mystery, with depths so dark and inscrutable that one feels something"
that approaches fear and horror. And so it was as I sat on the 'bus. The
civilians around me seemed like animals of a different species. They
were not human at all--or was it I who was not human?
I went to another seat in order to listen to a man and woman who were
"talking together. I felt that if they were to talk about the war, the"
"uncanny spell would be broken, the dream would dissolve and I would be"
restored to my own fellow creatures. But they spoke about trivial
domestic matters and about a flower show. If they had only mentioned the
"word ""war"" I would have felt relieved by its familiarity, but they did"
not mention it once.
"for derision from all the “chorus of irresponsible reviewers, the"
irresponsible indolent reviewers.”
I believe that Fiction will find those that can be reached by no other
means. Fiction sometimes sets a man seeking for Fact.
Very diffidently and very reverently I may remind my contemporaries
"that one, who has, at any rate, profoundly influenced the course of"
"history, whatever view we may take of His person, did not disdain this"
"method, “He taught them by parables.”"
“Let me tell you a story.” Is there any age of mankind which does not
respond to the invitation and give audience? A story stilled the
"tumult of the nursery in our earliest days, when heavy storms shook"
"the windows and the tedium of a long, wet afternoon had turned play"
into fretfulness. A story beguiled us into interest when our History
"lesson had seemed an arid futility in Fourth Form days, and our"
magisterial enemies began to show themselves human after all when they
bade us read _The Last of the Barons_ as we were painfully plodding in
"the Plantagenet period, and found the War of the Roses a very thorny"
waste.
It is strange to turn over the pages of eminent evangelical sermons
of the early Victorian days and to notice how “Novel reading” is
denounced. Probably the worthy divines who fulminated against fiction
"were thinking of their own boyhood, and the mischief which came to"
them from Fielding and Richardson and Smollett surreptitiously
perused. Sir Anthony Absolute’s detestation of the circulating library
survived in some provincial circles even when Sir Walter Scott had
come to his own. The last forty years have altered things
"considerably, and though some men may pretend to despise novels,"
now-a-days they must take them into account. Wise and learned persons
necessary. In this matter the aims of the people and the Government are
one. In facing a common danger and in co-operation there must arise
mutual respect and understanding. And perhaps through the very
catastrophe that is threatening the world there may grow up in India a
realisation of community of interest and solidarity as between
Government and people.
A CALL FOR NOBLER PATRIOTISM
A very serious danger is thus seen to be threatening the future of
"India, and to avert it will require the utmost effort of the people."
They have not only to meet the economic crisis but also to protect the
ideals of ancient Aryan civilisation from the destructive forces that
are threatening it. Nothing great can be conserved except through
"constant effort and sacrifice. There is a danger of, regarding the"
mechanical efficiency as the sole end of life; there is also the
"opposite danger of a life of dreaming, bereft of struggle and activity,"
degenerating into parasitic habits of dependence. Only through the
nobler call of patriotism can our nation realise her highest ideals in
thought and in action; to that call the nation will always respond. He
had the inestimable privilege of winning the intimate friendship of Mr.
"G. K. Gokhale. Before leaving England, our foremost Indian statesman"
"whose loss we so deeply mourn, had come to stay with the speaker for a"
few days at Eastbourne. He knew that this was to be their last meeting.
Almost his parting question to Dr. Bose was whether science had anything
"to say about future incarnations. For himself, however he was certain"
that as soon as he would cast off his worn out frame he was to be born
"once more in the country he loved, and bear all the country that may be"
laid on him in her service. There can be no doubt that there must be
salvation for a country which can count on sons as devoted as Gopal
Krishna Gokhale.
"red croton leaves, and the leaves of the red-blossomed mangrove--red"
"coloured substances being used to make the shell red, magically. Then,"
"passing in front of all the other canoes, he rubs their prows with"
"the bundle of leaves. After that, the canoes at both ends of the"
"row begin to punt along, the row evolving into a circle, through"
"which presently the canoe of the magician passes, punting along its"
"diameter. At this place in the Lagoon, there is a small vatu (coral"
outcrop) called Vitukwayla'i. This is called the vatu of the baloma
"(spirits). At this vatu the magician's canoe stops, and he orders some"
of its crew to dive down and here to begin the gathering of shells.
Some more private magic is performed later on by each canoe on its own
"account. The anchor stone is charmed with some red hibiscus flowers,"
in order to make the spondylus shell red. There is another private
"magic called 'sweeping of the sea,' which, like the magic of the mussel"
"shell, mentioned above, makes the sea clear and transparent. Finally,"
there is an evil magic called 'besprinkling with salt water.' If a
"man does it over the others, he will annul the effects of their magic,"
"and frustrate their efforts, while he himself would arouse astonishment"
and suspicion by the amount of shell collected. Such a man would dive
"down into the water, take some brine into his mouth, and emerging,"
"spray it towards the other canoes, while he utters the evil charm."
So much for the magic and the ceremonial associated with the
"spondylus fishing in the Trobriand Lagoon. In Sanaroa, exactly the"
"same proceedings take place, except that there is no attracting of"
"the reef, probably because they are already at the original seat"
of the kaloma. Again I was told that some of the private magic
would be performed in Sinaketa before the fleet sailed on the Kula
"expedition. The objects medicated would be then kept, well wrapped"
in dried leaves.
the woman of the myth. It begins with a long list of ancestral names;
then follows a boastful picture of how the whole fleet admires the
magical success of the magician's spell. The key-word in the main part
"is the word 'itolo': 'it stands up,' i.e., 'it starts,' and with this,"
"there are enumerated all the various classes of the kaloma shell,"
"differentiated according to size, colour and quality. It ends up with"
"another boast; ""My canoe is overloaded with shell so that it sinks,"""
which is repeated with varying phraseology.
"This spell the magician may utter once only, or he may repeat it"
several times on successive days. He fixes then the final date for the
"fishing expedition. On the evening before that date, the men perform"
"some private magic, every one in his own house. The hammering stone,"
"the gabila, which is always a binabina (it is a stone imported from"
"the Koya), is charmed over. As a rule it is put on a piece of dried"
banana leaf with some red hibiscus blossoms and leaves or flowers
"of red colour. A formula is uttered over it, and the whole is then"
wrapped up in the banana leaf and kept there until it is used. This
"will make the stone a lucky one in hitting off many shells, and it"
will make the shells very red.
Another rite of private magic consists in charming a large mussel
"shell, with which, on the next morning, the body of the canoe will"
"be scraped. This makes the sea clear, so that the diver may easily"
see and frequently find his spondylus shells.
Next morning the whole fleet starts on the expedition. Some food has
"been taken into the canoes, as the fishing usually lasts for a few"
"days, the nights being spent on the beach of Nanoula. When the canoes"
"arrive at a certain point, about half-way between Sinaketa and Nanoula,"
they all range themselves in a row. The canoe of the magician is at the
"right flank, and he medicates a bunch of red hibiscus flowers, some"
of the lighthouses which serve its own great fleet and the ships of all
the world. It has dredged new channels and marked them with buoys. It
has installed along the Central and South American coasts a wireless
telegraph service of the highest power and efficiency. It has
"constructed hundreds of miles of public roads, maintains public schools,"
and in other ways renders at its own expense the services which are
presumed to fall on governments. The American financiers associated with
it are now pushing to completion the Pan-American railroad which soon
"will connect New York with Panama by an all-rail route, and thus realize"
what once was esteemed an impractical dream.
But it is the United Fruit Company’s activities in Panama only that are
pertinent to this book. They demonstrate strikingly how readily one
natural opportunity afforded by this land responded to the call of
"systematic effort, and there are a dozen products beside the banana"
which might thus be exploited.

The fruit is thrown out by the company’s inspectors for scarcely visible
flaws]
"On the Atlantic coast, only a night’s sail from Colon, is the port of"
"Bocas del Toro (The Mouths of the Bull), a town of about 9000"
"inhabitants, built and largely maintained by the banana trade. Here is"
"the largest and most beautiful natural harbor in the American tropics,"
and here some day will be established a winter resort to which will
flock people from all parts of the world. Almirante Bay and the Chiriqui
"Lagoon extend thirty or forty miles, dotted with thousands of islands"
"decked with tropical verdure, and flanked to the north and west by"
superb mountain ranges with peaks of from seven to ten thousand feet in
height.
"shell; she would go, she would carry his valuable to this man,"
"our relative-in-law. Next day, he would yomelu; he would catch"
"a pig, he would break off a bunch of betel-nut, he would cut"
"sugar cane, bananas, he would fill the baskets with food, and"
spike the coco-nut on a multi-forked piece of wood. By-and-by
he would bring it. Our house would be filled up. Later on we
"would make a distribution of the bananas, of the sugar cane, of"
"the betel-nut. We give it to our helpers. We sit, we sit (i.e.,"
"we wait); at harvest time he brings yams, he karibudaboda (he"
"gives the payment of that name), the necklace. He would bring"
the food and fill out our yam house.
"This narrative, like many pieces of native information, needs certain"
"corrections of perspective. In the first place, events here succeed one"
another with a rapidity quite foreign to the extremely leisurely way in
which natives usually accomplish such a lengthy process as the making
"of a katudababile. The amount of food which, in the usual manner,"
is enumerated over and over again in this narrative would probably
"not be exaggerated, for--such is native economy--a man who makes a"
necklace to order would get about twice as much or even more for it
"than it would fetch in any other transaction. On the other hand,"
it must be remembered that what is represented here as the final
"payment, the karibudaboda, is nothing else but the normal filling up"
"of the yam house, always done by a man's relations-in-law. None the"
"less, in a year in which a katudababile would be made, the ordinary"
yearly harvest gift would be styled the 'karibudaboda payment for
"the necklace.' The giving of the necklace to the wife, who afterwards"
"carries it to her brother or kinsman, is also characteristic of the"
relation between relatives-in-law.
In Sinaketa and Vakuta only the necklaces made of bigger shell and
"about themselves, even to quite trifling and unnecessary details. And,"
"of course, each one thinks himself or herself the ONLY or the chief"
"'celebrity' in London, or, for that matter, in the world. I have always"
"to tone down the egotistical part of it a little, especially with"
"authors, for if I were to write out exactly what THEY separately say of"
"their contemporaries, it would be simply frightful! They would be all"
at daggers drawn in no time! I assure you 'interviewing' is often a
"most delicate and difficult business!"""
"""Would it were altogether impossible!"" said Villiers heartily--""But as"
"long as there is a plethora of little authors, and a scarcity of great"
"ones, so long, I suppose, must it continue--for little men love"
"notoriety, and great ones shrink from it, just in the same way that"
"good women like flattery, while bad ones court it. I hope you don't"
bear me any grudge because I consider my friend Alwyn both good and
"great, and resent the idea of his being placed, no matter with what"
"excellent intention soever, on the level of the small and mean?"""
The lady surveyed him with a twinkle of latent approval in her
pale-colored eyes.
"""Not in the least!"" she replied in a tone of perfect good-humor. ""On"
"the contrary, I rather admire your frankness! Still, I think, that as"
"matters stand nowadays, you are very odd,--and I suppose your friend is"
"odd too,--but, of course, there must be exceptions to every rule. At"
"the same time, you should recollect that, in many people's opinion, to"
"be 'interviewed' is one of the chiefest rewards of fame!--"" Villiers"
"shrugged his shoulders expressively. ""Oh, yes, it seems a poor reward"
"to you, no doubt,""--she continued smilingly,--""but there are no end of"
"authors who would do anything to secure the notoriety of it! Now,"
"suppose that, after all, Mr. Alwyn DOES care to submit to the"
"operation, you will let me know, won't you?"""
The senses are open for the nice observation of the curious. Though
"Erasmus does not know that need of proving the secrets of nature, which"
"inspired a Leonardo da Vinci, a Paracelsus, a Vesalius, he is also, by"
"his keen observation, a child of his time. For peculiarities in the"
habits and customs of nations he has an open eye. He notices the gait of
"Swiss soldiers, how dandies sit, how Picards pronounce French. He"
notices that in old pictures the sitters are always represented with
"half-closed eyes and tightly shut lips, as signs of modesty, and how"
"some Spaniards still honour this expression in life, while German art"
"prefers lips pouting as for a kiss. His lively sense of anecdote, to"
"which he gives the rein in all his writings, belongs here."
"And, in spite of all his realism, the world which Erasmus sees and"
"renders, is not altogether that of the sixteenth century. Everything is"
veiled by Latin. Between the author's mind and reality intervenes his
antique diction. At bottom the world of his mind is imaginary. It is a
subdued and limited sixteenth-century reality which he reflects.
Together with its coarseness he lacks all that is violent and direct in
"his times. Compared with the artists, with Luther and Calvin, with the"
"statesmen, the navigators, the soldiers and the scientists, Erasmus"
confronts the world as a recluse. It is only the influence of Latin. In
"spite of all his receptiveness and sensitiveness, Erasmus is never fully"
"in contact with life. All through his work not a bird sings, not a wind"
rustles.
But that reserve or fear of directness is not merely a negative quality.
It also results from a consciousness of the indefiniteness of the ground
"of all things, from the awe of the ambiguity of all that is. If Erasmus"
"so often hovers over the borderline between earnestness and mockery, if"
"he hardly ever gives an incisive conclusion, it is not only due to"
"cautiousness, and fear to commit himself. Everywhere he sees the"
"shadings, the blending of the meaning of words. The terms of things are"
"preparation for his higher and better destiny. The cultured, the"
"scholarly, the ultra-refined, may live well and uprightly by their"
"'moral sense,'--if they so choose, provided they have some great ideal"
"to measure themselves by,--but even these, without faith in God, may"
"sometimes slip, and fall into deeper depths of ruin than they dreamed"
"of, when self-centred on those heights of virtue where they fancied"
"themselves exempt from danger."""
"He paused,--there was a curious stillness in the room,--many eyes were"
"lowered, and M. le Duc's composure was evidently not quite so absolute"
as usual.
"""Taken at its best""--he continued--""the world alone is certainly not"
worth fighting for;--we see the fact exemplified every day in the cases
"of those who, surrounded by all that a fair fortune can bestow upon"
"them, deliberately hurl themselves out of existence by their own free"
"will and act,--indeed, suicide is a very general accompaniment of"
"Agnosticism. And self-slaughter, though it may be called madness, is"
"far more often the result of intellectual misery."""
"""Of course, too much learning breeds brain disease""--remarked Dr."
"Mudley sententiously--""but only in weak subjects,--and in my opinion"
"the weak are better out of the world. We've no room for them nowadays."""
"""You say truly, sir,""--replied Alwyn--""we have no room for them, and no"
"patience! They show themselves feeble, and forthwith the strong oppress"
"them;--they can hope for little comfort here, and less help. It is"
"well, therefore, that some of these 'weak' should still believe in God,"
since they can certainly pin no faith on the justice of their
fellow-man! But I cannot agree with you that much learning breeds brain
disease. Provided the learning be accompanied by a belief in the
"Supreme Wisdom,--provided every step of study be taken upward toward"
"February 1917, to the students of the Presidency College on receiving"
their _Arghya_ and congratulations on the occasion of his knighthood. It
"was published in the Modern Review for March 1917--Volume XXI, p. 343."
"In your congratulations for the recent honour, you have overlooked a"
"still greater that came to me a year ago, when I was gazetted as your"
"perpetual professor, so that the tie which binds me to you is never to"
be severed. Thirty-two years ago I sought to be your teacher. For the
trust that you imposed on me could I do anything less than place before
you the highest that I knew? I never appealed to your weaknesses but
your strength. I never set before you that was easy but used all the
compulsion for the choice of the most difficult. And perhaps as a
reward for these years of effort I find all over India those who have
been my pupils occupying positions of the highest trust and
responsibility in different walks of life. I do not merely count those
who have won fame and success but I also claim many others who have
taken up the burden of life manfully and whose life of purity and
unselfishness has brought gleams of joy in suffering lives.
THE LAW UNIVERSAL
Through science I was able to teach you how the seeming veils the real;
"how though the garish lights dazzle and blind us, there are lights"
"invisible, which glow persistently after the brief flare burns out. One"
"came to realise how all matter was one, how unified all life was. In the"
various expressions of life even in the realm of thought the same
"Universal law prevails. There was no such thing as brute matter, but"
that spirit suffused matter in which it was enshrined. One also realised
"dimly a mysterious Cyclic Law of Change, seen not merely in inorganic"
matter but also in organised life and its highest manifestations. One
saw how inertness passes into the climax of activity and how that climax
"The procession of drunkards on Palm Sunday, the saving of the"
"shipwrecked crew, the old men waiting for the travelling cart while the"
"drivers are still drinking, all these are Dutch genre pieces of the best"
sort.
We like to speak of the realism of the Renaissance. Erasmus is certainly
a realist in the sense of having an insatiable hunger for knowledge of
the tangible world. He wants to know things and their names: the
"particulars of each thing, be it never so remote, such as those terms of"
games and rules of games of the Romans. Read carefully the description
of the decorative painting on the garden-house of the _Convivium
"religiosum_: it is nothing but an object lesson, a graphic"
representation of the forms of reality.
"In its joy over the material universe and the supple, pliant word, the"
Renaissance revels in a profusion of imagery and expressions. The
"resounding enumerations of names and things, which Rabelais always"
"gives, are not unknown to Erasmus, but he uses them for intellectual and"
useful purposes. In _De copia verborum ac rerum_ one feat of varied
power of expression succeeds another--he gives fifty ways of saying:
"'Your letter has given me much pleasure,' or, 'I think that it is going"
to rain'. The aesthetic impulse is here that of a theme and variations:
to display all the wealth and mutations of the logic of language.
"Elsewhere, too, Erasmus indulges this proclivity for accumulating the"
treasures of his genius; he and his contemporaries can never restrain
themselves from giving all the instances instead of one: in _Ratio verae
"theologiae_, in _De pronuntiatione_, in _Lingua_, in _Ecclesiastes_. The"
"collections of _Adagia_, _Parabolae_, and _Apophthegmata_ are altogether"
"based on this eagerness of the Renaissance (which, by the way, was an"
inheritance of the Middle Ages themselves) to luxuriate in the wealth of
"the tangible world, to revel in words and things."
"I have not, indeed, always attempted to reach the explanation of things"
I have seen. When I have satisfied myself that a belief is really held
"by the people, that I am not the subject of conscious deception, either"
"by myself or others, I have conceived that my work was ended."
"There are those who, in investigating any foreign customs and strange"
"beliefs, can put their finger here and say, 'This is where they are"
"right'; and there and say, 'This belief is foolishly wrong and idiotic.'"
"I am not, unfortunately, one of these writers. I have no such confident"
belief in my own infallibility of judgment as to be able to sit on high
"and say, 'Here is truth, and here is error.'"
"I will leave my readers to make their own judgment, if they desire to do"
so; only asking them (as they would not like their own beliefs to be
scoffed and sneered at) that they will treat with respect the sincere
"beliefs of others, even if they cannot accept them. It is only in this"
way that we can come to understand a people and to sympathize with them.
It is hardly necessary to emphasize the enormous effect that a belief in
transmigration such as this has upon the life and intercourse of the
"people. Of their kindness to animals I have spoken elsewhere, and it is"
"possible this belief in transmigration has something to do with it, but"
"not, I think, much. For if you wished to illtreat an animal, it would be"
"quite easy, even more easy, to suppose that an enemy or a murderer"
"inhabited the body of the animal, and that you were but carrying out the"
"decrees of fate by ill-using it. But when you love an animal, it may"
"increase that love and make it reasonable, and not a thing to be ashamed"
"of; and it brings the animal world nearer to you in general, it bridges"
over the enormous void between man and beast that other religions have
made. Nothing humanizes a man more than love of animals.
"All at once, moved by a sudden impulse, he turned toward the right hand"
"side of the altar, where the great statue of St. Christopher stands,"
and where one of the loveliest windows in the world gleams like a great
"carven gem aloft, filtering the light through a myriad marvellous"
"shades of color, and there he beheld, kneeling on the stone pavement,"
"one solitary worshipper,--a girl. Her hands were clasped, and her face"
"was bent upon them so that her features were not visible,--but the"
"radiance from the window fell on her uncovered golden hair, encircling"
"it with the glistening splendor of a heavenly nimbus,--and round her"
"slight, devotional figure, rays of azure and rose jasper and emerald,"
"flickered in wide and lustrous patterns, like the glow of the setting"
sun on a translucent sea. How very still she was! ... how fervently
absorbed in prayer!
"Vaguely startled, and thrilled by an electric, indefinable instinct,"
"Alwyn went toward her with hushed and reverential tread, his eyes"
"dwelling upon the drooping, delicate outline of her form with"
"fascinated and eager attention. She was clad in gray,--a soft, silken,"
"dove-like gray, that clung about her in picturesque, daintily draped"
"folds,--he approached her still more nearly, and then could scarcely"
refrain from a loud cry of amazement! What flowers were those she wore
"at her breast!--so white, so star-like, so suggestive of paradise"
lilies new-gathered? Were they not the flowers of ARDATH? Dizzy with
"the sudden tumult of his own emotions, he dropped on his knees beside"
"her,--she did not stir! Was she REAL?--or a phantom? Trembling"
"violently, he touched her garment--it was of tangible, smooth texture,"
"actual enough, if the sense of touch could be relied upon. In an agony"
"of excitement and suspense he lost all remembrance of time, place, or"
"custom,--her bewildering presence must be explained,--he must know who"
"she was,--he must speak to her,--speak, if he died for it!"
"""Pardon me!"" he whispered faintly, scarcely conscious of his own words;"
there was at least a chance that they might bring to a successful
conclusion the complex and difficult task which was before them.

"They now drew near to the palace, which, as one descends the mountains,"
"is approached first. The town of San Ildefonso lay further to the right,"
an indistinguishable mass of heaped roofs and turrets without a light or
the vestige of a street apparent in the gloom. It seemed to Rollo a
strange thing to think of this stricken town lying there with its dead
"and dying, its empty tawdry lodgings from which the rich and gay of the"
"Court had fled so hastily, leaving all save their most precious"
"belongings behind, the municipal notices on the door, white crosses"
"chalked on a black ground, while nearer and always nearer approached the"
fell gipsy rabble intent on plunder and rapine.
"Even more strange, however, seemed the case of the royal palace of La"
Granja. Erected at infinite cost after the pattern of Versailles and
"Marly, the smallness of its scale and the magnificence of its natural"
surroundings caused it infinitely to surpass either of its models in
"general effect. It had, however, never been intended for defence, nor"
had the least preparation been made in case of attack. It was doubtless
"presumed that whenever the Court sojourned there, the royal personages"
"would arrive with such a guard and retinue as, in that lonely place,"
would make danger a thing to be laughed at.
But no such series of circumstances as this had ever been thought of;
the plague which had fallen so heavily and as it seemed mysteriously and
instantaneously upon the town; the precincts of the palace about to be
invaded by a foe more fell than Frank or Moor; the guards disappeared
"like snow in the sun, and the only protection of the lives of the"
"Queen-Regent and her daughter, a band of Carlists sent to capture their"
"""Come, gezabo, let's court Dame Roulette! Join us, Jack?"""
"This I declined, and watched them move off arm in arm. But a strange"
"thing arrested my attention for, as they preceded down the corridor, I"
saw a man in yachting clothes--the uniform of a captain--draw quickly
back into an alcove as if wanting to escape discovery. When they had
"passed he looked out, more fearfully than curiously, and after a moment"
of indecision slowly followed them. Urged by a suspicion that this was
"in some way associated with the professor, I arose and also followed."
Yet upon reaching the salon the stranger was nowhere to be seen. Tommy
"and Monsieur were each buying a stack of chips, the place seemed quiet"
"and orderly, so without being observed I returned to my table."
"Now left alone I leaned back, idly twisting the stem of my glass,"
looking over the sea of merry people who made a picture that quickened
interest. For I am particularly fond of sitting apart and watching an
"assemblage of handsomely groomed men and women laughing, talking and"
making love. I like to guess whether fears or tears or desperate courage
hide behind their gayety; whether the rapidly wagging tongues are
uttering inanities or planning naughty things; whether the love-making
"will stop with coffee and liqueur, or, lighted by them, burn into"
eternity.
All phases of human banality and human enigma seemed to be represented.
There were languid beauties of the Latin type whose drooping eyes might
"have expressed _ennui_, passion, pride--anything, in fact, that one's"
"humor chose to fancy; the blonde by adoption was there, with heavy"
"ear-rings of jet, whose habit was that of looking slant-wise through her"
"cigarette smoke and raising one black, though carefully plucked,"
"eyebrow; also there were a few American women, by far the most smartly"
dressed. Great was the throb of life in this discreet and fashionable
"England the priest solemnly instructs the god-parents of the child,"
"“Ye shall call upon him to hear sermons,” but for the most part the"
"admonition is in vain. As a matter of fact, he picks up his religious"
notions from the newspaper press. And the newspaper press is not now
controlled by men who have a distinct and definite belief in
"Christianity. It depends upon Finance, and financiers have other"
"interests. The assertion of the Psalter, “Notus in Judæa” has been"
"changed now-a-days into an interrogation, and we ask, “In Jewry _is_"
God known?” Let any man who has an intimate acquaintance with the
newspaper world run over in his mind the names of the great newspaper
"proprietors, the editors of our journalistic press, the writers of"
"leading articles, the rising young journalists; and when he has"
"excepted a few Irishmen, who may happen to remain faithful to the"
"Roman Catholic Church, to which they owe their education, how many men"
"will he find who honestly believe the Nicene Creed, and are habitually"
present on the first day of the week at the Breaking of the Bread?
The tone of the daily paper is tolerant. There is no rude hostility
"displayed towards definite Christian doctrines, but the toleration is"
"politely contemptuous. “All wise men are of the same religion, and"
what that religion is wise men do not say.”
It is true that in political matters the press has less power than it
used to have. A magnate of finance cannot now seriously affect public
"opinion, though he may buy newspaper after newspaper, and sweep out"
the editorial staff to supply their places with men of his own choice.
One wealthy wirepuller has other plutocrats to reckon with in
"questions of party politics, and a newspaper man who is dismissed by"
the proprietor of the _Tariff Reformer_ may find another editorial
chair placed at his disposal by the owner of _The Standard of Free
Trade_.
Flag Days and to Our Own Day; besides enriching a number of
semi-fraudulent war charities which had alluring titles.
"But if, from paying handsomely to all these praise-worthy endeavours"
"to mitigate the horrors of war, she proceeded to render personal"
"service, she became the despair of the paid organizers and"
business-like workers. She couldn't add and she couldn't subtract or
divide with any certainty of a correct result; she couldn't spell
the more difficult words or remember the right letters to put after
distinguished persons' names when she addressed envelopes in her
"large, childish handwriting; she couldn't be trusted to make"
enquiries or to detect fraudulent appeals. She lost receipts and
never grasped the importance of vouchers; she forgot to fill up
"counterfoils, or if reminded filled them up ""from memory"" so that"
"they didn't tally; she signed her name, if there was any choice of"
"blank spaces, in quite the wrong place."
"So, invariably, tactful secretaries or assistant secretaries were"
"told off to explain to her--ever so nicely--that ""she was no"
"business woman"" (this, to the daughter of wholesale manufacturers,"
"sounded rather flattering), and that though she was invaluable as a"
"""name,"" as a patroness, or one of eighteen Vice Presidents, she was"
of no use whatever as a worker.
She had no country house to place at the disposal of the Government
as a convalescent home. Michael after a few experiments forbade her
offering any hospitality at No. 1 Park Crescent to invalid officers.
Such as were entrusted to her in the spring of 1915 soon found that
"she was--as they phrased it--""a pompous little, middle-class fool,"""
wielding no authority. They larked in the laboratory with Red Cross
"nurses, broke specimens, and did very unkind and noisy things ..."
"besides smoking in both the large _and_ the small dining-rooms. So,"
"spacious days of Great Elizabeth, than in a tale of modern life such"
as _Two Years Ago_. His Broad Church Catholic teaching does not always
"find its way to the man in the street, and Henry Kingsley, whose life"
"was so different from that of his illustrious clerical brother, has"
more of human interest in his stories.
"The novel with a purpose, and especially with a religious purpose,"
"fails only, when it does fail, because the author’s knowledge of the"
"average man in his sins and his temptations to sin, is altogether"
incommensurate with his familiarity with the great religious and
social problems of which his story would suggest a solution.
It is often supposed that the men do not care to find the subject of
"religion introduced in fiction, that they resent religion in a novel,"
as children resent the administration of a medicinal powder in a
spoonful of jam; but the expert witness of publishers demolishes this
"opinion. After all, the religious claim is insistent, and life is"
untruly depicted when men and women are described in a story as
uninfluenced by it. There is something unreal in a book which has no
Sundays in it. Critical opinion as expressed in the notices of books
"in the daily papers, and in more weighty reviews, is very misleading,"
simply because the reviewers are generally very young men or women
who know more or less of literature but very little of life. The wrath
of the young man fresh from the University at the success of those
books which do not ignore the spiritual needs of men and women amuses
the experienced author.
“Faugh!” cries Mr. Jones of Balliol; “another batch of sin and
sentiment!” “The Christian creed and the conjugal copula! Religion and
Patchouli!” Yet the critic forgets that those who would reach the
minds and hearts of men must deal with the problems of creed and
"character which men have to solve, each one for himself."
But what shall we say of our president--Ingersoll? A man who in
ten short years has carried mental liberty into every household in
"America--who is without limitations in religion, and modifies justice by"
"no prefix. A man who, with unequaled oratory, champions Freedom--not the"
"""free, white, adult, male"" freedom of Washington. A man who has breasted"
"a whirlwind of detraction and abuse for Justice--not the ""male, adult"""
"justice of Lincoln, but the freedom and justice, without limitation, for"
"""man, woman, and child."""
"With such a leader, what should not be achieved? With such a champion,"
what cause could fail? If the people ever place such a man in the White
"House, the nations of this earth will know, for the first time, the real"
meaning of a free government under secular administration.
"""A government of the people, for the people, by the people,"" will be"
"more than simply a high-sounding phrase, which, read by the light of the"
"past, was only a bitter mockery to a race in chains; and, read by the"
"light of the present, is a choice bit of grim humor to half of a nation"
in petticoats. But so long as the taste of the voter is such that he
prefers to place in the executive chair a type of man so eminently
fitted for private life that when you want to find him you have to
"_shake the chair_ to see if he is in it, just so long will there be no"
danger that the lightning will strike so as to deprive the Freethinkers
of one man in America who could fill the national executive chair
"_full_, and strain the back and sides a little getting in."
"Once more I send greetings to the Convention, with the hope that you may"
"have as grand a time as you ought to have, and that Free thought will"
receive a new impulse from the harmony and enthusiasm of this meeting.

"primitive age of the race, but experience in telling stories has taught"

"Some people maintain that little children, who take things with brutal"
"logic, ought not to be allowed the Fairy Tale in its more limited"
"form of the Supernatural; whereas, if presented to older children,"
"this material can be criticised, catalogued and (alas!) rejected as"
"worthless, or retained with flippant toleration."
"Now, whilst recognising a certain value in this point of view, I am"
"bound to admit that if we regulate our stories entirely on this basis,"
we lose the real value of the Fairy Tale element--it is the one element
"which causes little children to _wonder_, simply because no scientific"
analysis of the story can be presented to them. It is somewhat
heartrending to feel that Jack and the Bean-Stalk and stories of that
ilk are to be handed over to the critical youth who will condemn the
"quick growth of the tree as being contrary to the order of nature, and"
wonder why Jack was not playing football in the school team instead of
climbing trees in search of imaginary adventures.
A wonderful plea for the telling of early superstitions to children is
to be found in an old Indian Allegory called “The Blazing Mansion.”
"“An old man owned a large, rambling mansion--the pillars"
"were rotten, the galleries tumbling down, the thatch dry and"
"combustible, and there was only one door. Suddenly, one day, there"
was a smell of fire: the old man rushed out. To his horror he
"saw that the thatch was aflame, the rotten pillars were catching"
"fire one by one, and the rafters were burning like tinder. But"
"inside, the children went on amusing themselves quite happily. The"
distracted father said: ‘I will run in and save my children. I will
highly-developed imagination of the one and the stodgy prosaical
temperament of the other. Tom could enter into the elementary question
"of giving his school-fellow a black eye, but could not possibly enter"
into the drama of the imaginary arrival of a lion. He was sorely in
need of Fairy Stories.
"It is for this element we have to cater, and we cannot shirk our"
responsibilities.
"William James says: “Living things, moving things or things that"
"savour of danger or blood, that have a dramatic quality, these are"
"the things natively interesting to childhood, to the exclusion of"
"almost everything else, and the teacher of young children (until more"
artificial interests have grown up) will keep in touch with his pupils
by constant appeal to such matters as those.”[34]
Of course the savour of danger and blood is only _one_ of the things to
"which we should appeal, but I give the whole passage to make the point"
clearer.
"This is one of the most difficult parts of our selection, namely, how"
to present enough excitement for the child and yet include enough
constructive element which will satisfy him when the thirst for
“blugginess” is slaked.
"And here I should like to say that, whilst wishing to encourage in"
children great admiration and reverence for the courage and other fine
"qualities which have been displayed in times of war, and which have"
"mitigated its horrors, I think we should show that some of the finest"
moments in these heroes' lives had nothing to do with their profession
as soldiers. Thus we have the well-known story of Sir Philip Sidney and
the soldier; the wonderful scene where Roland drags the bodies of his
the religious orders. To these were joined the northern parts of Navarra
"and the Basque countries whose privileges had been threatened, together"
with large districts of the ever-turbulent provinces of Aragon and
Catalunia.
Round the Queen-Regent and her little daughter collected all the liberal
"opinion of the peninsula, most of the foreign sympathy, the influence of"
"the great towns and sea-ports, of the capital and the government"
"officials, the regular army and police with their officers--indeed all"
the organised and stated machinery of government.
But up to the time of our history these advantages had been to some
extent neutralised by the ill-success of the governmental generalship
and by the brilliant successes of two great Carlist leaders--Tomas
Zumalacarregui and Ramon Cabrera.
These men perfectly understood the conditions of warfare among their
"native mountains, and had inflicted defeat upon defeat on every Cristino"
general sent against them.
But a cloud had of late overspread the fair prospects of the party.
"Their great general, Tomas Zumalacarregui, had been killed by a cannon"
"ball at the siege of Bilbao, and Cabrera, though unsurpassed as a"
"guerrilla leader, had not the swift Napoleonic judgment and breadth of"
"view of his predecessor. Add to this that a new premier, Mendizábal, and"
"a new general, Espartero, were directing operations from Madrid. The"
"former, already half English, had begun to carry out his great scheme of"
filling the pockets of the civil and military authorities by conveying
to the government all the property belonging to the religious orders
"throughout Spain, who, like our friend the Abbot of Montblanch, had"
resolutely and universally espoused the cause of Don Carlos.
right nor to the left. The constancy of his demeanour had its effect
upon the unseen enemy. The Sergeant was not further molested; and though
it was obvious that he advanced each step in about as great danger of
"death as a man who is marched manacled to the garrote, he might simply"
"have been going to his evening billet in some quiet Castilian village,"
for all the difference it made in his appearance.
"Up to this point Cardono had walked directly up the torrent bed, the"
rounded and water-worn stones rattling and slipping under his iron-shod
"half-boots, but at a certain point where was another rough cairn of"
"stones, he suddenly diverged to the right, and mounted straight up the"
fell over the scented thyme and dwarf juniper of the mountain slopes.
Whatever of uncertainty as to his fate the Sergeant felt was rigidly
"concealed, and even when a dozen men dropped suddenly upon him from"
"various rocky hiding-places, he only shook them off with a quick gesture"
"of contempt, and said something in a loud voice which brought them all"
to a halt as if turned to stone by an enchanter's spell.
"The men paused and looked at each other. They were all well armed, and"
every man had an open knife in his hand. They had been momentarily
"checked by the words of the Sergeant, but now they came on again as"
threateningly as before. Their dark long hair was encircled by red
"handkerchiefs knotted about their brows, and in general they possessed"
teeth extraordinarily white gleaming from the duskiest of skins. The
beady sloe-black eyes of the Sergeant were repeated in almost every
"face, as well as that indefinable something which in all lands marks the"
gipsy race.
The Sergeant spoke again in a language apparently more intelligible than
the deep Romany password with which he had first checked their deadly
intentions.
and a wedge of clearance showed. Almost imperceptibly she drew back and
rubbed against the timbers. A fender began to squeeze and complain. The
dock planking creaked. Sixty seconds more and she would be out of
"arm's-reach, and still George made no haste. Again Boyd shouted at him,"
and then with one farewell glower over his shoulder the big fellow
"mounted a pile, stretched his arms upward to the bulwarks, and swung"
himself lightly aboard.
"Even yet Emerson's anxiety was of the keenest; for, notwithstanding the"
"stress of these dragging moments, he had not forgotten Fraser, the"
"vagabond, the morally twisted rascal, to whose courage and"
resourcefulness he owed so much. He strained his eyes for a glimpse of
"the fellow, at the same time dreading the sight of a uniform. Would the"
ship never get under way and out of hailing distance? If those officers
"had discovered their mistake, they might yet have time to stop him. He"
"vowed desperately that he would not let them, not if he had to take"
_The Bedford Castle_ to sea with a gun at the back of her helmsman. He
"made his way hurriedly to the bridge, where he hastily explained to"
"Captain Peasley his evasion of the officers; and here he found Cherry,"
"her face flushed, her eyes sparkling with excitement, but far too wise"
to speak to him in his present state of mind.
A scattered shower of missiles came aboard as the strikers kept pace
"with the steamer to the end of the slip, exciting the fishermen, who"
"had again mounted the rigging, to a simian frenzy. Oaths, insults, and"
jeers were hurled back and forth; but as the big steamer gathered
"momentum and slid out of her berth, they grew gradually more"
"indistinct, until at last they became muffled, broken, and meaningless."
"Even then the rival ranks continued to volley profanely at each other,"
"while the Captain, with hand on the whistle-rope, blew taunting blasts;"
nor did the fishermen descend from their perches until the forms on the
"dock had blurred together and the city lay massed in the distance, tier"
"fell with terrific force upon the dome of the lantern, splintering the"
"roof and smashing the light, so that no welcome rays could be thrown"
from the tower again that night. The keepers at once set to work with
"the fog-signal, and during the hours of darkness worked like slaves,"
blaring out a warning by sound which they were unable to give visually.
"Fortunately, such an experience as befell the keepers of the American"
Thimble Shoal light is very rare. This beacon marks the shoal of that
"name, and is, or rather was, a screw-pile iron lighthouse, marking 11"
"feet of water at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, U.S.A. On"
"December 27, 1909, the keepers were immersed in their tasks, when there"
was a terrible crash followed by a dismal rending and splitting. The
building shivered from top to bottom. The keepers were thrown off their
"feet, and when they regained their wits they found that the schooner"
"_Malcolm Baxter Junior_, while being towed by a tug, had blundered into"
"them, and had carried a considerable portion of the building away. The"
"impact upset the light; the scattered oil burst into flame, and within"
a few minutes the lighthouse was blazing like a gigantic bonfire. The
"keepers stuck to their posts, and endeavoured frantically to extinguish"
"the outbreak, but their efforts were too puny to make any impression."
"At last, when a foothold was no longer possible with safety, and under"
"extreme pressure, they abandoned their charge. When the flames had"
completed their destructive work the lighthouse presented a sorry
"sight, being a mass of broken and twisted ironwork. A wooden tower was"
"erected with all despatch, and a fog-signal was installed, so that the"
men could carry on their duties while the reconstruction of the station
was hurried forward.
"The keepers turn their hands to strange occupations. Fretwork,"
"wood-carving, poker-work, and similar hobbies, are practised freely."
A few devote their leisure to intellectual improvement to fit them
"for other walks in life. The keeper of Windward Point, Guantanamo"
"her ears all the way. The sergeant and Rollo came next, with Mortimer"
"and Etienne behind, a naked blade in the hand of each, for Rollo had"
"whispered the word to draw swords. This, however, El Sarria interpreted"
"to mean his faithful Manchegan knife, to which he trusted more than to"
any sword of Toledo that ever was forged.
At any other time they could not have advanced a score of yards without
"being brought to a stand-still by the challenge of a sentry, the whistle"
"of a rifle bullet, or the simultaneous turning out of the guard. But now"
no such danger was to be apprehended. All was still as a graveyard
before cock-crow.
"It is hard, in better and wiser days, when things are beginning to be"
"traced to their causes, to give any idea of the effect of the first"
appearance of Black Cholera among a population at once so simple and so
superstitious as that of rural Spain. The inhabitants of the great
"towns, the Cristino armies in the field, the country-folk of all"
opinions were universally persuaded that the dread disease was caused by
the monks in revenge for the despites offered to them; especially by the
"hated Jesuits, who were supposed to have thrown black cats alive into"
rivers and wells in order to produce disease by means of witchcraft and
diabolical agency.
So universal was this belief that so soon as the plague broke out in any
"city or town the neighbouring monasteries were immediately plundered,"
and the priors and brethren either put to death or compelled to flee for

Some such panic as this had stampeded the troops stationed in and about
"the little town of San Ildefonso, when the first cases of cholera proved"
fatal little more than a week before. A part of these had rushed away to
"plunder the rich monastery of El Parral a few miles off, lying in the"

"said: “Now, children, don't you think we can pay England the tribute"
of going back to England's greatest poet?” In a few minutes we were
"back in the heart of the Forest, and I can still hear the delightful"
intonation of those subdued voices repeating:

Like chimney-sweepers come to dust.
It is interesting to note that the same problem that is exercising
us to-day was a source of difficulty to people in remote times. The
"following is taken from an old Chinese document, and has particular"
interest for us to-day.
“The Philosopher Mentius (born 371 B.C.) was left fatherless at a very
tender age and brought up by his mother Changsi. The care of this
prudent and attentive mother has been cited as a model for all virtuous
parents. The house she occupied was near that of a butcher: she
"observed at the first cry of the animals that were being slaughtered,"
"the little Mentius ran to be present at the sight, and that, on his"
"return, he sought to imitate what he had seen. Fearful lest his heart"
"might become hardened, and accustomed to the sights of blood, she"
removed to another house which was in the neighbourhood of a cemetery.
The relations of those who were buried there came often to weep upon
"their graves, and make their customary libations. The lad soon took"
pleasure in their ceremonies and amused himself by imitating them.
This was a new subject of uneasiness to his mother: she feared her
son might come to consider as a jest what is of all things the most
"serious, and that he might acquire a habit of performing with levity,"
"and as a matter of routine merely, ceremonies which demand the most"
exact attention and respect. Again therefore she anxiously changed the
"dwelling, and went to live in the city, opposite to a school, where her"
"on the Isthmus, though one hunter and trapper is said to have secured as"
"many as 60,000 in a year. But as the demand for the skins, and to a"
"lesser degree for the teeth, of the animals is a constant one, it is"
probable that with the aid of the tourists they will be exterminated
there as thoroughly as they have been in the settled parts of Florida.
While on the subject of slaughter and the extermination of game it may
be noted that the Canal Commission has already established very
"stringent game laws on the Zone, particularly for the protection of"
"plumed birds like the egret, and it is seriously proposed to make of"
that part of Gatun Lake within the Zone a refuge for birds in which no
shooting shall be permitted. Such action would stop mere wanton
"slaughter from the decks of passing steamers, and in the end would"
greatly enhance the beauty and interest of the trip through the lake
which would be fairly alive with birds and other animal life.

The Bayano River region beside being the center of such lumbering
activities as the Zone knows at present is the section in which are
"found the curious vegetable ivory nuts which, though growing wild, have"
become one of the principal products of Panama. Only a few years ago
they were looked upon merely as curiosities but are now a useful new
material. They are gathered by the natives and sold to dealers in
Panama who ship them north to be made into buttons and other articles
of general use. Nobody has yet experimented with the cultivation of the
"tree, and there is reason to believe that with cultivation larger nuts"
"could be obtained, and, by planting, considerable groves established."
"The trees grow well in every part of the Darien, and the demand, with"
"taught to Magna Grecia,[88] namely, that this earthly life was a trial, a"
"preparation for a higher and purer life, that the happiness of an"
after-life could be secured by means of rites and observances revealed by
"the gods themselves, all this was now preached with a firmness and"
"precision hitherto unknown. These eschatological doctrines in particular,"
helped Egypt to conquer the Latin world and especially the miserable
"masses, on whom the weight of all the iniquities of Roman society rested"
heavily.

The power and popularity of that belief in future life has left traces even
"in the French language, and in concluding this study, from which I have"
"been compelled to exclude every picturesque detail, I would like to point"
out how a French word of to-day dimly perpetuates the memory of the old
Egyptian ideas.
During the cold nights of their long winters the Scandinavians dreamed of a
Walhalla where the deceased warriors sat in well-closed brilliantly
"illuminated halls, warming themselves and drinking the strong liquor served"
"by the Valkyries; but under the burning sky of Egypt, near the arid sand"
"where thirst kills the traveler, people wished that their dead might find a"
limpid spring in their future wanderings to assuage the heat that devoured
"them, and that they might be {102} refreshed by the breezes of the north"
wind.[89] Even at Rome the adherents of the Alexandrian gods frequently
"inscribed the following wish on their tombs: ""May Osiris give you fresh"
"water.""[90] Soon this water became, in a figurative sense, the fountain of"
life pouring out immortality to thirsting souls. The metaphor obtained such
popularity that in Latin _refrigerium_ became synonymous with comfort and
"happiness. The term retained this meaning in the liturgy of the church,[91]"
and for that reason people continue to pray for spiritual
_rafraîchissement_ of the dead although the Christian paradise has very
"Now, whenever any one of these gentlemen who wish to convert me will"
show that the Colonel is wrong in this brief paragraph; whenever they
"will, in print or in public, refute the arguments to which he refers,"
"and to which they object, I shall not be slow to respond."
"2. It must be argument, not personal abuse, and it must be conducted in"
a courteous manner and tone.
"3. It must proceed upon the basis that I am as honest, as earnest, and"
as virtuous in my motives and intentions as they are in theirs.
"Now, surely these gentlemen cannot object to these simple requirements;"
and since some of them are men whose names are preceded by a title
and followed by several capital letters (ranging from D.D. to
"O.S.F.----which last I, in my ignorance, guess at as meaning Order of"
"St. Francis, but shall like to be corrected if I am wrong) they must"
believe that to answer the arguments themselves is both simple and easy.
If they do not so believe they surely have no right to occupy the
positions which they do occupy. If they do so believe it will do much
"more good to answer them publicly, since they have been made publicly,"
"and are already in the hands of several thousand people, who could not"
be reached by any amount of eloquence poured out on ray devoted head in
the privacy of my own parlor (or writing-desk).
"Therefore, gentlemen, permit me to say to you all that which I have"
already written to several of you personally--that Col. Ingersoll's
"paragraph, quoted above, expresses my own views and those of a great"
"many other people, and will continue so to do so long as your efforts to"
"show that he is wrong are only whispered to me behind a fan, or in the"
"strict seclusion of a letter marked ""private and personal."""
"once that nothing was to be expected of Eugenio, whose ancient and"
tottering limbs could hardly support the weight of his body. But there
was more hope of the two others. They proved to be stout young fellows
"from the neighbourhood, and professed the utmost eagerness for a bout"
with the gipsies. From their youth they had been accustomed to the use
of firearms--it is to be feared without due licence--in the royal
hunting preserves of Peñalara and the Guadarrama.
"But this made no difference to Rollo, who instantly set about equipping"
"them with the necessary arms, and inquiring minutely about the"
fastenings of the lower doors and windows. These it appeared were
"strong. The doors themselves were covered without with sheet-iron, while"
all the windows were protected not only by shutters but by solid
stanchions of iron sunk in the wall.
"On the whole Rollo was satisfied, and next questioned the servants"
concerning the state of the town and whether any assistance was to be
"hoped for from that quarter. In this, however, he was disappointed. It"
appeared that the whole municipality of San Ildefonso was so utterly
"plague-stricken that scarce an able-bodied man remained, or so much as a"
halfling boy capable of shouldering a musket. Only the women stood still
"in the breach, true nursing mothers, not like her of Ramah, refusing to"
"be comforted, but continuing rather to tend the sick and dying till they"
"themselves also died--aye, even shrouding the dead and laying out the"
corpses. A faithful brother or two of the Hermitage abode to carry the
last Sacraments of the Church through the deserted and grass-grown
"streets, though there were few or none now to fall on their knees at the"
"passage of _Su Majestad_, or to uncover the head at the melancholy"
tolling of the funeral bell.
With characteristic swiftness of decision Rollo made up his mind that
the best plan for the defence of the palace would be to place his scanty
"Had his father acted thus, the young Napoleon would in all probability"
have entered the military or naval service of Great Britain; he might
"have shared Paoli's enthusiasm for the land of his adoption, and have"
followed the Corsican hero in his enterprises against the French
"Revolution, thenceforth figuring in history merely as a greater"
"Marlborough, crushing the military efforts of democratic France, and"
luring England into a career of Continental conquest. Monarchy and
"aristocracy would have gone unchallenged, except within the ""natural"
"limits"" of France; and the other nations, never shaken to their"
"inmost depths, would have dragged on their old inert fragmentary"
existence.
The decision of Charles Buonaparte altered the destiny of Europe. He
"determined that his eldest boy, Joseph, should enter the Church, and"
that Napoleon should be a soldier. His perception of the characters of
"his boys was correct. An anecdote, for which the elder brother is"
"responsible, throws a flood of light on their temperaments. The master"
of their school arranged a mimic combat for his pupils--Romans against
"Carthaginians. Joseph, as the elder was ranged under the banner of"
"Rome, while Napoleon was told off among the Carthaginians; but, piqued"
"at being chosen for the losing side, the child fretted, begged, and"
stormed until the less bellicose Joseph agreed to change places with
his exacting junior. The incident is prophetic of much in the later
history of the family.
Its imperial future was opened up by the deft complaisance now shown
by Charles Buonaparte. The reward for his speedy submission to France
was soon forthcoming. The French commander in Corsica used his
influence to secure the admission of the young Napoleon to the
military school of Brienne in Champagne; and as the father was able to
"satisfy the authorities not only that he was without fortune, but also"
"that his family had been noble for four generations, Napoleon was"
and the habit of meditation without allowing the mind to dissipate
"itself. Inspired by his visits to the ancient Universities, at Taxila,"
"at Nalanda and at Conjevaram, Dr. Bose had the strongest confidence that"
India would soon see a revival of those glorious traditions. There will
soon rise a Temple of Learning where the teacher cut off from worldly
"distractions would go on with his ceaseless pursuit after truth, and"
"dying, hand on his work to his disciples. Nothing would seem laborious"
"in his inquiry; never is he to lose sight of his quest, never is he to"
let it go obscured by any terrestrial temptation. For he is the Sanyasin
"spirit, and India is the only country where so far from there being a"
conflict between science and religion. Knowledge is regarded as religion
itself. Such a misuse of science as is now unfortunately in evidence in
the West would be impossible here. Had the conquest of air been achieved
"in India, her very first impulse would be to offer worship at every"
temple for such a manifestation of the divinity in man.
ECONOMIC DANGER OF INDIA
One of the most interesting events in his tour round the world was his
"stay in Japan, where he had ample opportunity of becoming acquainted"
with the efforts of the people and their aspirations towards a great
future. No one can help being filled with admiration for what they have
"achieved. In materialistic efficiency, which in a mechanical era is"
"regarded as an index of civilisation, they have even surpassed their"
German teachers. A few decades ago they had no foreign shipping and no
manufacture. But within an incredibly short time their magnificent lines
of steamers have proved so formidable a competitor that the great
American line in the Pacific will soon be compelled to stop their
"sailings. Their industries again, through the wise help of the State and"
other adventitious aids are capturing foreign markets. But far more
admirable is their foresight to save their country from any embroilment
years. For something approaching half a century a woman maintained the
"Michigan City harbour light on the Great Lake of that name. Indeed,"
the associations were so deep-rooted and long that the beacon became
"popularly known as “Miss Colfax’s light,” after the name of its keeper."
Even when she attained the age of eighty years she was as active and
"attentive to her charge as on the day, in 1861, when she first assumed"
responsibility for its safe-keeping.
In those times there was a beacon established on the end of the wooden
"pier, which railed off an area of the restless lake for the purposes of"
"the inland port. Those were strenuous days. Her home was on shore, and"
every night and morning she tramped the long arm of woodwork to light
"and extinguish the lamp. Lard-oil was used, and during the winter the"
food for the lamp had to be heated to bring it into a fluid condition
before she set out from home. It was no easy matter struggling along on
"a blusterous, gusty evening, with a pail of hot oil in one hand and a"
"lamp in the other, over a narrow plank. Often, when a gale was raging,"
progress was so slow that by the time the beacon was reached the oil
"had cooled and congealed, rendering it a difficult matter to induce"
"the lamp to burn. Once set going, however, it was safe for the night,"
as the heat radiated from the burner kept the lard melted. In addition
"to this lamp, there was another light in the tower projecting from the"
"roof of her house, which had to be maintained, and this, being the main"
"light, was the more important of the two."
In 1886 the pier tower was taken out of her hands for ever. A furious
"gale, such as is peculiar to these inland seas, and which cannot be"
"rivalled on the ocean for fury, was raging. At dusk she started on her"
"usual journey. Time after time she was wellnigh swept off her feet, so"
"that she staggered rather than walked, for the spray and sand flecking"
"her face nearly blinded her. When she gained the tower she paused, and"
"observed that it was trembling violently. Undismayed, she ascended, lit"
"ii, 2-4; Hume's ed. i, 328 _sq._). In fine, the conventional Spain"
"is a manufactured system, developed under a Teutonic dynasty. ""To a"
German race of sovereigns Spain finally owed the subversion of her
"national system and ancient freedom"" (Stubbs, _Const. Hist._ 4th"
"ed. i, 5)."
"No doubt the Dutch disaffection to Philip, which began to reveal itself"
"immediately after his accession, may be conceived as having economic"
"grounds. Indeed, his creation of fresh bishoprics, and his manipulation"
"of the abbey revenues, created instant and general resentment among"
"churchmen and nobles,[766] as compared with his mere continuation of"
"religious persecution; and despite his pledges to the contrary, certain"
posts in the Low Countries were conferred on Spaniards.[767] But had he
"shown his father's adaptability, all this could have been adjusted. Had"
he either lived at Brussels or made the Flemings feel that he held them
"an integral part of his empire, he would have had the zealous support of"
"the upper classes in suppressing the popular heresy, which repelled"
"them. Heresy in the Netherlands, indeed, seems thus far to have been on"
"the whole rather licentious and anarchic than austere or ""spiritual."""
"The pre-Protestant movements of the Béguines, Beghards, and Lollards,"
"beginning well, had turned out worse than the orders of friars in the"
"south; and the decorous ""Brethren of the Common Lot"" were in the main"
"""good churchmen,"" only a minority accepting Protestantism.[768] In face"
of the established formulas concerning the innate spirituality of the
"Teuton, and of the play of his ""conscience"" in his course at the"
"Reformation, there stand the historic facts that in the Teutonic world"
"alone was the Reformation accompanied by widespread antinomianism,"
"debauchery, and destructive violence. In France, Spain, and Italy there"
"were no such movements as the Anabaptist, which so far as it could go"
was almost a dissolution of sane society.[769] From Holland that
"movement drew much of its strength and leadership, even as, in a"
"previous age, the antinomian movement of Tanquelin had there had its"
"1783-4. According to his schoolfellow, Bourrienne, these mimic"
"fortifications were planned by Buonaparte, who also directed the"
"methods of attack and defence: or, as others say, he reconstructed"
"the walls according to the needs of modern war. In either case, the"
incident bespeaks for him great power of organization and control. But
there were in general few outlets for his originality and vigour. He
"seems to have disliked all his comrades, except Bourrienne, as much as"
they detested him for his moody humours and fierce outbreaks of
temper. He is even reported to have vowed that he would do as much
harm as possible to the French people; but the remark smacks of the
story-book. Equally doubtful are the two letters in which he prays to
be removed from the indignities to which he was subjected at
"Brienne[7]. In other letters which are undoubtedly genuine, he refers"
"to his future career with ardour, and writes not a word as to the"
bullying to which his Corsican zeal subjected him. Particularly
noteworthy is the letter to his uncle begging him to intervene so as
"to prevent Joseph Buonaparte from taking up a military career. Joseph,"
"writes the younger brother, would make a good garrison officer, as he"
"was well formed and clever at frivolous compliments--""good therefore"
"for society, but for a fight--?"""
Napoleon's determination had been noticed by his teachers. They had
"failed to bend his will, at least on important points. In lesser"
details his Italian adroitness seems to have been of service; for the
"officer who inspected the school reported of him: ""Constitution,"
"health excellent: character submissive, sweet, honest, grateful:"
conduct very regular: has always distinguished himself by his
application to mathematics: knows history and geography passably: very
weak in accomplishments. He will be an excellent seaman: is worthy to
"enter the School at Paris."" To the military school at Paris he was"
"accordingly sent in due course, entering there in October, 1784. The"
change from the semi-monastic life at Brienne to the splendid edifice
"Mr. P. A. Barnett, in his book on the “Commonsense of Education,” says,"
alluding to Fairy Tales:
"“Children will _act_ them but not act _upon_ them, and they will"
not accept the incidents as part of their effectual belief. They
"will imagine, to be sure, grotesque worlds, full of admirable and"
interesting personages to whom strange things might have happened.
So much the better; this largeness of imagination is one of the
possessions that distinguish the better nurtured child from others less
fortunate.”
The following passage from Stevenson's essay on _Child Play_[41] will
furnish an instance of children's aptitude for creating their own
dramatic atmosphere:
"“When my cousin and I took our porridge of a morning, we had a device"
"to enliven the course of a meal. He ate his with sugar, and explained"
it to be a country continually buried under snow. I took mine with
"milk, and explained it to be a country suffering gradual inundation."
You can imagine us exchanging bulletins; how here was an island still
"unsubmerged, here a valley not yet covered with snow; what inventions"
were made; how his population lived in cabins on perches and travelled
"on stilts, and how mine was always in boats; how the interest grew"
furious as the last corner of safe ground was cut off on all sides and
"grew smaller every moment; and how, in fine, the food was of altogether"
"secondary importance, and might even have been nauseous, so long as we"
seasoned it with these dreams. But perhaps the most exciting moments I
"ever had over a meal, were in the case of calves' feet jelly. It was"
"hardly possible not to believe, and you may be quite sure, so far from"
"trying it, I did all I could to favour the illusion--that some part of"
"it was hollow, and that sooner or later my spoon would lay open the"
"secret tabernacle of that golden rock. There, might some Red-Beard"
seems to have returned his love; for in the stormy sunset of his life
at St. Helena he recalled some delicious walks at dawn when Caroline
and he had--eaten cherries together. One lingers fondly over these
"scenes of his otherwise stern career, for they reveal his capacity for"
"social joys and for deep and tender affection, had his lot been"
"otherwise cast. How different might have been his life, had France"
"never conquered Corsica, and had the Revolution never burst forth! But"
Corsica was still his dominant passion. When he was called away from
"Valence to repress a riot at Lyons, his feelings, distracted for a"
"time by Caroline, swerved back towards his island home; and in"
"September, 1786, he had the joy of revisiting the scenes of his"
"childhood. Warmly though he greeted his mother, brothers and sisters,"
"after an absence of nearly eight years, his chief delight was in the"
"rocky shores, the verdant dales and mountain heights of Corsica. The"
"odour of the forests, the setting of the sun in the sea ""as in the"
"bosom of the infinite,"" the quiet proud independence of the"
"mountaineers themselves, all enchanted him. His delight reveals almost"
"Wertherian powers of ""sensibility."" Even the family troubles could not"
"damp his ardour. His father had embarked on questionable speculations,"
"which now threatened the Buonapartes with bankruptcy, unless the"
French Government proved to be complacent and generous. With the hope
"of pressing one of the family claims on the royal exchequer, the"
second son procured an extension of furlough and sped to Paris. There
"at the close of 1787 he spent several weeks, hopefully endeavouring to"
extract money from the bankrupt Government. It was a season of
disillusionment in more senses than one; for there he saw for himself
"the seamy side of Parisian life, and drifted for a brief space about"
the giddy vortex of the Palais Royal. What a contrast to the limpid
life of Corsica was that turbid frothy existence--already swirling
towards its mighty plunge!
"After a furlough of twenty-one months he rejoined his regiment, now at"
to whatever is harsh and inharmonious. He calls it 'a certain occult
natural sense' which makes him abhor strife. He cannot abide being at
"loggerheads with anyone. He always hoped and wanted, he says, to keep"
"his pen unbloody, to attack no one, to provoke no one, even if he were"
"attacked. But his enemies had not willed it, and in later years he"
"became well accustomed to bitter polemics, with Lefèvre d'Étaples, with"
"Lee, with Egmondanus, with Hutten, with Luther, with Beda, with the"
"Spaniards, and the Italians. At first it is still noticeable how he"
"suffers by it, how contention wounds him, so that he cannot bear the"
"pain in silence. 'Do let us be friends again,' he begs Lefèvre, who does"
not reply. The time which he had to devote to his polemics he regards as
"lost. 'I feel myself getting more heavy every day,' he writes in 1520,"
'not so much on account of my age as because of the restless labour of
"my studies, nay more even by the weariness of disputes than by the work,"
"which, in itself, is agreeable.' And how much strife was still in store"
for him then!
If only Erasmus had been less concerned about public opinion! But that
"seemed impossible: he had a fear of men, or, we may call it, a fervent"
"need of justification. He would always see beforehand, and usually in"
"exaggerated colours, the effect his word or deed would have upon men. Of"
"himself, it was certainly true as he once wrote: that the craving for"
fame has less sharp spurs than the fear of ignominy. Erasmus is with
"Rousseau among those who cannot bear the consciousness of guilt, out of"
a sort of mental cleanliness. Not to be able to repay a benefit with
"interest, makes him ashamed and sad. He cannot abide 'dunning creditors,"
"unperformed duty, neglect of the need of a friend'. If he cannot"
"discharge the obligation, he explains it away. The Dutch historian Fruin"
has quite correctly observed: 'Whatever Erasmus did contrary to his duty
and his rightly understood interests was the fault of circumstances or
wrong advice; he is never to blame himself'. And what he has thus
justified for himself becomes with him universal law: 'God relieves
"It was a customary little ceremony, but in Risca's eyes it never lost"
"its grace and charm. To-night it seemed to have a deeper significance,"
"bringing Stella with her elfin charm into the midst of them, and thus"
exorcising the spirits of evil that held him in their torturing grip.
"He spoke but little at the meal, content to listen to the talk about"
"Stella, and curiously impatient when the conversation drifted into other"
"channels. Of his own tragedy no one spoke. On his arrival, Lady Blount,"
"with unwonted demonstration of affection, had thrown her arms round his"
"neck, and Sir Oliver had wrung his hand and mumbled the stiff Briton's"
incoherences of sympathy. He had not yet told them of his decision to go
to Australia.
"He broke the news later, in the drawing-room, abruptly and apropos of"
"nothing, as was his manner, firing his bombshell with the defiant air of"
"one who says, “There, what do you think of it?”"
"“I'm going to Australia next week, never to come back again,” said he."
There was a discussion. Sir Oliver commended him. The great dependencies
"of the empire were the finest field in the world for a young man,"
provided he kept himself outside the radius of the venomous blight of
the Colonial Office. To that atrophied branch of the imperial service
"the white administrator was merely a pigeon-holed automaton; the native,"
"black or bronze or yellow, a lion-hearted human creature. All the"
"murder, riot, rapine, arson, and other heterogeneous devilry that"
the latter cared to indulge in proceeded naturally from the noble
indignation of his generous nature. If the sensible man who was
appointed by the Government to rule over this scum of the planet called
out the military and wiped out a few dozen of them for the greater glory
"and safety of the empire, the pusillanimous ineptitudes in second-rate"
"purple and cheap linen of the Colonial Office, for the sake of currying"
favour with Labour members and Socialists and Radicals and Methodists
An habitual resident in London who is gifted with a keen faculty of
"hearing and observation, will soon learn to know instinctively the"
"various characteristics of the people who call upon him, by the"
particular manner in which each one handles his door-bell or knocker.
"He will recognize the timid from the bold, the modest from the"
"arrogant, the meditative thinker from the bustling man of fashion, the"
familiar friend from the formal acquaintance. Every individual's method
of announcing his or her arrival to the household is distinctly
"different,--and Villiers, who studied a little of everything, had not"
failed to take note of the curiously diversified degrees of single and
double rapping by means of which his visitors sought admittance to his
"abode. In fact, he rather prided himself on being able to guess with"
almost invariable correctness what special type of man or woman was at
"his door, provided he could hear the whole diapason of their knock from"
"beginning to end. When he was shut in his ""den,"" however, the sounds"
"were muffled by distance, and he could form no just"
"judgment,--sometimes, indeed, he did not hear them at all, especially"
if he happened to be playing his 'cello at the time. So that this
"morning he was considerably startled, when, having finished his letter"
"to the Duchess de la Santoisie, a long and persistent rat-tat-tatting"
"echoed noisily through the house, like the smart, quick blows of a"
carpenter's hammer--a species of knock that was entirely unfamiliar to
"him, and that, while so emphatic in character, suggested to his mind"
"neither friend nor foe. He laid down his pen, listened and waited. In a"
minute or two his servant entered the room.
"""If you please, sir, a lady to see Mr. Alwyn. Shall I show her up?"""
"Villiers rose slowly out of his chair, and stood eyeing his man in"
blank bewilderment.
the religion of Egypt came into contact with Greece. Isis was identified
"simultaneously with Demeter, Aphrodite, Hera, Semele, Io, Tyche, and"
"others. She was considered the queen of heaven and hell, of earth and sea."
"She was ""the past, the present and the future,""[42] ""nature the mother of"
"things, the mistress of the elements, born at the beginning of the"
"centuries.""[43] She had numberless names, an infinity of different aspects"
"and an inexhaustible treasure of virtues. In short, she became a"
"pantheistic power that was everything in one, _una quae est omnia_.[44]"
"The authority of Serapis was no less exalted, and his field no less"
extensive. He also was regarded as a universal god of whom men liked to say
"that he was ""unique."" ([Greek: Heis Zeus Sarapis]) In him all energies were"
"centered, although the functions of Zeus, of Pluto or of Helios were"
especially ascribed to him. For many centuries Osiris had been worshiped at
"Abydos both as author of fecundity and lord of the underworld,[45] and this"
"double character early caused him to be identified with the sun, which"
fertilizes the earth during its diurnal course and travels through the
"subterranean realms at night. Thus the conception of this nature divinity,"
"that had already prevailed along the Nile, accorded without difficulty with"
the solar pantheism that was the last form of Roman paganism. This
"theological system, which did not gain the upper hand in the Occident until"
"the {90} second century of our era, was not brought in by Egypt. It did not"
"have the exclusive predominance there that it had held under the empire,"
and even in Plutarch's time it was only one creed among many.[46] The
deciding influence in this matter was exercised by the Syrian Baals and the
Chaldean astrology.
"The theology of the Egyptian mysteries, then, followed rather than led the"
general influx of ideas. The same may be said of their ethics. It did not
"force itself upon the world by lofty moral precepts, nor by a sublime ideal"
"of holiness. Many have admired the edifying list in the Book of the Dead,"
that rightfully or otherwise sets forth the virtues which the deceased
but more or less successfully suppressed action.']

"by Freud, (_Die Traumdeutung_, p. 227), why we do not always dream of"
"inhibited movement. Freud considers that the idea of inhibited movement,"
"when it occurs in dreams, has no relation to the actual condition of the"
"dreamer's nervous system, but is simply an ideatory symbol of an erotic"
wish that is no longer capable of fulfilment. But it is certain that
sleep is not always at the same depth and that the various nervous groups
are not always equally asleep. A dream arising on the basis of partial
and imperfect sleep can scarcely fail to lead to the attempt at actual
"movement and the more or less complete inhibition of that movement,"
"presenting a struggle which is often visible to the onlooker, and is not"
purely ideatory.]
"[Footnote 81: This explanation, based on the depth and kind of the sleep,"
is entirely distinct from the theory of Aliotta (_Il Pensiero e la
"Personalità nei Sogni_, 1905), who believes that dreamers differ according"
"to their nervous type, the person of visual type assisting passively at"
"the spectacle of his dreams, while the person of motor type takes actual"
"part in them. I have no evidence of this, though I believe that dreams"
differ in accordance with the dreamer's personal type.]
[Footnote 82: Dugald Stewart argued that there is loss of control over
"the muscular system during sleep, and the body, therefore, is not subject"
to our command; volition is present but it cannot influence the limbs.
"Hammond argued, on the contrary, that Stewart was quite wrong; the reason"
"why voluntary movements are not performed during sleep is, he said, that"
volition is suspended. 'We do not will our actions when we are asleep. We
"imagine that we do, and that is all' (_Treatise on Insanity_, p. 205)."
"Dugald Stewart and Hammond, though their phraseology may have been too"
"metaphysical, were, from the standpoint I have adopted, both maintaining"
The dull green time-stained panes of the windows look upon each other
with the cowardly glances of cheats. Through the street and towards the
"adjacent mountain, runs the sinuous path, winding through the deep"
ditches filled with rain-water.  Here and there are piled heaps of dust
and other rubbish--either refuse or else put there purposely to keep
"the rain-water from flooding the houses. On the top of the mountain,"
"among green gardens with dense foliage, beautiful stone houses lie"
"hidden; the belfries of the churches rise proudly towards the sky, and"
their gilded crosses shine beneath the rays of the sun. During the
rainy weather the neighbouring town pours its water into this main
"road, which, at other times, is full of its dust, and all these"
"miserable houses seem, as it were, thrown by some powerful hand into"
"that heap of dust, rubbish, and rain-water.  They cling to the ground"
"beneath the high mountain, exposed to the sun, surrounded by decaying"
"refuse, and their sodden appearance impresses one with the same feeling"
as would the half-rotten trunk of an old tree.
"At the end of the main street, as if thrown out of the town, stood a"
"two-storied house, which had been rented from Petunikoff, a merchant"
"and resident of the town.  It was in comparatively good order, being"
"further from the mountain, while near it were the open fields, and"
about half-a-mile away the river ran its winding course.
This large old house had the most dismal aspect amidst its
surroundings.  The walls bent outwards and there was hardly a pane of
"glass in any of the windows, except some of the fragments which looked"
like the water of the marshes--dull green.  The spaces of wall between
"the windows were covered with spots, as if time were trying to write"
"there in hieroglyphics the history of the old house, and the tottering"
roof added still more to its pitiable condition. It seemed as if the
"whole building bent towards the ground, to await the last stroke of"
"rushed past him--man or animal he could not tell which, for its feet"
"made no more sound upon the floor than those of a wolf-dog. Then, as he"
"bolted forward, he heard a man cry out, and found himself in the midst"
"of turmoil. His hands encountered a human body, and he seized it, only"
to be hurled aside as if with a giant's strength. Again he clinched
"with a man's form, and bore it to the floor, cursing at the darkness"
and reaching for its throat. His antagonist raised his voice in wild
"clamor, while Boyd braced himself for another assault from those huge"
"hands he had met a moment before. But it did not come. Instead, he"
"heard a cry from the woman, an answer in a deeper voice, and then"
"swift, pattering footsteps growing fainter. Meanwhile the man with whom"
"he was locked was fighting desperately, with hands and feet and teeth,"
"shouting hoarsely. Other footsteps sounded now, this time approaching,"
then at the door a lantern flared. A watchman came running down between
"the lines of machinery, followed by other figures half revealed."
Boyd had pinned his antagonist against the cold sides of a retort at
"last, and with fingers clutched about his throat was beating his head"
"violently against the iron, when by the lantern's gleam he caught one"
"glimpse of the fat, purple face in front of him, and loosed his hold"
with a startled exclamation. Released from the grip that had nearly
"made an end of him, Willis Marsh staggered to his feet, then lurched"
"forward as if about to fall from weakness. His eyes were staring, his"
"blackened tongue protruded, while his head, battered and bleeding,"
lolled grotesquely from side to side as if in hideous merriment. His
"clothes were torn and soiled from the litter underfoot, and he"
presented a frightful picture of distress. But it was not this that
"caused Emerson the greatest astonishment. The man was wounded, badly"
"wounded, as he saw by the red stream which gushed down over his breast."
"Boyd cast his eyes about for the other participants in the encounter,"
but they were nowhere visible; only an open door in the shadows close
by hinted at the mode of their disappearance.
"in her nearness. At the same time he was seized with the old,"
half-resentful curiosity to learn her history. What wealth of romance
"lay shadowed in her eyes, what tragic story was concealed by her"
"consistent silence, he could only guess; for she was a woman who spoke"
rarely of herself and lived wholly in the present. Her very reticence
"inspired confidence, and Boyd felt sure that here was a girl to whom"
one might confess the inmost secrets of a wretched soul and rest secure
in the knowledge that his confession would be inviolate as if locked in
"the heart of mountains. He knew her for a steadfast friend, and he"
"t'elt that she was beautiful, not only in face and form, but in all"
those little indescribable mannerisms which stamp the individual. And
"this girl was here alone with him, so close that by stretching out his"
arms he might enfold her. She allowed him to come and go at will; her
intimacy with him was almost like that of an unspoiled boy--yet
"different, so different that he thrilled at the thought, and the blood"
pounded up into his throat.
It may have been the unusual ardor of his gaze that warmed her cheeks
"and brought her eyes back from the world outside. At any rate, she"
"turned, flashing him a startled glance that caused his pulse to leap"
"anew. Her eyes widened and a flush spread slowly upward to her hair,"
"then her lids drooped, as if weighted by unwonted shyness, and rising"
"silently, she went past him to the piano. Never before had she"
"surprised that look in his eyes, and at the realization a wave of"
confusion surged over her. She strove to calm herself through her
"music, which shielded while it gave expression to her mood, and neither"
spoke as the evening shadows crept in upon them. But the girl's
exaltation was short-lived; the thought came that Boyd's feeling was
but transitory; he was not the sort to burn lasting incense before more
"than one shrine. Nevertheless, at this moment he was hers, and in the"
joy of that certainty she let the moments slip.
home during the whole of my stay in Cleveland. In writing to invite
"me, she mentioned the pleasure it would afford her little ten-year-old"
"daughter to make my acquaintance, and added this somewhat enigmatic"
sentence: “Mignon has asked permission to dedicate her _last_ work to
"you.” I was alarmed at the word _last_, given the age of the author,"
"and felt sorry that the literary faculty had developed quite so early,"
lest the unfettered and irresponsible years of childhood should have
"been sacrificed. I was still more troubled when, upon my arrival,"
I learned that the title of the book which was to be dedicated to
"me was “The Two Army Girls,” and contained the elaborate history of"
"a double courtship. But, as the story was read to me, I was soon"
disarmed. A more innocent recital I never heard--and it was all the
quainter because of certain little grown-up sentences gathered from the
"conversation of elders in unguarded moments, which evidently conveyed"
but slight meaning to the youthful authoress. The final scene between
two of the lovers is so characteristic that I cannot refrain from
"quoting the actual words. Said John: “I love you, and I wish you to be"
"my wife.” “That I will,” said Mary, without any hesitation. “That's all"
"right,” said John. “And now let us _get back to the Golf Links_.”"
"Oh, that modern writers of fiction would “get back to the Golf Links”"
"sooner than they do, realising with this little unconscious philosopher"
that there are some reactions from love-making which show a healthy and
balanced constitution.
Experience with children ought to teach us to avoid stories which
contain too much _allusion_ to matters of which the hearers are
"entirely ignorant; but, judging from the written stories of to-day,"
"supposed to be for children, it is still a matter of difficulty to"
"realise that this form of allusion to “foreign” matters, or making a"
joke the appreciation of which depends solely on a special and “inside”
"knowledge, is always bewildering and fatal to sustained dramatic"
"origin. If they were not native, at least they were soon naturalised,"
and that for the simple reason that they satisfied the religious
"cravings of the Greek race. The essential spirit of their worship,"
"whatever the accidents of form and expression, was the spirit of the"
"old Pelasgian worship of Demeter; and therefore, though Dionysus may"
"have been an immigrant from northern barbarous peoples, the Greeks did"
not hesitate to give him room and honour beside Demeter in the very
"sanctuary of Eleusis. Similar, we may well believe, was the lot of"
"other foreign gods and rites. Whencesoever derived, they owed their"
reception in Greece to the fact that their character appealed to
certain native religious instincts of the Greek folk. Once transplanted
"to Hellenic soil, they were soon completely Hellenized; those elements"
which were foreign or distasteful to Greek religion were quickly
"eradicated or of themselves faded into oblivion, while all that"
accorded with the Hellenic spirit throve into fuller perfection; for
the character of a deity and of a cult depends ultimately upon the
character of the worshippers.
It is fair therefore to treat of Aphrodite as of a genuinely Greek
"deity; for, though she may have entered Greece from Eastern lands,"
doubtless long before the Homeric age her worship no less than her
personality was permeated with the spirit of genuinely Greek religion.
Too well known to need re-telling here is the story of how--to use the
words of Theocritus once more--‘the beautiful Cytherea was brought by
"Adonis, as he pastured his flock upon the mountain-side, so far beyond"
"the verge of frenzy, that not even in his death doth she put him from"
her bosom[1456].’ Such was the plot of one of the most famous religious
dramas of old time. And what was its moral for those who had ears to
hear? Surely that the beloved of the gods may hope for wedlock with
them in death.
It was certainly in this sense that Clement of Alexandria understood
a naked woman entered the room. Her loveliness was extreme; her form was
"perfectly rounded, but without suggestion of voluptuousness, though she"
"was not an animated statue, but had all the characters of humanity; she"
"walked with undulating thighs, head slightly drooping, and hair falling"
down and framing a face that expressed wonderful spiritual beauty and
"innocence. The lecturer led her round, saying, ""This is beauty; now, if"
"you can look at this and be ashamed----"" and he waved his arm. She went"
"away, and a beautiful Apollo-like youth, slender but athletic, entered the"
"room, also completely naked. He walked round the room alone, with an air"
"of majestic virility. I applauded, clapping my hands, but a shiver went"
"through the ladies present; their skin became like goose-flesh, and their"
lips quivered with horror as though they were about to be outraged. The
"youth went out, and the lecturer continued. At the climax of his oratory,"
"the Apollo-like youth entered, dressed as a common soldier, with no"
"appearance of beauty, and in a rough tone said: ""'Ere! I want a shilling"
"for this job."" (And I sighed to myself: ""It is always so."") No one had a"
"shilling, and the lecturer proceeded to explain to the man that what he"
"had done was for the sake of art and beauty, and for the moral good of"
"the world. ""What do I care for that?"" he returned, ""I want a drink."" Then"
"a lady among the audience produced a collar, wrote on it a testimonial"
expressing the gratitude of those present for the man's services on this
"occasion, and handed it to me to present to him. ""Damn it,"" he said, ""this"
"is only worth twopence halfpenny; I want my shilling!"" Then I awoke.'"
The idea of murder with which this dream began seems to suggest that it
may have had its origin in some slight visceral disturbance of which
"the subject was unconscious, but nothing had occurred to suggest the"
details of the episode. The interesting feature about it is the presence
throughout of moral notions and sentiments substantially true to the
dreamer's waking ideas.
In another dream of the same dreamer's the sense of responsibility is
"clearly present: 'Mrs. F. and Miss R. had called to see me, and I was"
"when men were crying for their rights, when they had awakened to a"
"sense of their possessions, and would take nothing in their place. The"
real chieftains were no more; they were imitation chieftains only who
"were playing at the game, and it was a game the clansmen would not join"
in. Few exercises could be more strange than first to read the account
of Scottish life in one of the immortal novels by Scott dealing with
"last century, and then to turn to Miss Ferrier or Galt, depicting a"
"period not so very different. Setting aside all questions of genius,"
"where comparison would be absurd, it would seem as if a beautiful"
"enamel had been removed, and a bare reality revealed, somewhat sordid"
"in comparison. The life was not really sordid,--realism as usual had"
"overshot its mark,--but the enamel had been somewhat thickly laid, and"
"might require to be removed, if truth were to be revealed."
So in the higher grades of Edinburgh society the enamel of gentility
has done its best to prejudice us against much true and genuine worth.
"It was characterised by a certain conventional unconventionality, a"
certain 'preciosity' which brought it near deserving a still stronger
"name, and it maintained its right to formulate the canons of criticism"
"for the kingdom. Edinburgh, it must be recollected, was no 'mean city,'"
no ordinary provincial town. It was still esteemed a metropolis. It had
"its aristocracy, though mainly of the order of those unable to bear the"
"greater expense of London life. It had no manufactories to speak of, no"
"mercantile class to 'vulgarise' it; it possessed a University, and the"
law courts of the nation. But above all it had a literary society. In
"the beginning of the century it had such men as Henry Mackenzie, Dugald"
"Stewart, John Playfair, Dr. Gregory, Dr. Thomas Brown, not to speak of"
Scott and Jeffrey--a society unrivalled out of London. And in later
"days, when these were gone, others rose to fill their places."
"Of course, in addition to the movement of the working people, there was"
"an educated protest against Toryism, and it was made by a party who, to"
"spread infection, he thinks. Erasmus had, earlier than most people,"
antiseptic ideas about the danger of infection in the foul air of
"crowded inns, in the breath of confessants, in baptismal water. Throw"
"aside common cups, he pleaded; let everybody shave himself, let us be"
"cleanly as to bed-sheets, let us not kiss each other by way of greeting."
"The fear of the horrible venereal disease, imported into Europe during"
"his lifetime, and of which Erasmus watched the unbridled propagation"
"with solicitude, increases his desire for purity. Too little is being"
"done to stop it, he thinks. He cautions against suspected inns; he wants"
to have measures taken against the marriages of syphilitic persons. In
his undignified attitude towards Hutten his physical and moral aversion
to the man's evil plays an unmistakable part.
Erasmus is a delicate soul in all his fibres. His body forces him to be
"that. He is highly sensitive, among other things very susceptible to"
"cold, 'the scholars' disorder', as he calls it. Early in life already"
"the painful malady of the stone begins to torment him, which he resisted"
so bravely when his work was at stake. He always speaks in a coddling
"tone about his little body, which cannot stand fasting, which must be"
"kept fit by some exercise, namely riding, and for which he carefully"
tries to select a suitable climate. He is at times circumstantial in the
description of his ailments.[15] He has to be very careful in the matter
"of his sleep; if once he wakes up, he finds it difficult to go to sleep"
"again, and because of that has often to lose the morning, the best time"
"to work and which is so dear to him. He cannot stand cold, wind and fog,"
"but still less overheated rooms. How he has execrated the German stoves,"
which are burned nearly all the year through and made Germany almost
unbearable to him! Of his fear of illness we have spoken above. It is
not only the plague which he flees--for fear of catching cold he gives
"up a journey from Louvain to Antwerp, where his friend Peter Gilles is"
in mourning. Although he realizes quite well that 'often a great deal of
"the disease is in the imagination', yet his own imagination leaves him"
"as ""totally distinct from the Icelandic,"" Celtic influence is also"
specified as affecting Norse literature in general. The first
"generations of Icelandic poets were men of good birth, ""nearly"
"always, too, of Celtic blood on one side at least""; and they went"
"to Norway or Denmark, where they lived as kings' or chiefs'"
"henchmen. The immigration of Norse settlers from Ireland, too,"
"affected the Iceland stock very early. ""It is to the west that the"
best sagas belong: it is to the west that nearly every classic
writer whose name we know belongs; and it is precisely in the west
"that the admixture of Irish blood is greatest"" (_ib._). The facts"
"seem decisive, and the statements above cited appear the more"
clearly to need modification. It is to be noted that Schweitzer's
_Geschichte der skandinavischen Literatur_ gives no hint of the
Celtic influence.
But the Icelandic civilisation as a whole could not indefinitely
progress on its own basis any more than the Irish. Beyond a certain
point both needed new light and leading; for the primeval spirit of
"strife never spontaneously weakened; the original Icelandic stock being,"
"to begin with, a selection of revolters from over-rule. So continual"
domestic feuds checked mental evolution in Iceland as in old
Scandinavia; and the reduction of the island to Norwegian rule in the
thirteenth century could not do more for it than monarchy was doing for
Norway. Mere Christianity without progressive conditions of culture
availed less for imaginative art than free paganism had done; and when
"higher culture-contacts became possible, the extreme poverty of Iceland"
tended more than ever to send the enterprising people where the culture
and comfort were. It is in fact not a possible seat for a relatively
flourishing civilisation in the period of peaceful development. The
Reformation seems there to have availed for very little indeed. It was
"vehemently resisted,[690] but carried by the preponderant acquisitive"
"forces: ""nearly all who took part in it were men of low type, moved by"
act up to it! It seems to them the necessary corollary of strength that
the strong man should be sympathetic and kind. It seems to them an
"unconscious confession of weakness to be scornful, revengeful,"
"inconsiderate. Courtesy, they say, is the mark of a great man,"
discourtesy of a little one. No one who feels his position secure will
"lose his temper, will persecute, will be disdainful. Their word for a"
fool and for a hasty-tempered man is the same. To them it is the same
"thing, one infers the other. And so their attitude towards animals is"
but an example of their attitude to each other. That an animal or a man
should be lower and weaker than you is the strongest claim he can have
"on your humanity, and your courtesy and consideration for him is the"
clearest proof of your own superiority. And so in his dealings with
"animals the Buddhist considers himself, consults his own dignity, his"
"own strength, and is kind and compassionate to them out of the greatness"
of his own heart. Nothing is more beautiful than the Burman in his ways
"with his children, and his beasts, with all who are lesser than himself."
"Even to us, who think so very differently from him on many points, there"
"is a great and abiding charm in all this, to which we can find only one"
"exception; for to our ideas there is one exception, and it is this: No"
"Burman will take any life if he can help it, and therefore, if any"
"animal injure itself, he will not kill it--not even to put it out of its"
"pain, as we say. I have seen bullocks split on slippery roads, I have"
"seen ponies with broken legs, I have seen goats with terrible wounds"
"caused by accidental falls, and no one would kill them. If, when you are"
"out shooting, your beaters pick up a wounded hare or partridge, do not"
"suppose that they wring its neck; you must yourself do that, or it will"
linger on till you get home. Under no circumstances will they take the
"life even of a wounded beast. And if you ask them, they will say: 'If a"
"man be sick, do you shoot him? If he injure his spine so that he will be"
"a cripple for life, do you put him out of his pain?'"
jewels worn by an Isis of ancient Cadiz;[68] her ornaments were more
brilliant than those of a Spanish madonna.
"During the entire forenoon, from the moment that a noisy acclamation had"
"greeted the rising of the sun, the images of the gods were exposed to the"
silent adoration of the initiates.[69] Egypt is the country whence
"contemplative devotion penetrated into Europe. Then, in the afternoon, a"
second service was held to close the sanctuary.[70]
The daily liturgy must have been very absorbing. This innovation in the
Roman paganism was full of consequences. No longer were sacrifices offered
"to the god on certain occasions only, but twice a day elaborate services"
"were held. As with the Egyptians, whom Herodotus had termed the most"
"religious of all peoples,[71] devotion assumed a tendency to fill out the"
whole existence and to dominate private and public interests. The constant
"repetition of the same prayers {97} kept up and renewed faith, and, we"
"might say, people lived continually under the eyes of the gods."
Besides the daily rites of the Abydos liturgy the holidays marking the
beginning of the different seasons were celebrated at the same date every
year.[72] It was the same in Italy. The calendars have preserved the names
"of several of them, and of one, the _Navigium Isidis_, the rhetorician"
"Apuleius[73] has left us a brilliant description on which, to speak with"
"the ancients, he emptied all his color tubes. On March 5th, when navigation"
"reopened after the winter months, a gorgeous procession[74] marched to the"
"coast, and a ship consecrated to Isis, the protectress of sailors, was"
"launched. A burlesque group of masked persons opened the procession, then"
"came the women in white gowns strewing flowers, the _stolistes_ waving the"
garments of the goddess and the _dadophori_ with lighted torches. After
"these came the _hymnodes_, whose songs mingled in turn with the sharp sound"
of the cross-flutes and the ringing of the brass timbrels; then the throngs
"of the initiates, and finally the priests, with shaven heads and clad in"
"to expand itself into a broad, loving, sympathetic comprehension of the"
"wants and afflictions of human-kind; and he was writing a new poem, of"
which Villiers had seen some lines that had fairly amazed him by their
grandeur of conception and clear passion of utterance. Thus it was
"evident there was no morbidness in him,--no obscurity,--nothing"
"eccentric,--nothing that removed him in any way from his fellows,"
"except that royal personality of his,--that strong, beautiful,"
"well-balanced Spirit in him, which exercised such a bewildering spell"
"on all who came within its influence, He believed himself loved by an"
"Angel! Well,--if there WERE angels, why not? Villiers argued the"
proposition thus:
"""Whether we are Christians, Jews, Buddhists, or Mahometans, we are"
supposed to accept angels as forming part of the system of our Faith.
"If we are nothing,--then, of course, we believe in nothing. But granted"
"we are SOMETHING, then we are bound in honor, if consistent, to"
"acknowledge that angels help to guide our destinies. And if, as we are"
"assured by Holy Writ, such loftier beings DO exist, why should they not"
"communicate with, and even love, human creatures, provided those human"
"creatures are worthy of their tenderness? Certainly, viewed by all the"
"chief religions of the world, there is nothing new or outrageous in the"
"idea of an angel descending to the help of man."""
"Such thoughts as these were in his mind now, as he ever and anon"
"glanced across the glittering table, with its profusion of lights and"
"flowers, to where his poet-friend sat, slightly leaning back in his"
"chair, with a certain half-perplexed, half-disappointed expression on"
"his handsome features, though his eyes brightened into a smile as he"
"caught Villiers's look, and he gave the smallest, scarcely perceptible"
"shrug, as who should say, ""Is this your brilliant Duchess?--your witty"
"and cultured society?"""
"marriage-journey, Eros is not merely the guide of the steeds, but aids"
"the bridegroom in carrying off Kore, so that in this case the struggle"
with death takes purely the form of a struggle with love. At the same
"time the mother is driving along with her chariot, thereby signifying"
"the renewal of life, which is yet more clearly betokened in the"
ploughman and the sower at her side.
‘In a yet gentler spirit we see the same journey conceived in a
vase-painting from lower Italy. Here there is a look of gentleness
"on Hades’ face; the bride accompanies him gladly, and even takes an"
"affectionate farewell of her mother, who appears to acquiesce in her"
"departure. In this case too Eros is flying above the horses, and is"
"turned towards the lovers, while in front of him there flies a dove,"
the bird sacred to the goddess of love. Hecate with torches guides the
steeds; near at hand waits Hermes to escort the procession; and above
"the whole scene the stars are shining, as if to indicate the new life"
in the region of death.
"‘In another form, exalted to a yet higher holiness, the same marriage"
is repeated in the sphere of Dionysus-worship. Thus on a cameo in the
"Vatican, Dionysus is represented driving with his bride, Ariadne, in"
a brightly-decked triumphal car. Holy rapture is manifested on the
"features of both, and on top of the chariot stands a Cupid directing"
"it. Dionysus is arrayed in the doe-skin, and holds in his left hand"
"a _thyrsus_, in his right a goblet; Ariadne is carrying ears of corn"
"and poppy-heads, and has her hair wreathed with vine-leaves. The car"
"is drawn by Centaurs of both sexes, with torches, drinking-horns,"
and musical instruments. The idea which underlies this scene is the
reproduction of Life out of Death; Hades has issued forth again for
"a new marriage-bond with Kore in the realm of light, appearing now"
"rejuvenated in the form of Dionysus, just as his bride assumes the form"
"of Ariadne, and because the power of death is broken behind him, his"
"saw it as a struggle between old and new, which, to him, meant evil and"
"good. In the advocates of tradition he saw only obscurantism,"
"conservatism, and ignorant opposition to _bonae literae_, that is, the"
good cause for which he and his partisans battled. Of the rise of that
higher culture Erasmus had already formed the conception which has since
"dominated the history of the Renaissance. It was a revival, begun two or"
"three hundred years before his time, in which, besides literature, all"
the plastic arts shared. Side by side with the terms restitution and
reflorescence the word renascence crops up repeatedly in his writings.
'The world is coming to its senses as if awaking out of a deep sleep.
"Still there are some left who recalcitrate pertinaciously, clinging"
convulsively with hands and feet to their old ignorance. They fear that
"if _bonae literae_ are reborn and the world grows wise, it will come to"
light that they have known nothing.' They do not know how pious the
"Ancients could be, what sanctity characterizes Socrates, Virgil, and"
"Horace, or Plutarch's _Moralia_, how rich the history of Antiquity is in"
examples of forgiveness and true virtue. We should call nothing profane
that is pious and conduces to good morals. No more dignified view of
life was ever found than that which Cicero propounds in _De Senectute_.
In order to understand Erasmus's mind and the charm which it had for his
"contemporaries, one must begin with the ideal of life that was present"
before his inward eye as a splendid dream. It is not his own in
"particular. The whole Renaissance cherished that wish of reposeful,"
"blithe, and yet serious intercourse of good and wise friends in the cool"
"shade of a house under trees, where serenity and harmony would dwell."
"The age yearned for the realization of simplicity, sincerity, truth and"
nature. Their imagination was always steeped in the essence of
"Antiquity, though, at heart, it is more nearly connected with medieval"
ideals than they themselves were aware. In the circle of the Medici it
"is the idyll of Careggi, in Rabelais it embodies itself in the fancy of"
the abbey of Thélème; it finds voice in More's _Utopia_ and in the work
reason; they have reached the heights of spiritual exaltation; they
have seen and felt as minds more calm and rational can never see nor
feel.
"And the ancient Greeks, had not they too the gift of ecstasy, the"
faculty to soar above facts on the wings of imagination? When the drama
of Demeter and Kore was played before the eyes of the initiated at
"Eleusis, were not they too uplifted in mind until amid the magic of"
night they were no longer spectators of a drama but themselves had a
share in Demeter’s sorrow and wandering and joy? For the pagan story
is not unlike the Christian story in its power to move both tears and
"gladness. As now men mourn beside the bier of Christ, so in old time"
may men have shared Demeter’s mourning for her child who though divine
had suffered the lot of men and passed away to the House of Hades. As
"now men rejoice when they behold the risen Christ, so in old time may"
men have shared Demeter’s joy when her child returned from beneath the
"earth, proving that there is life beyond the grave. But the old story"
"taught more than this. Not only did Kore live in the lower world, but"
her passing thither was not death but wedding. Therefore just as now
"the resurrection of Christ, who though divine is the representative of"
"mankind, is held to be an earnest of man’s resurrection, so the wedded"
life of Kore in the nether world may have been to the initiated an
assurance of the same bliss to be vouchsafed to them hereafter.
What was there then in this drama of Demeter and Kore at which the
Christian writers could take offence or cavil? We do not of course
know in what detail the story was represented; but the pivot on which
the whole plot turned was necessarily the rape of Kore. Now it appears
that in the play the part of Aïdoneus was taken by an hierophant and
the part of Kore by a priestess; and it was the alleged indecency
resulting therefrom which the fathers of the Church most severely
"censured. Asterius, after defending the Christians from the charge of"
together we shall be able to shake the odious yoke from off the neck
"of Corsica."""
But there was another work which exercised a great influence on his
"young mind--the ""Gallic War"" of Cæsar. To the young Italian the"
conquest of Gaul by a man of his own race must have been a congenial
"topic, and in Cæsar himself the future conqueror may dimly have"
recognized a kindred spirit. The masterful energy and all-conquering
"will of the old Roman, his keen insight into the heart of a problem,"
"the wide sweep of his mental vision, ranging over the intrigues of the"
"Roman Senate, the shifting politics of a score of tribes, and the"
myriad administrative details of a great army and a mighty
province--these were the qualities that furnished the chief mental
"training to the young cadet. Indeed, the career of Cæsar was destined"
"to exert a singular fascination over the Napoleonic dynasty, not only"
"on its founder, but also on Napoleon III.; and the change in the"
character and career of Napoleon the Great may be registered mentally
in the effacement of the portraits of Leonidas and Paoli by those of
"Cæsar and Alexander. Later on, during his sojourn at Ajaccio in 1790,"
when the first shadows were flitting across his hitherto unclouded
"love for Paoli, we hear that he spent whole nights poring over Cæsar's"
"history, committing many passages to memory in his passionate"
admiration of those wondrous exploits. Eagerly he took Cæsar's side as
"against Pompey, and no less warmly defended him from the charge of"
plotting against the liberties of the commonwealth[6]. It was a
perilous study for a republican youth in whom the military instincts
were as ingrained as the genius for rule.
Concerning the young Buonaparte's life at Brienne there exist few
"authentic records and many questionable anecdotes. Of these last, that"
which is the most credible and suggestive relates his proposal to his
schoolfellows to construct ramparts of snow during the sharp winter of
living[1514]. The allusion to human weddings is clear. It was no doubt
"imperative in old time, as it still is, in Greece, that anyone who"
"attended upon a bride or bridegroom, as for instance the bearer of"
"water for the bridal bath, should have both parents living; and the"
"use of the same term in reference to Eros, the attendant upon Zeus"
"and Hera, marks the intimate connexion between the divine marriage"
and the marriage of living men and women. But another epithet in the
"passage conveys no less clear an allusion to the marriage of those,"
"whom men call dead, with their deities. Hera is named εὐδαίμων, a word"
"which, meaning ‘favoured by God,’ may seem strangely applied to one"
who herself was divine[1515]. But it was selected by Aristophanes for
a good reason; by the word εὐδαιμονία was commonly denoted that future
bliss which the initiated believed to consist in wedlock with their
"deities. Like θεοφιλής, ‘god-beloved,’ the term εὐδαίμων, ‘blessed,’"
"was, so to speak, a catch-word of the mysteries[1516]; and the"
application of it to Hera in Aristophanes’ ode brings the legend of
Hera’s marriage into rank with those other wedding-stories whose actual
plot hinged upon the identity of death and marriage. Thus though one
"legend might be more appropriate in its externals to one occasion, and"
"another legend to another occasion, the ultimate and fundamental idea"
of them all was single and the same.
This view is boldly championed by the second authority whom I proposed
to quote upon the subject of mystic marriage-scenes depicted on
"funeral-monuments. ‘The idea,’ says Lenormant, ‘of mystic union"
in death is frequently indicated in the scenes represented upon
_sarcophagi_ and painted vases. But for the most part the idea is
"expressed there only in an allusive manner, which depends upon the"
identification which this marriage-scene established between the dead
"person and the deity, by means of such subjects as the carrying off"
"of Cephalus by Aurora, or Orithyia by Boreas, or the love-story of"
"Aphrodite and Adonis[1517].’ ‘Thus,’ he explains, ‘a girl carried"
frenzy.[17] Then followed a mysterious vigil during which the mystic was
supposed to be united as a new Attis with the great goddess.[18] On March
25th there was a sudden transition from the shouts of despair to a
"delirious jubilation, the _Hilaria_. With springtime Attis awoke from his"
"sleep of death, and the joy created by his resurrection burst out in wild"
"merry-making, wanton masquerades, and luxurious banquets. After twenty-four"
"hours of an indispensable rest (_requietio_), the festivities wound up, on"
"the twenty-seventh, with a long and gorgeous procession through the streets"
of Rome and surrounding country districts. Under a constant rain of flowers
the silver statue of Cybele was taken to the river Almo and bathed and
purified according to an ancient rite (_lavatio_).
The worship of the Mother of the Gods had penetrated into the Hellenic
"countries long before it was received at Rome, but in Greece it assumed a"
peculiar form and lost most of its barbarous character. The Greek mind felt
an unconquerable aversion to the dubious nature of Attis. The _Magna
"Mater_, who is thoroughly different from her Hellenized sister, penetrated"
into all Latin provinces and imposed herself upon them with the Roman
"religion. This was the case in Spain, Brittany, the Danubian countries,"
Africa and especially in Gaul.[19] As late as the fourth century the car of
the goddess drawn by steers was led in great state through the fields and
vineyards of Autun in order to stimulate their fertility.[20] In the
"provinces the _dendrophori_, who carried the sacred pine in the spring"
"festivities, formed associations recognized by the state. These"
"associations had charge of the work of our {58} modern fire departments,"
besides their religious mission. In case of necessity these woodcutters and
"carpenters, who knew how to fell the divine tree of Attis, were also able"
to cut down the timbers of burning buildings. All over the empire religion
and the brotherhoods connected with it were under the high supervision of
"the quindecimvirs of the capital, who gave the priests their insignia. The"
sacerdotal hierarchy and the rights granted to the priesthood and believers
were minutely defined in a series of senate decrees. These Phrygian
"Forest Chapel and went into the woods. He put his lip to the earth,"
"and lifted a green leaf to his brow, and held a branch to his ear,"
"and because he was no longer heavy with the sweet clay of mortality,"
"though yet of human clan he heard that which we do not hear, and saw"
"that which we do not see, and knew that which we do not know. All the"
"green life was his. In that new world, he saw the lives of trees, now"
"pale green, now of woodsmoke blue, now of amethyst; the gray lives of"
"stone; breaths of the grass and reed, creatures of the air, delicate"
"and wild as fawns, or swift and fierce and terrible, tigers, of that"
"undiscovered wilderness, with birds almost invisible but for their"
"luminous wings, and opalescent crests.”"
The value of this particular passage is the mystery pervading the whole
"picture, which forms so beautiful an antidote to the eternal explaining"
of things. I think it of the highest importance for children to realise
that the best and most beautiful things cannot be expressed in everyday
language and that they must content themselves with a flash here and
there of the beauty which may come later. One does not enhance the
beauty of the mountain by pulling to pieces some of the earthy clogs:
one does not increase the impression of a vast ocean by analysing the
single drops of water. But at a reverent distance one gets a clear
"impression of the whole, and can afford to leave the details in the"
shadow.
In presenting such passages (and it must be done very sparingly)
experience has taught me that we should take the children into our
confidence by telling them frankly that nothing exciting is going
"to happen, so that they will be free to listen to the mere words. A"
very interesting experiment might occasionally be made by asking the
children some weeks afterwards to tell you in their own words what
pictures were made on their minds. This is a very different thing from
"allowing the children to reproduce the passage at once, the danger of"
"eager spirit scorns so tardy a method: he will ""compel men to be"
"happy,"" and for this result there is but one practicable means, the"
"Social Contract, the State. Everything which mars the unity of the"
"Social Contract shall be shattered, so that the State may have a clear"
field for the exercise of its beneficent despotism. Such is
"Buonaparte's political and religious creed at the age of seventeen,"
and such it remained (with many reservations suggested by maturer
thought and self-interest) to the end of his days. It reappears in his
"policy anent the Concordat of 1802, by which religion was reduced to"
"the level of handmaid to the State, as also in his frequent assertions"
that he would never have quite the same power as the Czar and the
"Sultan, because he had not undivided sway over the consciences of his"
people.[10] In this boyish essay we may perhaps discern the
fundamental reason of his later failures. He never completely
"understood religion, or the enthusiasm which it can evoke; neither did"
"he ever fully realize the complexity of human nature, the"
"many-sidedness of social life, and the limitations that beset the"
action even of the most intelligent law-maker.[11]
His reading of Rousseau having equipped him for the study of human
"society and government, he now, during his first sojourn at Auxonne"
"(June, 1788--September, 1789), proceeds to ransack the records of the"
"ancient and modern world. Despite ill-health, family troubles, and the"
"outbreak of the French Revolution, he grapples with this portentous"
"task. The history, geography, religion, and social customs of the"
"ancient Persians, Scythians, Thracians, Athenians, Spartans,"
"Egyptians, and Carthaginians--all furnished materials for his"
encyclopædic note-books. Nothing came amiss to his summarizing genius.
Here it was that he gained that knowledge of the past which was to
astonish his contemporaries. Side by side with suggestions on
"regimental discipline and improvements in artillery, we find notes on"
"the opening episodes of Plato's ""Republic,"" and a systematic summary"
is derived from the art of advertisement. The science of psychology owes
a great deal to advertisers. In former days most psychologists would
probably have thought that a man could not convince many people of the
excellence of his own wares by merely stating emphatically that they
"were excellent. Experience shows, however, that they were mistaken in"
this. If I were to stand up once in a public place and state that I am
"the most modest man alive, I should be laughed at; but if I could raise"
enough money to make the same statement on all the busses and on
"hoardings along all the principal railway lines, people would presently"
become convinced that I had an abnormal shrinking from publicity. If I
were to go to a small shopkeeper and say: “Look at your competitor over
"the way, he is getting your business; don’t you think it would be a good"
plan to leave your business and stand up in the middle of the road and
"try to shoot him before he shoots you?”—if I were to say this, any"
small shopkeeper would think me mad. But when the Government says it
"with emphasis and a brass band, the small shopkeepers become"
"enthusiastic, and are quite surprised when they find afterwards that"
"business has suffered. Propaganda, conducted by the means which"
"advertisers have found successful, is now one of the recognized methods"
"of government in all advanced countries, and is especially the method by"
which democratic opinion is created.
There are two quite different evils about propaganda as now practised.
"On the one hand, its appeal is generally to irrational causes of belief"
"rather than to serious argument; on the other hand, it gives an unfair"
"advantage to those who can obtain most publicity, whether through wealth"
"or through power. For my part, I am inclined to think that too much fuss"
is sometimes made about the fact that propaganda appeals to emotion
rather than reason. The line between emotion and reason is not so sharp
"as some people think. Moreover, a clever man could frame a sufficiently"
rational argument in favour of any position which has any chance of
being adopted. There are always good arguments on both sides of any real
"the Palatine, and Caligula's successor could not but grant to the Phrygian"
"goddess, so long established in the city, the favor accorded the Egyptian"
divinity who had been admitted into Rome but very recently. In this way
Claudius prevented too great an ascendency in Italy of this second stranger
and supplied a distributary to the current of popular superstition. Isis
must have been held under great {56} suspicion by a ruler who clung to old
national institutions.[14]
The Emperor Claudius introduced a new cycle of holidays that were
"celebrated from March 15th to March 27th, the beginning of spring at the"
"time of the revival of vegetation, personified in Attis. The various acts"
of this grand mystic drama are tolerably well known. The prelude was a
procession of _cannophori_ or reed-bearers on the fifteenth; undoubtedly
"they commemorated Cybele's discovery of Attis, who, according to the"
"legends, had been exposed while a child on the banks of the Sangarius, the"
"largest river of Phrygia, or else this ceremony may have been the"
transformation of an ancient phallephory intended to guarantee the
fertility of the fields.[15] The ceremonies proper began with the equinox.
A pine was felled and transferred to the temple of the Palatine by a
"brotherhood that owed to this function its name of ""tree-bearers"""
(_dendrophori_). Wrapped like a corpse in woolen bands and garlands of
"violets, this pine represented Attis dead. This god was originally only the"
"spirit of the plants, and the honors given to the ""March-tree""[16] in front"
of the imperial palace perpetuated a very ancient agrarian rite of the
Phrygian peasants. The next day was a day of sadness and abstinence on
which the believers fasted and mourned the defunct god. The twenty-fourth
bore the significant name of _Sanguis_ in the calendars. We know that it
"was the celebration of the funeral of Attis, whose manes were appeased by"
"means of libations of blood, as was done for any mortal. Mingling their"
"piercing cries with the shrill sound of flutes, the Galli flagellated"
"themselves and cut their flesh, and neophytes performed the supreme {57}"
"sacrifice with the aid of a sharp stone, being insensible to pain in their"
In Flemish Ghent and Bruges the clashing interests of weavers and
"woollen-traders, complicated by the strife of the French (aristocratic)"
"and anti-French (popular) factions, led to riots in which citizens and"
magistrates were killed (1301). At times these enmities reached the
magnitude of civil war. At Ypres (1303) a combination of workmen
"demanded the suppression of rival industries in neighbouring villages,"
and in an ensuing riot the mayor and all the magistrates were slain; at
Bruges (1302) a trade riot led to the loss of fifteen hundred
"lives.[744] When later the weaving trade had flourished in Brabant, the"
same fatality came about: plebeians rebelled against patrician
magistrates--themselves traders or employers of labour--in the principal
cities; and Brussels (1312) was for a time given up to pillage and
"massacre, put down only by the troops of the reigning duke. A great"
"legislative effort was made in the ""Laws of Cortenberg,"" framed by an"
"assembly of nobles and city deputies, to regulate fiscal and industrial"
affairs in a stable fashion;[745] but after fifty years the trouble
"broke out afresh, and was ill-healed.[746] At length, in a riot in the"
"rich city of Louvain (1379), sixteen of its patrician magistrates were"
"slain, whereupon many took flight to England, but many more to Haarlem,"
"Amsterdam, Leyden, and other Dutch cities.[747] Louvain never again"
recovered its trade and wealth;[748] and since the renewed
Franco-Flemish wars of this period had nearly destroyed the commerce of
"Flanders,[749] there was a general gravitation of both merchandise and"
manufacture to Holland.[750] Thus arose Dutch manufactures in an organic
"connection with maritime commerce, the Dutch municipal organisation"
securing a balance of trade interests where that of the Flemish
industrial cities had partially failed.
The commercial lead given by the Hanseatic League was followed in the
"Netherlands with a peculiar energy, and till the Spanish period the main"
part of Dutch maritime commerce was with northern Europe and the Hansa
"cities. So far as the language test goes, the original Hansards and the"
We shall now take up the difficult question of the influence of Judaism
upon the mysteries during the Alexandrian period and at the beginning of
the empire. Many scholars have endeavored to define the influence exercised
by the pagan beliefs on those of the Jews; it has been shown how the
Israelitic monotheism became Hellenized at Alexandria and how the Jewish
"propaganda attracted proselytes who revered the one God, without, however,"
observing all the prescriptions of the Mosaic law. But no successful
researches have been made to ascertain how far paganism was modified
through an infiltration of Biblical ideas. Such a modification must
necessarily have taken place to some extent. A great number of Jewish
"colonies were scattered everywhere on the Mediterranean, and these were"
long animated with such an ardent spirit of proselytism that they were
bound to impose some of their conceptions on the pagans that surrounded
them. The magical texts which are almost the only original literary
"documents of paganism we possess, clearly reveal this mixture of Israelitic"
theology with that of other peoples. In them we frequently find names like
"Iao (Yahveh), Sabaoth, or the names of angels side by side with those of"
"Egyptian or Greek divinities. Especially in Asia {64} Minor, where the"
"Israelites formed a considerable and influential element of the population,"
an intermingling of the old native traditions and the religion of the
strangers from the other side of the Taurus must have occurred.
"This mixture certainly took place in the mysteries of Sabazius, the"
"Phrygian Jupiter or Dionysus.[31] They were very similar to those of Attis,"
with whom he was frequently confounded. By means of an audacious etymology
"that dates back to the Hellenistic period, this old Thraco-Phrygian"
"divinity has been identified with ""Yahveh Zebaoth,"" the Biblical ""Lord of"
"Hosts."" The corresponding expression ([Greek: kurios Sabaôth]) in the"
Septuagint has been regarded as the equivalent of the _kurios Sabazios_
([Greek: kurios Sabazios]) of the barbarians. The latter was worshiped as
"the supreme, almighty and holy Lord. In the light of a new interpretation"
the purifications practised in the mysteries were believed to wipe out the
"action, for he had always regarded learning as a pastime rather than a"
"drudgery, and so had easily distanced his comrades in the race for"
knowledge. While they were flirting with the Lischen or Gretchen of the
"hour, he had willingly absorbed himself in study--thus he had attained"
"the head of his classes with scarce an effort, and, in fact, had often"
found time hanging heavily on his hands for want of something more to
do. He had astonished the university professors--but he had not
"astonished himself, inasmuch as no special branch of learning presented"
"any difficulties to him, and the more he mastered the more dissatisfied"
he became. It had seemed such a little thing to win the honors of
scholarship! for at that time his ambition was always climbing up the
"apparently inaccessible heights of fame,--fame, that he then imagined"
was the greatest glory any human being could aspire to. He smiled as he
"recollected this, and thought how changed he was since then! What a"
"difference between the former discontented mutability of his nature,"
"and the deep, unswerving calm of patience that characterized it now!"
Learning and scholarship? these were the mere child's alphabet of
"things,--and fame was a passing breath that ruffled for one brief"
moment the on-rushing flood of time--a bubble blown in the air to break
"into nothingness. Thus much wisdom he had acquired,--and what more? A"
great deal more! he had won the difficult comprehension of HIMSELF; he
had grasped the priceless knowledge that man has no enemy save THAT
"WHICH IS WITHIN HIM, and that the pride of a rebellious Will is the"
parent Sin from which all others are generated. The old Scriptural
"saying is true for all time, that through pride the angels fell; and it"
is only through humility that they will ever rise again. Pride! the
"proud Will that is left FREE by Divine Law, to work for itself and"
"answer for itself, and wreak upon its own head the punishment of its"
"own errors,--the Will that once voluntarily crushed down, in the dust"
"at the Cross of Christ, with these words truly drawn from the depths of"
"penitence, ""Lord, not as I will, but as Thou wilt!"" is straightway"
"lifted up from its humiliation, a supreme, stately Force, resistless,"
Greek conception of the goddess they must be treated as complementary.
They are well interpreted by Farnell. Rejecting the theory of physical
"symbolism, he suggests ‘a more human explanation. Hera was essentially"
"the goddess of women, and the life of women was reflected in her;"
their maidenhood and marriage were solemnised by the cults of Hera
"Παρθένος and Hera Τελεία or Νυμφευομένη, and the very rare worship of"
Hera Χήρα might allude to the not infrequent custom of divorce and
"separation[1490].’ With, Hera the Widow we are not here concerned,"
but only with the higher conceptions of Zeus and Hera as expressed in
the representation of the ‘sacred marriage’; the bride and bridegroom
"who looked upon that saw in it, we may be sure, not a symbolical"
"representation of the seasons and the productive powers of the earth,"
but rather the divine prototype of human marriage. It reminded them
"that deities, like mortals, were married and given in marriage, and it"
"imparted to their wedding a sacramental character, making it at once a"
"foretaste and a gage of that close communion with the gods which, when"
death the dividing line between mortals and immortals should once be
"passed, awaited the blessed among mankind."
Other small points too suggest the same trend of thought. The
preliminaries of a wedding often comprised a sacrifice to Zeus
"Teleios and Hera Teleia[1491], and were called προτέλεια being the"
"‘preliminaries of initiation’ into that mystery, of which the"
"sacred marriage, enacted before the now wedded pair, was the full"
revelation[1492]. Again these preliminaries always included the
"solemn ablution[1493] of which I have spoken above, and in this"
resembled the preparations for admittance to the mysteries. Moreover
an instance is recorded in which this ablution was itself invested
with the significance of a wedding between the human and the divine.
The maidens of the Troad before marriage were wont to unrobe and bathe
themselves in the Scamander; and the prayer which they made to the
"river-god, whose bed they entered, was, ‘Receive thou, Scamander, my"
"regarded it all as a part of the experience in life which he craved, and"
"he might have become in a short while just such another as these, had it"
not been for an incident which suddenly arrested him in his career of
"dissipation, and turned his thoughts into different channels."
"It had been early June when he came to town, and now July had come, with"
"its sultry suns and breathless nights, when Grey ofttimes felt after an"
"evening over cards that it was mockery to go to bed, and lounged away"
"the residue of the night at his open window, enjoying the only coolness"
"and freshness that was to be had, as the wind came whispering from the"
river charged with refreshing moisture.
Sometimes the river seemed to call him; and at such times he would lay
"aside his finery, clothe himself in some plainer habit, and betake"
"himself through the silent house, where the night watchman was always"
"found slumbering at his post, out through the big courts and down to the"
"river steps, where a few light wherries were always kept moored, one of"
"which he would select, and shoot out upon the glimmering river to meet"
the new day there.
Some of his happiest hours were spent thus; and at such times as these
he felt rising within him a vague sense of unrest and of disgust.  He
"had come to the world of London to conquer fate, to make for himself a"
name and a career; and here he was wasting day after day in
"coffee-houses or clubs, with a crowd of idlers whose thoughts never rose"
"above the fancy of the hour, whose only ambition was to kill time as"
"easily and pleasantly as possible, and to line their pockets with gold,"
that they might have more to throw away on the morrow.
Was this what he would come to?  Was this what he was made for?  Would
"he become like unto them, a mere roisterer and boon companion, a man"
without aspirations and without ambition?  His cheeks burned at the
"canoe, but makes all the strokes on one side, a thing that looks very"
"easy, but is in fact extremely difficult. The dexterity of these men"
with their long single oar is wonderful. They glide in and out among
"scores of gondolas on the crowded canals without collision or jerking,"
and they turn a corner within an inch.
[Sidenote: Baggage Smashing in Europe.]
"These remarks upon the skill of the gondoliers, and the ease and safety"
"of the gondolas, remind me, by contrast, of the destructive bungling"
"of a porter in Cologne, who undertook to cart a load of trunks and"
"handbags and shawl-straps down from our hotel to the Rhine steamer, and"
"who, in turning a corner on a down grade, made the turn too short, and"
hurled the whole lot of our belongings into the muddy street with such
"violence that many of them were defaced, some permanently damaged, and"
one valise broken to pieces and utterly ruined.
That German baby carriage had an exciting adventure also on the night
"of our arrival in Rome. As usual, it was made the apex of the pyramid"
"of trunks and grip-sacks which constitute our sign manual, so to"
"speak, on the top of every omnibus that takes us from the station to"
"the hotel; but in this instance it was carelessly left untied, so"
"that as we went steeply down one of the seven hills of Rome, the cart"
"tumbled from its high perch to the stone-paved street, snapping off one"
"of the handles, and suffering sundry other shattering experiences. A"
few days after we had the pleasure of paying a fraudulent cabinetmaker
more for repairing it than it cost in the first instance. The Italian
workmen and shopkeepers uniformly charge you more than their work and
goods are worth. I think I have had more counterfeit money passed on me
in the short time I have been in Italy than I have had in all the rest
"of my life before, and the very first swindle of this kind to which I"
"was subjected was in a church, when the sacristan gave me a counterfeit"
children; we step into the land of fiction. It has always been a source
"of astonishment to me that, in trying to escape from our own every-day"
"surroundings, we do not step more boldly into the land of pure romance,"
"which would form a real contrast to our every-day life, but in nine"
cases out of ten the fiction which is sought after deals with the
"subjects of our ordinary existence--namely, frenzied finance, sordid"
"poverty, political corruption, fast society, and religious doubts."
There is the same danger in the selection of fiction for children:
"namely, a tendency to choose very utilitarian stories, both in form and"
"substance, so that we do not lift the children out of the commonplace."
"I remember once seeing the titles of two little books, the contents of"
which were being read or told to small children of the poorer class:
"one was called “Tom the Boot-black,” the other, “Dan the News-boy.”"
My chief objection to these stories was the fact that neither of
the heroes rejoiced in their work for the work's sake. Had Tom even
"invented a new kind of blacking, or if Dan had started a splendid"
"newspaper, it might have been encouraging for those among the listeners"
"who were thinking of engaging in similar professions. It is true, both"
"gentlemen amassed large fortunes, but surely the school age is not to"
be limited to such dreams and aspirations as these! One wearies of the
"tales of boys who arrive in a town with one cent in their pockets, and"
"leave it as millionaires, with the added importance of a Mayoralty, not"
to speak of a Knighthood. It is true that the romantic prototype of
"these boys is Dick Whittington, for whom we unconsciously cherish the"
affection which we often bestow on a far-off personage. Perhaps--who
knows?--it is the picturesque adjunct of the cat--lacking to modern
millionaires.[38]
I do not think it Utopian to present to children a fair share of
stories which deal with the importance of things “untouched by hand.”
They too can learn at an early age that “the things which are seen are
"with a man, a friend, she revealed to him a secret of a woman friend's."
"Then, realising her betrayal of confidence, she decided that the best"
"thing she could do would be to kill the man. On reflection, however,"
"she thought that it would, after all, be unkind to do so since he was a"
"friend, and so told him that if he ever repeated the secret she would have"
him torn to pieces. It will be seen that the betrayal of a secret was
"felt as a far more serious offence than murder. The facility with which,"
"in such dreams as this, the suggestion of murder presents itself, even to"
"dreamers who, when awake, cherish no bloodthirsty or revengeful ideas, is"
certainly remarkable.
It is often said that in dreams erotic suggestions present themselves with
"extreme facility, and are eagerly accepted by the dreamer. To some extent"
"there is truth in this statement, but it is by no means always true. This"
"may be illustrated by the following dream, the sources of which could"
be easily traced; two days before I had seen the gambols of East Enders
"at Hampstead Heath on a Bank Holiday, and the day before I had visited"
"a picture gallery, the two sets of impressions becoming ingeniously"
"combined, according to the usual rule of dream confusion. I thought that"
when walking along a country lane a sudden turn brought me to a broader
"part of the road covered with grass, into the midst of a crowd of women,"

"nudity, and engaged in romping together, more especially in tugs-of-war;"
"some of them were on horseback. My appearance slightly disturbed them, I"
"heard one cry out my name, and to some extent they drew back, and partly"
"desisted from their games, but only to a very slight degree, and with"
"no overpowering embarrassment. I was myself rather embarrassed, and,"
"glancing at them again, turned back. Afterwards my walk again brought"
"me in view of them, and it occurred to me that women are somewhat"
"changing their customs, a very wholesome change, it seemed to me. But I"
remonstrated with one or two of them that they ought to keep in constant
"movement to avoid catching cold. No erotic suggestions were present,"
From ocean to ocean the territory which is called the Canal Zone is
"about forty-three miles long, ten miles wide and contains about 436"
"square miles, about ninety-five of which are under the waters of the"
"Canal, and Miraflores and Gatun Lakes. It is bounded on the north by the"
"Caribbean Sea, on the south by the Pacific Ocean, and on the east and"
west by the Republic of Panama. It traverses the narrowest part of
"Panama, the waist so to speak, and has been taken out of that body"
politic by the diplomatic surgeons as neatly as though it had been an
obnoxious vermiform appendix. Its territory does not terminate at low
"water-mark, but extends three marine miles out to sea, and, as I write,"
a question of jurisdiction has arisen between the two Republics--hardly
twin Republics--of Panama and the United States concerning jurisdiction
over three malefactors captured by the Zone police in a motor boat out
at sea. It may be noted in passing that Panama is properly tenacious of
"its rights and dignity, and that cases of conflicting jurisdiction are"
continually arising when any offender has only to foot it a mile or two
to be out of the territory in which his offense was committed. The
police officials of the Zone affect to think that the Panama authorities
are inclined to deal lightly with native offenders who commit robbery or
murder on the Zone and then stroll across the line to be arrested in
their native State.

There was a quarrel on while I was on the Zone over the custody of a
"Panamanian who killed his wife, with attendant circumstances of"
"peculiar brutality, and then balked the vengeance of the Zone criminal"
authorities by getting himself arrested in Panama. “We want to show
"these fellows”, remarked a high police official of the Zone, “that if"
they do murder in our territory we are going to do the hanging”. That
"'If Ferrier's life should be written hereafter,' said one, who knew and"
"valued him, just after his death,[7] 'let his biographer take for its"
motto these five words from the _Faery Queen_ which the biographer of
"the Napiers has so happily chosen.' Ferrier's life was not, what it"
"perhaps seems, looking back on its comparatively uneventful course,"
"consistently calm and placid,--a life such as is commonly supposed to"
"befit those who soar into lofty speculative heights, and find the"
'difficult air' in which they dwell suited to their contemplative
temperaments. Ferrier was intrepid and daring in his reasoning; a sort
"of free lance, Dr. Skelton says he was considered in orthodox"
"philosophical circles; a High Tory in politics, yet one who did not"
"hesitate to probe to the bottom the questions which came before him,"
even though the task meant changing the whole attitude of mind from
"which he started. And once sure of his point, Ferrier never hesitated"
openly to declare it. What he hated most of all was 'laborious dulness
and consecrated feebleness'; commonplace orthodoxy was repugnant to him
"in the extreme, and possibly few things gave him more sincere pleasure"
than violently to combat it. The fighting instinct is proper to most
"men who have 'stuff' in them, and Ferrier in spite of his slight and"
"delicately made frame was manly to the core. But, as the same writer"
"says, 'though combative over his books and theories, his nature was"
"singularly pure, affectionate, and tolerant. He loved his friends even"
"better than he hated his foes. His prejudices were invincible; but,"
"apart from his prejudices, his mind was open and receptive--prepared to"
"welcome truth from whatever quarter it came.' Such a keen, eager nature"
"was sure to be in the fray if battle had to be fought, and we think"
none the worse of him for that. Battles of intellect are not less keen
"than battles of physical strength, and much more daring and subtlety"
"may be called into play in the fighting of them; and Ferrier, refined,"
"sensitive, fastidious, as he was, had his battles to fight, and fought"

"At last one of the priests, attended by an acolyte, took up a censer,"
"placed a little incense on the coals with a teaspoon, and, swinging it"
"in his hand by the chain, led us back into the cathedral, turned to"
"a chapel on the left, unlocked an iron gate in a tall railing which"
"separated this chapel from the body of the building, closed the gate"
"again when our party had come inside, and, while a dozen or so of"
the people who had been at their devotions crowded up to the railing
"and peered curiously through, he and his attendant began to kneel"
repeatedly before the altar and to swing the smoking censer on every
"side. Above the altar was a strong, square steel box, over which, in"
"plain view, was suspended a _fac-simile_ of the Iron Crown, made of"
"cheaper materials, while the real crown was still concealed within the"
steel safe.
[Sidenote: The Great Relic itself.]
"Handing the censer to his attendant, that it might be kept swinging"
"without intermission, the priest produced another series of keys and"
proceeded to unlock a succession of small doors in the side of the
"metal safe, which proved to be a ""nest"" of caskets, one within another,"
"the last of which was a glass case. Drawing this out, he brought into"
"full view the venerated crown of the Lombard kings, and told us to step"
up on the stool by the altar so as to see it better. It is made of six
"plates of gold, joined end to end, richly chased, and set with splendid"
"jewels. But one would see at a glance that neither the material, nor"
"the workmanship, nor the gems, could account for the unique reverence"
"with which it has been regarded for centuries, and an indication of"
which we had just seen in the service conducted by the priest. Among
"the regalia in the Tower of London, and at several other places in"
"continuance of the severer medieval destructive checks. They must,"
"therefore, have put a high degree of restraint on marriage, and probably"
observed parental prudence in addition.
"When it is found that in Sweden, where the conditions and usages were"
"once similar, there was latterly at once less prudential restraint on"
"marriage and population, and a lower standard of material well-being,"
the two cases are seen to furnish a kind of _experimentum crucis_. The
comparatively late maintenance of a powerful military system in Sweden
having there prolonged the methods of aristocratic and bureaucratic
"control while they were being modified in Denmark-Norway, Swedish"
population in the eighteenth century was subject to artificial stimulus.
"From about the year 1748, the Government set itself, on the ordinary"
"empirical principle of militarism, to encourage population.[700] Among"
its measures were the variously wise ones of establishing medical
"colleges and lying-in and foundling hospitals, the absolute freeing of"
"the internal trade in grain, and the withdrawal in 1748 of an old law"
limiting the number of persons allowed to each farm. The purpose of that
law had been to stimulate population by spreading tillage; but the spare
"soil being too unattractive, the young people emigrated. On the law"
"being abolished, population did increase considerably, rising between"
"1751 and 1800 from 1,785,727 to 2,347,308,[701] though some severe"
"famines had occurred within the period. But in the year 1799, when"
"Malthus visited the country, the increased population suffered from"
"famine very severely indeed, living mainly and miserably on bark"
bread.[702] It was one of Malthus's great object-lessons in his science.
On one side a poor country was artificially over-populated; on the
"other, the people of Norway, an even poorer country, directly and"
"indirectly[703] restrained their rate of increase, while the Government"
during a long period wrought to the same end by the adjustment of its
military system and by making a certificate of earning power or income
"necessary for all marriages.[704] The result was that, save in the"
"“Panama” was first attached to them years ago, because their chief"
"market was found in Panama City, whence they were distributed to more"
northern countries. The palm of which they are made however grows
generally in Panama and the government has established in the Chiriqui
province a school in which native boys are taught the art of hat making.
In the National Institute at Panama City there is also a government
trades school where boys are given a three years’ course in the elements
of the carpenters’ and machinists’ trades. Indeed the rulers of the
"Republic, which was so abruptly created, deserve great credit for the"
steps they are taking for the creation of a general system of public
"education, both literary and practical. The school system is not yet on"
"a par with that of states of longer existence, nor will it in all"
probability ever quite conform to more northern ideas of an educational
"establishment. For example, the National Institute is closed to girls,"
who for their higher education are limited to the schools maintained by
"the church. A normal school, however, in which girls are prepared for"
teaching in the primary grades is maintained with about 125 students.
The school system of Panama must be regarded merely as a nucleus from
which a larger organism may grow. Yet when one recalls the state of
society which has resulted from revolutions in other Central American
"states, one is impelled to a certain admiration for the promptitude with"
which the men who erected the Republic of Panama gave thought to the
educational needs of people. They were suddenly put in authority over an
"infant state which had no debt, but, on the contrary, possessed a"
"capital of $10,000,000 equivalent to about $30 for every man, woman and"
"child of its population. Instead of creating an army, buying a navy and"
thus wasting the money on mere militarism which appeals so strongly to
"the Latin-American mind, they organized a civil government, equipped it"
"with the necessary buildings, established a university and laid the"
foundation of a national system of education.
[Illustration: COFFEE PLANTATION AT BOUQUETTE]
The old attic was now so rich of hue and yet so stiffly chaste that
Noll almost rubbed his eyes to see if he were awake.
It was indeed a handsome room; and yet----
Some faint whisper of the how and the why these things had chanced
flashed through Noll’s consciousness. Here Julia had put the savings of
her hard-won earnings. A tidy mind frets at the ordered disorder of the
workshop. She was of a precise habit that has a ruthless distaste for
"chips. She had secretly consulted the old lady, who had grimly advised"
her to “let the man’s room be”; but he who takes to the council of war
"a decided intention is irked by opposition, and smiles away the wisdom"
of older heads as the mere caution of senility. And indeed there was
"something of the poetic intention behind her gentle obstinacy, as there"
was behind everything she did; for (and she knew it in her secret heart
to be not wholly without a little of such jealous venom as her gentle
blood could hold) she had been passionately set upon bringing into this
"man’s life a fresh influence, a fragrance that she was sure he had"
not known--she was aglow with the glamour of the love-mood to be the
all-in-all in the atmosphere of her lover’s day. And as the rich crave
"ever to be more rich, so she, queening it in her little parish, was"
blind to the simple fact that all the subtle and gracious tenderness of
her gentle womanhood had won her a larger empire over her lover than
"any she could hope to win by petty endeavour. The old lady, her wise"
old eyes seeing that the other had come to consult the oracle with the
"answer rather than the question, had nodded her willingness, after the"
"first demur, to comply with the younger woman’s whim. And the nod of"
"surrender once given, she had addressed herself, during their absence"
"on the honeymoon, to carrying out the young wife’s instructions to the"
"uttermost detail, even employing no small sum out of her own small"
income to the perfecting of it.
the priests to embrace in their collections all possible contingencies so
"as to be prepared for any question that might at any time arise, a large"
number of signs were entered which the diviners thought _might_ occur. In
"other words, in order to be on the safe side the diviners allowed their"
fancy free rein and registered many things that we can positively say
never did occur and never could occur[17]. With the help of hand-books on
"human and animal pathology, we can without difficulty distinguish between"
"two classes. Thus, twins being regarded as significant and triplets even"
"more so, the priests did not stop at this point but provided for cases"
"when four, five six up to eight and more infants were born at one"
"time[18]. Again in regard to animals, inasmuch as bitches and sows may"
"throw a litter of ten and even more, the priests in their collections"
"carried the number up to thirty[19] which is, of course, out of the"
"question. For sheep and goats the number was extended up to ten, though it"
probably never happened that more than triplets were ever born to an ewe
"or to a mother-goat. Even twins are rare, and I am told that there are few"
authenticated cases of triplets.
Malformations among infants and the young of animals were of course
"plentiful, but here too the anomalies and monstrosities are not as"
numerous and varied as were entered in the handbooks of the Babylonian and
Assyrian diviners. The factor of fancy to which I have referred enters
"even more largely in the entries of many actual malformations, through the"
assumption of a more or less fanciful resemblance of some feature or of
some part of an infant or of the young of an animal with the features or
parts of some animal.
An excess number of limbs--three legs or four arms in the case of an
"infant, or five or six legs in the case of a lamb, puppy, pig or foal, or"
two heads--is not uncommon. On this basis the priests entered cases of
excess legs and arms and heads up to nine and more[20]; and similarly in
regard to ears and eyes.
"almost reach the intensity of hallucination. Thus, after an indigestible"
"supper, I awake with the vivid feeling that some one is lying on me"
"and attempting to drag off the bedclothes, and I find myself violently"
"attempting, but apparently in vain, to articulate: 'Who is there?' In a"
"dream of similar type, which occurred when lying on my back (and possibly"
"with slight indigestion due to an unusually late dinner), I awoke making"
a kind of inarticulate exclamation which awakened my wife. I had dreamed
"that I was lying in bed, and that some unseen creature--more supernatural"
"than human, it seemed--was violently dragging the bedclothes off me, while"
"I shouted to it, very distinctly it seemed to me, 'Avaunt, avaunt!'"
"It is evident that my own sense of oppression, my own unconscious and"
"involuntary movements in disturbing the bedclothes, were reconstructed by"
"sleeping consciousness as the actions of an external person, in the second"
"case, a supernatural creature, which, it is interesting to note, I duly"
accepted as such and addressed in the conventionally appropriate manner
of old romance. The illusion may persist for some moments after waking. A
"lady, after breathing rather loudly and convulsively for a few seconds,"
"wakes up, saying 'There is a rat or a mouse on the bed, shaking it up"
"and down.' 'You were asleep,' her husband replied, 'as I knew by your"
"breathing.' 'Oh, I was breathing like that,' she said, 'to make it jump"
"off.' Here we see that, somewhat as in the previous cases, the dreamer's"
"own muscular activity is, during sleep, reconstructed into the image of an"
"external force; but when she is in the semi-waking hypnagogic stage, she"
"recognises that the activity was her own, though still unable to dismiss"
the delusion based on the theory formed during sleep.
"At this point we reach the threshold of hallucination, and the next"
"case to be brought forward may be said to lie on the threshold, for an"
impression received in the hypnagogic (or hypnopompic) stage is accepted
"in its illusional form, even when the dreamer is fully awake. A farmer's"

producing practically without attention for fifteen seasons. Cornfields
have been worked for half a century without fertilizing or rotation of
crops. The soil there is volcanic detritus washed down during past ages
"from the mountainsides, and lies from six to twenty feet thick. It will"
"grow anything that needs no frost, but the province supports less than"
"four people to the square mile, nine-tenths of the land is unbroken and"
"Panama imports fruit from Jamaica, sugar from Cuba and tobacco and food"
stuffs from the United States.

"The fruits of Panama are the orange, which grows wild and for the proper"
"cultivation of which no effort has been made, which is equally the case"
"with the lemon and the lime; the banana, which plays so large a part in"
the economic development of the country that I shall treat of it at
"length later; the pineapple, cultivated in a haphazard way, still"
attains so high an order of excellence that Taboga pines are the
"standard for lusciousness; the mango, which grows in clusters so dense"
"that the very trees bend under their weight, but for which as yet little"
"market has been found, as they require an acquired taste; the mamei,"
hard to ship and difficult to eat because of its construction but withal
"a toothsome fruit; the paypaya, a melon not unlike our cantaloupe which"
"has the eccentricity of growing on trees; the sapodillo, a fruit of"
"excellent flavor tasting not unlike a ripe persimmon, but containing no"
pit. With cultivation all of these fruits could be grown in great
"quantities in all parts of the Republic, but to give them any economic"
importance some special arrangement for their regular and speedy
"marketing would have to be made, as with the banana, most of them being"
by nature extremely perishable.

"intangible, unseeable;--one cannot say of it, lo here!--or lo"
there!--it is as complicated and subtle as any other of the
manifestations of pure Spirit. Then you must decide on one universal
"standard, or reasonable conception of what 'morality' is. Again, you"
"are met by a crowd of perplexities,--as every nation, and every tribe,"

"'moral' to have many wives; in others, to drown female children; in"
"others, to solemnly roast one's grandparents for dinner! Supposing,"
"however, that you succeed, with the aid of all the philosophers,"
"teachers, and scientists, in drawing up a practical Code of"
Morality--do you not think an enormous majority will be found to ask
you by whose authority you set forth this Code?--and by what right you
"deem it necessary to enforce it? You may say, 'By the authority of"
Knowledge and by the right of Morality'--but since you admit to there
"being no spiritual or divine inspiration for your law, you will be"
"confronted by a legion of opponents who will assure you, and probably"
"with perfect justice, that their idea of morality is as good as yours,"
"and their knowledge as excellent,--that your Code appears to them"
"faulty in many respects, and that, therefore, they purpose making"
"another one, more suited to their liking. Thus, out of your one famous"
"Moral System would spring thousands of others, formed to gratify the"
"various tastes of different individuals, precisely in the same manner"
as sects have sprung out of the wholly unnecessary and foolish human
arguments on Christianity;--only that there would lack the one
"indestructible, pure Selfless Example that even the most quarrelsome"
"bigot must inwardly respect,--namely, Christ Himself. And 'morality'"
would remain exactly where it is:--neither better nor worse for all the
trouble taken concerning it. It needs something more than the 'moral'
"sense to rightly ennoble man,--it needs the SPIRITUAL sense;--the"

"The most interesting feature was offered by the temperature, as this was"
very liable to lead one astray. A primary rise always occurred with the
"collection of blood in the pleura, this reaching its height on the third"
"or fourth day, usually about 102° F. in well-marked cases; it then fell,"
"and in favourable instances remained normal. In a large number of cases,"
"however, where the amount of blood was considerable, this was not the"
"case, the primary fall not reaching the normal, and a second rise"
occurred which reached the same height as before or higher. The second
"rise was accompanied by sweating, quickened pulse, and the probability"
of the development of an empyema had always to be considered. I believe
in most cases this secondary rise was an indication of a further
"increase in the hæmorrhage, for the dulness usually increased in extent,"
and such rises were often seen when the patient had been moved or taken
"a journey. Again, the temperature often fell to normal after"
"paracentesis and removal of the blood, to rise again with a fresh"
"accumulation, which was not uncommon. I have already mentioned the large"
proportional incidence of hæmothorax observed in the patients who had
"to travel down from Paardeberg, and I might instance another case"
"related to me by Dr. Flockemann of the German ambulance, which was very"
"striking. A Boer, wounded at Colesberg, developed a hæmothorax which"
"quieted down, and he was removed to Bloemfontein; on arrival at the"
"latter place the temperature rose, and other signs of fever suggested"
"the development of an empyema; an exploring needle, however, only"
brought blood to light. After a short stay at Bloemfontein the symptoms
"entirely subsided, and the man was sent to Kroonstadt, when an exactly"
"similar attack resulted, again quieting down with rest."
"Similar recurrent attacks of hæmorrhage and fever occurred, however, in"
patients confined to their beds without moving after the first journey.
"trade, they had become at the date of their assured independence the"
chief trading State in the world. Whatever commercial common sense the
world had yet acquired was there in force. And inasmuch as the wealth
"and strength of these almost landless States, with their mostly poor"
"soil and unavoidably heavy imposts, depended so visibly on quantity of"
"trade turnover, they not only continued to offer a special welcome to"
"all immigrants, but gradually learned to forego the congenial Protestant"
strife of sects. It was indeed a reluctantly-learned lesson. Even as
local patriotisms constantly tended to hamper unity during the very
"period of struggle, so the primary spirit of self-assertion set the"
ruling Calvinistic party upon persecuting not only Catholics and
"Lutherans, but the new heresy of Arminianism:[785] so little does"
"""patriotic"" warfare make for fraternity in peace. The judicial murder of"
the statesman John van Olden Barneveldt (1619) at the hands of Maurice
"of Orange, whom he had guarded in childhood and trained to"
"statesmanship, was accomplished as a sequel to the formal proscription"
of the Arminian heresy in the Synod of Dort; and Barneveldt was formally
"condemned for ""troubling God's Church"" as well as on the charge of"
treason.[786] On the same pretexts Grotius was thrown into prison; and
the freedom of the press was suspended.[787] It was doubtless the shame
of the memory of the execution of Barneveldt (the true founder of the
"Republic as such),[788] on an absolutely false charge of treason, and"
"the observation of how, as elsewhere, persecution drove away population,"
that mainly wrought for the erection of tolerance (at least as between
Protestant sects) into a State principle.
"The best side of the Dutch polity was its finance, which was a lesson to"
"all Europe. Already in the early stages of the struggle with Spain, the"

the vestibule in the Argive Heraeum there was a couch (κλίνη) for
"Hera[1475], and he seems to speak of it as if it were a common enough"
"piece of temple furniture. So too at Phlya in Attica, where were held"
"the very ancient mystic rites ‘of her who is called the Great,’ there"
"was a bridal chamber (παστάς), where, it has rightly been argued, there"
‘must have been enacted a mimetic marriage[1476].’ Again Clement of
"Alexandria speaks of a παστός of Athena in the Parthenon, and makes"
it quite clear by the story which he relates that he understood the
word in the sense of bed-chamber. The story is also for other reasons
"worth recalling, because it shows how the religious conception of"
marriage between men and gods was readily extended to the worship of
"other deities than those whose mysteries we have sought to unravel,"
and at the same time furnishes the only case known to me in which
that mystic belief was prostituted to the base uses of flattery. The
occasion was the reception accorded by the Athenians to Demetrius
"Poliorcetes. Not content with hailing him as a god in name, they went"
"so far in their mean-spirited subjection as to set up a temple, at"
"the place where he dismounted from his horse on entering their city,"
"to Demetrius the Descender (Καταιβάτης)[1477], while on every side"
altars were erected to him. But their grossest piece of flattery was
"a master-piece of grotesque impiety, and met with a fitting reward. A"
marriage was arranged between him (the most notorious profligate of his
"age) and Athena. ‘He however,’ we are told, ‘disdained the goddess,"
"being unable to embrace the statue, but took with him to the Acropolis"
"the courtesan Lamia, and polluted the bed-chamber of Athena, exhibiting"
to the old virgin the postures of the young courtesan[1478].’ Even that
"contemptuous response to the Athenians’ flattery did not abash them,"
"but, finding that he did not favour their acknowledged deity, they"
"determined to deify his acknowledged favourite, and erected a temple to"
Lamia Aphrodite[1479].

In one aspect the Scandinavian polities have a special lesson for the
"larger nations. They have perforce been specially exercised latterly, as"
"of old, by the problem of population; and in Norway there was formerly"
"made one of the notable, if not one of the best, approaches to a"
practical solution of it. Malthus long ago[698] noted the Norwegian
marriage-rate as the lowest in Europe save that of Switzerland; and he
"expressed the belief that in his day Norway was ""almost the only country"
in Europe where a traveller will hear any apprehension expressed of a
"redundant population, and where the danger to the happiness of the lower"
"classes of people is in some degree seen and understood.""[699] This"
"state of things having long subsisted, there is a presumption that it"
"persists uninterruptedly from pagan times, when, as we have seen, there"
existed a deliberate population-policy; for Christian habits of mind can
"nowhere be seen to have set up such a tendency, and it would be hard to"
show in the history of Norway any great political change which might
"effect a rapid revolution in the domestic habits of the peasantry, such"
"as occurred in France after the Revolution. Broadly speaking, the mass"
of the Norwegian people had till the last century continued to live
under those external or domiciliary restraints on multiplication which
"were normal in rural Europe in the Middle Ages, and which elsewhere have"
been removed by industrialism; yet without suffering latterly from a
"though their fighting ships were manned by men of all nations, the"
tendency was to feed them in the native fashion. Such a practice
would tell fatally in the sea-fights with the English. Cp.
"Gardiner, _Commonwealth and Protectorate_, ii, 123."
"In addition to this expertness in handling, the Dutch traders seem to"
"have bettered the lesson taught them by the practice of the Hansa, as to"
the importance of keeping up a high character for probity. At a time
when British goods were open to more or less general suspicion as being
"of short measure or bad quality,[808] the Dutch practice was to insure"
"by inspection the right quality and quantity of all packed goods,"
"especially the salted herrings, which were still the largest source of"
Dutch income.[809] And that nothing might be left undone to secure the
"concourse of commerce to their ports, they maintained under almost every"
stress[810] of financial hardship the principle of minimum duties on
imports of every description. The one notable exception to this policy
of practically free trade--apart from the monopoly of the trade in the
Indies--was the quite supererogatory veto on the importation of fish
from other countries at a time when most of the fishing of Northern
Europe was in Dutch hands.[811] Where imports were desirable they were
encouraged. Thus it came about that landless Amsterdam was the chief
"European storehouse for grain, and treeless Holland the greatest centre"
of the timber trade. Before such a spectacle the average man held up his
hands and confessed the incomparable ingenuity of the Hollanders. But
"others saw and stated the causation clearly enough. ""Many writing on"
"this subject,"" remarks Sir William Petty, ""do magnifie the Hollanders"
"as if they were more, and all other nations less, than men, as to the"
"matters of trade and policy; making them angels, and all others fools,"
"brutes, and sots, as to those particulars; whereas,"" he continues,"
"giving a sound lesson in social science to his generation, ""I take the"
foundation of their achievements to be originally in the situation of
"the country, whereby they do things inimitable by others, and have"
"their natural order, and begin by telling you I sailed from Leith on"
"the morning of the second of this month, with no wind at all. We"
"drifted on, I know not how, and toward evening were within gunshot of"
"Inchkeith; on the following morning we were in sight of the Bass, and"
in sight of the same we continued during the whole day. For the next
"two or three days we went beating up against a head-wind, which forced"
"us to tack so much that whenever we made one mile we travelled ten, a"
"pleasant mode of progressing, is it not? However, I had the whole ship"
"to myself, and plenty of female society in the person of the captain's"
"lady, who, being fond of pleasure, had chosen to diversify her"
monotonous existence at Leith by taking a delightful summer trip to
"Rotterdam, which confined her to her crib during almost the whole of"
our passage under the pressure of racking headaches and roaring
"sickness. She had a weary time of it, poor woman, and nothing could do"
"her any good--neither spelding, cheese, nor finnan haddies, nor bacon,"
"nor broth, nor salt beef, nor ale, nor gin, nor brandy and water, nor"
"Epsom salts, though of one or other of these she was _aye takin'_ a wee"
"bit, or a little drop. We were nearly a week in clearing our own Firth,"
and did no good till we got as far as Scarborough. At this place I had
"serious intentions of getting ashore if possible, and making out the"
rest of my journey by means that were more to be depended on. Just in
"the nick of time, however, a fair wind sprang up, and from Scarborough"
"we had a capital run, with little or no interruption, to the end of our"
voyage.' An account of a ten days' voyage which makes us thankful to be
"in great measure independent of the winds at sea! Holland, our"
"traveller thinks an intolerable country to live in, and the first"
impressions of the Rhine are distinctly unfavourable. 'The river
"himself is a fine fellow, certainly, but the country through which he"
"flows is stale, flat, though I believe, not unprofitable. The banks on"
either side are covered either with reeds or with a matting of rank
"shrubbery formed apparently out of dirty green worsted, and the"
continuance of it so palls upon the senses that the mind at last
"were pouring forth the richest music, while a dense crowd of people,"
"many thousands, all standing, watched with eager interest a small,"
"crate-like object, made of slats of dark wood, which rested on the"
"high altar, enclosed in a glass case, with a gold baby on top and gold"
ornaments round about.
[Sidenote: The Holy Cradle.]
"We pushed our way through the crowd, so as to get a satisfactory view"
"of it while the service was in progress--the genuflections, the robing"
"and disrobing of the archbishop, the chanting, and the rest--after"
"which six men, dressed in pure white from head to foot (white gloves"
"included), except for a red circle and cross on the breast, knelt"
"before the cradle, then lifted it from the altar, with its gold and"
"glass setting, and placing it on a kind of litter on their shoulders,"
"under a gilt and white canopy borne by other attendants, marched with"
"it thus, in procession around the church, along with a large crucifix"
"under another canopy, and followed by a long line of cardinals,"
"bishops, priests and acolytes, carrying it back finally to its place in"
"the sacristy, where it will remain till next Christmas Day."
[Sidenote: The Christ of Rome a Babe or a Corpse.]
"We squeezed our way through the great crowd at the door, and walked"
"back to our hotel, wondering to what extent the usual Roman Catholic"
conception of Christ had deprived that organization of real spiritual
"energy; for, almost invariably, Roman Catholic art represents him"
"either as a dead Christ on the cross, or a babe in his mother's arms,"
"and hardly ever as the risen and glorified Lord, the Conqueror of"
"death, the Leader of his people, to whom all power is given in heaven"
and on earth--the more usual Protestant conception. And we asked
ourselves whether this difference did not help to explain the greater
"merchants, and so ruined his credit,[790] the Dutch issued tin money and"
"paper money, and found it readily pass current with friends and"
foes.[791]
"Of all the Protestant countries, excepting Switzerland, the Dutch States"
alone disposed of their confiscated church lands in the public
"interest.[792] There was indeed comparatively little to sell,[793] and"
the money was sorely needed to carry on the war; but the transaction
seems to have been carried through without any corruption. It was the
suggestion of what might be accomplished in statecraft by the new
"_expertise_ of trade, forced into the paths of public spirit and checked"
by a stress of public opinion such as had never come into play in
"Venice. Against such a power as Spain, energy ruled by unteachable"
"unintelligence, a world-empire financed by the expedients of provincial"
"feudalism, the Dutch needed only an enduring resentment to sustain them,"
and this Philip amply elicited. Had he spent on light cruisers for the
destruction of Dutch commerce the treasure he wasted on the Armadas
"against England and on his enormous operations by land, typified in the"
"monstrous siege of Antwerp, he might have struck swiftly and surely at"
the very arteries of Dutch life; but in yielding to them the command of
"their primary source and channel of wealth, the sea, he insured their"
ultimate success. In the Franco-Spanish war of 1521-25 the French
cruisers nearly ruined the herring fishery of Holland and Zealand;[794]
and it was doubtless the memory of that plight that set the States on
maintaining predominant power at sea.[795]
"Throughout the war, which from first to last spread over eighty years,"
"the Dutch commerce grew while that of Spain dwindled. Under Charles V,"
Flanders and Brabant alone had paid nearly two-thirds of the whole
imperial taxation of the Netherlands;[796] but after a generation or
two the United Provinces must have been on an equality of financial
"resources with those left under Spanish rule, even in a state of peace."
"21. The following officers, that is to say,--"
"(1) Any officer of customs in the United Kingdom, subject"
nevertheless to any special or general instructions from the
"Commissioners of Customs or any officer of the Board of Trade,"
subject nevertheless to any special or general instructions from
the Board of Trade;
(2) Any officer of customs or public officer in any British
"possession, subject nevertheless to any special or general"
instructions from the governor of such possession;
(3) Any commissioned officer on full pay in the military service
"of the Crown, subject nevertheless to any special or general"
instructions from his commanding officer;
(4) Any commissioned officer on full pay in the naval service of
"the Crown, subject nevertheless to any special or general"
"instructions from the Admiralty or his superior officer, may seize"
or detain any ship liable to be seized or detained in pursuance of
"this Act, and such officers are in this Act referred to as the"
"""local authority""; but nothing in this Act contained shall"
derogate from the power of the Court of Admiralty to direct any
ship to be seized or detained by any officer by whom such court
may have power under its ordinary jurisdiction to direct a ship to
be seized or detained.
[Sidenote: Powers of Officers authorised to seize Ships.]
22. Any officer authorised to seize or detain any ship in respect of any
"offence against this Act may, for the purpose of enforcing such seizure"
"or detention, call to his aid any constable or officers of police, or"
"Dutch were of the same ""Low Dutch"" stock, which was also that of the"
Anglo-Saxons.[751] Thus there was seen the phenomenon of a vigorous
maritime and commercial development among the continental branches of
"the race; while the English, having lost its early seafaring habits on"
"its new settlement, lagged far behind in both developments. Kinship, of"
"course, counted for nothing towards goodwill between the nations when it"
could not keep peace within or between the towns; and in the fifteenth
"century the Dutch cities are found at war with the Hansa, as they had"
"been in the thirteenth with England, and were to be again. But the"
"spirit of strife did its worst work at home. On the one hand, a physical"
schism had been set up in Friesland in the thirteenth century by the
immense disaster of the inundation which enlarged the Zuyder Zee.[752]
Of that tremendous catastrophe there are singularly few historic traces;
but it had the effect of making two small countries where there had been
"one large one, what was left of West Friesland being absorbed in the"
"specific province of Holland, while East Friesland, across the Zuyder"
"Zee, remained a separate confederation of maritime districts.[753] To"
"the south-west, again, the great Flemish cities were incurably jealous"
"of each other's prosperity, as well as inwardly distracted by their"
"class disputes; and within the cities of Holland, in the fourteenth and"
"fifteenth centuries, while intelligible lines of cleavage between trades"
"or classes are hard to find, the factions of Hoek and Kabbeljauw, the"
"""Hooks"" and the ""Codfish,"" appear to have carried on a chronic strife,"
as irrational as any to be noted in the cities of Italy. Thus in the
"north as in the south, among Teutons as among ""Latins"" and among ancient"
"Greeks, the primary instincts of separation checked democratic growth"
and coalition; though after the period of local feudal sovereignties the
powerful monarchic and feudal forces in the Netherlands withheld the
cities from internecine wars.
The most sympathetic historians are forced from the first to note
the stress of mutual jealousy among the cities and districts of the
Aristophanes’ picture of Hera’s wedding and those funeral monuments
and vases which Furtwängler describes; for there too ‘golden-winged
"Eros held firm the reins, and drave the wedding-car of Zeus and blessed"
"Hera[1513].’ In other words, this Olympian marriage was only one among"
"several mystic marriages which all conveyed, though in diverse form,"
"the same lesson, that marriage was the perfection of divine life no"
"less than of human life, and therefore that hereafter when men, or at"
"any rate the blessed and initiated among men, should come to dwell with"
"their gods, no bond of communion between gods and men could be perfect"
short of the marriage-bond.
It was natural enough that the drama of Hera’s wedding with Zeus should
"most often have been chosen to be played at an ordinary wedding,"
because it would not obtrude thoughts of death upon a joyous event
with such insistence as most of the other religious legends which
"reposed upon the same fundamental doctrine; but sometimes, we know, it"
"was the priestesses of Demeter who officiated at wedding-ceremonies,"
and in those cases it cannot be doubted that it was Persephone and not
"Hera who was the divine prototype of the bride, and the thought that"
her wedding was a wedding with the god of death could not have been
"excluded. At funerals, on the other hand, the story of Zeus and Hera"
which was preferred at weddings owing to its less obvious allusion to
"death, would for that same reason have found less favour than those"
other marriage-legends in which the identity of death with marriage
"was more clearly enunciated; and of these, owing to the exceptional"
"reverence in which the Eleusinian mysteries were held, the story of"
Persephone seems to have been among the most frequent. Yet in the
"picture drawn by Aristophanes at which we have just glanced, for one"
subtle touch which suggests the connexion of Hera’s wedding with human
"weddings, there is another subtle touch which suggests its relation"
with human death. The first is an epithet applied to Eros who drove the
"wedding-car--the epithet ἀμφιθαλής, used of one who has both parents"
Are you?
"If I've got a plan, what is it?"
You tell me.
That's the way to do it!
Is this a test?
Yes.
What will it do to us?
Kill us.
That's the way to do it!
"So, come on then - plan, do I have one?"
I knew straight away.
"No, you didn't."
Course I did.
Show me!
Why should I?
Because we'll be dead in under 30 seconds.
Do I have a plan?
"If we'd been escaping, we'd be climbing down the building."
"If we'd been hiding, we'd be on the other side of the roof."
But we're standing right here.
So?
So!
After you.
After you.
"After you, I'm wearing a dress."
"Eyes front, soldier!"
My eyes are always front!
Mine aren't.
Stop it!
No!
I understand you're the previous governess.
I regret to inform you the position is taken.
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lots!"
"All right, all right."
You'll be kissing the gunner's daughter before too long.
Get her out to sea while the tide's still with us.
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
We have all had our fill of Jacob Moore.
So I'm seizing the ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below.
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning Moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Up sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
"Aye, Captain."
Stow the prisoners.
Let's get clear of this godforsaken place.
Let's go!
Come on.
We need to drink.
Please.
Make it quick.
What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We are being pursued.
Let us go.
Now!
I'm so hungry.
"I thought there was a cracker, or like some fruit left or some shit."
I don't know.
Put that away.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Are you here to hurt me?
No no no.
No no.
"No no, we don't wanna hurt you."
Okay.
Not at all.
I'm sorry about him.
Yeah.
"We're robbers, and we're stuck down here with you."
You're robbers?
Yeah.
You don't make any sense.
We were pulling a heist.
I'm the leader.
He's part of my crew.
"Yeah, don't, don't judge us on our rugged exterior."
Find anything yet?
Nothing.
I think we just should have sent that text.
"Look, it was a good plan, okay."
"We found the jammer, we killed it, we could have gotten a phone call out."
So no one knows that you're here?
No.
Wait a minute.
Why would you rob this place?
"We, we thought it was legit."
There was no one here.
"Prisoners are taken out on work detail one block at a time, right?"
- Same time every day.
- An ambush?
When guards are vulnerable.
It's not like we're liberating the whole camp anyway.
"Assuming we can get them out, there'll be search parties."
They're not in any condition to run for long.
I'll need to find a place to hide them.
"I'll do more recon, map out a route."
Gather all the guns
- we have.
- What can I do?
You've been through a lot.
Just stay out of trouble.
"What, am I grounded?"
I do something wrong?
I didn't say you did.
- I want to help.
- And you can.
Someone needs to hold the fort.
He'll be all right.
We'll look after him.
I'll be fine.

"- My Jordans, nigga!"
"- Shit, this isn't good."
- This is not good.
This is not good.
No.
No.
No.
They're coming over here.
- Fucking shit.
Why did you do that?
"- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose."
"They're getting weapons, man."
"All right, what do we do?"
What do we do?
"Run, run, run."
"Run, run."
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
What do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only have one shot.
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
And that whoever you do not shoot will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground.
Ready?
Let the show begin.
Stand your ground.
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Gather around me here!
Captain Taylor.
"Dale, it's Gig."
- His machine.
- Oh.
"Um, see, things have got a little bit sticky over here."
"Slight change of plans, nothing that your deft touch couldn't rectify."
So either swing by or call back.
That'd be marvelous.
- Thank you.
- Great.
- Slight snag though.
- What?
"Well, Dale - blesshim - has been doing favor after favor for us."
"If it's not one thing, it's the other."
So -
- So what's your point?
- [ Sighs ]
"If he's gets the ticket back for us, we'll have to give him more money."
- No.
No way.
NO.
- That would only be fair.
There is a limit to my classiness.
- Quite obviously.
- Shut up!
I'll handle this.
You just leave Dale out of it.
Bunch of morons.
I have to do everything myself!
- Hi.
"- Well, well, well."
Look who it is.
An old face from the past.
Put mother on.
I have to talk to her.
"Listen, firstly I'm sorry."
"Then, my condolences."
"If someone asks for me, say you couldn't reach me."
They don't know I've hired a cell-phone.
I'll be back for the seventh day of mourning.
I promise I'll be there.
Don't talk to me like that.
This is the wrong time.
All right. ls there anything else?
Take care.
Hello.
Hello.
Why aren't you singing now?
You sing so well.
"Go on, keep singing."
I dare not.
But why?
You're down there and I'm here.
We can't look each other in the eye.
I can't see you.
I can see you.
What are you doing down there?
I'm digging a well.
You don't dig wells on hills.
- l'm digging a ditch.
- Why a ditch?
For telecommunications.
Why are you alone?
Working alone makes things simple.
"It's good, you don't have a boss."
A dead man.
A dead man at the lagoon.
We have to leave!
He's been into the grog again!
"Shut your mouth, will!"
"We all saw it, right?"
It's true.
I saw it with me own eyes.
- It rose up like a demon!
- Demon?
Get the women back into the stockade!
"First it attacked you, now it's come for me."
This place is cursed.
We're all cursed!
"Calm down, man!"
We have to find another island to get provisions from before it's too late.
"- It's a devil, sir."
- He speaks the truth.
"Right, you lot."
Load all the goods into the longboat!
Did you not hear him?
Move it!
We shouldn't have taken the ship!
"Shut up, man!"
You're giving everyone the jitters!
He must be sun-struck.
Let me help.
Right.
Just keep him away from the rest of the men.
Come on.
"Roll out the barrel, boys!"
Just put your shoulder into it.
I'll manage.
I told the cleaning lady to come twice a week too.
Absolutely not.
The way things were was fine.
It won't be the same.
What?
Dust?
I can dust.
I have to get the money from the account that Grandpa left.
We have to go to the bank.
Okay.
"Besides that, I'll arrange some more money."
I don't need you to arrange for me.
I need you to sign as a guarantor on the contract.
Did you notice that the bathroom light is flickering?
Yeah.
"It's like a discotheque, it needs to be checked."
I'll handle it.
Good.
Can I take this?
Of course.
You didn't forget anything?
I have everything.
You're sure?
- I'm sure.
"No, no, I'll take the dishes later."
Are you not feeling well?
"No, I'm fine."
Do you feel sick?
- It's nothing.
Want me to get you some glycerin?
"No, I don't need any."
It isn't rare to find destructive even criminal behavior.
"Hey, do me a favor, will you?"
Tell me something good.
Don't be alarmed.
"If it's a lesion, in a way, she's fortunate."
All we have to do is remove the scar.
-Let's move her.
"- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?"
A little more.
Good.
"Regan, I'm just gonna move you down on the table, okay?"
Let me do this.
It's okay.
See?
There we go.
It's just for a short time.
You're doing fine.
Very sticky.
Good.
"Now, Regan, you're gonna feel something a little bit cold and wet."
Okay.
Now you're gonna feel a little stick here.
Don't move.
Good.
Okay.
You're gonna feel some pressure here.
"Now, don't move."
Hook up.
There's nothing there.
No vascular displacement at all.
Do you want me to run another series?
I don't think so.
- [Squelching]
- Euch!
This is disgusting.
You're no threat to humanity.
"Well, except for maybe the gross-out factor."
"Go ahead, slimy."
Take your best shot.
Hot dog!
A worthy adversary.
"Don't press the ""Don't"" button."
"I'll press your ""Don't"" button, buddy."
[Strains] Heavier than it looks.
Eat bricks!
"Ooh, he's good."
Can I clone or can I clone?
"Surrender, Tick, you're hopelessly outclassed."
I don't know the meaning of the word surrender.
"I mean, I know it, I'm not dumb."
Just not in this context.
And if it's class you want...
Now talk to me about class.
Lucky break.
[Pants and strains]
Here goes nothing.
Oh.
Need an extension cord.
Huh?
What?
"Oh, that old joke."
"So, what tired routine do you do for an encore?"
"Oh, dear."
- [Crashing]
I'll go up the hill.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
I can't call you.
Hello.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Sorry, it takes a few minutes to reach the high ground."
You can't foresee that.
"One day she's well, the next she isn't."
Her condition varies.
We're all waiting.
We have to wait.
She has company.
Her son has come a long way.
He's waiting like us.
When will we be back?
In a couple of days maybe.
Good-bye.
I knew that warm voice belonged to a warm-hearted man.
Hello.
How are you?
It's deep!
"Three metres, as stated in the contract with the engineer."
I think you may be right.
Working alone is better.
It's harder... but there are advantages.
- Do you understand me?
- No.
I mean that no one bothers you.
A boss.
You don't have a boss.
Yeah?
He comes and disturbs us.
I was winning.
"They're beings, Trelane."
They have spirit.
They're superior.
"No, no."
You saw.
"You'll grow up, Trelane."
You'll understand.
Now come along.
"Aw, but you said I could."
You promised.
I never have any fun.
"Stop that nonsense at once, or you'll not be permitted to make any more planets."
"Aw, but you saw."
I was winning.
I would have won... honest.
"No, Trelane."
"No, Trelane."
I would have.
I would have.
I would have.
I would.
I would.
I would.
I would.
"Captain, we regret that the life paths of yourself and your companions have been disturbed."
Who are you?
Who is Trelane?
You must forgive our child.
The fault is ours for indulging him too much.
He will be punished.
We would not have let him intercept you had we realized your vulnerability.
What's this?
I'm the Boss after all.
I always carry my portable lobby along.
Sit.
Where do I sit?
Here.
Don't sit there you fool.
It'll crack the eggs.
So there are eggs inside?
No.
There are nails.
They'll pierce through.
Yes Mr. Thakur.
How can I be of service?
Are you going to kill Shiv in jail?
Why are you being so eager Thakur?
I know all about you.
First you clear the garbage and then your record.
Thakur.
If kill him in your jail... won't there be an investigation on you?
The media's been showing your footage with that boy... and boring you to death.
If kill him won't you be blamed?
He's right.
Then what do we do?
It's simple.
We won't kill Shiv in jail.
We'll get him out first and then...
Superb.
Let him escape.
What do you say Ayushman?
Let's make him flee from jail.
Stupid fool.
- You're welcome.
Is that your car stuck there?
We're waiting for a tractor to pull it out.
"I see, thank you very much."
I'd really like to repay you somehow.
- Don't worry about it.
- But still.
It was really nothing.
Let's go.
- Thank you for your help!
- You're welcome.
Get her keys.
"We're just gonna grab some stuff and then we're gone, all right?"
"hey, hey, hey."
Come on.
Army food.
Yum.
- Which one's the key to the boat?
- The red one.
Let's get out of here before I start puking again.
"Look, look, I won't tell anybody you were here."
Just take the boat and go.
Please.
"Actually, we don't really need this."
I'm gonna find them.
The people who did this are not gonna get away.
Just tell me she's gonna be all right.
"She lost a lot of blood, but her pulse is strong."
We just have to keep watching her.
Bad heart valve.
She's had it since she was born.
What's with your attitude?
You don't think I was worried as well?
What are you doing?
I'll take a taxi.
Why?
Hurry and get in.
I'll be more comfortable in a taxi.
You should go first.
You're trying to avoid me nagging.
Yes.
"Fine, do as you like."
Stop it!
Hurry!
"Listen, just listen, all right?"
All right.
Take a deep breath.
As deep a breath as you can take.
You're so mean.
This is why you woke me up?
"I was right, wasn't I?"
There's no one here.
I was really curious how it would be like under water.
You're such a pervert.
We...
We what?
How will we be living in five years?
How will it be in ten years?
How will our feelings have changed?
What kind of person will you remember me as?
And when will I be able to let you go?
Will I be able to let you go?
"In five years, you'll probably be a father."
Slowly.
"No. no, no, no."
Did--did you see that--that guy
With the--with that--that gun?
It--it erases your short-term--no.
Psst.
What the hell is up with you two?
Now who are you working for?
Secret service.
"But a department that you, sir, know nothing about."
I doubt that.
Now what department?
"It's a, um, archival department."
You're filing clerks
Running around shooting stun guns
At your own people?
"Oh, we didn't shoot you."
"All right, filing clerks that protect us from invisible bad guys."
- Yeah.
Pretty much.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
I'll take it from here.
"Careful, archives."
"Paper cuts, they take days to heal."
That's hilar-- you're hilarious.
Very scared.
- So glad to see you.
- Thank you.
Not a damn word.
"Now, I warned you to back off before things got worse."
Inter-planetary.
"So take him, Stanin."
"Look, tell me, do you love me?"
"Look, do you hear?"
Will you write to me?
"Tell me, do you love me?"
Will you write to me?
Manya?
Let's beat it!
Look...
We're just naturally loose!
"We can't broadcast this to our planet, nobody would believe it."
And why not?
"Because if they get to know this on our planet, then everyone will want to fly here."
And we don't have enough flying saucers for this.
It would be the end of our civilization.
You get it?
Hallo.
Hallo!
What do you think?
Should I write to her?
Don't pick it up!
What will you report to them?
This just isn't possible.
I'll adjust the message a bit so it won't be so shocking.
What do you think about this?
-No.
It's concealing facts.
-I know.
But it will be better this way.
Believe me.
I'll only a little bit more...
- This is the one.
One more shot.
One more shot.
Just one more.
Just one more.
"- You know, I'm on to you."
- What do you mean?
"Okay, you told me that I'm top dog but secretly, you think you're top dog, all right?"
Now you're just trying to out-top-dog the top dog.
Can you take these doors off child-lock so I can kill myself?
- Men working.
"Things are different now, man, all right?"
You're not top dog anymore.
I am.
You know what?
You are absolutely correct.
You are the top dog.
Here.
What are you doing?
There's no top dog crown.
Are you trying to make me look stupid?
"Look, man, this is about respect."
I'm a lot flyer than I used to be.
"- Yeah, much flyer."
I respect you.
"- No, you don't."
"Because if you did, you would have told me that the small room is the top dog room."
Face to face
Just when...
Just when you thought Our chance had past
What?
I own this song.
"That way, we don't have to think about it."
"We don't even have to look either, because we're never gonna miss it that distance."
"It's a good plan, Daze."
A real good one!
- You think so?
- Totally.
Cool.
- Don't aim too high.
- Why not?
We don't want to that little bird.
"Oh, yea... good thinkin'."
Are you ready?
- Ready.
- Let's do it.
Who wants a snack?
Be careful they're hot.
Uhm... no thank you.
- Don't you like cookies?
"- Yeah, but..."
I feel kind of bad now.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Are those oatmeal?
"Thanks, mister."
What's wrong?
"Wait a minute, did you put something in this?"
Why are you looking at us funny?
"No, no, no..."
It just that you girls aren't what I expect it.
We didn't picture you either.
Keeps life interesting I guess.
Do you have any milk?
"I hate to interrupt or anything, but... don't you think you girls are better be load?"
"No image, no arrests, no Internet profile."
- No way to see what he looks like.
- So I could go undercover as him.
"- Could be pretty risky, Bos."
- But worth it.
This is more than just a gambling ring.
I can tell you he's scheduled for some casino time after his 8:00 massage.
Looks like one of us is gonna have to rub down a bad guy.
Good idea.
Massage?
No.
No.
Don't look at me.
I'm the cruise director.
I've already given up my cover.
I'm a dude.
You guys suck.
That's nice.
"Just a little higher up the thigh, honey."
There we go.
"Just a little higher, babe."
"There it is, sweet cheeks."
Why don't you just relax and enjoy the pressure points?
How's about you shut up and give me the happy ending?
Okay.
I'll give you a happy ending.
Once upon a time...
The end.
Bingo.
- You're back.
- I am.
I felt a little underdressed.
I got knocked up.
So my man proposed to me.
No.
Why did you have to quit too?
I'm pregnant.
He doesn't want me to work.
You can still work even if you're pregnant.
"If I was pregnant, I would still work."
You don't understand.
"I am having a baby, and it will affect the baby."
"If you play that card, there's nothing more to say."
Why are you upset?
I'm not upset.
You told me we would work side by side forever.
Yeah I did say that.
I'm sorry.
But you understand right?
I don't.
You can't do this to me.
Are you really mad?
You have no right to be mad!
Why can't I?
No.
Listen and stop worrying.
Your jobs won't disappear.
"I'll find a new person to take my place, okay?"
Why so mad?
Because nobody can replace you.
You can find someone better.
But I don't want it.
It's not you.
"For me, there is no Je 2."
"Second, you're lookout only."
You're not goin' inside.
Can't he be lookout?
It's fine.
"Actually, yeah, can he be lookout?"
I'm not done.
"Last, you need to respect my leadership skills."
"I'm the leader, okay, and you need to treat me accordingly."
"You realize that real leaders don't tell others they have leadership skills, but you got-"
"- You sure about that, man?"
"I mean, this is my heist, right?"
This is just a robbery.
"Look, this is your heist, you're the leader and I respect your leadership skills."
"Too late, homie."
All right.
All right.
You can come along on the heist.
It's not a heist.
Thank you.
"Hey, all right."
"Yeah, okay."
Thank you.
Yeah.
It means a lot.
You guys hear me okay?
Yep.
Clear up here.
All right.
Be back in a minute.
"All right, guys, let me show you how the big boys do it."
I'm buyin' boobs.
What are you gonna get?
Did he hang himself?
No... he goofed it up.
He...
The rain.
What's up with you?
Soft in the head?
Did you get lost?
Yes.
"Here, with you."
"It's not like in the movies or in books, where everything is precise, thought-out, organized... with a clear-cut goal."
"Everything's chaos, chance... pain... disorder..."
"Still, my way of putting things in order is to get them, one by one, my mother's lovers."
There's one left.
Do you want me to tell?
No.
What for?
To know my life.
There is no life.
There's only a war.
Listen.
I can't hear anything.
Close your eyes.
Mary?
"You're gliding too high, friend."
You're gonna crawl back.
I won't cushion your descent.
You're overdosing.
"If I were human, I'd waste you here and now."
I'm not going to be human.
I won't go back on my word.
"I wouldn't want to hurry you, but theaters run on precise timetables."
Go betweens too.
"All right, line up here."
ERNIE:
The guys who robbed me are there?
They'll speak.
Give me a number if you recognize a voice.
- How did you find out about them?
- Police work.
Ready?
Yeah.
"All right, let's go."
"""Stay in the corner and behave."""
"""Stay in the corner and behave."""
"- ""Stay in the corner and behave."""
- Hold on a minute.
"Okay, go on."
"""Stay in the corner and behave."""
"- ""Stay in the corner and behave."""
- Yes.
Number five.
"Ask him to laugh and say, ""Or we'll punt you like a football."""
"Number five, laugh and say, ""Or we'll punt you like a football."""
"""We'll punt you like a football."""
I can't pick anybody out.
Is that all of them?
Number six.
"- ""Stay in the corner and behave."""
- No.
"Are you not lD'ing these guys, because you're afraid of them?"
- I'm not afraid.
- You'll take care of this on your own?
- Did Chicky give me up to these guys?
- Which guys?
"If you say you're not the devil, and reveal your true form to me-"
I'll leave you alone.
"When the demon is snared, the rooster will cry three times."
Wait until the third cry.
You'll leave me alone?
Yes.
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.
Touch me and see.
"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, and you see I have both."
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
what do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only h have one shot?
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
"And that whoever you do not shoot, will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground."
Ready?
Let the show begin.
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Gather 'round me here.
Captain taylor.
Mr. Crusoe!
I thought you'd forgotten us!
Are you gonna be leading us?
- I'll leave that to you.
- Right.
"I need to help a friend, but I'll be back."
It's coming from the jungle!
"Lancaster, unshackle the men!"
"Come on, pick up the muskets."
The prisoners are out!
"Arm yourselves, you drunken sods!"
They're in disarray!
Let's have at them!
Fire!
Reload!
No!
Hold your fire.
Hey.
Hey.
You won?
No brig time.
You on a break?
"No, we're done."
You lost?
They said that my marriage to Mustafa was valid.
No.
"You don't have to go back, do you?"
"No, I divorced him."
I gave back the mahr.
The money from the villa.
Divorced?
Just like that?
"Oh, Islamic law has some interesting wrinkles."
"So you and I, we're not really married?"
We can be if you take this.
My mahr.
Your phone card?
There's almost $12 on it.
It's all I have.
"Yes, I will marry you."
"You know, it still may take some doing to keep her in the country."
"Well, she's officially an adulteress now so she can't go home."
That strengthens our asylum claim.
"Well, I give you exhibit A."
"Judge sees that, can't hurt."
"Here you go, gentlemen."
So what are we drinking to?
Women who appreciate the truth.
Let me know when you find one.
We promised.
I thought you were OK with that.
Yeah.
That was when the wolf seemed a long way away.
"Now, I mean this room feels half the size it normally does."
I know what you mean.
It was fun the last full moon.
Yeah...
"Out there, all of us together."
It was...
It was a rush.
It was...
It was right.
"I mean, it was right."
Outside in a pack is where we belong.
The only reason we transformed outside last time is because we ran out of time.
"Mum and Dad, they won't let that happen again."
They can't stop us if we don't let them.
"Rhydian, I won't go against them."
"So, for the rest of our lives we'll just spend the one night we should we running wild, locked up?"
Yeah.
"No, I mean, no."
No.
I can't think about the rest of my life right now.
OK.
I'm with you.
Whatever you decide.
We stay.
Fancy coming to the exhibition with me?
Come on!
Don't you find it interesting?
What?
Next Thursday.
- That's great.
You have to do it.
- I don't know.
- You have to do it.
- Really?
Yes.
You've never been a part of an actual graduation ceremony.
I know.
That's because my conservative high school... wouldn't let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time.
- Don't be gross.
- You think I should do it?
- You've worked hard.
You've earned it.
- I guess.
Come on.
You know that deep down you really want to do this.
I'll admit I've always wanted to wear one of those gowns.
And the hat?
For the tassel.
You know my thing for fringe.
"They call out your name, and people clap, and you get your diploma."
Then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other.
"Very symbolic, very dramatic."
- That's it.
You're doing it.
- If you insist.
- Who do you want to invite?
- I don't know.
You.
- And?
- That's cool with me.
Sit right down.
"Well, I..."
"Well, I'll just take a sip."
"- Of course, I shouldn't stay too long."
"- Oh, nonsense."
Nonsense.
You can stay as long as you like.
"After all, we have all evening, haven't we?"
Of course we have.
Here.
There.
"Oh, I like your singing."
Yes.
You must sing again for me sometime.
Where did you get such a pretty voice?
"Well, I don't know."
I just...
Perhaps it's the pretty place it comes from?
- Well...
"- Very lovely, where it comes from."
"- Well, here's health so good luck."
"- I make my own luck, my dear."
"Yes, and tonight I follow the rainbow."
"Oh, you don't half talk, do you?"
Perhaps we could follow it together?
"- I'll follow it right home, mister."
- To that rattrap?
"- Hey, what are you calling names?"
- I think you deserve something better.
How do you know where I live?
"Well, I can imagine."
Surely your wages here don't earn you a place in Barkley Square.

I want to lead the march!

Fall in!
(DRUMBEAT ROLLING)

Did you get an address?
- I'm gonna send it to you now.
"All right, urn..."
- I'll see you there.
"- Yeah, see you there."
- You off to arrest someone?
- Yeah.
You're screwed then cos I'll do you for false arrest.
I had reasonable and probable cause to think you were committing a crime.
"- Listen, one more peep out of you..."
- (LAUGHS)
- ...and it's with intent to supply.
- You're a liar.
And you're a junkie hooker.
I'm a copper.
"Do that, would you?"
Stitch me up?
Yeah.
"In a millisecond, just to shut you up."
Do you even know what they'll do to me for this?
"They'll break my ankles, if I'm lucky."
Listen.
Look at me.
"Nothing's going to happen to you, all right?"
"Yeah, who says?"
You?
"- Yeah, me."
"- They do know where I live, you know."
"People like that, they always do."
Come on.
"Mark, I wouldn't do this unless I absolutely had to."
Do what?
"But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left."
Eric didn't know.
None of us do.
"You can play it safe, or take the chance and fight now."
These are some of the best men I've fought with.
We saw thousands die at Dunkirk.
Our orders were to hold the line to the last man.
And we did.
It was a suicide mission.
I'm not putting these men through that again.
I'm sorry.
I can't let them take that risk.
I asked to be taken to my POW.
Why I am still here?
Damn.
You know what?
I missed lunch.
"So, do you mind if I...?"
If you're done?
Mmm.
Luftwaffe silver clasp.
- Sixty missions to get one of those.
- I know what you want.
Yeah.
Gravy.
Why would I give information to an office boy?
Tell you what.
"I won't pretend to know anything about you, if you don't assume that you know me."
Don't usually flash that on a first date.
You ever been shot before?
No.
It's not much fun.
I'm upset with myself.
I live in my fantasies.
"When reality knocks, I don't open."
He tell you?
Briefly.
No need for more.
It would be dangerous.
For you and us.
I thought it over.
You're partially right.
Militancy is getting us nowhere.
Bourgeoise elections even less.
It's a trap.
It's time for action.
No revolution ever avoided it.
French resistance took up arms.
We extol their heroism.
We're the new resistance.
Don't Maoists say that?
Maybe they're right.
So we're breaking with the Trotskyites.
Where do you position yourself?
Why talk anarchy if you don't act on it?
It's easy.
The car comes.
The comrades change vehicles.
Set theirs on fire in the woods.
He'll take you back by motorcycle.
- If it's worth it.
- It's not our call.
"We chose the underground, and its rules."
First one: no questions.
How dare you do that to me?
Is this how you're going to be?
"I was willing to endure all the pain till the very end, but you torture me over this crap?"
Don't you remember?
I told you how hard it is to fight with images!
So just give me the facts.
Not your bullshit philosophy.
"You slept with her, huh?"
"Oh, that I know already."
Did you walk over me?
"You and that bitch walked over me, huh?"
I won't cry.
Just tell me.
- Then I'll be quiet.
- You're completely insane.
"Tell me, please."
"Just tell me, Joongrae."
"No, I can't."
I can't be treated like this.
I don't deserve this.
I just can't.
"Sorry, I'm leaving."
"R. The Best Beach on the West Coast, Shinduri"
- Thanks for coming.
- What happened?
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Yes.
There's such a muscle?
So there are muscles we can't use.
Guess it's like the appendix.
That's too bad.
You mustn't have worked on your script.
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
"If you say you're not the devil, and reveal your true form to me-"
I'll leave you alone.
"When the demon is snared, the rooster will cry three times."
Wait until the third cry.
You'll leave me alone?
Yes.
Not in a good way.
"Said he's a vet, right?"
Afghanistan?
Maybe we crossed paths.
I don't think so.
I wonder what he saw out there that made him like this.
You get to the good part?
You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?
The detonator and booster can't be separated from the main charge without triggering the fuse.
Designed it special for hotshots like you...and me.
Anything that's put together can be taken apart.
And we ain't got nothing in common.
We'll see.
- Can you do this?
- Yeah.
He's a punk.
I got this.
All right.
Here's the plan.
"On three, you're stepping off that mine."
Got to do it cleanly.
Then get behind that blast wall.
- I can do that.
"- No, he's gonna need help."
He's been standing here for hours.
His legs are dead.
I don't need you.
"As soon as he's off the plunger,"
I can find the back door to this thing and defuse the mine.
Let's go.
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.
Yeah.
"I mean, totally."
What we are working on now is the most personal survival horror game in history.
Cool.
One that works out how to scare you by using your own mind.
Whoa.
That...
That sounds crazy.
Can't wait!
I'm uploading a neural net package.
"Neural net packing, neural net."
Hmm.
"Name could use a little work, I think."
It's all 90s.
"I'm just kidding, it's a good name."
It's state of the art intelligence software.
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity and try and work out how best to frighten you and then adjust to your experience accordingly.
- Whoa!
- Are you ready?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Beam me up.
"Here we go, lock and load."
- Eyes closed.
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- Okay.
It's uploading.
"Five, four, three, two, one."
How are you feeling?
Um...
"You did her, and now you've come to see what it did to me?"
"- I love her out of pity, Mickey."
"- Don't you, by chance, pity me a little?"
- I love her out of sorrow.
"- Me, I love her out of full stop!"
- She respects you.
- Like one respects graveyards.
I'll never leave her to you.
It's to have you in her mitt that she took that mad flat just across from yours.
"Yes, you did your bit to waste the Venom."
But there's still three to go in her noble cause.
You up for it?
Now it's you she'll run away from.
Mickey isn't the brute you believe he is.
I don't have beliefs.
It...
It's tough to hurt you.
"For me to be able to kill you, you need to be a woman."
I'd wrap the blade in silk.
You wouldn't feel a thing.
No.
She would.
Buzz off!
Oh no!
"We are such children, prince."
Mary...
See?
- D'you suffer?
- D'you?
Our clients!
"Right on time, like for church!"
"Hey degenerate, you got Gothic mosques at home?"
- Come on.
"No,it's disgusting."
It was like a little freckle a month ago and then it just ran amuck.
"All right,now you're gonna have to show me."
"Seriously,you might be,like,sick."
Let us help.
I'm very sensitive about this.
Do not make fun.
I'm serious.
Do not make fun.
Okay.
"Promis promise,promise."
Oh!
No!
"Oh,my God,you guys suck."
"So,if I had one of those on my back, you wouldn't lust after me anymore?"
"Um... no,no,I wouldn't."
"Seriously,you should never show that to a potential soul mate ex."
Maybe it's a sign.
You should see if psychic chick can read it.
"Hey,what's up,guys?"
"Hey,dude."
- Morning.
"- Hey,man."
Late night?
What are you doing here?
It's a beautiful day.
I thought I'd take Rufus for a hike.
I don't like that you just show up here whenever.
Yeah?
Like how you just show up at my house?
Those were extenuating circumstances.
- No fear or favour.
How about Mr. Crawford?
How does he take it?
- I've not had occasion...
- Not had occasion?
"He's made of good stuff, he must be spirited."
"Therefore, he must get into mischief."
"If he gets into mischief, he must be punished."
The captain insisted on no favouritism.
- You heard him say that.
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, be watchful, Mr. Kilpatrick."
- And diligent.
"- Yes, sir."
"And if you ever need my advice, don't hesitate to ask."
"Thank you, sir."
"- Don't lie, son."
"- I didn't do it, sir."
- Are those your initials?
"- Yes, but I just made a scratch."
- You could hardly see it.
- You did?
- You lied to me.
- I thought...
- It's so marked-up anyway.
- It shouldn't be.
There's a rule against defacing the table.
I've been lenient with you.
Too lenient.
- Anything to say?
- Only that someone else must have...
- I have nothing to say.
"Linking, sir."
"Full-power acceleration from orbit, Mr. Scott."
"Full power, sir."
"Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment,"
Mr. Sulu.
"Standing by to warp, sir."
Shall I make a full report to Spacefleet Command?
Not yet.
They may trace our beam.
Wait until we're well out of range.
"Can we know his range, Captain?"
We can take an educated guess-- at the point we entered their solar system.
Still no sign of pursuit.
"Instruments clear, sir."
Good.
May I take a moment to change?
"Yes, I think you might."
Turn in your glass slippers.
The ball is over.
"Gladly, Captain."
Hard to believe that it ever happened.
"Captain, we're about to warp."
Large body ahead.
Collision course.
"Hard to port, Mr. Sulu."
"That was the planet Gothos, Captain."
Gothos!
Have we been going in circles?
No.
All instruments show on-course.
Gothos again.
Hard over.
Do you believe in prayer?
Not really.
Neither do I.
My dad always prays.
So does mine.
Do you wanna try it?
Try praying'?
Okay.
How is he?
Still dying.
"Well, you've almost mastered another skill, though."
That's good.
Foreman's biopsy results.
Non-specific signs of inflammation.
That's it?
We also swabbed for staph.
Negative.
He's not even a carrier.
"Well, at least foreman was wrong too."
"Yeah, there's that."
Can I go to joe's apartment now?
No.
Go back to the lab.
Start retesting all the samples that foreman collected.
For what?
Everything.
"Bacteria, toxins, fungus."
Anything that likes to feast on brain.
That's thousands of... better hurry.
"Cameron, suit up."
You're gonna monitor foreman.
He's on to hand contractures.
Be careful.
Means you are not shooting me?
I had to shoot.
But not with gud with boom.
Make a boom which blast.
"Bring the beg like he put in that locker, and we will put boom in it."
And after that we will exchange there bags.
Then we will have 900000/-.
And he will have the boom.
And by pressing the remote.
How can i do this.
I don't know how to press the remote.
He is big rascal.
He is trashing him with boom to have his money.
You stuff has also trash by him.
Should i shoot him right here?
Will we trash him in his style.
Means with boom?
Yeah.
And now there is no tension of getting same to same bag.
Really Bhai you have.
What?
Bag Bhai (brother).
This boom can blush even by touching hand.
What shall i do?
Put it in this.
"Now let me go, let me go Papa."
Papa?
"He is saying Papa just like us, Papa."
Papa we should took on photo.
"Sir, what are you doing, it will blast."
"Sir, do you also want to put bag in safe deposit."
I used to... act out.
Patrick was popular.
He'd ditch his girlfriend after games and we'd go down to the pier.
"Well, under it."
Did you and Patrick reunite for old times' sake ?
No.
"Michelle, Patrick incurred a suction bruise on his neck antemortem."
What's that mean ?
It means whoever gave him the hickey did so before his murder.
Perhaps during it.
Now we swabbed the area around his neck to check for DNA.
Would you care to give us a sample for comparison ?
Patrick was so cute.
I just wanted to experience that feeling again.
- Okay...
Okay !
- Come on.
Still like that ?
"Oh, you know it."
"But to him, I was still a skank."
Hear that ?
I requested our song.
We didn't have a song.
Come on.
Let's go out there and dance.
"What, in public ?"
Are you kidding me ?
I didn't take you out in public in high school.
Why would I start now ?
"If someone killed him, I can't say I'm sorry."
But it wasn't me.
Alexx...
Modified it how?
Not in a good way.
"Said he's a vet,right?"
Afghanistan?
- Maybe we crossed paths.
- l don't think so.
I wonder what he saw out there that made him like this.
You get to the good part?
You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?
The detonator and booster can't be separated from the main charge without triggering the fuse.
Designed it special for hotshots like you...
And me.
Anything that's put together can be taken apart.
And we ain't got nothing in common.
We'Il see.
- Can you do this?
- Yeah.
He's a punk.I got this.
All right.Here's the plan.
"On three,you're stepping off that mine."
Got to do it cleanly.Then get behind that blast wall.
- l can do that.
"- No,he's gonna need help."
He's been standing here for hours.His legs are dead.
I don't need you.
"As soon as he's off the plunger,I can find the back door to this thing and defuse the mine."
Let's go.
"All right,on three,you're hauling ass."
"One,two..."
Three!
My uncle says it'll come and take me
If I don't do my chores.
"He said that, huh?"
"Well, then, if we get rid of it, you've got nothing to worry about, you'll never have to do chores ever again."
- Really?
- Yes.
"Look, go away."
What?
"As far as we know, no one was taken last night, but it will strike, and soon."
We'll kill it before that happens.
You must be great at parties.
We're talking about a hundred square miles of forest here.
be patient.
Ronon's been going up against the wraith one on one for the last seven years.
"If anyone can track this thing, it's him."
"And exactly how is he going to do that, huh?"
It helps to have good hearing.
Right.
Carry on.
What about you?
You sensing anything?
I'm not sure.
What do you mean?
There is a presence here... but it is different.
I cannot quite explain it.
It's in there.
Ronon!
Damn it.
It's in there.
- Was it wraith?
- Yeah.
- You see it?
"Well, I think it's way too soon to start packing up our desks."
Come on.
You know he's gonna bring in his own people.
"No, we don't."
we haven't even met him yet.
He might want to keep things intact.
Seriously?
And not clean house?
He's throwing out merc's toilet.
Mm.
Stop it.
We need to stay positive.
I have a good feeling about this.
You do?
I don't.
"Well, I really do."
I am so fucked.
No way this guy isn't gonna clean house.
"Well, you haven't even met him yet."
I don't need to.
It's what I would do.
But you're brilliant at your job.
Why wouldn't he want to keep you?
Because I'm brilliant at it.
"Okay, you know what you mean, but..."
You never want someone who can do your job better than you can.
Why do you think I've got Andy and myra?
"Plus, if this guy finds out they offered me the job before him, forget it!"
Fucked!
"Normally, at this point,"
I would try and be encouraging...
"Yeah, no point in that."
[Shouting] Ah!
"Yes, Virginia!"
There is an escape clause.
Come on.
"You really had me going there for a while, you little devil, you."
You'll get changed.
You'll get all cleaned up.
"Oh, good idea."
I'll do that.
Right after I see Col. Potter and take the oath.
He was drunk.
He didn't know what he was doing.
"Sure, I did."
I was drinking.
"Look, Vickers caught Klinger with his heart down."
It'd be criminal of you to swear him in now.
- You just can't do it.
"- Slow down, Pierce."
The boy's not drunk now.
Let him have his say.
Face it.
I'm a poor kid off the streets.
The only real experience I have is hustling pool.
Now I have a chance to rise through the army's ranks and make something of myself.
"- Pretty sober thoughts, Pierce."
- Come on.
He's crazy.
Nobody but an idiot would ever reenlist.
I wonder if you can think of any exceptions to that rule.
Take your time.
I can wait.
I'm going to be here a while yet.
Roll down your window.
We have to tell him.
No.
"If he stops, it'll fall off."
"Even if he slows down, it'll fall."
The best thing for that fish would be... if he could just drive steadily... forever.
I guess these are his last moments of life.
Shall we say some words?
I didn't know you... but I want you to die knowing that you were loved.
I love you.
Hey.
It was on your roof!
.
We'll go in front of you!
- Pull in front of him.
- Okay.
We've got to keep him at a steady speed.
Just keep them steady.
"Oh, God."
That little girl is gonna have towatch it.
But at least they know.
At least we're all together on this.
"When me and Pam were first in love... we hated to be apart, even for an hour."
"Oh, yeah."
I had something like that once.
- A real fuck-a-thon.
- We just slept.
We loved to sleep when it was time to sleep.
Not sex.
"I mean, we had sex... but what we really loved was to sleep like babies all day long."
That sounds perfect.
I don't want to have to do this living.
Then we'll meet up and talk about it.
Otherwise we talk and talk and nothing ever happens.
That's why we have to take the initiative ourselves.
"Those who want to join, come with me to the entrance..."
The others can think about it.
"If a few came, I'd be happy."
Who here has a camera or a cell phone?
...
Stop...
Two steps to the right...
- Sit down!
Open your eyes!
They're for you.
They're pretty.
What do they eat... water?
You have to feed them.
I have to feed them?
We'll feed them.
They'll definitely die.
They'll last a little while.
So...
What's up?
How's it going with your marketing assistant?
What do you want?
Did you tell her your idea for a Christian community center?
Have a seat!
You know someone who can sing... female... pretty.
You mean Nora.
"You won't get Nora, she belongs to the hotel."
Make me a beer Angie!
"Well, that takes a while."
Then take your time!
- Norm.
- Take care.
Was a pleasure.
Take care.
- And...
- Be well.
"- I can, I will be."
"- Oh, well, don't look at that."
Jesus Christ.
You dick.
- Good one?
- Good enough.
Even looking at the girls here brings on a cascade of conflicting emotions.
They're always gonna want more than you're prepared to offer.
You remember that.
"You'll learn it yourself one day, if you haven't already."
What are you thinking about?
Are you thinking about what I just told you?
This place looks unforgiving.
Suffers in comparison to the guest room.
"Well, the offer's still on the table."
Don't sit on the car.
"Listen, this isn't the city."
They're a different breed of snob up here.
It's academia.
Academia nuts.
(LAUGHS)
I fail to understand the distinction.
"Yeah, I do, too, sometimes."
It's been really awful.
I consider you my good friend.
I appreciate that.
I'm cold.
It's actually about 110 in here.
There's no way it's warm in here.
- Do you really feel warm?
- You could grow tomatoes in here.
"Honestly, it is unbelievable."
"Well, I can't make it cooler for you."
"Well, we're taking the credit."
"No, we're taking the credit."
How about a compromise?
We'll take all the credit.
"- Well, perhaps we could split the bounty?"
- What bounty?
"Well, I'm guessing there's no bounty, but..."
"Dan, Amy, how are you?"
I'll take it from here.
- I want to take in Pierce.
"- Whoa, whoa."
"No, no, no."
We are not going into the White House and blowing our cover for this guy.
You can't come in.
That comes from the president.
"- Well, she's a bitch."
- I'll tell her you said hi.
"Hey, we got to get moving."
"Hey, you guys."
Long time no see.
"Jesus, Mike, they got you involved in this?"
You're the fucking press secretary.
Thank you.
That's what I've been saying.
I have no wish to be embroiled in this either.
- Good bye.
Hello.
Who was he?
The Tomaji parson lord.
Do you know it?
Sure.
It is can not to entrust it in nobody.
I have the pistol there always under my pillow.
"Shoot it if he is putting in his foot here once more, my Mariska"
"Well of course, major lord."
As if I would be exchanged kind Tót family.
I slept very well.
"Although I had bad dreams, but like that, as if I would be exchanged."
"We are very happy, major lord."
And this the air.
This silence.
This place is sound-proof.
Than the black velvet.
A guest of ours said it about him.
Yeah!
It is this punctually!
Than the black velvet.
Lõrinc lord's state a unfortunate railway reverse gear caused.
"Calm down, major lord!"
- You Sándor.
What you knock here?
- What should I do Lajos?
It is itching.
This rotten plaster is since 4 weeks on me.
"Than the malady, is itching so."
Well go then into the house or behind the house.
My own garden not i can do what I want?
Back off!
The man will kill you.
Kill you.
Understood?
"Yes, sir."
Hello.
- How are you?
- All right.
Your tie is crooked.
You just knocked everything crooked.
- How are my teeth?
- Your teeth are fine.
Perfume?
That's a first.
So I've been going over the possibles.
And I've been sniffing ten grand.
"Nothing in Artie's hit list suggests a multi-part object, which means we're looking for one thing and it should be in their possession."
Why?
It's Carson's rule of linear transfer.
It means they have to have it on them.
Forced outcomes require tangency.
Someone's been paying attention.
Some of us longer than others.
Let's assume that it's a single artifact shared by two suspects.
We each take one and we compare notes.
I'll take lady luck.
You take her date.
And I got these.
- I...
- What is it?
"I cleaned 'em with alcohol, all right?"
So...
"Yeah, and he'll be shooting after the windows go."
- It's the best we can do.
- All right.
Stand by.
"Turn it on, or I pull the trigger."
- I can't turn it on.
- Why not?
Why not?
- Because it has to be implanted.
- She's right.
The chip derives its power from tiny electrical impulses fired between neurons.
It has to be in your skin to work.
- I really gotta...
- Sit down!
You're not going anywhere.
See?
Dude actually had a chip in his arm.
"All right, it seems calm for now."
Reid's still on the train.
Now we have two agents in there.
It's probably the Higher Authority.
I told you.
I have protocols to follow.
I was supposed to go right back out there.
I have rules.
Answer the phone.
"You want me to stay, I'm obviously going to stay."
"But, I mean, you're going to be the one that has to explain it to the Man."
"Whoa, ""the Man""?"
"They're still trying to tell you what to do, Ted."
Why can't you all just leave me alone?
Leave you alone?
These are some numbers i'm thinking of playing.
"No, Malcolm, don't worry."
Nobody's gonna steal your numbers.
You'd be a fool not to.
These six numbers aren't just chosen at random.
"They're my own algorithm based on probability, emerging number patterns the theories of sir Isaac Newton."
Isaac Newton.
Really?
There's just six numbers.
You only buy one ticket a week?
That's all I need.
How many do you buy?
"Well, it depends."
20.
You're just shotgunning it?
Rookie move.
"Well, how much have you won?"
How much ever or how much this year?
Let's say ever.
Zero.
- It's not just about winning or losing.
- It's the lottery!
It's all about winning.
What else is there?
"The journey, Captain!"
It's how you get there.
I'd rather lose my way then win a $20 million jackpot your way.
Okay.
I think we're through here.
"You think you're pretty clever, don't you, Mr. Lottery expert?"
I've got news for you.
We've got your number.
There's no time.
You sure somebody's not yanking your chain?
There it is.
Ssr.
Don't move.
Don't think he can.
This is it.
We got the stark stuff.
That's like the whole haul.
"Ease up on that, will you?"
I don't want to end up inside out.
We're getting promotions out of this.
Why?
'cause we answered the phone?
This got handed to us...
again.
Somebody's wrapping this up like it was christmas.
Christmas?
"Well, hey, who doesn't love christmas?"
I'm gonna call chief.
I want every single box checked and signed in.
"Careful with that, boys."
"Hey, keep it sealed off!"
You got it!
Who's our new helpful friend?
Jerome zandow.
He had an act in a sideshow at coney island.
Petty crimes here and there.
Probably just muscle for hire.
Even muscle knows something.
"He had his hands on an arsenal of stark technology,"
But he just sat there with it.
Sit down.
You can't punch the leader.
"You are not a leader, okay."
You're a fuck up.
You've always been a fuck up.
I need you to calm down.
"Okay, we need to figure out a plan before that sick fuck comes home."
What about the skylight?
That's like 25 feet up.
"Even if we stand on each other's shoulders circus style, we won't be able to reach it."
We tried that already.
Text.
I thought you said the signals are blocked.
"I'll just ah, hit send and throw it to the skylight."
"It's a signal jammer, okay."
"We find the jammer, we kill it, then we call for help."
"Look, it's a new plan guys, all right."
"You guys, you sweep this are out here for the jammer,"
Blair and I will take the bedroom.
You don't tell me what to do.
Can you wait for me?
Riley.
Yeah.
Hey.
"I need you with us, okay."
We gotta find that jammer.
He's right.
No.
I'm a fuck up.
"No, you're not."
We all make mistakes.
"Look at me, I'm in deep with Timmy Song, right."
Let's get a coffee.
I don't want a coffee.
"Well, I do."
"So whatever character assassination you've got lined up for me, let's at least temper it with caffeine."
Who found her?
Some new lot just above us.
Had reason to pop into the loft and there was old fatty.
Only not so fat any longer.
Don't talk like that.
SHE SIGHS
The gossip on the street says it was a suicide.
"Come home, Peg."
We can't talk here.
I can't go back there.
I can't spend another night in that flat.
"Well, then we'll move."
"We'll put it on the market, we'll buy somewhere else."
"(It's not the flat, Elaine, it's you!"
)
(I can't be with you any longer!
)
Think very carefully about what you say next.
I've hired a van.
I'll be round on Friday to get what's mine.
You don't have to be there.
"In fact, it's better if you're not."
THUNDER
HE SIGHS
Most people miss first time.
You're going to be late.
SHOWER RUNS
KNOCKING
Yes.
Okay?
There he is.
I'm coming to get you!
Reserve a special cell for me.
I'll be right back after stabbing him!
Poor husband.
Can one man be the reason for destroying another?
The curse of husbands will not spare you.
Be careful.
- It's okay.
Is the inspector's phone ready?
It is ready.
- Give it.
Do you know the old actor 'Bagavathar'?
Yes.
- This is belongs his era.
Why is he still using it?
May be he has his sentiments about it.
We can fix that then.
"I'll fix wifi, bluetooth, and all features in this."
Why would you do that!
So he can track all my activities and be a pain?
Give me the phone.
Get the money from him.
"If the phone conks off again, take it to the museum."
Please don't bring it to my shop.
I'll pass the message to the inspector.
"Panju, if the victim was an outsider,"
He should have stayed in a hotel or at a lodge.
Why don't we enquire there.
I now know why we seem to set well together.
No rush.
They're bringing the horses around.
No rush?
I feel awful we stopped at all.
You swear you didn't do it for me.
Because I'm a terrible rider.
We've gained time on horseback
We never would have achieved by carriage.
But we needed rest.
The horses were about to drop as well.
"And, in truth, it may not matter."
My mother might already be dead.
Don't say that.
You might think
She deserves it after all she's done.
To mary.
I think even mary would say that's in the past.
It will be soon
If I can convince my father to spare her life.
"It's unbelievable, really."
What?
"If all goes well,"
Bash begins his life with mary and I get exile.
And my mother.
Not for long.
"I'll set her up somewhere, far away, with my brothers"
And then...
I'll be on to the next.
Where will you go?
I was thinking morocco.
You don't think you'd stand out in morocco?
Sweden then.
"Oh, please do."
Go ahead.
I shouldn't keep you longer.
Students who are willing to go to class!
"This way, Mr. Kaan."
You'd better cut your hair.
I don't want to see it like this again.
Who could give us the multiples of this?
"Yeah, take your time."
Take the chalk.
But I didn't raise my hand Professor.
- Excuse me?
- I didn't raise my hand.
You'd better answer this question before I divide you up by your multiples.
"Come on kid, come on."
Sit down!
Hey listen;
I have the voice of a dramatic soprano.
I am now an alto and do you know why?
Because I've lost my voice while making a demo.
But my album is being delayed.
How could this be?
Alright!
"Move it, move it."
I beg you.
"Dude, don't these teachers ever change?"
Do they always choose the ones who don't raise their hands?
That's their tactic.
"In Professor Fatma's class if you raise your hand, you're safe."
Really?
We'll see about that.
We're now doing geometry.
Why am I still alive?
I made a promise to your wife.
"""You killed her."""
- Do not.
That's what they want to make you believe.
Because you did?
Why did you take it from me?
Mara was my creator.
"She got me up, knew I was different."
She was my mother.
You do not have mothers!
The quarantine of the Federation did it for the test.
So that we begin to show genetic anomalies.
Anomalies that the superior command did not like.
Like what.
- Hair?
- Some of us.
"For others, like me, or more Advanced."
"We have developed the ability, to reproduce."
Your wife kept the secret for a long time.
"When she threatened, with scattering the secret."
The top command entered.
They wanted to keep it a secret.
At all costs
Stop!
They have no right...
Your investigation is over.
Dirty Noid-Bitch!
"No, you murdered her!"
I saw it with my own eyes!
I did not kill her!
I tried to save her.
Great.
Let's go this way.
How do you know it's that way?
[âª]
"All this time,"
And I don't know where to begin.
You can't just decide to change your life
And expect to make up for
All the ruined years of mine.
"No, you're right."
"I can't deny my past, andreas."
"What I did, I did."
But you were a fool
To take on the gural nataz.
You had what you wanted.
You knew the dagger and sheath
Would lead you to the astronomicons.
And they had you.
You still don't believe that
"I had exchanged them for you, do you?"
I understand your doubt.
My misdeeds have led to this.
"Physical scars change my appearance,"
But nothing compares to what has
Happened to me on the inside.
"All those days facing death,"
I came to realize that
Nothing mattered more to me...
Than you.
[âª]
Hello.
These symbols may very well describe
"His peers, his public."
They'd find out what kind of a husband he is.
Letting the great Gillian Booth rot away.
His vanity couldn't stand it.
"He'd, he'd... be shamed into action!"
"Yeah, as long as he was your husband, maybe."
I wonder what my partner is saying to him now.
What is she saying?
"Well, in that red file is a report of the search we did in your dressing room and the dental resin we found on the sink in your bathroom."
I think your husband's about to find out how he got that bite mark on his neck.
Please don't.
Stop her.
Don't let him see it.
Please stop her.
This should be interesting.
"Sneaky, pathetic bitch."
Frame me for murder.
How could she?
It was to blackmail you into a marriage.
I was duped.
- I want an annulment.
"- Yes, Philip."
File the papers today.
I'll call the movers.
I want her out of my home.
Every last trace of her.
I don't care if she dies in the gutter!
No!
"No, Philip!"
Don't say that!
"- He's leaving. / No, please."
"- Go talk to him, talk to him."

Director Kim.
The character who resembles me.
What is she like?
"- Well, she's rather simple."
- Just curious...
And honest.
"But she only sees as much as she can, so she's not that honest."
"Just simple and a bit abstract, which really doesn't suit her."
She easily falls for what others say.
"As well as for authority or success, that kind of thing."
I'm like that?
"No, she's just a character that I'm thinking of."
So that's what she's like.
I'd like to meet you occasionally and have nice conversations.
"Sure, let's do that."
"We drank too much, huh?"
I'm sorry.
I saw you a few days ago.
Sorry?
You were running around with a man and a woman chasing you.
- How did you see that?
- We were walking by.
I see.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
Director Kim asked me to join him for some sushi.
The food is delicious.
Really?
Why'd you go alone without telling me?
He called right after you left.
"Oh, I was just leaving."
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll buy you two new ones.
Jim!
Wait a minute.
"Warrant or no warrant, i'm going with you."
You stay here and keep me posted as to what's going on.
"Besides, somebody's got to look after josie."
"I'd rather not, jim."
"Do it for me, will you, nick?"
A lot of bad losers got hurt in this deal.
There's no telling what they're liable to do.
Tell josie everything will be all right.
You'll hear from me tomorrow.
Don't forget your books.
Uncle daniel.
There's jail for you on every page.
Ohh!
"Good luck, jim."
Where's fisk and drew?
"They were expecting you, so they're not here."
All right!
Who is this fellow?
What's your name?
Boyd.
Have you got a warrant for him?
"No, sir."
You ought to have a warrant for everybody that ever worked for drew.
"Sorry i can't oblige you, commodore."
They slipped out through the alley.
Seal that vault.
"Yes, sir."
"You're only sealing a memory, commodore."
Just like falling off a log...
Only further.
Watch the red light.
"Action stations, Number One."
"Come on now, action stations."
"All right, I'll tell you what I'll do."
I'll jump first so I can show you what a piece of cake looks like.
Open doors.
"Sergeant, take over as dispatcher."
Right.
To think we get paid extra for this.
Quite the swindle if you ask me.
Stand by.
Green light on.
Go!
Just like falling off a log.
"Action stations, Number Two!"
"Come on now, any one of you."
"Come on now, this is an order."
Do you hear me?
"If you don't jump now, you'll never make it later."
"Action stations, Number Two."
Take your hands off me or I'll drag you with me.
That's more like it.
"Action stations, Number Three."
Gol
Number Four.
Go!
# Now come sit by my side If you love me
# Do not hasten to bid me Adieu
# Just remember the poor parachutist
# Who is doing his job just for you
I will destroy the jedi.
I'll show you.
You have failed me for the last time.
You are no longer my apprentice.
And now you shall die.
"Thank you, Artoo."
That's quite enough.
"Ventress, you're not looking well."
She never does.
"You have failed, Ventress, surrender."
Never.
"Yes, my lord."
Ventress is battling the jedi on board the command ship.
Turn your guns on our command ship and open fire.
"But, my lord,"
"I calculate that will destroy, Ventress, the jedi, and all our forces."
Precisely.
- We're in position.
- Open fire.
That is correct.
Calculate your flight path to terminate in the main hangar.
It's over.
"Anakin, look out!"
We have to get out of here.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
The command ship has been destroyed.
Our scanning indicates there are no survivors.
Your work there is finished.
Recall the fleet.
"But how far can you run when you are on a plate, covered in butter, wearing a pink tutu?"
- No!
- And a sombrero!
And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
No!
Please!
"Please, I'll switch to pancakes."
And the donkey was never seen again.
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No.
You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't.
- I did.
No!
Anything but that!
No!
The end.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
"It worked, didn't it?"
Who's next in our little contest?
Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
OK.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
"Yeah, whatever."
You had your chance.
Now then.
"Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street, in this house."
"A man had come as a last resort, because... no one else would go near the place."
I hear you've been expecting me.
It's okay.
Why are you saying she's my wife?
.
I don't even know her.
I know it's hard for you to believe.
But this is true.
Joy is your wife.
You love her so much.
Your memory will come back soon.
"But for the meantime, we're just here for you."
Recognize Joy.
So you will remember her.
...as her husband.
"Adel, is this serious?"
.
You had a speedy recovery Migs.
Just a little more therapy...
But expect some disorientation...
That's just a part of your recovery process.
"As of now sir, we just have to wait."
We can't tell when his memory will come back.
"What we can advise is, don't let him get too stressed."
"But Doc, what do we have to do?"
Those he can remember.
Why don't you and Migs stay over at our place for now?
.
In his room.
Because he might get more confused if you lived there in your new house.
We'll just go home.
I'm his wife.
I'll take care of him until his memory returns.
-But Joy...
Two aliens have orgasms.
They don't even have bodies.
Oh!
You're an alien in this country.
And I wouldn't certainly complain about your body.
Do sit down.
Well being a German alien and a scientist.
What do you think about German alien orgasms?
I want you now.
That's too good.
What's your hurry?
I'll do anything you want.
Do you want to hit me?
You are sick.
"Sure I'm baby, I've got so many problems with my brain it's a real pain in the ass."
"Ho, yeah."
"Look stop, I'm gonna come."
"Give it to me, baby, give it to me."
"come on , come on."
Suppose orgasms are killing people.
What would you say about a person who had multiple orgasms?
I would say this person is very sick.
And would you be interested into studying such a person?
Being a scientist?
And German alien?
Come on...
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
"I'm sorry, I can't stay, I must go with, she's in great danger."
I'm sorry.
Shit.
"Excuse me, do you know anybody here by the name of Adrian?"
You can never get to grips with that.
"The asshole who killed him, is still walking around free."
If he's still alive.
He'd be way over 60 now.
You're so quiet.
I've nothing else to report.
I had to be in the area for work.
Insurance.
"Because I read about Ben in the newspaper, I wanted to see you."
Just for sentimental reasons.
We'll have to believe you came for me.
And not to sell me an insurance policy.
"-No, for you."
But I have to go now or I'll be late for my appointment.
Want my arm?
Come by when Bram's home.
He'd like that.
I sure will.
"Well, by then."
Well done.
How did you know?
-The sun didn't bother you.
You didn't blink.
I wasn't thinking of that.
Was it an accident?
-No.
My retina suddenly started to come off.
It happened within 2 hours.
Irreparable.
The specialist said it was a reaction to the war.
Stress and anxiety.
That those bastards are still ruining your life after all these years.
"please, calm down."
"But this is still an advanced, liberal society, as far as I know."
"The police aren,t standing behind me, so I can say -"
"Let him talk, BonaIoi."
You see?
Stop it!
"Watch out, or I,II hit you!"
"Don,t try that again!"
"You,re all brawn, no brain!"
Stop it!
Bastard!
"Okay, okay."
I lost my temper.
Thanks.
I noticed.
"I,m sorry."
"Oh, don,t start whining!"
I was mad.
"I didn,t mean it."
Did I hurt you?
Come on.
"I,d like to thank our guests."
"Good night, viewers."
until next time.
"Paris, whore of the world"
"It,s been confirmed that general Pinochet remains in critical condition."
"His family is with him, and we hope to have better news soon."
"Our model couple has now been ,in orbit, and under constant surveillance for three weeks."
No ill effects to report.
Quite the opposite.
"However, the City of the Future has hit some snags."
The project has stirred up local opposition:
I thought about my wife with a slime like you.
"- All right, buster..."
- Stay out of this.
Smearing you across the front pages is not enough.
Scum like you shouldn't be allowed to live.
You're gonna die.
"Stan, stop it."
Stop it.
Help him.
He'll kill him.
I can't believe it.
I'm rid of him.
It's perfect.
We just call the police and tell them it was self-defence.
Are you crazy?
That's the one thing we can't do.
But why not?
He was trying to kill you.
I'm a witness.
Shut up and listen.
Connie will take care of it.
You just go home.
Do whatever it is you'd normally do.
Just act as if nothing happened.
"When he doesn't come home tonight, call his brother, ask him where he is."
"When he says he doesn't know, act worried."
"Don't call the police until 2, maybe 3 in the morning."
Tell them anything you want to except that he came here.
You understand?
What are you gonna do with him?
He'll just disappear.
"Police will look for him a few months, then give up."
Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you for having me.
Are you ready to get out there and turn some laps?
I'm ready as I'll ever be.
Is that fair?
'Cause I know you like to drive fast on your own.
Yeah.
"I mean, in my own car, in the safety and dangerousness of real traffic."
We will see you in the hangar when you're done.
Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Lake Bell!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Let's get some air going here.
Wood:
"Now, the fastest lap time is 139.3, set by Stephen Moyer."
[ Engine revving ] Let's see how Lake can do.
And now to shift gears.
Looking good so far.
Little tap on the brakes.
Keep it serious.
Keep it really serious!
Good focus.
"Car looks composed so far, heading down in towards the teardrop."
[Bleep]
"Looking good, not super-fast through there."
And there's a thousand people there.
I hope I don't.
"Oh, my God."
That's a lot of people to be looking right at me as I...
don't shift.
But this is where people make up a lot of time.
I thought I'd cover all the major food groups.
"So sorry about this, Rambo."
"It's cool, man, it's Dad's money."
He won't even notice.
You ever had mice?
"We have, but more as an infestation than a delicacy."
So is Daddy properly loaded?
"Er...yeah, I guess so."
"He owns, like, a shipping company and a sawmill thing and a marble..."
whatever it's called - hole?
Quarry?
Yeah!
And the grain company.
The grain company that we work for?
He owns that?
Yeah.
"Well, I actually own it now."
He kind of gave it to me.
Boom!
"Well done, Rambo."
"Well, sort of."
"I'd much rather be working at the shipping place, to be honest."
But I sort of burnt my boats there after the er...fire.
"So Dad moved me to grain, which is obviously super lame!"
But at least I met you guys.
Nice mice.
The spoilt brat has the whole company.
"When I was his age, I didn't even have pubes."
Really?
You said he was 16?
"Yeah, I was a late starter."
"The point is, this kid can force Flavia to get me a new chair."
This is who he hires?
What?
Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.
It's the guy you'd hire.
"Look, you remember Emilio?"
"Okay, this dude got Emilio off, like, twice."
Okay?
"Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo."
"And then, poof."
Dude is like Houdini.
"Seriously, when the going gets tough you don't want a criminal lawyer."
"You want a ""criminal"" lawyer."
Know what I'm saying?
"Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White."
Badger is way too loyal to roll.
"Plus, he's scared shitless of me, all right."
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap so, worst-case scenario, you know, they plead him out."
He does five months picking up litter in an orange jump suit.
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
"We'll flip for it, all right?"
Call it.
So damn long ago.
Don't you even think of going back...
The ruins will make you cry.
I still can't believe it- look at us!
Why?
What's wrong?
We inherited barstools...
I prayed so hard that you would return from Munich.
Your prayers worked...
You finally got me divorced.
Just joking.
It has nothing to do with you.
It didn't work out and we got divorced...
Feel this!
This golden fabric is so nice.
My sistercalled last night.
Mom?
They must have come for you again.
I'm going to turn myself in.
Don't be ridiculous!
But this is no kind of life...
I have to hide until it gets dark.
It's not only you.
Everybody's got issues with cops in this country...
If you talk to mom don't mention anything about Murat.
Don't worry!
"What are you going to make for me, sweetheart?"
We'll think of something...
Look at this mess!
"I have to go to school, mom."
Didn't we send you here for your brother?
"But, I did clean that spot..."
I'm such a mess...
"On the other hand, I'm sure you chose right."
You're fine.
That's what the doctor says.
But it's not true.
You know I've always envied your job?
The music?
To me it's like magic.
Of course I have a terrible hearing.
There's nothing to envy about.
"It's just a hobby, not a job."
The composer who doesn't perform is nothing but an amateur.
I thought you were fine in Germany.
Yes...
Well that was before the sanitarium.
What sanitarium?
Didn't you know?
Everybody knows it!
I spent two years in a madhouse.
I didn't know at all.
Yes.
But what happened to you?
I had a screw loose I guess.
But know you feel better?
"Besides, you know, the crazy ones are the most intelligent."
It's a shame that no one else thinks that way.
You shouldn't care.
"Of course I care, unfortunately."
"Well, I'm fine now."
I have a couple of projects.
Even though I only need an orchestra.
But apart from that I'm practicing some songs.
Take these guys.
I'll get your ship back.
"No, no, no."
We're going to themaru.
At least that ship works.
I'm in a bad mood.
And we're out.
"Nothing nearby on sensors,"
Although local gravitational forces
And multi-Spectral energy readings
Are consistent with a solar system.
"Dylan, i can't find a slip-Point."
"Well, there's only one way"
To find a slip-Point
Force whoever's onandromeda
To make one.
"Beka, bring us around."
We're going to play a little game of chicken.
Here we go.
Let's see who flinches first.
"Rhade, bucky cables on standby."
Bucky cable range in three... two... one.
Bucky cables as offensive missiles.
Okay.
Bring us around for another pass.
Targetandromeda with whatever weapons we've got
And hit her hard.
You know i'm double billing you for this.
Huh.
Ship to ship.
This is captain dylan hunt.
"Surrender, and you won't be harmed."
But you have to tell her.
You owe her and you owe me.
She doesn't give a shit.
You are so infuriating.
Is that the language you use in this house?
I just think that it would be good if you told her.
"If you don't, I will."
I'm going to see what's going on.
We thought he was dead.
- We didn't think he existed.
- You're still lying.
"No, I'm not lying."
Jørgen tried to find him in India lots of times.
He never reacted and so we assumed that he wasn't...
"- I don't have time for this, Mom."
"- Jacob was a big, immature child!"
He fucked everything with a pulse.
He was drinking himself to death.
He did drugs.
"He had grand ideas, but did nothing."
"He probably means well, but you can't trust him."
"- He wants to save everyone, but..."
- I don't care if he's fucked a goat.
I have a right to know who my father is.
- You can't manipulate people like that.
- We're not.
Fuck off and leave us alone!
Not right now.
You're far out.
What's Jørgen's reaction?
Anna?
- Should I come along?
Come on.
Get to work.
You'd think they'd feed you more if they expect you to do all this work.
That's what Eric said.
He always gave me half his rations.
Refused to eat them himself.
If he'd eaten more...
He's gone.
My team must have taken care of it.
We're gonna need a new plan.
- There's always Death Valley.
- No.
What's Death Valley?
That's Death Valley.
- See that door on the other side?
- Yeah.
It takes you to the front gate.
- If that's the only way...
- We're completely exposed.
"Also the barbed wire, searchlights, guard tower."
Goons can see everything from up there.
We'd be fish in a barrel.
It's out of the question.
You need to call your people off.
We're better off with the tunnel.
Your tunnel will take months to finish.
You could be relocated before it's ready.
"But if it works, we can get everybody out."
"Two hundred of you, running around the forest?"
"No papers, no clothes, no place to hide?"
You'll be hunted like dogs.
"Yeah, it's risky."
"European third type, that."
I have a job for you.
Mickey goes wrong.
She lost the joy of living.
We transmit life if he continues with that woman.
"Take it away, do it for me."
"If it is not cheerful, Mickey's not a dick."
"I do not want to see him, I do not want them both!"
"I do not want, no, no!"
"Purposes before, and now blames me?"
"- The love for piety, Mickey ..."
- I pity you did not?
- The love for pain.
- I love her and that was it.
- You will comply.
- Respect for the cemeteries!
You will not ever.
To have you in their hands has taken this empty apartment here in front.
"Okay, your part to exterminate the Venini you have done, but we still have three to go to the bottom."
You feel?
Now it is you who will flee.
Mickey is not the brute that you think.
I do not think anything.
You ... it is difficult to get wrong.
"In order to kill, should be a woman."
Wrap the blade in silk.
- Won't feel anything.
- No.
You.
Get in there.
No. ..
"We are like children, Prince."
We're in the same boat now.
There's no way out for us.
Don't let me see you again.
Inspector Li!
Five dead witnesses.
- It was him.
- Are you sure?
Show his picture.
Ask the neighbors if he was here.
Okay.
No regrets
No remorse
Let bygones be bygones
No signs of melancholy
No tears ofself-pity
I don't care about what's right or wrong
I'm not sentimental about the past
Just set me free from this reverie
For the pain lingers on
It dwells deep in my heart and soul
Only time will tell
Ifwe are meant for each other
My tears and laughter are my own indulgence
"Inspector, you hit the nail on the head."
The neighbors say he lives here.
Are you nuts?
Jenny!
"Jeffrey, is that you?"
Why don't you come back?
I'll be back this morning.
We're moving to a new home.
Why?
"I mean, it wasn't a problem."
I really didn't think about it.
"I mean, I did think about it, and I thought..."
maybe what you were saying wasn't so wrong.
"- No, it was really wrong."
- Why?
And I just want to let you know that if it will make you feel better...
I'm just going to make it real clear that...
I don't have any real interest in you or anything.
You know.
So they'll stop saying all that.
"That I barely even know you, which is of course true..."
"and that basically, you and I mean nothing to each other."
So that should solve the problem.
Thanks.
"It's the least I could do, you know."
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing out here?
It's what I always do. I can't make it through a whole day in there.
- l know what you mean.
- Yeah.
What do you need to hide from?
Your life is perfect.
I'm serious. I would give anything to have your life.
My life is so pathetic.
You have this great house.
Parents that are there.
No one bothers you at school.
"Rickie, I need to talk to you about the gun."
Don't.
"That equipment will bring back anyone for a while, but long term..."
It was my fault.
"I am responsible for what happened to Clara, she was in my care!"
What is the point of blaming yourself?
None.
Because she's going to live.
Hello.
"They all think I'm going to die, don't they?"
And I know you're going to live.
How?
I never know how.
I just know who.
The green lady... she said you were the saver of worlds once.
Are you going to save this one?
"If I do, will you come away with me?"
Yes.
Well then.
Merry Christmas.
I have in my hand a piece of the Ice Lady.
Everything you need to know about how to make ice people.
Is that what you want?
See you at the office.
"So then, Doctor, saving the world again?"
Might I ask why?
Are you making a bargain with the universe?
You'll save the world to let her live?
Yes!
"And don't you think, after all this time and everything I've ever done, I'm owed this one?"
I don't think the universe makes bargains.
It was my fault.
Well then.
Better save the world.
"Gosh, he's a big one."
Good grief.
"So what's the plan then, what do we do?"
"We will try to measure them, we will tie them up and then..."
So you kind of hog-tie them and then attach some device...
A GPS device?
Radio telemetry.
"Right, radio telemetry."
Shall we try?
You can try.
"You can feel it, can't you?"
It's being hog-tied.
It's like a chicken when you...
Measurement's beginning now.
Head width 14.5.
Follow the line of the tail.
Two and 2/3 metres - wow!
What's the next stage?
The next stage is to attach the transmitter.
"We'll see, it's probably thick enough."
That's working.
So this is fine tune.
"OK, keep the leg like this, even though it's already released."
It's a tough animal.
And then we release them in the three count like that.
"One, two, three and then everybody just go!"
"Right, OK, ready."
"Wait a second, we've just got rope on the..."
Just undoing the tape around the...
Just undoing the tape on the snout.
Got it.
Unwind.
Then leave the rest of the world for me.
"What, Muraaki?"
Can you only fight?
Only the one who can fight can love.
Can fight for love.
Can die for love.
What is going to happen tonight?
Is the sky going crazy?
Don't question nature.
This is happening..
..because you are about to belong to me forever and forever.
Such a ferocious storm happens only once in a thousand years.
There will be only one Saiba and Jilaan in a thousand years.
The moon shall yield a sword.
You are the moon and I am a dark night.
How did I get so attached to you?
Trust your heart.
Does your heart beat to my name?
How would it?
Muraakis don't possess a heart.
Saiba belongs to me.
And she shall always belong to me.
I had said so.
You shall die in Paathar's waters.
So Muraakis don't possess a heart?
We gave you a heart and then stabbed it.
We killed you with deceit.
Saiba did.
"No trust, no love."
"Don't commit this sin, Kaabir."
Don't.
It is no sin to kill for love.
Athos saw me.
There's no going back now.
"My dear fellow, that would be treason and foolhardy."
Louis is already dying.
"I hope you are not having doubts, Feron?"
You are asking me to kill my own brother!
"If you don't, then he will discover your betrayal and hang you."
"And if he doesn't, I will hang you!"
Thank you.
You will kill Aramis and the King.
Very well.
(LAUGHS)
"Now we found a nice spot in the shade, we can wait."
Properly.
"Come on, come on."
"That's it, good... (WHISPERS) Please be good, please be good, please be good."
(SNIFFS)
"Oh, this could turn out to be a good day after all."
I imagine the General's aide will be a little while longer yet.
(LAUGHS)
"How many battles did we fight, eh?"
(CHUCKLES)
- Too many.
- Hmm.
Yeah.
"We've served our country, often and well."
"So if we are rewarded with the odd mission like this,"
I won't complain.
"In that case, I'd like to propose a toast."
"To easy missions, well earned."
To easy missions well earned.
Ooh.
I don't feel anything.
Put this in your mouth.
Keep it there.
This tells your temperature.
"When the red light goes on, that's your temperature."
I don't want it.
A disorder of the nerves.
At least we think it is.
We don't know yet exactly how it works.
It's often seen in early adolescence.
She shows all the symptoms.
Hyperactivity.
Her temper.
Performance in math.
Yeah.
Why the math?
What is that?
It affects her concentration.
Ah-ha.
"-Now, this is for Ritalin."
-Okay.
Ten milligrams a day.
Is that a tranquilizer?
It's a stimulant.
A stimulant?
"My God, she's higher than a kite now."
Her condition isn't quite what it seems.
Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic behavior in a child.
The Ritalin seems to work to relieve the condition.
"And as to how or why, we really don't know."
"But, uh, her symptoms could be overreaction to depression."
That's out of my field.
"You basically ran into the vehicle, right?"
No no no no no!
You're not married nor do you have any children.
What a stupid question to ask.
Don't say that.
My colleague is a good doctor and you'll go and finish your ward round.
"So, you're a hawker."
What are you doing exactly?
"It's really nice of you to sit here with me, Doc."
I wanted to...
The others keep asking when the bandages will be taken off of my arm.
"It will become stiff otherwise, right?"
You got a strong hand.
Squeeze firmly!
Good.
"- You're a real man, Biberkopf."
"- I am, I am."
It was a tragic accident.
You had a fractured skull and we couldn't save your arm.
"Oh, my arm is gone."
Th-thank you for letting me know.
Well.
You don't have such a great job either.
You have to walk around telling people those things.
"Yes, that's just part of the job."
"Now, you'll be getting up soon."
- Tomorrow?
"- No, a few more days."
- But it could work tomorrow.
- No no no.
But I can't stay here much later or my business is screwed.
I need to get up really soon.
- Say some things you don't like.
- Shut up.
- I'm bored!
"- Look, surveillance is boring."
"There's a pair of jays in that tree, if you look."
Big thrill.
You know who really loves the countryside?
Nonces.
Makes it easier to grab the kids.
You always hear about weird shit like that happening in places like this.
That's more like it.
"That's the undercover's wife, Caroline Risdale."
Ticking my boxes.
I'd go under the covers with her but there's only thing that comes before a lady.
Me dinner.
I'm starving.
I'd eat those two jays in a sesame seed bun.
"I'll get us something to eat, then we can work in shifts."
- Why?
- Because I may garrotte you myself.
"Don't be like that, John."
"Come on, mate."
- What kind of bag?
- I dunno.
A bag bag.
"- A suitcase, an overnight bag...?"
- That's it.
An overnight bag.
He goes out for a jog like you said and... he comes back out with a bag.
What was I supposed to do?
Did anything happen to spook him?
- Did he see you?
Into the jungle!
- Hurry up!
Run away!
- I'm staying with you.
Idiot!
Do you want to die?
"Just drop everything and hide, for God's sake!"
We must help them.
We can't stand by and watch.
They're going to kill everyone.
"- We must do something, for Christ's sake!"
- We must go.
I can't jeopardise our plan.
"I know you don't understand, but more people would die than those whom we can't help right now."
I can't just stand by and watch.
I'm going back to the village.
"Right, let's continue."
Mum!
Mum!
- Dad...
- Be quiet!
Take him away from here.
"Come on, let's get back."
"Capitán, we've searched the entire village."
There's not a single guerrillero among the dead.
They've managed to escape.
"Once they're in the jungle, we'll never catch them."
Those bastards are creeping away like millipedes.
"Carry on, but don't take any prisoners."
"My patience is nearly exhausted, Silveira."
These leaflets are flooding the country.
It is your job to prevent that.
WOMAN:
"Oh, my God."
It's okay.
Come on!
I'll take care of you.
Come on.
MARY:
It's okay.
Keep coming.
I'll take care of you all.
Come on.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Keep coming.
I'll take care of you.
Come on.
( laughs )
ALLIE:
Miss Crawford.
I'm ready to go with you now.
Little girl...
I love the way your mind works.

The Conquest Of The Pole
The conquest of the North pole Fantastic aerial journey over north sea and north pole.
Fantastic film in two parts.
Part I
The scholars of the whole world meet to discuss a means for the reaching of the north pole.
A delegation of Suffragettes seeks to interrupt in vain the serious work of the meeting
"The meeting selects the committee, which will have the honor to take in the marvelous airplane of professor Klaps Platz"
"The professor demonstrates his flight apparatus, which is to reach the glaciers of the north pole"
What did you do?
What did you do?
Answer me!
Why are we here?
No one should live like this.
Drugged in a fucking tank!
It's for your own good.
it's not!
You're waiting for me to die.
I don't wanna fight but there's things we need to discuss.
What things?
would it be considered nagging if I was to repeat my previous observation that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures?
It's what the guy gave me.
Wasn't in a position to make demands.
I almost died this morning.
That seizure was...
It was barely a minute.
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.
You're less affected.
You know he needs a higher dose.
And I know you got more money squirreled away.
That money's to get us out of here.
not us.
You and him.
You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.
"Sun"" is the keyword."
I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu.
Do you?
and making him spotted dick.
Found this in your pocket.
Adamantium.
"If my guess is right, his next victim is here amongst us."
- Who?
- You only!
"You gave an interview to TV9 channel, right?"
Is there any rule that your guess will come true?
He took charge and shot him.
Check thoroughly and kill without missing him.
"All your search is in vain, because I'm his next target."
He'll definitely come for me.
"I shot a bullet into him, right?"
He likes challenge.
He'll definitely counter attack me.
"Somebody gave this for you, sir."
"I'm going to rob Rs.20 crores from him in an hour, be ware!"
"We have an hour only, we must find who is he."
Inform all TV channels.
Fast!
Who is he?
Doctor?
Politician?
Who are you man?
I'm a peon in Revenue office.
Remember that while doing your duty.
It seems you refused to do household work.
Why are you so proud?
"Sir, madam..."
"Don't talk, go get me a tea."
Rs.20 crores?
!
Who is the mad man to say that?
"We don't have time, tell us the truth."
"I beg you sir, please leave me."
I'm fine.
Your son is arrived from London.
- Father...
- John...
You will see in my will the estate of Norland was left to me in a way -
- That prevents me from dividing it between my two families.
"Norland, in its entirety, is therefore yours by law."
And I am happy for you and Fanny.
"But your stepmother, my wife and daughters are left only 500 a year."
Barely enough to live on.
Nothing for the girls' dowries.
- You must help them.
- Of course.
You must promise to do this.
"I promise, Father."
I promise.
Help them?
What do you mean?
"I mean to give them 3,000."
The interest will be an extra income.
- The gift will fulfil my promise.
- Without question.
More than amply.
One had rather.
On such occasions.
do too much than too little.
"Of course, he did not stipulate a particular sum."
"What do you say to 1,500, then?"
What brother would be so kind to his real sisters.
Let alone half-blood?
- They can hardly expect more.
Girl's gotta have some secrets.
- To mysteries.
- To solving them.
Damn it.
Yes.
The bidders have arrived.
Let's get going.
I have to go...
And so do you.
So soon?
Some things are not meant to be.
A flower?
"Yeah, but check out the tube."
It's the exact same thing we found in Amanda's cabin.
"You guys, don't tell me, we uncovered a cartel of evil florists?"
"Bos, can you get a match on the flower?"
Already tried.
Got nothing.
- How wide was your scan?
- Seven continents.
"Whatever that flower is, it's one-of-a-kind."
Roman's guarding his lucite-encased corsage tighter than a kid on prom night.
It was important enough to make Amanda disappear.
And to make Roman break a date with you.
That says something.
I don't like it.
"Too many pieces, not enough puzzle."
We need a connection.
You said Roman got a call?
Yeah.
"It was kind of a mood-killer, actually."
"Someone told him the bidders were here, and that's when he grabbed his keycards and split."
Did you sleep well?
I made some breakfast.
I'd have made some for you as well but... that was the last of the bacon.
Are they always this noisy upstairs?
I like it.
People enjoying themselves.
Helps me get to sleep.
"They're Colombians, I think."
"So, what happens now, Calum?"
About what?
I'm sorry.
I forget you need a bit of extra help sometimes.
Yesterday?
I was dragged here from prison.
Do you remember that?
You were nearly garroted.
"Oh, that!"
They wouldn't have gone through with it really.
"Just their idea of a little kinky game, was it?"
Yeah.
"I'm a bit worried he likes me too much, actually."
"And so when are they gonna turn up again, Calum?"
"Oh, don't worry."
Lenny'll be back soon.
"And that's what he does, by the way."
Turns up.
"Doesn't always knock, either."
"So, make sure you're not doing any washing up naked."
"You'll be wanting to see your sister after this, I expect."
"You've not even met your niece yet, have you?"
Is that allowed?
Course it is.
Tell him to go the fuck away!
That's what she says.
I just want to talk to you for a minute!
"Tell him, no, he's an asshole."
"That, too."
Don't even start.
I didn't say anything yet.
I know what you're gonna say.
"No, you don't."
Bullshit.
"First, you'll deny it."
Then you'll lie about it.
"Then you'll say you're sorry and swear it'll never, ever, ever happen again."
Then it happens again.
You're making my sauce?
I'm making sauce.
Put the butter in yet?
"No, 'cause it's not your sauce."
It's better with the butter.
I'm not putting your fucking butter in.
"Hey, I get it."
You're mad.
But don't blame the butter.
"Look, this whole D.U.I. thing is bullshit."
You were arrested for driving drunk with our kids in the car.
"Well, when you say it like that, yeah, it sounds terrible."
I had a couple glasses of champagne.
You tell me you never had a few drinks and then drove the kids?
I know you did.
You just never got caught.
"Yeah, well, not anymore."
I haven't had a drink in six weeks.
Lay down on the operating table.
You are going to me to anaesthetise?
no?
One does not worry.
We already are.
In question?
Biliary vesicle.
You want to see the x-rays?
It does not matter.
"Once open, which does not go exempt it."
"A little while, it excuses..."
You quiet.
The patient does not have to speak.
It wants that to me it puts nervous and that it does a cut to him in zigzag?
So that the biliary vesicle.
You want to indicate to me where is?
Ah... here.
Wonderful.
Perforation of the stomach hemorrhage and in half an hour bushes to the patient.
congratulations.
Stupid!
idiot!
More above.
More above.
Cicchirini.
Moron I here to it say only.
"It seems to me right, Professor, nobody says ""idiot"" like you."
"Thanks, idiot."
Well?
we are going to find that vesicle or we postponed the operation for morning?
"Yet this mess, would be better."
-Quit!
I thought we're being honest here.
"You got some balls, you know that."
All of you.
"You want to talk about self-control, how about you, Sil?"
Fucking every slut working in the place when you got a wife and kids.
"Or you, Paulie."
Remember last winter in the woods with the Russian guy?
I am warning you!
"There he goes, Mr. Type A personality."
We're talking about you killing yourself with drugs!
Not my fucking personality!
-Right.
-I'm going to kill myself?
"The way you eat, you'll have a heart attack before you're 50."
-Sit down.
-You're talking to the boss.
"Good, maybe someone will smack some goddamn sense into him!"
"Great, my own mother."
"Fuck you, you fucking whore!"
Son of a bitch!
"Guys, please!"
Come on!
Stop it!
Excuse me.
How's he doing?
I'm a relative.
He slipped off the kitchen counter spraying for ants?
He was wearing socks.
-Are you aware that he has a drug problem?
-Really?
The man has a hairline skull fracture.
"We'll admit him, keep him overnight."
"Mr. Goode, no matter where this ends up, I want you to know, justice was done here today."
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
Congratulations.
"I am rarely speechless, but I am speechless."
Thank you.
Thank you both.
It's not over yet.
"They're going to drag this out in appeals, so..."
I thought it was going against us.
Sometimes fate smiles.
"Will, are you standing or sitting?"
Which one do you want me to be?
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
Do you know what this means?
That we can pay off our balloon payment.
And dodge the executioner for another quarter.
If you get a settlement.
Where's Canning at?
He'll appeal.
For effect.
$25 million should motivate him.
"Peter, you okay?"
We have a problem with the house.
We?
"Uh, Jackie."
She paid ten percent in cash on the down payment.
"Apparently, she was bidding against someone."
Me.
She was bidding against me.
So I'm planning on going ahead with the purchase and then flipping the house in a few months.
"Well, I am, sir, aren't I?"
"- Nothing to worry about, sir."
"- Oh, I'm sure there's not."
I'm inquiring about a missing cabinet last seen in her possession.
- I don't know if you know anything?
- I've no idea.
"Now, please..."
"- Well, won't you come in?"
"- Yes, thank you."
This is Lord...?
- How do you do?
"- And this is Miss, um...?"
This is a most genial gentleman from the police.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Will you have a glass of sherry?
"Well, I'm not supposed to on duty, if you'll pardon the... word... but a small one for medicinal purposes."
- Splendid.
- Yes.
"Well, for what we are about to receive..."
"Oh, Mumsie, need we flee the country?"
If we made a clean breast of it...
Murdering a stranger by mistake?
Go and finish off that trunk.
How you can use that of all trunks?
(Screams)
- Now what?
- It's...
It's Daddy Batty.
He would come!
Get rid of him.
"We're going on holiday, remember?"
"Well, let me in."
I don't know what's wrong with him.
"One second he was calming down and then the next-- well, where's the surgeon?"
He's back on the ship.
"Well, you better take care of my brother!"
"Yes, sir."
"Go, lad."
"Go now, lad."
Easy does it.
Put him on the table.
His throat's constricted.
Maybe he swallowed an insect and it stung him.
His only hope is if I can open his throat below the swelling.
"Well, do it!"
"If you have a god, pray to him now."
"If not, I suggest you get one quick."
The ghost pointed at him and now he's dead.
Shut up!
I'll take his body and bury him at sea.
And I trust ya to take care of things while I'm gone.
Of course.
I'll be back.
Haibal didn't have gunpowder when he crossed the alps.
He broke up rocks with fire and vinegar.
Shall I tell you how?
You always do this to me when I cannot get away.
What's wrong with expanding your horizons?
Makes my head hurt.
"Crusoe, you should stop worrying."
We have a plan.
I just want to go home.
"Hey, you should take a slug."
You should take it easy.
"Do us a favor, please?"
Could you turn the stage lights on again?
It's a child's dream.
"Turn the lights on, now!"
Do as she says.
We won't go at it again!
Not you.
You performed... you came.
I got what I could for you.
Did you like my acting?
I could smash...
Why did you tell me you kissed the earth I walk on?
You have to kill me!
"I am so tired, to rest, to rest!"
I am a seagull!
"No, that's not it."
I am an actress.
That's it!
He's there too.
Yes.
But that's nothing.
"He didn't believe in theater, he always used to mock my dreams, and I ended up not believing in them either, I lost my courage!"
"And then the turmoils of love, the jealousy, the constant fear for my little one."
"I was becoming petty, insignificant, my acting was stupid!"
"I didn't know what to do with my hands, didn't know how to stand!"
I couldn't control my voice!
You don't know what it feels like!
She's better than me.
Learn to carry your cross and keep your faith
"I have the faith, and I suffer."
It's ridiculous.
Chicks like this...
"Yeah, all right."
I'll get 'em.
Hmm.
I hope it won't be too heavy for you to carry.
- See youse later.
- All right.
"Say, uh, what do we need the nails and hammers for?"
"Well, the snow's disappearing fast."
We'll have to cache the sled later on and build a boat.
Oh?
"Say, uh, look-"
Yeah?
What is it?
"I, uh-"
I got something to tell you.
Maybe you better take it sitting down.
You know how I feel about women in this country.
Where we're going is ten times as tough and rugged...
- as anything you've seen up to now.
- What are you getting at?
"Well, just this."
I paid your room rent here at the hotel... and I'll leave you enough money for expenses until we get back.
You mean I'm supposed to wait here while you and Shorty go-
That's it.
I've been wondering whether you'd try something like this.
"Well, if you're going, I'm going too."
- You mean you don't trust us?
- I mean exactly that.
"All right, Shorty and I will stay here."
You go find the mine.
"- Oh, don't be smart."
"- Well, you're not going."
It's been out there ever since.
"It feeds three, four times a year."
Takes two or three people each time.
Two years after the crash it took my own son.
That's it.
One Wraith in the forest.
Yes.
I'll be done by morning.
We all go together.
In the daylight.
Are you really going to help us?
"Like the man said, it's just one Wraith."
It'd be downright unneighbourly if we didn't.
"In that case, drinks are on me."
Well... let's not forget the food.
What?
Is it true?
You're going to hunt the Daemus?
It looks that way.
"I heard it has two heads and it can turn you into stone, just by looking at you."
Well you heard wrong.
My uncle say's it'll come and take me if I don't do my chores.
He said that?
"Well then, if we get rid of it, you got nothing to worry about."
You'll never have to do chores ever again!
- Really?
"- Yes, look, go away!"
What?
"As far as we know, no-one was taken last night."
But it will strike and soon.
"Well, we'll kill it before that happens."
You must be great at parties.
Yep.
"They'd find the magnet, you'd be the first and only suspect, so you framed us."
Do you have any idea what you did to this man?
This man has nothing.
His...
His wife left him.
His girlfriend is in jail.
And he's been living in a ratty little condo.
"Thank you, Randy."
He's been looking at a sad little picture of a boat on a wall for 11 years...
Randy.
"...and you gave him hope, and then, you ripped his heart out."
Randy.
"For that, you're going to burn in hell."
That and the homicide.
"Actually, two homicides."
Don't forget the lottery fanatic who had a picture of them both together.
I think we're done here.
You two are under arrest.
Stand up.
"Let me see your hands, hotshot."
Thank you.
"Glad you like numbers, Billy."
You're going to be wearing some numbers on your shirt.
Is that right?
They won't be lottery numbers.
I get it.
Because you're going to prison.
"Yeah, I get it."
You have the right to remain silent.
I will if you will.
"You miss it, don't you?"
- A teenage waste of space.
- A name would be nice.
"It would, wouldn't it?"
You ask a lot of questions.
Why did you compel that man to kill himself after he told me to stop looking for you?
Dramatic impact.
Wish it would've been more effective.
- Human life means that little to you?
- It means nothing to me.
It's just part of being what I am.
"No, it's not."
I know other vampires.
That's not true.
You mean your boyfriend over there by the pool table?
Stefan Salvatore.
Why Stefan?
Why didn't you go for Damon?
Or do you enjoy them both like Katherine did?
- We should be in there.
- No.
Isobel made it clear we're not to step foot inside.
- I'm not gonna kill her in a restaurant.
"- You're not gonna kill her, period."
She ruined your life.
You wanna protect her?
She's my wife.
Was.
Was my wife.
"I looked for the woman I married, but she wasn't there."
Whoever that is is cold and detached.
- Yeah.
- She's given up her humanity.
- What are you doing?
- You're sweating.
"I've never met anybody quite like you, Jack."
I wish things were different.
I'm really a pretty likable guy when I'm not a fugitive.
I wish things were different too.
Isn't it funny how people meet?
"I mean, they can come from two totally different worlds... and never even know each other exists."
And then one day they meet and their lives are never the same.
- Are you married?
- No.
Do you have a girlfriend?
"No, I don't have a girlfriend."
And it's true that... you haven't been with a woman in a couple of years?
"It's true, yeah."
"If all this doesn't work out, you'll go back to prison, right?"
Probably.
"So it's conceivable that... you'd never be with a woman ever again, right?"
Right.
What are you doing?
Falling in love with you.
"Natalie, you can't..."
We can't do this.
I can't help it.
We may never have this chance again.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Can't see the road.
There it is.
There's the road.
"Ten more miles, do or die."
What the hell is he swerving all over for?
- That's so disgusting.
"Yeah, people really get wound up when they watch this."
- I just laugh.
I think it's funny.
- That's not real vomit.
- It was real.
- It's real.
No.
But it's like...
What I keep saying is if you put crushed graham cracker cookies and ginger ale or ginger cookies or whatever and you hold it in your mouth and spit it out.
"It doesn't matter that it's not real, it's just disgusting."
It's just as vile.
"This woman coming through, do you remember when her line was:"
"""Hell no."" And she did it, ""Hell no."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- No, that's not real."
"- Yes, it is."
- She...
All the takes of her saying that line are on the DVD.
"Ari, your face..."
Right here.
Right here.
"Oh, ashamed but happy."
- Guilty pleasure.
- I think that was the last thing I shot.
That was the...
"Yeah, that was the last thing you shot."
- That was your last day.
- It's like a little private shame that you share with yourself.
"Fine, let's go to Brooklyn."
"Aaron fell down, one of those takes."
"- Oh, he did?"
"You'll lose Haley and Jack, screw this job."
You won't have a life.
I can't reach her.
"Morgan, I'm going to find the security office."
- Morgan!
- Right here.
- Looks like loading dock security.
- Should we evacuate?
"No, no."
We'd have mass panic.
Let's go.
Hello?
- FBI.
- FBI?
- Are these all your security cameras?
"- Yes, sir."
- What's this camera here?
- That's the roof.
East end.
"Morgan, I've got 4 guys on the east end of the roof."
- What's on that side of the roof?
Nothing.
No access doors to the mall?
Not unless you go through the air vents.
"Morgan,it's the air vents."
They're going for the air vents.
Don't move!
Put the devices down and put your hands where I can see them!
Gun!
"Police tonight foiled an apparent robbery attempt at the new usa mall, which presumably have marred an otherwise successful grand opening."
Haley?
"Hey,in here."
Are you OK?
Yes.
Do you recognize him?
I don't.
I think I do.
He's a Haengin soldier we met on your first trip as our leader.
Why do they want me dead?
Even if he had a grudge... there's no way a soldier would attack a troop.
It could become a political issue.
You came back alone?
A bodyguard attacked us.
What?
You pathetic fool!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
- Call in my men!
"- Yes, sir."
What did you find out?
"The Haengin commander we traded with... (Sayong, Yuntabal's tactician) was Baemang."
His superiors caught him... trying to embezzle the gold he was supposed to pay us with.
They kicked him out of the army.
He and his men then became bandits.
Bandits?
"(Kepil, Yuntabal's assistant) You mean she was attacked by bandits?"
Yes.
I should've killed him then and there.
This is serious.
They used to be soldiers so they should be very well trained.
This really is bad.
We don't stand a chance against them.
Now they know our size and location.
Are you saying that my brother is a faggot?
"I'm saying I don't know who sent that postcard, and I don't fucking care!"
None of us cares... about Felix.
We just came for the free booze.
"- Left or right, Paul?"
- Go fuck yourself!
Left or right?
- Left.
- Left it is.
Bastard!
No!
You bastard.
Paul was right.
"We weren't Felix's friends, not properly"
"But I did speak to him on the night of the party and he was gentle, Justin."
"He was vulnerable and lonely, but he had a kind soul."
He wouldn't want this.
You didn't know him at all.
He wouldn't want this cruelty.
I'm sure of it.
Perhaps you're right.
I'll accept part of what you say.
"Felix was flawed... crippled, even."
But we came from the same line.
We were forged in the same fire.
This weakness was not what he was made of.
All this is in his name.
"But if he was watching, he'd be sickened by it."
"We are a proud family, Gemma."
People like you can't understand that.
Shame drove him to do what he did.
And pride demands payment for that slight.
I'm working now!
You keep yelling at me day and night
And to think you're my dad?
"Look at you, are you a thief at night?"
Thief?
"If so, need I stay here... and work like a horse?"
What are you mumbling about?
What did you say?
Nothing!
If you don't like it here... you're free to leave
"Boss, look at your restaurant"
It's as big as a market.
I'm the only staff here
It wouldn't hurt to hire one more helper
What did you say?
Who's gonna pay for that?
You're so ungrateful!
If it wasn't me who pitied you last year...
"And keep you here, you'd have starved to death"
"Y es, oh yes!"
Thanks Mr. Boss!
Work fast!
"Can't take any criticism, even talks back to me"
Did you light the stove yet?
Light the stove?
You lazy bum!
I woke you up... to have you light the stove!
You're so forgetful!
I'll beat you up!
"You good-for-nothing, how dare you run!"
"I'll beat you up, you can't remember a thing!"
Where is he?
Someone will hear us.
That's all I've got to say to you!
Stop it!
I'm sick of it.
"You're the one who keeps following me and makes perverted calls, aren't you?"
That's not me.
I never do things like that!
How can you do things like that?
"And you sent that porn magazine to my company, didn't you!"
?
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.
I wouldn't give this to anyone.
Why do you have it!
?
Nami.
No!
Stop it!
"If I knew your telephone number, I would call you all day."
"And if I'd known where you live, I would've written you a love letter everyday."
What do you want from me?
- The girl in that magazine isn't who I am!
- That's not the you I fell in love with.
Why don't you tear that magazine up then?
Red Porno
You're hopeless.
Why can't you behave normally?
Why do you have to torment me?
"If you get what you want, will you go away?"
This isn't what I want.
This isn't what I hoped would happen.
Will you go out with me tomorrow?
From the department store?
Do you have any idea what this looks like?
Come on.
You know we didn't shoot at them.
- You know that we're legit.
"- Yeah, I do."
"But if you keep shutting me out,"
How am I supposed to back you up?
We'll just--
This stays with me until things die down.
- Or implode.
- What?
"Sir, you're putting yourself in serious danger."
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
So tell me.
We can't.
"Well, I admire your loyalty."
I prized it myself once.
But you need to look at where you're placing it right now.
This has come to my attention.
It checks out.
And I will have to act on it.
"You want me to trust you, okay."
If there's even a remnant of a two-way street left--
If you still trust that I'm trying
To look out for you--then read it.
I want some extra people in the office.
Around the clock for the next 72.
Just in case.
Why?
'cause he stole something dangerous
And it's important that I get it back from him.
What makes you so sure it was him?
I'm sorry.
"She stopped by, my mind was elsewhere."
I didn't pay attention.
What are you waiting for?
Help me look for it.
Here it is.
My husband has a safe in a bank.
The key is in the left drawer of the desk and the contract is in a Bible in the library.
"Well, this is good news."
Isabelle?
You cut your hair.
It suits you!
Your clerk told me I could find you here.
Can I sit down?
I heard about your mother.
"I didn't have a family before, now there's no one left."
It doesn't make a difference.
- And why didn't you tell me?
"- No, I..."
"No, I wasn't going to tell you about it."
And you wanted some time to think... about us.
"Yes, I thought about it."
"I want to carry on, François."
Whether it suits my son or not...
I am entitled to live my life.
But you... you're not afraid of falling out with him?
He'll get over it.
"For the moment, you're the one that matters."
Will you say the same thing in the future?
The mayor of Villedieu will be searched tomorrow.
There will be consequences.
I'll be dragged through the mud.
I won't bother you anymore.
Bye!
You don't have to leave right off!
You just think over.
Help yourself.
- Thanks.
"Please, be careful with this."
It's fragile.
Would you mind?
- Thanks.
It's nothing special.
"I will show you, don't worry."
I told you I was a land surveyor.
This here is a theodolite.
I look through this every once in a while.
I only need to keep it unnoticed.
Why?
- I don't want them to think I'm some kind of a spy.
Have I shown you the bathroom?
- No.
"It's dilapidated, as you see."
There's no need to repair it now.
You won't have to walk through my room.
"Be sure that you lock yourself when you use the bathroom, they may break in."
I haven't told you...
Do you know that this house is going to be torn down in a month?
Of course I do.
"Why did you insist to live here, then?"
Sentimentality and other things.
I told you.
"When this happens, I'll manage myself somewhere else."
You won't have any troubles with me.
Miyu
Why are you doing this?
"You broke up with that guy, you should come home"
Why didn't you tell me?
I was planning on going home but thought I'd stay a little longer
Why?
Did you think that coming back home wasn't cool?
You were showing off like this amateur virgin?
Nope.
It's just more fun being here
You're having fun doing this job?
"Yep, it's very fun"
Why?
You won't understand
Why not?
Cause you're a virgin
Thanks for everything.
Now it's my turn to work for you.
There's something I want to do with you the day after tomorrow.
What?
Hold hands and walk together.
"Hello, package delivery for you."
"Sure, okay..."
Just a moment.
Coming.
"That'll be 1,280 yen, cash on delivery."
Thank you very much.
It's the book we ordered online.
Don't you think we're fine after all this time?
"No, just hang in for two more days."
"Well, 38 hours to be precise."
"Please, just be patient."
You've made a new friend.
- Are you the new volunteer?
- He's a lawyer.
He and I are gonna throw a doctor's ass in the slammer.
"Oh, well... see you later."
Bye.
You smell that stink?
Like something's rotting?
Behind the stink of detergent... can't you smell that?
It reeks of death around here.
Why do you think she puts up with it?
She had a kid who died.
That's why.
"All of us in here are going out in body bags, and she knows that."
She thinks that when we see her little darling up there we'll tell him how mommy's doing.
And we'll take care of him.
Make sure he eats his dinner and goes to the potty up in Heaven.
"Volunteer, my ass."
What about you?
"You got a message to send, too?"
"Who you got up there, huh?"
"I'm going soon, so make the most of it."
"Some ""dearly beloved?"""
- Or maybe...
- Excuse me.
Hey!
"Hey, come back."
I didn't mean it like that.
I don't know how to die.
None of us know how to die.
But maybe... somewhere deep inside of us a part of us does know how.
Maybe it's not as terrible as it seems.
Yes.
Where are the plans?
"Oh, here they are, sir."
"Will you ever forgive me, sir?"
"- What for, Jeeves?"
"- For hitting you on the head, sir."
"Oh, it's all right now, Jeeves."
Everything's all right.
"Well, dash it!"
Everything's not all right.
"Jeeves, you ingrate."
"Get me out of the rough, will you?"
"I'm afraid you'll need a blacksmith for that, sir."
"We owe a great deal to you, Mr. Wooster, and to your man."
- Not at all.
It was great fun.
"- Well, thanks anyway."
I'll go and see if I can find that blacksmith for you.
- How can I ever thank you for all you've done?
- It isn't thanks I want.
It's eternal devotion and everlasting friendship.
"Do you mean that, or are you still in a daze?"
"I'm in a daze, but a wonderful daze."
"Parsons, orange blossoms, little choirboys— can you face that?"
"Yes, if you promise me you'll never speak to a strange woman again."
What are you doing?
- Sittin' down.
- Amazing.
"Oh, Jeeves, this is a very pleasant spot."
We must spend our honeymoon here.
"Not our honeymoon, sir."
Only yours.
You always have it your way.
Okay thank you.
I will send it in.
You still have time to see me?
I've been standing here for a while now.
I feel like I'm making life hard for you.
"Seriously, why are you here?"
"I'm trying very hard, doc."
This is trying?
Yes.
"It's spread to your ear now, you know that?"
Rash: 50 spots
"If on the outside it's like this, the inside is probably worse."
I understand doc but...
I've been dying to do this job.
And it finally arrived.
You want me to turn it down?
Opportunities like this come once in a life time.
"But you only have one life, right?"
That's right.
"We got one life, so we should do what we want to do."
And do the best we can.
You look like you aren't afraid of dying.
"You just said that we only have one life, right?"
"So we should find what makes us happy, right?"
And what I do makes me happy.
I don't feel tired doing it.
So I work hard and I'm wrong?
"And everyone has to die anyways, right?"
You're a doctor.
You should know that.
You obviously know little about dying.
I am not a gutless coward.
"If I leave like this, I will be sinful for the rest of my life."
I won't live peacefully.
And I will be a criminal forever.
I won't leave.
I come to express my support.
You can't lose in this case.
Because your master's name is so important.
"But now, I know that, you are a real brave and quixotic hero."
I believe that you are innocent.
I'll wait for you.
Good speech!
Will you wait for me?
You'll be released at 5 pm tomorrow.
How about the final address?
They can do nothing to me.
"They can't imagine that, you studied law in UK too."
"Tomorrow, you'll take my place."
Hubby...
You'll handle Foon's life.
You sent me to study law in UK... isn't it because you felt boring?
Of course not!
The world is so big!
"I think, it's a good deed... to let you see the world, is that right?"
"Hubby, I didn't study law in UK."
They rejected me.
"So, what did you study in UK?"
Fashion design.
What did you say?
Time's up.
I studied fashion design.
Fashion design.
"""...that killed the rat."""
And then I have to go all the way to Denmark to shake somebody's hand.
He'll take a photo of me and show all his rich friends he's done good.
This is not up for discussion.
- I have to think about it.
"- No, you won't think about it."
"You will go, wear a suit, get a haircut, behave nice and smile."
"Please, Jacob."
You know as well as I do that this is our last chance.
Otherwise we'll have to close down.
Then these children will have nowhere to go.
They'll be on the streets.
Please.
You owe the children that much.
This is our last chance.
Are there only rich people where you are going?
- Yes.
- No one is poor?
- No.
Some have more than others.
"- If I was rich, I'd be happy."
"- I know, but people there are idiots."
"- You hate all the rich, Mr. Jacob."
Is it because the houses are far apart that people are far apart?
"I'll tell you all about it when I get back, right?"
What's wrong?
Pramod?
You're not coming back.
I know it.
I promise that I'll be back for your birthday.
I told you so.
"Pramod, come on."
Great.
But what I'm getting at is what were the autopsy results?
Why do you people keep making me relive this nightmare?
Because you're the coroner!
Good point.
What was the cause of death?
Cause?
"Well, um..."
"Sir, there are so many causes of death nowadays."
"Um, murder, disease, loneliness - that's the real killer."
That's what finally got the roadrunner.
"Your honour, the witness is really pissing me off!"
"Mr. Diamond, answer the question."
"Well, I would if he would stop misleading me."
Come on!
What was the cause of death?
What?
What got him?
What?
"Come on, what was the cause of death?"
What was the cause of death?
"Well, I don't know the cause of death."
Because I never finished the autopsy.
There!
Satisfied?
"Fine, we'll just have to do it again."
This is good.
I'm ordering that the body of Mayor Bowman be exhumed first thing in the morning.
Very good.
"Oh, it's gonna be gross."
It's gonna be disgusting.
Is that the ring for the tipster hotline or the suicide hotline?
Continuing with the treatment would be meaningless.
"Moreover, your current medical fees are costly enough."
I will definitely come up with the money in one month.
"Therefore... please, you must definitely save him."
I absolutely can't let go of my dad like this.
He has been in a coma for 10 years.
Maybe it's time to give up.
"Because of me, my dad is like that."
"I can't give up, I can't."
Doctor!
Please save him.
I'm begging you!
Please save him.
Please save my father.
Please save him.
"Hello everybody, I'm from life beverage company."
I sell hangover drinks.
We are currently having a free trial for our product.
"To participate, you just need to go to our website."
"These don't really work, right?"
"It's a lie, right?"
There's no such thing.
People who have tried this drink say that their stomachs feel a lot better the very next day.
"No, thanks."
We don't need it.
Don't be like this.
Sounds good.
Let's give it a try.
Thank you.
"One bottle, two bottles."
"Hello, It's Kim Na Na."
Right now?
Victor.
"Victor, you are risking his life."
He's my nephew.
My only living relative.
He's the only one I can leave my my bankruptcy to.
"That's what experimentation is all about, Letha."
We cannot afford to lose him.
I am the only one we cannot afford to lose.
Can't you see that I've got complete control over his mind?
"He has no fear, no memory, no will."
He can only carry out my commands.
What... what's happening?
We're out of gas.
"What are you, crazy?"
"Look at the dial, it points to... empty."
Empty?
It was all that waiting I had to do for youse.
I'll run down the street to the gas station and get some gas.
"Boy, oh, boy."
You guys are costing me a lot of dough.
I sure hope you make the tip worth it.
Something's going to happen to someone near here.
We've got to help.
"No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver."
I'll go.
I think it came from back that way.
Be careful.
And remember what Uncle Bene said.
That is enough.
Bring him down!
"Sickle, turn to your right."
Balance yourself and walk along the ledge.
"That is true, Victor."
He has acrophobia Among other things.
Find a different test for him.
Acrophobia is not a problem with my device.
Start climbing.
"I will do anything else you say,"
"But I am not going up that building, understand?"
- I...
- Sickle I command you to climb up that fire escape.
"You will go to the very top,"
"You will turn around, and you will look down."
And you will not be frightened of heights.
Off you go.
It's working.
It's working!
It seems to be.
Victor.
"Victor, you are risking his life."
He's my nephew.
My only living relative.
"He's the only one I can leave my Uh, my bankruptcy to."
"That's what experimentation is all about, Letha."
[Letha] we cannot afford to lose him.
I am the only one we cannot afford to lose.
Can't you see that I've got complete control over his mind?
"He has no fear, no memory, no will."
He can only carry out my commands.
- [car rattling] - what...
What's happening?
We're out of gas.
"What are you, crazy?"
"Look at the dial, it points to..."
- Do they make pink slate?
- That's enough.
"If it doesn't match your pants, I don't want it."
Slate is a word that falls apart if you say it more than three times.
"So 21 ,000 tons of slate by June."
"- Slate, slate, slate."
- Slate is a stone around my neck.
- Because you took it for granite.
- Right.
Cut it out.
We're slated to install these interiors... I'm going to do the rest of this job by myself.
- Yeah?
Rick.
- Huh?
It's for you.
Yeah.
Uh...
Now?
Okay.
Miles is here.
- l thought I smelled sulfur.
- You... shut up.
"Sammler and associates, I greet you."
"Sorry for the intrusion, but I needed a word with you, Rick, sooner rather than later."
"Well, sure, Miles."
"How was your vacation, by the way?"
Vacations can only be judged by the degree of discomfiture upon one's return.
"In this case, the vacation was a grand success."
"Do you believe in portents, Rick?"
What do you mean?
- How's your filing system here?
- Excuse me?
Is that all right?
"Ok, good bye."
- Is the Director in?
- Go see his secretary.
Take this to the boss's car.
Is the director in?
Don't you know how to say hello?
"Yes, sorry."
Is he in?
- He's not seeing anyone right now.
- He called me.
- Who are you?
"- Balla Traoré, from the factory."
"Right, Balla from the factory, he's expecting you."
It's the office on the right.
"You're late, I was leaving..."
Have a seat.
- Any news?
- Everything's all right.
I got the quarterly report.
"Truth is, this factory is going from bad to worse in red ink, according to a report made before you arrived."
"But right now, we need to keep up appearances at all costs."
"A rich man nowadays, is like the crap that... bees feed on."
"They get pleasure, but at the same time it makes them cry."
"200 workers will be laid off, among this mass of lazy bums."
"200, that's too many!"
"The factory will produce, I'll take care of it."
You have my trust.
- Here's the sack.
- Leave it there.
That's everything.
You owe me 215 FM.
It isn't loaded.
- What?
- I took the precaution of removing the pellets.
Which I thought was clever.
I'm more than a little offended...
- at you not keeping your promise.
- You fool!
"I say, handle her with care."
She's most precious.
"- Sit down, Wooster."
- Thank you.
I am dripping with fatigue.
- Won't you sit down?
"- You may as well, Miss Lowman."
You may be here for quite a while yet.
You park on the plush and I'll come and look after you.
- There you are.
- Idiot!
Don't say things like that.
I only did what I did for your own good.
"- If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to Miss Lowman."
- Not at all.
Lovers quarrel.
"- Keep quiet, Wooster, and sit down!"
"- Oh, thank you very much."
"Get me a chair, will you?"
I'll get one myself.
Mustn't strain the arm of the law.
"Now, Miss Lowman, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble... if you'll hand over the other half of those plans."
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know that isn't true.
Why don't you give him whatever he wants for my sake?
The Russian women.
Get away.
"Here, try the end window, where the candy is."
"Come on, Hoffy,we all want to see."
- How'd he get over there?
-Easy.
"Walked through the gate, past the guard, like he was some Kraut field marshal."
Now we know what he got for the radio.
This is murder.
"The stinking miser, keeping all that for himself."
"So I'm a vigilante, huh?"
"So, what are the officers gonna do now?"
"Don't worry, we'll handle it from here."
"Well, you'd better handle it fast, before he sells us all down the river."
Hi.
Too late for chow?
"What's the matter, boys?"
My slip showing?
I'll say it is.
You spilled a little borscht on it.
Borscht?
- Did you have a good time over there?
-Oh.
Somebody was peeking.
"Yeah, had a dreamy time."
"Those dames, they really know how to throw a party."
"I've known some women in my time, but between you and me there's nothing like the hot breath of the Cossacks."
There are a couple of blond snipers over there.
Real man-killers.
They--
What's this?
"What happened, Cookie?"
Josephine wants to sniff out something authentic.
"Yes, exactly."
And you?
I'm just a guest here.
He lives in 503.
Max needs a place to crash.
"That's why you're here, right?"
"Although, who is Max?"
We'll see.
What is this here?
"Please leave him alone now, Franz."
I ask myself that as well.
I am leaving him alone.
You'll find yourself alone here...
Max.
Then have a good day.
"When you have a bit of time, I would like to show you something."
Not today.
Then I guess not.
Perhaps tomorrow.
May I ask you a few questions?
Very good.
What are you actually doing here?
You're very talkative.
Everything begins when we start to think for ourselves.
That's the basis for every change.
"The problem is, we have no idea about the products and goods, we continually use."
- No one knows where they're produced...
- No one actually knows what 's in them.
We are totally bombarded by foreign images.
That's why I propose this very simple action.
We all head out...
"Now, I need you to get up slowly, and you'll go to that chair, with your hands behind your back, and sit down."
Can you do that for me?
You don't have to say anything.
Just nod if you're cool.
I just need you... on that chair.
"You brought this... on yourselves, guys."
But it can all be over very soon.
I just need one of you to own up to sending the postcard...
- and then we're all done here.
- We don't know who sent the postcard.
"- Please, we don't know."
- He doesn't care if we know or not.
He just wants to screw with us.
- Don't you?
- You got a few moments to talk it over.
I'll be outside.
But I'll be watching.
Luke... with me.
"Did you send the postcard, Luke?"
"No way, man."
I hardly knew your brother.
No offence.
"I'm just a ""party guy"", I bring the drugs and mix the drinks."
"Shallow as fluck, seriously."
"They should be thanking you, Luke."
"If you hadn't have helped out, things might have got a bit more... messy."
You're a good man.
This business with the postcard.
"I don't know, maybe you should just..."
- let it go.
"- I can't do that, mate."
I need answers.
You're welcome.
Sorry.
- Are you well?
"- Fine, thanks."
Sorry to disturb you.
"You're welcome, it's my route."
I'll take you.
I often see you on this road.
- You're not a local?
- No.
You seem to have problems.
One problem!
"In any case, every affair has its own problems."
Anything over a hundred years old is considered an antique.
What are you talking about?
You don't work underground?
"Because of this bone, you think we're looking for treasure or antiques?"
I don't think that.
I'm almost sure of it.
You haven't come for the ceremony?
The cat's out of the bag!
Our crew was joking with the kid.
They said that we've come for treasure.
We didn't want people to know why we're really here.
His family lives in the village.
It's a small village too.
That's why he believed it.
"Later, we told him the secret."
"When I was little, I felt the same."
"Whenever someone told me a secret, I always wanted to tell others."
"And in the end, I would."
I think I enjoyed telling it more than I enjoyed keeping it.
'Morning.
"Rosa, close the door."
There's a draft.
- She opened her eyes.
- That gives me the creeps.
- And when she yawns?
- I shit myself.
"Doctor, I wanted to talk to you."
Of course.
How are you?
How did you sleep?
I'll buy you a coffee.
How long do you think Lydia can stay like this?
"Months, years, her whole life."
Is there no hope?
"As a doctor, I have to say no."
However...
RESUSCITATED
"""Meryl Lazy Moon awakens from a coma after 15 years."""
She went into a coma during childbirth.
"Meryl was a PVS, persistent vegetative state, like Lydia."
theoretically unconscious for life.
Her recovery contradicts all I'm about to say.
So that means there is hope.
"No, I repeat, scientifically, no."
"But if you choose to believe, go ahead."
She can open her eyes.
Or am I imagining that?
"No, she can open her eyes."
But that doesn't mean she can see you or is aware of anything.
Lydia's cerebral cortex has been completely destroyed.
But the brain stem is intact.
Everyone let's line up
So we can make our way down please.
Girls on on side boys on the other
Girls on on side boys on the other
Right.
Well good luck up there.
How could I have forgotten?
We reserved our seats together.
Oh Lily and Rufus!
Oh We haven't seen you
- Since we broke matzo together.
- Hi.
- You look wonderful.
-Thank you.
Love--It's put color in all of our cheeks.
We were talking on the way over here
About what a wonderful couple you two make.
So we decided you should take the plunge like us.
Dating at our age is not enough.
Marry before it's too late.
Well It's not exactly
Uh We're just enjoying the journey.
Well Apparently at one point
We had a destination
But that no longer seems to be the case.
Subtle.
Mm I was going for honest.
Dear friends colleagues
As we stand here today
We bear witness to a bright new beginning.
Just standing in front of him
I-I couldn't do it.
I mean literally I could just kill her.
Okay.
You know how I'd do it?
Rip out her tongue and I'd wrap her own tongue around her freaking neck until she was dead.
Do you know what?
That would be funny.
That would be funny.
You know why?
Because then she couldn't shoot her flipping mouth off and she'd be dead.
And I would win because she's dead!
I added echo for effect.
I like sound.
Now look at the timecode.
"It's the time of the murder, damn!"
This is the first time that someone saying they want to kill someone was their alibi.
Grrr!
Shaye.
"You know,"
"I do what I do, check one two."
Check one two.
"Well, this is the big day."
I'll be witness for the prosecution.
Somebody's ears are going to be burning
"Because I'll be talking about you, testifying about you."
Some say I'll even be lying about you.
"What's that, Larry?"
You want me to tell the truth no matter what?
Then everyone'll know our personal business.
They'll never understand.
What?
I...
I suppose I could do it just for us.
What a lovely name.
The dawn.
"(PLAYS ""FANTASIE-IMPROMPTU IN C MINOR"")"
(SIGHS)
- I'm not happy with it.
- Why?
Because a perfect impromptu should seem spontaneous and free.
No-one should be able to guess at the desperate calculation behind it.
I've been struggling with this for so long.
It's like being tangled in a net.
I feel...
I have terrible dreams at night.
"I think if I ever finish it, then it will have finished me."
You must suffer tortures to find the perfect word that will make it all seem effortless.
Me?
Suffer for art?
You must be joking.
I suffer quite enough for life.
I have no hope to be perfect.
I simply pump out pages for money.
"No, your books are admirable."
I've been reading them.
Have you?
GEORGE:
Ah.
Is this your family?
"No, that's my fiancee."
"Well, we are no longer engaged."
Her family didn't feel that I was a very good risk for a husband.
No-one expects me to live very long.
- Balls!
- I beg your pardon?
-She's just a kid.
Jesus Christ.
"-The fuck, Emerson?"
(panting)
GREY:
No loose ends.
(COCKS GUN)
(GUNSHOT)
DOCTOR:
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
How do you feel about the girl?
She asked a very good question.
-Which was?
-Why?
"Well, that's a question that needs to be asked."
We are not sociopaths.
We're vulnerable to qualms of conscience like anyone else.
"We face these decisions every day, and we vote up or down."
"Like everything else, it has all been distilled down to zeros and ones."
They have asked for me to describe your emotional state
(helicopter hovering) in as detailed a manner as possible.
To determine whether you are fit to remain in the field.
"Fair and square, is it not?"
"Look Johnny, my room shouldn't go vacant even for a day."
Your house is like my own!
I wouldn't be able to bear it.
If you were to incur any loss on my account!
May I take one?
Get lost!
Are you a moron?
Rushing to pay the advance when the house isn't even vacant yet!
You haven't understood this city at all.
"Johnny bhai, thank you."
Oye!
What do you think you are doing?
Hey!
I am talking to you!
That is my drawer.
It was my drawer till you stuffed your things in.
Your mother has given me the key.
If my mother gave you the house keys someday..
..would the house be yours too?
I pay my share of the rent every month.
You eat worth much more in a single day!
I will leave your house...
and your drawer as well!
Quit talking about it.
Why don't you actually do it for a change.
I told you not to come here!
What was so important?
You should not trust me so much!
Where else can I keep it?
All the banks are asking for an income proof.
I will come and take it in a couple of weeks.
Who owns the cuff link...
"And where did it go, eric?"
"We figure that out, we clear jesse, right?"
Or we sink him.
Okay.
Our forensic nurse found evidence
Of forcible sexual intercourse.
But there was no evidence of male contribution.
What does that mean?
It means that your attacker wore a condom.
None of this makes sense.
I know.
"This may be a little strange question to ask,"
"But, um..."
Do you think that tony could've had anything to do with it?
How can you even ask me that?
"Look, tony gets accused of things,"
But...
People don't know him like I do.
I'm just asking because
I was married to someone like him once.
"And, um, I know what that can do to your self-image."
It's not like that with tony and me.
"And I used to defend him, as well."
And I paid a pretty heavy price.
"If, um..."
"I mean, if you ever feel like you want to talk to someone,"
Here's my card.
"Okay, guys."
We're now in a cisco webex meeting.
Are we ready?
"Dave, is this line secure?"
I had to finish high school first.
Before I go into modelling.
Why not just do it anyway?
"Yes, but unless mum signs the contract Unique can't hire me."
She's been in such a mood since dad went off with her best friend.
Unique will want you anyway.
You're so beautiful.
You are so sweet.
You are the most beautiful girl I have ever met.
I've been in love with you since the first time I saw you.
"I love you, too."
- I'II go with you.
- Do you mean it?
You make me feel I've come home.
With you I'd be able to get my life sorted.
- You think?
- I know I do.
In New York we'd have our own place   and make our own dough.
And start a family when we were ready.
"No fucked-up parents, no fucked-up friends."
No dope.
- Just us.
- But if mum says no we can't go.
No.
But you are a clever girl.
You'll get her to change her mind.
So your mum says you can't be a model till after high school?
What a bummer!
We were going to come and see you in New York!
"I've just bought a new suitcase, too."
- You look a bit better now.
- Philip's arrived.
I'm the sheriff.
It's my business to know such things.
"Besides, this road only goes to one place."
"Now, you folks have a good time down there, you hear?"
- Thank you.
- This'll be cleared up in no time.
Great.
"Thanks, sheriff."
[Mike] Thanks a lot.
"Come on, Bills."
"He's back at it again, Perry."
That girl's cut the same way as those two last year.
"Earl, why don't you just haul this stuff to town and stop playing coroner?"
You know it's the same.
You ain't no closer to catching him now than you was then.
I know.
But your blabbing about it ain't going to do nothing except maybe scare folks around town half to death.
"Now, will you get that stuff out of there?"
I got something I got to do.
"You're too old for this job, Sheriff."
"[chattering, laughing]"
"Hey, Billy, how about it, huh?"
"Sure, Mom."
Hold it.
"Draw, sidewinder, or I'll kill you where you stand."
You got your iron there.
"You better pull it, or I'm going to blow you apart."
[cap pistol fires]
[laughs]
Got to watch out for these varmints.
"Thanks, Sheriff."
"Hey, that's great."
A man with your talents...
"My talent is gambling, Pop."
"Hoofing is all right, but there's no future in it."
I want to spread out.
"I think I'm going to miss you, Lucky."
"I know I'm going to miss you, Pop."
"Is he staying with us, Pop?"
"No, he's made up his mind to get married."
How do you like that?
Letting his marriage interfere with our career?
We shouldn't have played his hometown.
It was a bad move.
Bad for us and bad for him.
Local boy makes bad.
"- Father, has he come yet?"
"- No, and it's all very much as I expected."
"Hi, fellows."
- How do I look?
"- Marvelous, colossal, splendid."
Wait a minute.
You're not going like that.
Of course.
"Big church wedding, girl's family very social... whole town there."
"I guess it doesn't really matter, just a hick town."
What doesn't matter?
- Last year's trousers.
- Last year's trousers?
No cuffs.
- No cuffs?
- No cuffs.
Whoever heard of cuffs on these?
Are you serious?
- Yeah.
Don't you think?
"I mean, honestly, are you ever angry at him?"
No.
Really?
You're not angry at him?
"Well, I did get angry sometimes, but not... but just..."
I just felt...
I don't know.
"Kind of a tragedy that he didn't work it out, isn't it?"
"You know, it seems almost too much he was on the way home to maybe come live with us."
- Yes.
- Who knows?
- You still believe that?
- I do believe it.
Do you think he crossed off his passport on his way home to...
to show something?
"Yes, to indicate... yes."
Why else would he have done it?
Why else would he have done that?
Can you give me an explanation?
It's a good myth to have.
I don't think it's a myth.
I don't think it's a myth at all.
"I mean, I have very strong conviction about that, because I know what... what Lou said to me, you know, when we... when we parted."
What did he say?
He said he would do it.
"I mean, he said..."
I said that I can't...
"I can't bear it any longer, and you have to... you have to do something, and you have to live with us."
And he said he would.
- Really?
I'm well--known round here for it.
I'm famous in the chest.
"Don't half turn the chicks on, right?"
The only snag is if the waistband on your jeans is too tight.
That's what jeans are all about.
"If your jeans aren't tight enough, you might as well be dead, right?"
Can you repeat all that?
I couldn't hear you for the sounds.
"I was just saying, like, you know, I dig all your gear."
-
- You got any blancmange?
-
"- Yeah, I got two of their LPs."
Life's full of excitement when you're engaged!
Where are you going with that?
"The magnificent metal digit is going on the pavement, p--pointing at the shop."
It's the opening salvo in me new advertising c--campaign.
"You spare no expense, do you?"
It's your old ice cream sign!
That's just for openers.
The hard sell comes later.
-
- It's all peeling and rusty.
-
"- Oh, yes."
How is your mother this morning?
-
- She's wandering.
-
"- Oh, is she?"
Perhaps we can get her to wander off completely!
-
I knew that I belonged... someplace.
"You know what I mean, Tillie?"
I don't think that...
I don't think there's anything in the world that's more important than that.
- Hey!
What are you doing that for?
- Because I care about you.
Put that down.
You can't make it dragging me.
- You look like a jerk.
- You know me.
I'll do what I say.
"What is this, your mother talking to you or something?"
My mother's dead and we're here.
You'll never make it if you have to take me.
You don't want me anyway.
Is that what you think?
"If you think that, then just do it."
What the hell.
Don't try to rattle me.
"Your father gave me 20 bucks to keep you from running, but if you wanna do that, that's fine."
Blow your guts out all over the mountain.
See if I care.
"Tillie, don't move!"
I won't get any further alone.
"If you hadn't been with me, I wouldn't have got this far."
I would've sat down on that first night by the fire and waited for the snow to cover me over.
Tillie...
I don't wanna go back there without you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Edgar.
But never thought I'd walk away.
With so much joy but so much pain.
And it's so hard to say goodbye.
But yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
Another chapter in the book.
Can't go back but you can look.
And there we are on every page.
Memories I'll always save.
Up ahead only open doors.
Who knows what we're heading towards.
"I wish you love, I wish you luck."
For you the world just opens up.
But it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
"Every day that we had all the good, all the bad."
I'll keep 'em here inside.
"All the times that we shared every place, everywhere."
You touched my life.
It's hard to imagine that a person would ax her so horribly.
Totally sliced up.
Let him in.
He's free.
"Maybe he knows about our style, our real identity."
What shall we do?
He suspects that we killed her.
"By any chance, did you two do it?"
"No, I didn't!"
"If you said no, then it's no."
Keep cool.
Don't be nervous.
You're the one who's nervous.
"No, it's hereditary."
I need to pee.
"Ladies and gentlemen, next you will see our amazing vanishing show!"
This beautiful girl will completely vanish in front of your very eyes.
Then she will appear behind that curtain like magic!
"Soon, this girl will..."
Look over here everyone!
"While that gentleman gets covered with blood, in this box..."
"What bastard bent this wire, damn it?"
Tada!
The vanished beauty will appear over there!
- Where's Miss Hwang?
- I don't know!
Come grab her!
Are you her family?
"Yes, we are."
She doesn't have much left to live.
Please prepare yourselves.
Doctor.
"Get it over to Aaron,"
- see what we get.
"- Okay, good."
Ma'am...
When were you going to tell me ?
Excuse me.
Tell you what ?
Last week you were looking at Ray's old case files.
"And now today, a man I thought was locked up for the rest of his life, the man that killed my husband, was murdered."
I'm still working on that.
"You see the way I have this is that if Bob Keaton got out of prison, that tells me he wasn't Ray's killer."
"Horatio, don't lie."
Do you trust me ?
I thought I could.
I need you to trust me until I have something real to tell you.
Okay ?
You promise me ?
Promise ?
Of course.
Hey.
"Alexx, what is that ?"
The shooter left a calling card our competitor missed.
Muzzle stamp.
It was under the mess.
They didn't know to look for it.
"But we did, didn't we ?"
The killer got close for the second shot.
The heat softened Bob's skin.
And then the muzzle smashed into it.
"The muzzle with an imperfection, Alexx."
This demarcation is unique only to the killer's gun.
"So we find that gun, we match it to this imperfection, we have our killer."
"Anyway, you're not going to see her anymore."
"Why do I feel like heartbroken, just like my 2nd year in college?"
But this time how can it be a broken-heart?
It can't be.
"A relationship like this where... we meet for a few minutes a month, the doctor is just doing her job."
There's nothing more to it.
So how can I say that I'm heartbroken?
But just now I said heartbroken 3 times.
Shit.
There is no way I'm heartbroken.
You're way brokenhearted bro.
It's not hard to tell.
I've given you my diagnosis.
No way.
Why not?
Sure.
You have all the symptoms.
"You can't eat, or sleep."
I know.
I was a teenager once.
But we didn't even pass go.
"But from what you've told me, you've gone far enough."
Why did you drop all your work to go see her?
You even asked me to play badminton to exercise.
Right?
I was sick.
So I went to see a doctor.
I exercised to get better.
You did it so she would give you props.
You did it for her.
You wanted her to see you doing good things.
"You'll be ok because you want to be ok for her, right?"
- Yes.
- I am Tonjura.
I am pleased to meet you.
-It's an honor to meet you.
- We would like to extend our deepest regret.
We cannot help you in this matter.
We are not a violent species.
And not equipped for war.
"I'm sorry, Robert."
- The Arktorians have always been here.
"Silently monitoring human progress, along with several other races."
But now they're all returning home.
-You mean evacuating?
So now we really are alone.
-Yes.
Thousands of years of accumulated human data ends here.
- You could have gone back with them.
Why didn't you?
Or at least given them the Purian.
- They've fulfilled their duties to the council.
This is not one of them.
"And as I stated before, I'm not leaving."
-Is this John?
John Walker?
"- Yes, yes, this is John Walker."
- It's Denise from the motel.
You told me to call if anyone came inquiring.
"Well, there are government agents inside this room as we speak."
"Well, you didn't tell them anything, did you?"
- No.
I didn't.
But these guys have real badges.
"Kill me, machine."
Do it!
"Don't be afraid, andromeda."
Sweet dreams.
Thanks for stopping by.
Appreciate it.
Why would they leave us alive?
Let's discuss.
They think we have
Information they can use.
Like what?
What do they possibly need from a drunken nietzschean
And the captain of a ship
That doesn't function any more?
Maybe they're interested in your huge load of fruit.
Or maybe they have an actual chain of command
And they're waiting for orders.
"You know, if i was a bad guy, i would split us up."
"I mean, why let us conspire unless they want us to?"
Confident in their monopoly of power.
That's just overconfidence.
"If they're smart enough to fix theandromeda,"
They're smarter than that.
Maybe none of it matters.
I can get next to that.
Did i ever show you guys this?
No.
No.
It's a long story.
Anyway... why don't we go
"And see what these cowboys are up to, huh?"
"Rhade, where are you going?"
Are you coming with me or not?
Molech.
"Molech, do you want another drink?"
It's Evan.
No thanks.
Sorry about Dante.
Gene.
They figure out what killed him?
What does it matter?
"He's dead, right?"
There have been people around here asking questions.
"You haven't said anything, have you?"
Of course not.
Good boy!
No thanks
I'm just trying to make you feel better.
"Yeah, well, it didn't do much for Gene."
You don't think this is what killed him?
He was doing a lot.
Yeah and he was sleeping it off in an alley.
Who knows what could have happened to him.
"Hey, I know how we can make each other feel better."
I have a new piercing.
Where are you?
There's evidence to indicate that Gene Hansen died of anaphylactic shock.
The pathologist found an unknown substance in his bloodstream.
"Yeah, an unknown substance."
I need you to be straight with me.
Are you selling drugs here?
I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.
"Coreen, tell her I'm not selling drugs."
"You have to tell her, whichever way it is."
He has no jurisdiction.
"Now, why don't we try going to Tascosa."
Fight it there?
"The minute he steps foot in that town, they'll hang him."
vin:
Wanna give me some of them beans?
Might slow you all down if I'm going empty.
[DEPUTY GRUNTS]
Let's go!
[vin GRUNTlNG ]
MAN:
The hell you doing?
MAUDE:
Need ammonia and water.
"Mother, what are you doing?"
I'm redecorating.
"Yes, but poker tables?"
Selling liquor?
I thought we had an understanding.
"Well, I found those gambling tables in the hotel cellar."
"Now, am I supposed to let those lovely furnishings..."
... languishinadarkanddusty hole?
"Don't start with me, Mother. I won't sit back and watch you take my business."
Your business?
Where in the city charter does it say...
... thatonlyyoucan servedrinks and offer gambling?
You know what this means?
"A little war, dear?"
I'll run you into the ground.
"Well, we'll just see who buries whom."
"Well, then, the gauntlet is thrown."
Good day.
"I mean, you can go back to college if you want."
You can take classes.
"Writing, photography."
You can travel if you want.
"The point is, we have options."
Why can't you be happy?
I would be happier if we had coffee.
OK.
No.
"We swore for the sake of our sisterhood that we would never, ever ask each other to double date again."
"Oh, come on, Sarah."
We were 19 years old.
"That is ancient history and besides,"
I already told Robert that you would come.
"It's ""Robert"" now."
"I have seen the birthmark on his butt, so we're on a first name basis."
Would you just come on?
Lt'll be fun.
One thing Joe and I are not at the moment is fun.
I'd say we're downright gloomy.
"Well, shake it up."
Get out.
"Yeah, right."
Um...
"Intensive couples counseling didn't work, but a good dinner out, that'll fix everything."
I know you and Joe have been having a hard time.
"If I honestly believed staying home was going to help,"
- I'd drop it.
- There's a problem.
"OK, listen."
Fine.
"But if it's a complete disaster, don't say I didn't tell you."
"Yes, I believe it is customary."
I suppose we go on the deck and into the matter comfortably.
I'll get my wrap.
"There we are, my sweet."
Bermuda.
"We'll ride bicycles and everything, won't we?"
I myself prefer a horse and the open range.
With the vine fanning my cheeks.
And the stars for me guide.
"What was that, Jason?"
- What was what?
- What you just said.
"I don't know, my dear."
I'm afraid I wasn't listening.
[ship horn blowing]
The pilot boat.
"I must get this letter off, my dear."
You'll pardon me.
"You'll hurry back, won't you, Jason?"
I'll be back before you can say abracadabra.
Abracadabra.
Have you tried the cut-rate ticket brokers?
I've tried everyone.
Everywhere.
Nobody wants to put money into a show with a black eye.
"- Oh, if father only had..."
- Your father isn't responsible.
I went into the show because I liked it.
I thought it had good possibilities.
It's no great tragedy.
There'll be other shows.
But what about now?
Zoravar.
It can't... be Zoravar.
It's someone else.
Shiv.
No one's took a stand for me ever.
You gave him a fitting reply only for me.

Do you really have one last bullet?
"Jeffrey, thankyou for sparing me."
We're in the same boat now.
There's no way out for us.
Don't let me see you again.
Inspector Li!
Five dead witnesses.
- It was him.
- Are you sure?
Show his picture.
Ask the neighbors if he was here.
Okay.
No regrets
No remorse
Let bygones be bygones
No signs of melancholy
No tears ofself-pity
I don't care about what's right or wrong
I'm not sentimental about the past
Just set me free from this reverie
For the pain lingers on
It dwells deep in my heart and soul
Only time will tell
Ifwe are meant for each other
My tears and laughter are my own indulgence
"Inspector, you hit the nail on the head."
The neighbors say he lives here.
Are you nuts?
Jenny!
"Jeffrey, is that you?"
Why don't you come back?
I'll be back this morning.
"I had it for you, only as I said, I didn't expect..."
- I know.
You said it before.
- You don't have to worry about it.
- I'm not worried.
- I'll have it by the end of the week.
"In the meantime, I suppose you'd like some spending money."
"Here, here's 500."
I'll take that.
It'll take me a few days to get settled.
"By that time, you can get that dough together and tell me where I come in."
Where you come in?
What do you mean?
"What business you want me to handle, what parts of town and what my cut is."
- Your cut?
- Yeah.
"That was the idea, wasn't it?"
"I took the rap, three years."
"You took the dough, made connections, built it up."
For you and me.
Wasn't that it?
"Oh, I see."
Yes.
I understand but you've got this thing all wrong.
"See, I work for Keefer."
He's the boss.
I haven't anything to say.
"If you want a spot in his business, why you'll have to take it up with him."
"Now, look, Frazier, I'm not taking it up with anybody but you."
You figure it out for yourself.
I'm taking up with you where I left off.
"That was the agreement, and we're going to stick to it."
"look down in pity--"""
You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!
Shut up!

Are you tired?
Let's rest before we start again.
"I'm not wasting your time, am I?"
I lost my job.
I screwed up and word got out to the whole industry.
No one wants to hire me.
So I'm free everyday.
"I should say that's great, right?"
So you can rest.
Okay?
No more black circles around your eyes.
I retouched under my eyes for you.
I will erase the rash for you too doc.
Actually our occupations have a lot in common.
I don't know if you still want to die.
"But you are not allowed to, got it?"
You must get better.

Jerd you make Thai people proud.
Wow you've come a long way my friend.
Congratulations bro.
It looks like a funeral in black and white.
My boyfriend wants it more dreamy.
What do you mean dreamy?
You know dreamy.
The fact you took these at the park is lame.
Don't tell me you want pink grass too.
Just do it to make him happy.
Thank you.
Did I fail?
No.
I...
I'm sorry.
Um...
Did I fail?
You won't tell him...
Most patients come to rosewood in order to relax and recuperate away from the harsh
day-to-day life outside of these gates.
"Some patients, however, they're faced with more advanced challenges."
"But not to worry, patients like that are kept in a separate wing from ladies such as yourself, miss Porter."
Shall we?
Of course.
"Andifyoudecide youdon'tlikeit,"
I'll come right back.
Okay.
Okay?
That girl looked really disturbed.
Are you sure you want to stay?
"Roderick, do quit your ceaseless worrying."
This is just what I need.
I feel better already.
I'll come visit you soon.
Take care.
Perhaps you'd like some tea?
"Oh, that sounds wonderful."
"Now you just let Gunther know when you're ready, and he'll show you to your quarters."
It can be easy to get lost here until you know your way around.
Thank you.
She seems rather a bore.
Is she anyone of note?
"He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?"
That's why you want to kill him.
"For someone who's never been in love, you're quite perceptive, aren't you?"
Maybe I was.
Once.
- I got donuts.
They got jelly.
- (CHUCKLES)
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
"No, no."
Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix at this high-end jewelry place.
"The manager was a drunk, and he would forget to lock the case with the expensive watches."
Neal...
I resisted.
Twice.
"Third time, this guy's just asking to get took."
"So, I grabbed a couple of cases of watches, and I hopped on a train to Portland."
The store's got insurance.
"Anyway, I stashed them in a locker at the train station."
"They're still there, so that's hardly stealing."
"Well, so you got away clean?"
I didn't get away clean.
"The manager may have been a drunk, but the security cameras were stone sober."
"I thought this heat had died down, but it hasn't."
I'm sorry.
Tallahassee's out.
- You don't have to do this.
- Please.
- Please.
It will be safer if you stay quiet.
BROYLES:
Her name's Christine Hollis.
"Twenty-seven years old, in the master's program for fine arts at BU."
"Far as we can tell, she's no one special."
"Parents deceased, no siblings, no arrests."
Twenty-seven hundred dollars in her bank account.
- Nothing unusual at all.
- Do we have a home address?
We're working on it now.
Assuming she's still alive.
We have no reason yet to think otherwise.
"Well, that's just it, isn't it?"
We don't know what to think.
I'm lost.
"Twenty-four years ago, one of them saved Walter and Peter."
Walter doesn't know why.
Can't remember.
"But beyond that, everything we know about these guys the little that there is, suggests that they just watch."
They don't get involved.
But now...
Figure out why he took this girl.
What makes her the exception?
"Do that, and I think you'll find him."
PETER:
"Hey, I think we may have a lead on the Observer."
"Walter, look at this."
In his book.
I think that might be blood.
"- Unless Mary helps him, of course."
- Of course.
"Rotten for you, Christine."
I got the fright of my life.
Did you see him come after me?
"Writers can do fine things but when they crack up, they're a menace."
"Here, dry your tears."
An emergency.
"Sit down here, I'll phone you a cab."
I'll come back and tell you what Gerard said about you.
- Feeling sad?
- Yes.
Where do you live?
"Let me take you home, I'm going that way."
"- No, they're getting me a cab."
- That'll take ages.
Come on.
- You wind surf?
Any good at it?
"- Yes, out at sea and in the harbor."
- Among the big tankers.
- lsn't that dangerous?
It's child's play.
Want me to teach you?
"No, it's not my sort of thing, but I'll come and film you some time."
"Oh, any time."
"1938, when Sino-Japanese War was like a raging fire."
"And the countries were fighting each other,"
"Atomic fission was first tested by German Scientists, which would lead to the world's destruction."
"If this was exploited by Hitler,"
The entire human race will be annihilated.
Why are you standing?
How does one start this engine?
I have cursed you.
You won't forget your fears until you disappear.
I cursed you.
Solomon?
What are you doing?
Whom are you sacrificing our children for?
You betrayed God.
"Pestilence, diseases and troubles are happening because of you."
Your betrayal will bring blood and sufferings to our people.
"You betrayed, you betrayed..."
"I don't know what to do, Garik."
I thought that I had one person who could help me.
But it turned out that he is dead.
"I'm alive, thank God."
Stop that!
I know that I'm ill.
You and many other people don't exist.
You're looking for reality in an unreal world.
It's like looking for God for He is the only reality.
Do you get it?
The rest is the illusion of the Creator.
"Garik, shut up!"
You're dead.
May be you died?
Maybe you were devoured by your mega-centre.
I look at your paying for your wealth.
I think I made a right decision.
"I built my own real world, my family and my life."
But I'm grateful to you.
I won't be happy without you.
"With that planning to kill wife, throwing bombs on police, and escaping to Malaysia on fake passports."
Go and tell her.
What's this man?
Game.
Is it good?
"He's not a patient, he has no memory loss."
He has memory loss.
"Being a doctor, I say this."
"No, he has no memory loss."
He has memory loss.
"No, he doesn't have memory loss."
Trust me.
"He told me what had happened 2 years back, and also told me that he doesn't remember that."
"He told me what had happened 2 years back, and also told me that he doesn't remember that...?"
"Actually, he told me that I am a doctor."
Aren't you a doctor?
It's okay you knew it.
But don't tell him.
He will beat me to pulp.
Hey you patient...
Where were you?
Did you find anything about him?
I found everything about him.
What?
Does he remember his past?
I saw my future.
Don't play with him.
He will cover your face and beat you up.
Stop talking nonsense.
Are you playing games with me?
Everyone thinks they have started the game.
"But actually, we are all players in his game."
Excuse me for barging in on you so soon after a long trip.
That's no problem.
I touched this up on the train back from Kyoto.
"You may not find it suitable for a textbook, but here you go."
When can I get paid?
Soon.
"Scholars don't live on air, you know."
We'll get it to you as soon as we can.
"Come to think of it, would you send it to my school?"
Huh?
"Oh, I understand."
You have to put more expression into it.
"Ah, they're dancing."
"Yes, I'll go tell her you're home."
"Like this, see."
Mother!
Father's here!
Oh?
"Shinako, go say hello to your father."
"Namiko, are you asleep?"
Excuse me.
"That kimono looks really good on you, Mother."
Is that right?
I'll tell you about clothes.
"Before the war, lacquer and colourful prints sold really well."
That's right.
Those are luxury goods.
"If a woman wore a luxurious kimono during the war, a woman exposed her asarakasa."
It would have been the picture of vulgarity.
"Father, you have a morning lecture, don't you?"
"Yes, but go on ahead."
I see.
It's remarkable.
Tremendous.
"Look, at long last."
The Temple of Ages!
This statue's extraordinary.
I've never seen anything like it.
I don't think it's a statue.
You're right.
I believe we have discovered
Solon himself.
"He must have been caught in a volcanic eruption, and covered in hot ash."
Like the bodies at Pompeii.
He's hanging on to something here.
It's the platinum book.
"Yes, like the page we found inside the Ark."
"Yes, well I think I'd better hold onto that."
Might just help defray some of my traveling expenses.
Look!
The gods march in rank.
"The riddle says when the planets are aligned, we'll find the Treasure of Atlantis."
Where is it?
The red crystal.
The one in the observatory?
We forgot the second line of the riddle.
"""Hecate races in the heavens."""
The planets alone isn't enough to reveal the treasure.
It takes something more.
Hecate has to appear.
Who the devil's Hecate?
A demon of the night who rides a chariot of fire.
There she is.
A meteor shower.
"Well, if I'm afraid, I'll call on you, you little slut."
Small since when?
I'm plenty grown up!
"More than is good for you, right?"
Not at all!
But I'm already outgrowing the clothes...
Everyone can tell that.
See for yourself!
Have a look.
"Well, what's already there..."
Don't be so sure.
- If you've set yourself up here...
"- Stop it, ok?"
"Can I come visit then, Bruno?"
This is no children's playground!
Can I have a drag?
Why are you shaking like that?
Give it back!
Just what I'd need - have people say that I seduced a minor into smoking.
Come over here...
What do you want?
Come here already!
It's my sister!
Take care that you're not caught here!
Maybe one could stretch a few clothes lines from pillar to pillar?
Or across here...
"Or at right angles so that the whole thing would get more class, become slightly more stylish."
So that things are not hanging around here like... in a pawnshop.
There are more 100 valuable costumes here.
He wants to unpack his stuff.
All the baskets?
Termination!
[ Exhales sharply ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Hisses ] [ Gasps ]
[ Panting ]
"[ Inhales deeply, panting ]"
[ Breathing heavily ]
Man:
We'll let you know if we need any other information.
Thanks for everything.
Appreciate it.
Hey.
What did you tell the sheriff?
The usual -- psycho killer on the loose.
"They, uh... usually buy it."
I lost my whole family today.
I'm so sorry.
I...
Can I steal you a sec?
"Once this place clears out, we're gonna make this a family affair."
"Wait, Dean."
[ Chuckles ]
We're not gonna kill Maritza.
She's a monster.
"Yeah, who saved our asses."
You said that you wanted to keep things strictly business.
"Well, last I checked, we were in the business of killing monsters."
I wanted to keep things strictly business between us.
But I still have a heart.
What if I had crossed paths with a hunter back when I was possessed by Gadreel?
"I could've ended up dead, too."
Would I have deserved that?
Would I have deserved to die?
- Is he willing?
- Let me worry about that.
"Karl, go after him."
Okay.
"Hey, watch where you're going!"
What's the big deal?
I'm looking for someone.
"Pardon me, Your Excellency!"
Have you seen a guy with a brown fur collar?
Has a guy with a brown fur collar been in here?
I haven't seen him.
You seen a guy with a brown fur collar?
A brown fur collar?
Lots of guys with brown fur collars come in here.
Who sent you here?
"If you haven't seen the guy, then why should you care?"
Lots of guys with brown fur collars come in here.
See?
He's seen 'em!
We need to know who sent you here.
I don't have to tell you my business.
"If you ask him if a guy with a brown fur collar was in here, then he can ask you who sent you here."
I still don't have to tell you who I am.
"No, my friend."
"If you ask him a question, then he can ask you one too."
Otherwise just don't ask him.
I still don't have to tell you my business!
Then he doesn't have to say if the guy was here.
It's just logical.
Aren't you the clever one!
Fine!
Go on being clever!
Do you know why I gave them?
So that he could photocopy them.
"And, do you know why I gave them to Kaan?"
Because I trust him.
If you ever ask me how I know that... because the animal didn't even look at questions once.
Come in!
Give them to me.
Go to your seat.
Did you ever check the questions?
Don't talk nonsense!
Of course I didn't.
Are you crazy?
And he says he didn't check them with no shame at all.
"Don't tell me, ""Don't you feel ashamed?"""
- What happened to you?
"- I am answering, (e) gone crazy"
You drove me crazy.
"It's enough, enough."
Did you get that?
It's enough!
Don't shout.
She's studying.
Did your daughter's success just occur to you now?
I'll get her married to a man and it will be over.
Do you understand that?
"You'll get her married, huh?"
Whose daughter are you forcing to marry?
My daughter will finish her studies.
Then she'll marry the man she loves.
"So, she'll marry the man she loves and live a miserable life like I do?"
I am going to divorce you!
Divorce me!
We like it here.
We have family and community.
And you've just come here with your new novel and turned them against yourself with your arrogance and ego.
You are to blame nobody but yourself for these things.
I don't know how to process that.
I'm not sure how quickly I can absolve you of wrongdoing and shoulder the blame myself.
I'd like to go elsewhere and talk.
Speak with you more.
"Just not standing here, outside."
Okay.
Just not back in there.
Hello.
I've thought it best for my students not to ever see me out of class.
So what do you do at night?
I stay home.
I read and I think.
It will make my life harder if people see me differently.
Does that make sense?
But you want only to be thought of as a talented writer and not as a real person?
"Hmm, yeah."
Yeah.
That's probably about right.
"In fact, that's exactly right."
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)
Thank you.
All right.
Be a good boy.
"Give me a call, okay?"
Yeah.
I never had a weekend on campus where I went to school.
I can't really quite adjust.
Last night your uncle and then me...
In what way?
Never mind.
JONATHAN:
You seem to have a decent situation here.
This place is just fine.
Yeah.
You do not need to look away every time you see me.
This is your father that I saw you with earlier?
He's my uncle.
Mononcle.
Like the film.
You look sad with him.
I don't think you're saying what you think you are.
I meant to say...
"When with him, it makes you look as though you are not happy."
Oh.
I guess that's pretty much what you said the first time.
Why this is?
Your own family makes you unhappy?
I feel uncomfortable talking to you like this.
Why?
Because we don't like each other.
Or you don't like me.
It's not like that.
I mean...
"Okay, it's true that I am upset that"
"I study for years to obtain a teaching degree, and you..."
You just publish two slim novels and get a job many would murder for.
"I, however, think it is possible we could be friendly together."
You encouraged the faculty to turn on me.
Nobody likes me here.
Nobody ever talks to me.
I will threaten to go to the cops.
"She'll lose her license, her business, maybe does some time."
Or she signs the farm over to me.
"If Audrey signs the farm over to you, the other grandchildren will all have grounds for suit once the value of the land is discovered."
We'll fight them.
And you'd be tied up in legal battles for years.
"Legally, the better play would be to sign the quick claim over to the only surviving child."
- What?
- Your mother.
Maybe we can make a deal with her.
"Although shit, no."
[sigh] Julia told me she's somewhere on the West Coast.
No.
She's not.
She's here in Bridgeport.
She came back a few years ago.
She's just never contacted anybody.
I think she's just waiting for Otto and Audrey to... to die.
"Well, call her up."
I...
She doesn't have a phone.
I...
"If it's a long story, then let's go see her."
I don't know where she is.
"I have to look for her, okay?"
Okay.
Call me when you've found her.
Cheers for the drink.
That went well.
We didn't have time to prep for a rollover.
What did you always tell me?
Work the problem.
Are we at a livestock sale?
"She's a woman, not a goat."
- Are you in love with her yourself?
- Of course not.
"""I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities."""
"""I Iove, that is all."""
"""But I Iove strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""
"No, it's like something out of a novel..."
like that dreadful woman writes.
- If you can call her a woman.
- George?
"She makes a great hash of her life, but she's got a good heart."
That's why so many men don't want to let go of her.
George knows how to love... while she loves.
The countess has an extraordinary style.
I'd not have guessed there was a volcano under that ice.
"We can't find anything, citizen."
The viscount has been completely obliterated.
- Good to see you.
- Good evening.
They're all in here.
follow me.
What the devil...
"Good God, CIaudette!"
Go back upstairs and change!
- Pooh!
- Ow!
hello!
welcome.
"well, he left the salon at that moment."
CIaudette's decided to dress as a man for some reason.
Do you want a drink?
We're under attack!
Fight!
(Buwiyum's hideout in Eupru)
Follow me.
You come this way.
Sail south for hundreds of miles?
It's the only way to get food to survive the embargo.
I thank you for saving my life but I can't go on a suicide mission.
No one sets sail now because of the wind.
"(Buwiyum, pirate captain) We'll die before we reach the south."
I know it'll be difficult... but you've sailed the sea for decades.
I risked my life to come here.
Jolbon will collapse if I return with nothing.
I can't let them down when all they want is to fight the Han.
Help me.
Very well.
"I'll sail south as you want, but... make me an offer we can't refuse."
We have to do whatever we can to convince him.
He knows the situation we're in.
He won't go for just anything.
What more does he want from us?
It's hard to say.
He holds the key to the deal.
Take it away.
Your Highness.
If the King won't let me go...
I'll join Jumong in death.
He'll let you and Yuri go if I die.
Your Highness.
Your Majesty.
You must stop Lady Yuhwa.
She hasn't eaten for days.
You think someone like me is afraid of being shot?
Back off!
Meredith.
This is between you and I.
"The rest of these guys, they don't matter."
This is just you and me.
And a choice.
You're shaking now.
You're getting angry.
You're letting your emotions get the better of the situation.
The adrenaline is really kicking in.
"But what I know, the reason that I'm not shaking is because this is a choice not dictated by emotion."
This is logic.
"Pure, simple."
My boy over there is rated 4th in the world on the Glock 30.
You know what that means?
What's it mean?
-lt means I could shoot you from Texas.
-(CHUCKLES)
"Now, that's, of course, an exaggeration but the point stands."
He knows what he's doing.
He's a professional.
And you're you.
You've already dropped the gun.
Because this is a choice within a very strict set of parameters.
Right now you're in control.
What you don't wanna do is put him in control.
Don't give him the choice.
That way is death.
That way is the unconditional end to future choice.
That's it.
Good girl.
Inform the chiefs of all the 12 clans
Tomorrow morning... we're going to gather in Wushe
and offer a blood sacrifice
Our ancestors' spirits...
We're here for the guns.
Sorry to disturb you
- Boss...
- Welcome.
This way please
Fill them up with salt And give me ten boxes of matches
Wow!
"Lots of things to buy, huh?"
"Boss, we'll pay for it next time"
On credit again?
"- Yes, we can"
- How much is it?
"No, you can't!"
Wait!
You're buying all these on credit?
It's alright
It's alright?
But you never pay me back!
Let's give them a hand
That old drunkard Mouna Rudo really can't take it anymore?
I'll ask the young men to get ready before they all get dead drunk
"Young man, how dare you tell me these in front of the police station!"
Good morning!
Pihu Sapu?
What the hell was he up to?
That crazy boy spells nothing but trouble
"But we'd be bored around here without him, won't we?"
You call making troubles interesting?
"Yeah, and we've got a cab driver out there preying on young women."
He pinned me up against that wall.
And if it hadn't been for that car horn...
"If we ever find the driver, you can thank him."
Why don't we get the SOCO's down here?
He might have dropped something.
I heard that blood expert from work died.
Is it the same bloke?
Could be.
You said you lost your keys?
Do you think they were in your bag?
"Yeah, definitely."
I was all fingers and thumbs.
"Oh, god, do you think he's got them?"
You might want to stay somewhere else tonight.
Call a friend.
Just until you've had the locks changed.
OK.
I don't really know who though.
I've only been in London a few weeks.
OK.
We'll sort something.
Both girls are employed at the forensic services lab
They both get into minicabs from work.
"If it isn't the same bloke, it's one hell of a coincidence."
There is no evidence that Kelly was sexually attacked.
But Kelly fought back.
"She got him riled, he lost control and killed her?"
It's possible.
"Yes, Casey."
"Yeah, I'll be down in two secs."
OK.
Rose is back.
"Hello, Number 9."
Oh my!
Are you...?
Wow!
- I always figure you're...
- You always figure out as what?
Imaginary.
Or a boy.
Do you know what I've been doing today?
I've been watching you and your partner.
Did you hear somethin'?
That partner of yours is clean out of her mind
And she's gonna put us all in a real bad spot.
We can't let that happen.
I can't let that happen.
I won't let that happen.
Do you even know what grief her little sloth is gonna cost us?
"Well, I'll tell you."
"Two of the idiots that she ventilated, were engaged."
Do you know who'll they're gonna marry?
The Police Chief's stepdaughters.
And you can bet the house once they sort out all these rubbish.
"Boss is gonna be held accountable, next to that, a garden of variety gang war would be a sunday stroll."
- There was a dead guy at the bottom of the steps.
- He saw me!
"Can I ask you a question, Ma'am?"
Do you always work by yourself?
Yes.
Is it lonely?
What's that to you?
Just wondering.
How did he manage to hide a twin brother from us?
"Sir, Mikhail never communicated with him."
"If he had, we'd have known."
All right.
"Well, in less than 56 hours that bank in Nice opens the safe deposit box... and we all read about ourselves in the ""New York Times""."
If that happens... we'll be spending the rest of our lives wondering how we screwed up so badly.
Washington doesn't like federal agents... working for the Russian mob.
Our names are on that list.
Get the brother.
Convince him to work with us in Nice.
We don't have any options.
We'll get him.
"And, guys, keep this one alive."
I doubt if they were triplets.
Triplets.
"Alex, what are you doing?"
Look at this mess.
"Maybe if you told me what you're looking for, I could help you find it."
I wouldn't know what to tell you.
I'm just looking.
What'd you find?
He knew about me.
What'd you do in the war?
Sniper.
Why wait five years to find me?
Jimmy!
You in there?
"Open up, you shithead!"
This stuff's hot!
This is not your lucky day.
Tell your boss to leave me the fuck alone!
"Lvan, you look like your parrot died."
"Yes, that's a fine poem."
"So the ""glass"" remained intact?"
"Yes, it remained intact."
He'll be saved.
"- Doctor, do you mind if I smoke?"
"- No, you should mind."
- What?
- You should mind.
Not me. lt's no concern of mine if you smoke.
The air is so pure here.
It'll take more than your cigarette to pollute it.
I only measure my strength with my lungs.
"If you're in good health, carry on."
"Doctor, what's your speciality?"
I don't have one.
"That way, I look after the whole body."
"If I specialised, I'd be limited."
You must have a lot of patients then.
Almost no one.
"I have to ride around, looking at nature's beauty, calling on people, doing the odd circumcision, giving jabs, piercing ears, etc."
"If I'm no use to others, at least I make the most of life."
I observe nature.
Observing nature is better than playing backgammon.
Or doing nothing.
"This is the place, doctor."
ldleness leads to corruption.
"Well, well, it's our invalid!"
She's my friend.
She's as old as Methuselah.
"Hello, are you well?"
It's been a while!
I have things to do.
- l am feeling hungry today.
I know.
"When you feel hungry, you come to my door."
"Otherwise, why would you come to me?"
What would you like to eat?
Shall I serve you the breast?
- No!
- The heart...the ears..
- No!
"- The eyes, then?"
No!
I feel like eating the brain today.
The brain?
The police has eaten away my brain.
Where from shall I serve you?
I am not talking of your brain.
I am talking of a goat's brain!
Where does the goat have brain?
"Yes, I did find a goat with a brain."
"When I was about to slaughter it, the goat pleaded not to slay him since he was appearing for S.S.C. exams."
I advised the goat against it since he had to die some day.
He didn't pay heed.
"Today, he is making rounds at the college."
How ridiculous!
What's the connection between a goat and the college?
The boys who attend college are like goats.
Sometimes they are at the mercy of a job sometimes at the mercy of a girl.
"All right, then."
"Treat me to an omlette, at least."
You will have to slog hard for that!
- Slog hard?
- Yes.
Lose half.
- Which half?
- The half you don't need.
- All right.
All right.
I'd miss you.
I'd miss you more than I can say.
Help me take this.
None on that side.
Keep going.
Let's go around this way.
Mrs. Cole?
"Watch yourself, girl."
- Mrs. Cole?
- Hmm?
- I thought you was under it.
- I was in the office.
Hmm.
"Okay, coming in from the left."
I might have to borrow clothes.
"Talk to the costumes mistress, but don't be surprised if she's tetchy."
A parachute mine took the roof off Studio Four last night and her Panzer division uniforms are ruined.
They're saying it was the worst night of bombing yet.
"Nothing left of Wimbledon, apparently."
"The props master hasn't turned up, the best boy's in hospital, and no one knows where the grip is, so we're having to make do with whatever we can get."
It's got a bit of a wobble.
Might have to lash it to the gantry.
"There'll be tears before bedtime, mark my words."
"No, you've got a bit of a wobble."
- Chick.
"Could we save that lamp till we roll, please?"
"Sorry, Mr. Hilliard."
"If I just tell them once,"
You shall not find a place even in the market.
Brother!
Very good!
"Brother, very good."
Good to see this part of you today.
"You have educated yourself to grow so big that,"
You raised your hand on your elder brother.
That too for the sake of this girl?
Be happy in your world.
Before I go I shall give you a word.
"You shall not come for my burial, after I die."
When you need your brother... you may even ask for my life.
Your brother will lay down his life for you.
I can't even ask you for forgiveness.
My brothers have left me worthless in my own view.
"Come, I shall drop you home."
"""Be it love or god, it goes away like this""."
"""It feels as though every prayer have become worthless""."
Sheen!
"""I gathered every bit to make a home""."
"""But somehow the winds go to know of it""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Love is off the target at times""."
"""On one side is Love and on the other is the world""."
"""Love is off the target at times""."
Are you crazy?
!
Nora!
Here.
Thanks.
"She doesn't understand me, so I got nervous  and let the tray fall down."
- It doesn't matter.
"I'm nice to her and I even gave her money, because she needs money."
- I had this well prepared.
"Tom, it doesn't fucking matter."
Nothing here is prepared.
Can you make breakfast for two?
Two?
Right away.
Leave it alone!
Just leave it alone for now.
"It's okay, we'll leave it alone."
We'll leave it alone.
Just a moment.
Pull yourself together.
"Hello, I'm Josephine Reiter."
Franz is starting up a commune.
This is no commune.
I met Josephine at an entrepreneur's seminar.
She was my marketing instructor.
"Great, and what does that have to do with me?"
Actually this is a historical location here.
But now my cousin wants to set up some sort of Christian-Communist enclave.
- Certainly there are people out there that would be interested.
"Maybe not here, but in general."
Am I right?
Certainly you can turn this in to something.
"I would have preferred him to be guilty, but alive."
This hanging is a horrible story.
It's not our fault.
We should have better monitored him.
"You, especially."
"You're my assistant, right?"
I can not have eyes everywhere.
"So when the judge will be here, be available to him."
With deference.
"Otherwise, you will return to ""La Santé"" jailhouse."
If you knew the trouble I was given to be posted here.
This is an entry permit.
Mr Fandor?
"It is unfortunate that the procurator authorizes a journalist, especially today."
I know you really want to kiss your brother but will you be able to endure the test?
Open the door.
Nibet.
"We lay back Mr Dollon on his bed, Mr judge."
He seems to sleep.
"Damn, the dead has left."
"Listen, let's be serious,"
- you're in the wrong cell.
- But no!
You see that he is not here.
He was here a few minutes ago.
You're fooling us..
He was moved elsewhere.
Impossible.
I'm the only one with keys.
Anyone know where the corpse from cell 12 is?
No one came.
The dead was here.
Hey.
- Hey.
"- Any luck with the sponsor, hunt?"
Nobody's made a donation since Sonny Newman was alive.
"Check this out, bro."
They're back in town.
Been here a while I guess.
They came into the copy shop to design this for some kind of business that they run.
But get this.
"Back in 2002, they won the lottery."
Brought back the Chiefs for one season and then became these big time poker players.
- So are you thinking...
- They lived here.
They played hockey.
They got lots of cash.
"So when the Chiefs folded, we took our lottery money and we went gambling."
"Roulette, dice, poker, Vegas, Atlantic City."
We were high rollers.
"But it was an empty life, you know."
"Babes, booze, bar fights."
"Our wives left us, took our kids."
You guys have kids?
"- Yeah, we got three of them."
"- Yeah, one each."
"Yeah, the judge said we weren't good role models."
Said we have to find peace and balance.
"That night during wrestling, I saw a TV ad for Peace and Balance."
- So we bought a franchise.
- Zenovation.
- So how's business?
- Sucks.
- Real bad.
There's a field drag effect too.
We're having to use a lot of power to maintain our speed and heading.
"Avon, I saw Mandrian with this."
Then he put it back in the bottom of Sara's flight bag.
What is it?
That's what I want you to tell me.
[ALARM]
Look!
Filtration malfunction.
We'd better get down there.
- Dr Kendall wants you.
- Filter plant?
There's been another killing.
[ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE]
[ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE]
Tell me what happened.
"I was coming past, and I heard a noise."
So I looked inside.
Mandrian was just as you see him.
"Sonheim was standing over him, with this dagger in his hand."
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him!
Power reserves are almost gone
"In 103 minutes, it will no longer be possible to operate force wall and main drive simultaneously."
Please decide which to close down.
Without main drive we'll never get out of this.
Without the force wall we'll be smashed to pieces!
Have the locators detected the outer edge of the storm yet?
No.Yes!
No.
Maybe.
"Which is it, Vila?"
With each round trip to The bluff costing thousands...
Let's go ahead and get That anchor set.
Shawn can't afford To come up empty again.
Anchors away!
It's the only miles I can hike today underwater.
"So today, he's hoping to Get maximum mobility underwater."
By trying something new...
Harnessing a mini-dredge And oxygen supply to his back.
"Hopefully, we didn't come out Here, spend all this time."
And money for nothing.
"If there's gold on the claim, I'm gonna know about it today."
On the bottom.
Big boulders.
Big boulders.
Copy?
"Okay, I got you."
Copy.
How's the visibility?
Good.
Just go ahead And cut me loose.
"Okay, shawn, I've cut you loose."
That's good.
I'm working my way over here.
There's a lot.
I cut the dredge loose From the pier.
So the dredge can go away From this big boat.
And we can stay on anchor And safe.
And look how far he just Walked.
"He just walked 50, 80 feet."
"Free from any constraints,"
Shawn marches along the Seafloor At depths of over 25 feet.
Not seeing anything here.
- A first date like a game show.
- I didn't mean to lecture.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call it a date."
It's just rare that I meet a person I can discuss these things with.
- Some pepper?
"- No, not for me."
Could you bring me a side dish of extra dressing please?
"I don't particularly like salad, I just like the dressing."
Ah.
"This twin-prime conjecture, it's interesting."
Are there still pairs like that past a million?
I can't believe you thought of that.
That is what is to be proven.
I have concert tickets next Saturday.
I was wondering if we can do this again.
- Sure.
- Great.
Terrific.
What was it you wanted to discuss about my teaching?
I have a confession to make.
That was just an excuse to meet you.
I hope you don't mind.
Mind?
I found it interesting.
"I have many questions, the first of which is, how do you get them to stay?"
Well?
- Nothing.
- What happened to your hair?
Don't ask.
- You won't be seeing him again?
- We're going out next week.
"So, he must like you."
But you will not get 20 lakhs.
You will get 50 thousand or 1 lakh.
I will get it ready in 2 days time.
- You won't do it.
- Why?
"Though people can work hard, you provide rice for Rs. 2 per kg."
And make them lazy fellows.
You give houses for the poor.
You provide employment for the youth.
You provide free electricity and loans to farmers.
"During elections, you waive the loans."
You give everything to everyone.
Why don't you care about children?
What sin have they committed?
Is it because children are not eligible to vote?
How much can we get selling this house?
To the bankers?
This house is on loan.
How much do you have in your account?
Rs. 10 lakhs.
Give me a cheque.
For what?
"I said do it, father."
Rs. 10 lakhs...?
What made you think that I will give you the money?
"Since he married my daughter, I forgave him  made him my PA."
I challenged you that I will make you fall at my feet.
What made you think that I will forgive and give you the money?
Who won?
Me or him?
To make my heart wet...
Came this drizzle of smile...
Although...
"I have to admit, she does seem a little different."
"Remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground."
Like this?
A little more.
Now...
Why is distillation an important step?
To remove the toxins from the ferassin root?
Precisely.
"We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic shock, now, would we?"
"No, father."
"Seriously,"
Have you seen anything like this before?
"No, I have not."
She is unlike any wraith I've ever encountered.
What if it's all an act?
"If she were a killer,"
Why would he protect her?
"Well, maybe the act's for his benefit, too."
"They live here together, Rodney."
"If she were like other wraith,"
He would be her first victim.
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Go ahead.
We just got back with Beckett.
Ronon's going to take him up to the cave.
I'm going to check in with the villagers.
What are you going to tell them?
I'm still working on that.
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?
"Oh, here and there."
"Don't mess with the clever, quiet one."
"Why are you so negative about it all, John?"
I enjoyed sharing a cell with you.
I learned a lot.
Why have you got your eyes closed?
"Cos when I open them again I'll be waking up in my nice, cosy cell and you won't be with me."
I'm still here.
"- What do you do for them, Calum?"
- You know...
Pretty much what I've always done.
"Multi-tasking, bits and bobs, needles and pins."
"Not quite how the judge described it at your sentencing, was it?"
What do they want us to do?
Do the stuff the law can't do.
Dealing with people the law can't reach.
"Come on, John, you're the clever one."
Have you not worked it out yet?
Check out the CVs.
Who can make sure the cat is most definitely dead?
Doof!
You're the specialist.
You're the killer.
"# Oh, know how I love you"
# As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
# And the rosebuds... #
"Morning, flatmate."
Did you sleep well?
I made some breakfast.
I'd have made some for you but that was the last of the bacon.
- As they always this noisy upstairs?
- Mm.
I like it.
It's a distraction for him.
Can you imagine the pressure that he's under?
"Plus, it means that Patty... whatever her name is is going to have to bear more of the burden, which is great."
She's never tried a case.
You've never tried a case.
I didn't go to Laverne Law School.
Wow.
"Look at you, so confident."
- [click]
- Lucy:
Thank you.
So McBride is going to file for a continuance.
It would be malpractice not to.
And I say that we oppose it strongly.
- Are you sure about that?
- Absolutely.
"Every single day that this case drags on,"
"Borns Tech is vulnerable to a decline in stock value, and that makes America vulnerable."
"I mean, letting a nobody like Billy McBride hold up a great corporation with a frivolous and ridiculous lawsuit?"
"It's not just wrong, it endangers everything that matters to our c-c... c-c-c... c-c... [deep inhale] country."
[exhale]
Ahem.
"Lucy, do you need me to fill a prescription for you?"
F-- [chuckle]
I'm fine.
Yeah.
You seem...fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I swear.
I'm fine.
Man:
Now shut your trap.
- You mean you won't go?
- No!
And if you mention gold temples again to me...
I'll tear the back right off you with a shovel.
"Very well, MacChesney, you made your choice."
I offered you the chance to be a millionaire... and you turned it down.
"All right, I'm going alone."
Wait a minute!
"Cutter, you ain't leaving this village without my permission."
Give me that bottle.
I've been a soldier for 14 years.
I know my duties as well as you do.
"But you're not talking to a soldier now, you're talking to an expedition."
I'm an expedition.
Out of my way.
"Cutter, sit down before I throw you down."
"Make way for the expedition, if you know what's good for you."
Goodbye forever.
Stand back.
I'll throw you in the clink if you make a move.
Out of my way before I split your jaw.
"- Cutter, I'm warning you."
"- Come on, put 'em up."
"Come on, out of my way."
"I'll bash your ugly face in, that's what I'll do."
"Come on, put 'em up."
I'm afraid I have to do it.
Sgt. Ballantine.
- What?
- Come here.
Poor fellow's taken with a dizzy spell.
Stop this.
I'll be beheaded if you don't choose francis anyway.
I'd rather die today
To show you that I mean every word that I say.
Is this some kind of trick?
Test me.
Ask nostradamus to explain
How the future he sees for you and francis
Has altered since clarissa's death.
"Oh, yes."
Be sure.
Be very sure.
"I would want every certainty, too."
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure about anything.
"I believe you, but..."
You don't know what you want.
I love them.
I love them both.
"Begging your pardon, your majesties,"
But the king demands your presence.
A messenger has arrived with news
About the line of succession of England.
Their queen...
Is dead.
And she has named me her successor?
"After all her deliberations, they say she died"
Suddenly...
In the night.
"But England is yours by bloodline, by right."
"You must claim it immediately,"
Or your cousin elizabeth will seize it from your grasp.
You didn't call!
- Don't come here and intimidate me!
I waited all day.
Who are you?
How can you stand yourself?
"We tried to contact you several times, but we couldn't find you."
Come on.
You're filthy rich.
You could have hired an army.
It abviously took more than an army to find you.
To find a junkie drinking in India with hookers.
You hid my daughter for 20 years because I cheated once?
"Do you really think that's why, Jacob?"
Because you cheated once?
You're a very small person.
- What are you telling me?
- You're not listening.
- Then tell me.
Tell me!
- Let's all calm down a little.
Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?
- We'd have figured something out.
- I didn't know until I got back.
I met Jørgen and...
"No, Jacob, I don't owe you anything."
You don't owe...
Aren't we talking about your daughter?
- Shouldn't she know her father?
"- She has a father, a good father."
I don't know what the hell to say.
What you did is so wrong.
"You know that, right?"
"Oh, that's good."
will you excuse me while I put on my pretty new dress?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
I understand there's to be a little card party here tonight to which we ladies are cordially not invited.
That's right.
Where--?
Where is stella?
She's out there on the porch.
I'm going to ask a favor of you in a moment.
"well, now, what's that gonna be, I wonder."
Some buttons in back.
You may enter.
How do I Iook?
You look okay.
"well, thanks."
Now the button.
"well, I can't do no more with them."
"You men with your big, clumsy fingers."
-May I have a drag on your cig?
"-Yeah, have one for yourself."
"Why, thank you."
It--
It looks like my trunk has exploded.
Me and stella was helping you unpack.
You certainly did a fast and thorough job of it.
"well, certainly looks like you raided some stylish shops in Paris, BIanche."
clothes are my passion.
How much does it cost for a string of furs like that?
"Why, these were a tribute from an admirer of mine."
He must have had a Iot of admiration.
"In my youth I excited some admiration, but look at me now."
Move out of the way.
You.
"Yes, you."
Get out.
"This is private property, get off it now."
Move!
Who let him in here?
Do you have any idea who that is?
That's Vigol from The Daily Mail.
All he's responsible for is stirring up trouble and writing malicious gossip like that bloody curse story.
Communication with the press is only allowed with The Times.
I will not tolerate any exceptions.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes.
- Where are you going?
"- Home, Howard."
I'm not a schoolboy.
CARNARVON:
Are you looking forward to the opening?
Everything's ready.
I've emptied it all out apart from the two guardian statues.
- I thought they should stay.
- Why not?
"You will cover up our little hole, won't you?"
I wouldn't want Lacau seeing that.
I wish we could get rid of that bloody man.
"But we have to deal with him, we mustn't forget that."
Try a little flattery.
Always works with the froggies.
You know you should never have signed that deal with The Times.
It's only made matters worse.
I thought it was what you wanted.
"The, um, autograph defense."
Exactly.
"So if the print won't do it, maybe what's inside"
The print will.
Now you lost me.
I'm gonna break down
The chemical compound in coop's fingerprint.
"Within that, I think there may be something he can't refute."
"Dimethicone silicone- based lubricant,"
And cells consistent with lambskin.
Lambskin?
That's a condom.
Exactly.
Coop was wearing a condom.
So was anna's rapist.
This spectra has a unique chemical signature.
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna run it against the spectra from anna's sex kit.
¶ ¶
"So, um, what kind of condom do I use?"
What's my favorite?
My brand of choice?
I rarely use them.
"So it's kind of a, um,"
Personal question.
"Actually, it's evidence."
Really?
There were specific traces
In anna kitson that we also found
In the oil of your fingerprint.
That print is the same as the one on the murder weapon.
"So, just to get this straight, you raped anna,"
You're so naive.
"Decontamination work only pays 10,000 yen per day, 20 days per month."
The fish cake factory pays 750 yen per hour.
"You know, even deciding to buy clothes used to be a dilemma, pacing back and forth, not sure if I should."
"Now, if it's under 20,000 yen, I just buy it."
Being poor is unthinkable now.
"Talking with the cast and crew is fun, and I get to meet cool people."
"When I get makeup done and wear costumes,"
I start to become someone else and forget the bad stuff.
"Porn is legitimate work, so I don't feel guilty at all."
"Can you tell Mom and Dad you're doing porn, then?"
No.
You shouldn't do work you can't tell your parents about.
What about you?
Why are you here?
Weren't you at Grand Pacific?
I was fired.
Why?
None of your business.
This is a love hotel.
Can you tell Mom and Dad?
What if I do?
Go ahead.
"Sorry, excuse me."
"Azusa, we're ready for you now."
- Okay.
- Thank you.
"Don't tell Mom and Dad, okay?"
It'll make them sad.
It makes...
Will you take a picture with us?
"Sure, of course."
Thank you.
Pushing more dye.
"Oh yeah, there we go."
Look at the shape there.
All squished up like a Takotsubo vase.
like a Takotsubo vase.
"See that, that's textbook."
"Um, Nik..."
"What you got baby, you got a broken heart."
"- Oh Sam, don't..."
"- No, baby."
"No, I'm serious, baby."
You have stress cardiomyopathy.
"Yeah, it's also called broken heart syndrome."
"It's associated with sudden, intense emotional or physical stress."
The muscles around your heart took such a beating when you got the news about Stephanie that they're just having a hard time keeping up now.
You really do have a broken heart.
But we can treat this.
"I can't lie to you, we've got to go through this entire night incident-free."
"If we can do that, you're gonna be fine."
Hey!
We need a doctor!
What the hell happened?
Kid started complaining of a sore throat in the car.
"- Started wheezing, choking..."
- Let's get him on the bed.
Pike!
No verbal or motor responses.
What the hell is...
That's bruising around his neck!
Looks fresh.
Sats at 90 and falling.
It won't happen again.
You're damn right it won't!
Next time something like that happens the little girl is coming out of the window with a bullet in her head.
ERIC:
Mary.
"Oh, what the hell, Ray?"
Leave the little girl alone.
You stay right there.
You sad little man.
Who do you think you are?
God?
You shut up.
"He's not God, Dorothy."
He's just a poor excuse for a man.
A man without any faith.
Faith?
You're gonna talk to me about faith?
"God comes down and, pluck, there goes your son, no more Luke."
Bye-bye.
Why?
"Dale, why?"
Because He's up in His Heaven and all's right with the world?
Or because we live in a stinking sewer where nothing makes one bit of sense?
RAY:
But you have faith.
"Your son dies for no reason, but you have faith."
"You get taken and tortured, but you have faith."
( Ray laughs )
"If I didn't, then I wouldn't have any reason to go on living."
"Then you crawl away and you die, because this right here-- this is as much sense as the world will ever make."
What are you doing?
I told you I didn't want anyone killed.
- Lauren.
"- Oh, my God."
Don't get me started on that girl.
How could you be so cold and frigid?
- She's like a freaking speculum.
- She's here.
"Hi, Kenzi."
Hey.
"You know, as your doctor I should recommend against excessive intoxication."
Who's drunk?
"Well, we don't know the effects of cocktails on your abilities."
"Well, I am not a guy, so I can promise you booze does not affect my ability to perform."
"I wouldn't wanna be on the receiving end of a drunken Succubus booty call, so take it easy."
- No promises.
Keep an eye on her.
"Okay, I don't know if it's from the buckthorn hallucinations but that was some serious sparkage."
- I think she likes you.
"- No, it doesn't matter."
"It doesn't matter, because Lauren is human."
"I sleep with her, and she dies."
This guy-
"- This guy on the other hand, he has sexual chi to burn."
He's right behind you.
A woman as lovely as yourself shouldn't be alone.
"Well, I'm not."
There's two of you.
I'm Samir.
- Bo.
- I know.
Everybody knows.
"The one who won't choose a side, neither light nor dark."
Exciting.
Isabel.
"Dr. Jacobs, there's a private matter"
I wish to discuss with you.
"Um, nurse oaks?"
"- Yes, madame?"
- My apologies.
"Nurse oaks, please show them the garden."
Yes?
It would be my pleasure.
"Please, come this way."
"Yes, Dr. Jacobs, there is the private matter that I would..."
"Right this way, please."
You'll find this is a lovely spot to come read a book or just enjoy the view of the woods.
"The gardens are lovely, don't you think?"
Roderick.
"They're quite nice, I must admit."
"Yes, indeed."
What order shall be taken with the prisoners?
Shoot them in the head.
I suspect witchcraft in the beast.
Where the evil which thou has driven to mingle with my being will slip away like a dream.
"Lucy, this is not a good time."
"Like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers, which will no longer taint my breath in the garden of Eden."
Is that hawthorne?
What do you mean?
"You were quoting one of Mr. hawthorne's twice-toldtales, were you not?"
I do not know what you speak of.
Did he send you?
Is this a test?
"There you are, Lucy."
"My apologies, nurse oaks."
It won't happen again.
So...radio stations in here?
"Little kday, little old-school rap for me."
"Definitely the first person to check out the radio on the backstretch, which is the fastest part of the course."
"Oh, my God."
There it is.
[ Tires screech ]
A happy tire is a squealing tire.
"That's right, making stig proud."
Good speed on the backstretch.
"All right, coming through the last turn here."
"Nice and smooth, and across the line."
[ Cheers and applause ]
"Lake, come on up."
So lovely.
How are you?
"Have a seat, please."
"It's nice, right?"
How'd it go in the suzuki?
"It's fun to say the word ""suzuki,"" you know?"
[ Laughter ]
"- So, that's, like, good news."
- Right.
"But otherwise, in terms of fastness and times, all that..."
I hope I didn't let you down.
"Oh, come on."
"No, you didn't."
"Let's just get comfortable with being in the lower Echelon, and then I'll be more comfortable with it."
Do I look comfortable?
"Everybody's gonna be comfortable because you are a beautiful woman that loves cars, so they already love you."
I love cars.
I love cars.
How'd you get into cars?
- to save your family.
- And I would not wish the pain of that failure upon anyone.
I would rather live with that pain than this.
"And that's just the thing, Sara."
"Look, if you were able to try to save Laurel, then you wouldn't be alive at all."
Then fine.
I don't care.
"When we left, when I recruited you, we... we... we altered the timeline."
"Now had it remained the same, then Damien Darhk would have..."
He would have killed not only you and...
"and your sister, but your father as well."
"But, Rip, if... if we go back, and we take the team..."
The outcome would be exactly the same.
You don't know that.
- I'm afraid that I do.
- No.
I...
There's got to be a way.
"Rip, I have to be able to do something."
I'm so sorry.
"Look, I can't."
Can't do this without my sister.
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
"You are one of the strongest people I have ever met, Sara."
Laurel...
"Laurel may be beyond your saving, but Kendra and Carter, they might not be."
"Captain, we are prepared to make the time jump to 1944."
"We're on our way, Gideon."
We've arrived in Saint-Lô.
"No sign of Kendra yet, but I have located"
"Vandal Savage, and he does not seem to be alone."
"Sorry, don't think it'd be ethical to tell you their names."
Goodbye.
Marion.
- Thanks for today.
- Anytime.
"How about tomorrow, for instance?"
I can't remember when I've had so much fun.
"I've almost forgotten the silly, wonderful things there are for two people to do."
It isn't over yet.
"Mike, please."
"- I don't think we'd better, I mean it!"
"- Connie, listen..."
"All right, let's talk about this."
I don't want to talk.
I just want you to leave.
- Just like that?
- That's right.
"- We're not kids, we're adults."
- And we'll behave like adults.
"I kissed you, you kissed me."
"That's affection, not carnality."
"That's not lust, you should know the difference."
What do you call a man who thinks about nothing but...?
Human.
All men are alike.
The approach is different but the result is always the same.
"Sooner or later, we get to this."
"If all I wanted was a woman, I could get one in a bar, in a hotel lobby..."
Or in my home?
- I'm not gonna let you make this dirty.
- What do you call it?
I'll tell you a truth about yourself.
"Okay, good."
I think we just solved a murder.
The sun is in our eyes and in our hearts even when it's night and when it's dark.
"The moon still glows, the stars still shine,"
Now and forever until the end of time.
What do you think?
I think you need to dig deeper.
What does that mean?
I can't tell you that.
"It's just, like, part of the journey."
"You look pretty, Mama."
"Thank you, baby."
"I'm gonna go get my notebook, okay?"
I wrote more poems.
That's great.
"So, keep an eye on Jess and Naomi, shut down any fist fights, and..."
"Yeah, I shouldn't be too late."
So are you still in business?
"As a doctor, I remain a member of society with a special obligation to all of my fellow human beings."
I don't think you have to be a doctor to have that obligation.
What do you mean?
I want in.
We could be partners.
I already have a partner.
"Well, then I'll be your receptionist."
It doesn't work like that.
"Mary, I need a career change, and we'd make a great team."
"Let's talk about this later, shall we?"
You need me.
I love you.
"Hey, where are you going, anyway?"
A funeral.
Tie it to Steve's leg.
"Now, I want everybody out of here."
We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
I'll get the men from the barracks.
You think you can snatch Dunbar?
Not from the S.S.
We're sure gonna make a stab at it.
"Duke, Price, Stosh, Harry, meet at the north latrine."
You'll all get your posts.
"Now, everybody start drifting out, one by one."
"Easy, boys, easy."
Disperse out there nicely.
"Remember, just because the Krauts are dumb that doesn't mean they're stupid."
- Ready?
-Roger.
"Okay, move out."
I don't know what your scheme is.
it sounds crazy.
"It may be, but it's better than having Dunbar dead."
I guess you're right.
How about me going out and keeping Schulz off balance?
- Good.
- I wouldn't worry about Schulz.
I'd worry about Sefton.
Remember me?
I'm the stoolie.
"You ain't gonna squeal this one, brother."
No?
Aren't you afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound?
"For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?"
"You're gonna stay here in the barracks, and not a peep out of you."
"Okay then, put a guard on me."
You know that.
"Does it really matter, Jamal?"
It don't matter if it matters.
It's corporate.
Take it to go.
Can I have my check?
Wipe that down before you leave.
Is this both weeks?
Jamal:
Same as always.
"You don't know me, but this is not me."
I don't suffer complicated women.
"But Laura, you know, she's got me..."
She's got me making exceptions.
So this chick lives in the same house she lived in with her ex?
Yes.
- And he owns the house.
- Correct.
- And they're not fucking?
- Nope.
"So he's giving her a dope house for free, taking her to all these high-end events, and she's not giving it up?"
"Yo, I got to find me a guy like this."
You think she's full of shit?
"Look, I don't know her."
"No, but I'm asking for your opinion 'cause my instincts are askew."
"No dude's ever given me anything for free, period."
"If she's fucking him, I don't know when she's doing it because I'm with her all the fucking time."
"Well, she's not with you now."
"What, you don't think people fuck during the daytime?"
[Blender whirring]
Of course.
"I mean, people fuck at all times."
Her and my grandpa own a bunch of them.
"This is supposed to be the model home, but it never got finished."
Why?
"Did someone die here, and now it's haunted?"
"Yes, that's exactly what happened."
What did happen?
I don't know.
How do contractors just disappear?
"If we don't have a model home, we don't have a new development."
It's been a month.
I'm not waiting for you guys anymore.
You know where to reach me.
No luck with the contractors?
Vanished.
My father's never gonna let me hear the end of this.
Did you talk to Seth?
I think so.
But don't blame yourself.
I'm not blaming myself.
But how can I allow a strange boy to live in this house?
Seth needs to know it's what any mother would do.
I was talking about the contractors.
So you want him to stay here?
"Well, I mean, I know the place needs some sprucing up, but..."
"God, did I just say ""sprucing""?"
"So, Ryan, what do you think?"
I haven't really had time to think.
But how much better is this place than some group home?
And wait till you see the best part.
It's an empty pool.
To some people.
"So, your mom."
"So, from now on, I will try to trust you, wherever you go and whatever you do."
So...
"Soo Bin, I would like it if you trusted me too."
I won't run away again.
So... from now on...
Believe in me.
Please.
Han Gyul.
The guy you beat up last time...
- The one I fought...
- The one you fought...
Choi Chan Gyu...
He wants to fight you one more time.
"The reason you keep failing your exam... is because you spend all your time working part-time jobs, isn't it?"
There's nothing I can do about that.
Don't you regret giving up that special position at the agency?
I don't regret it.
"If I took that, that would mean I would never see you or Shi Yoon again."
"Especially you, Jung Yeon."
You're even supplying the entertainment.
You seem to be having a blast.
You said you wanted to fight.
Are you on a date instead?
Jung Yeon.
"It's dangerous, go over there."
"Hey, speak with some respect."
Isn't it obvious that I'm older than you?
I'm taller too.
I'll keep these guys out of it.
"We'll fight, one on one."
- Since you asked for it.
- What if I win?
I was afraid of people walking in the streets.
"The more movement I saw around me, the more I wanted to be still."
I'm sure things weren't as bad as I remember them now.
Are you coming to the rehearsal?
-Well...
One of the songs is going to amaze you.
Then I'll go for sure.
Even now I can't understand everything that happened back then.
I felt such panic I wanted to go back to the madhouse.
Stop thinking about it.
The funniest thing was when Laura left that guy...
She almost reproached me for my apathy.
Are you writing in your diary?
How do you know I have a diary?
You told me.
I'm sure I didn't tell you anything.
But are you writing it?
Yes.
And what is it about?
About what happens to me.
Some stuff.
You're not very talkative today.
I'm upset.
With me?
With mom.
Don't tell her about the diary.
I won't.
You always end up telling her everything.
- I won't say a word.
She'd start asking... and as I won't say anything she'd look for it everywhere.
Did you hide it?
Don't think I'm gonna tell you where it is.
"Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear old princie to fall in love with you."
"That is, he's got to kiss you."
"Not just any kiss, the kiss of true love."
"If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human permanently."
"But if he doesn't, you'll turn back into a mermaid... and... you belong to me!"
"No, Ariel!"
[muffled]
Have we got a deal?
"If I become human,"
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
That's right!
But you'll have your man.
"[Chuckles] Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?"
[Cackles]
Oh!
And there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing.
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.
"Just a token really, a trifle."
You'll never even miss it.
What I want from you is... your voice.
- My voice?
"- You've got it, sweetcakes."
"No more talking, singing."
Zip!
"But without my voice, how can I..."
"You'll have your looks, your pretty face."
And don't underestimate the importance of body language!
Ha!
♪ The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
What?
This operation was not officially sanctioned.
- Excuse me?
- London vetoed the mission.
They still think Crawford is in custody in Kenya.
"Which is where he would be, if everything had gone to plan."
- I took a calculated risk.
- Fuck that.
- We need the information on Latif.
- And fuck you.
"Yeah, in latex, I know."
Shall we save the recriminations till later?
Let's get you to safety.
Wait.
Dieter's file say that he was a chopper pilot.
"It's a long shot but they might have a bird out here, to extract Clare and Crawford after the exchange."
How unfortunate that you killed him then.
Is it worth a hand job if I didn't?
"Hello, Dieter."
I'm Colonel Grant.
British Military Intelligence.
Don't move.
"Please, don't move."
"If I push this, an air bubble will go into your heart and kill you."
It's a very nasty way to go.
It's just insurance.
You were going to kill my men after all.
- No.
"We weren't, we..."
"- Shh, shh, shh, shh."
Now I can choose not to kill you.
So shall we discuss where your transport is?
- Thank you.
Come on in back.
I got a new baby lamb.
"Oh, I'd love to see it."
"Oh, it's darling."
I didn't show you my lizard.
I keep him in a box right there.
"I got some holes punched in it, just so he can breathe."
His name is Pocahontas.
"Used to be, a man didn't have to cook his own meals in his own house."
Times have changed.
"Ma's working, and I'm late for church."
"The way you parade yourself up and down, taking off your clothes..."
- I don't parade up and down.
- You do!
- You just like to show yourself off.
- I don't like to show off!
"Just because we don't live in a palace, doesn't mean we have to act like pigs."
"- We've got a trash can, remember?"
"- Well, well, well."
"If you don't pick it up, somebody else has to."
And it wouldn't harm you to take the garbage out and bury it.
Or do you like living like a pig?
"What do you think you are, always giving orders?"
Take your hands off of me!
Don't you touch her.
Don't you touch her anymore!
Just a little family fracas.
Guess my little girl's getting too big to spank.
"It was my fault, Allison."
I made him mad.
Every family has fights.
"Police are questioning the victims' acquaintances, and are expanding their investigation."
"Jung Ki-ho, reporting from Nam Mountain."
Sure you didn't do it?
I didn't.
- Then who?
- I don't know.
Are you sure?
"- You did it, didn't you?"
- Don't!
Why would I kill them?
I asked if you took my cellphone.
We will see a lunar eclipse within the next weeks.
The weather bureau reported that this will be the biggest...
This is my food.
Where have you been?
You scared me.
Have something on your mind lately?
I understand that kids your age want to hold on to a secret.
"Your father understands, okay?"
Thanks.
All I want to give you is one advice.
"Whatever you've eaten until now, whether it be raw or boiled, if you want to eat something from now on, you can't lick your chops, I mean, you can't eat it."
- Understand?
- Don't wake me up.
Can you breathe in there?
Where can I hide it this time?
You've worked too hard.
Who's there?
Surprise!
Happy birthday!
"I knew it was your birthday, so I wanted to surprise you."
Was it too surprising?
"What you did was righteous, but the magistrate will disagree."
Stay away from Ahsan for a while.
But...
"Wherever you go, whatever you do, don't lose the spirit and courage you showed today."
"And someday, you will restore your grandfather's good name and revive this clan."
You will be able to change the world as you so desire.
Father...!
Are we doing the right thing?
Let him go.
Heaven has made him with a purpose I'm sure...
"Forgive me, sir..."
Yi Soon-shin?
That bastard is out to destroy me!
"Yi Soon-shin, that bastard!"
Soon-shin!
Chun-su!
Where are you going alone?
"You're not running away without me, are you?"
Chun-su...
I'm coming with you.
I'm sick of this place.
What am I going to do here in Ahsan without you and without my father?
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
Let's stop and rest for a while?
"No, we have to be out of Chun-an before dawn."
But I can't take another step!
We have to go.
I can't!
Let me get a drink of water at least.
"Chun-su, let's get going!"
Hold your horses?
What do you know about a drug called Knipex?
Knipex.
"Ah, it's a dopamine agonist used to treat neurological disorders."
"Stops tremors, that sort of thing."
Wow.
Even I feel bad trying to win a bet against a guy who's sick.
But not that bad.
All right.
"Thanks, Mike."
"Hi, honey."
[Sighs]
I knew I'd find you here.
But you left so quickly last night.
"Well, I was trying to call that health inspector."
Do you know how much money we're losing every day we're closed?
"Well, listen, overseeing Wolfgang Puck's new place, plus Opus,"
"Mystique, all the beverage and food operations..."
"You know, maybe it's just, you know, a little too much."
Is that it?
What?
It's overwhelming.
You're letting things slide.
Slide?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
That stuff happens.
Happens all the time.
"But the question is, how... how can we fix this?"
I cannot believe you have so little faith in me.
That inspector's just trying to get revenge on me for refusing to go out on a date with him.
"Come on, honey."
That report's a fake.
He made it all up.
"Michelangelo, can I?"
Can I ask you something?
"Do you think that something is, like, there, whether you look at it or not?"
"And... and do you think everything or every, every, every, every, everybody exists that ever was or ever will be?"
"Because, then, logically you don't have to do anything at all."
You can just sit and wait and wait for it all to happen but...
"But I don't want to wait, you know?"
Cos what if that's not true?
"I mean, free will must have something to do with it, otherwise what's the point of being alive?"
Have you got?
Have you got?
"Have you got, like, some place I could stay?"
I mean...
"I mean, would your mum?"
"Would your mum mind, if I?"
I...
I just really want to get away from... from all this.
"You know, like doing, like..."
like doing the show.
Doing the show again and...
And I thought...
And I...
But Rho...
"I mean, Rho..."
Rhoda said...
But I...
I thought...
I thought... maybe...
W... what... what do you think?
Michelangelo I would like you to record something for posterity.
And you keep it safe.
You understand?
"Hi, honey."
Didn't you have the same fight with him at breakfast?
This is the same fight as breakfast.
It's the same jar of peas and it's the same stubborn little boy who is not gonna get his own way.
"That baby thinks he is gonna break me, but he doesn't know who he's dealing with."
"Hal,"
I'm not about to lose it with a...
"God, how does he do that?"
"One, two, three, go!"
"Please, we have to stop."
I have to empty the blood out of my shoes again.
One last time.
"One, two, three, go!"
This is gonna be so great!
This is the answer.
What's the question?
"I don't know yet, but this is definitely the answer."
Would you look at this?
Jamie poured flour in the dryer.
Now I get to wear a loaf of bread to work tomorrow.
He destroys everything!
He's absolutely the worst kid we have ever had!
"Oh, you say that with every kid."
"Let's face it, Lois."
It's just the hand we were dealt.
God just doesn't like us.
That doesn't make us bad people.
"No, there's something different with Jamie."
He's not like the other ones.
"I'm telling you,I can see it in his eyes."
"Honey, calm down."
You know what will make you feel better?
Luxury liners have long had a tendency to sink...
"So that's how it all ended, but it seems that old witch was a spy for some country that dealt in slave trade."
And who were those men chasing after me?
Secret police...?
!
You should have told me!
It was a spur-of-the-moment decision.
"Someone else forgot his cell phone before, remember?"
I see...
"Because of you, I had to be tailed by these blokes."
These blokes...?
I'll forgive you this time.
It was sorta fun.
So long...
Be sure to tune in next time!
"Hi, I'm the quick-change artist, Hitomi Chidou."
"In the next episode, you'll meet a dirty robot who claims to be a support robot."
"Saying he's under orders from Headquarters, he makes us do things like take off our clothes!"
"Plus, we face an enemy who comes from outer space... and he's god-awful strong!"
"Tune in for ""Shooting Star from the Sky"""
on the next Great Dangaioh.
"Oh, I'm so mad!"
What awful weather...
"Send that file to Saga of the Stats Division, first."
Yes.
You'll get the details when the Commander returns.
Huh...?
Kuya...
Ohh...
I...
Who is it?
!
And I just couldn't handle it going down like that again.
You really like me?
I'm crazy about you.
"Well, I like hearing that... because I love you."
What?
But we never even...
You know.
"But we've talked on the phone every night for, like, a month, and I love talking to you."
I love hearing what you have to say about everything.
And I don't want to rush the other stuff if it means you're gonna freak out.
Because I want this to be something.
"So I'm fine with waiting, okay?"
"Just, no more chili cheese fries."
- They smell disgusting.
- Deal.
They say that the hallmark of a good negotiation is when neither side is particularly happy.
"Well, then this was a very good negotiation."
My people will hate this deal.
Yep.
"Mine, too."
"You didn't need to pull that whole ""helpless"" act on me, you know?"
"Sure, you say that now."
Seriously.
"I mean, you're a killer negotiator."
You don't need tricks.
You've got skills.
Hmm.
You're not too bad yourself.
"Oh, a word of advice, though..."
- I'd keep an eye on that daughter of yours.
- Are you kidding?
I've completely given up on that one.
(BRANCHES BREAKING)
Stop there.
Throw down your weapons.
We're screwed.
Maquis.
And who are they?
These are some assholes.
"Say that again, if you've got the balls."
You are assholes.
Fine.
You asked for it.
(Shoots a blank)
"You're the asshole, who cheats at cards."
"You couldn't beat me at cards if you wore a hood, Mariano."
You know each other?
"Yeah, they also work for the Ministry."
"So, you mean that all this is a joke."
"Yeah, we do it to all the new guys, like you."
Interesting sense of humor you have.
If we don't have a little fun now and then this will be the death of us.
"Come on, let's go."
Not a damn bit funny.
We're almost there.
Are you sure that the translator won't show up in Hendaye?
I took care of him.
"He'll spend a few weeks glued to the toilet,"
I assure you.
Why do I never get to seduce a beautiful woman instead of greasy lechers?
For the same reason we're going to see Hitler and not Ava Gardner.
"Look, her I did meet, but I must be the only one who doesn't brag about it."
Hitler.
There have been too many assholes in this world and I've met a lot of them.
"You're digging your own graves, you fools!"
"You do what we tell you, or you're digging yours."
[MEN SHOUTING]
[GUNSHOT]
"Listen, bigshot, you saw what Pollard just got, so order them gates to open up and take us to the car, or I'll blow your hair all over the ceiling."
"You haven't got the nerve, Dale."
You can't get away with this.
You'll spend the rest of your life in the Hole.
You got 10 seconds to find out whether I got the nerve.
"Ten seconds or 10 years, the answer will always be the same."
"Listen, you dirty rats in there."
"If these gates ain't open in 10 seconds,"
I'm killing Armstrong just like Pollard!
"Is that right, warden?"
Did they kill Pollard?
Never mind.
Don't open the gates.
Get on the phone.
Call for extra help.
"We have, warden."
"It's on the way, sir."
"This is it, Armstrong."
Don't you need the warden to make 'em open up the solitary?
"Yeah, yeah, that's right."
"I oughta give it to you now, but I got a date to keep with Stacey, and you're opening it up for him."
You're heading for the Hole.
Not a chance.
[MEN CHEERING]
"Get them keys, or I give it to Lang on the spot!"
"All right, men, all right!"
All right!
I'll open up.
- Petition!
"- Why fear the word ""mutiny""?"
- I'm not afraid of it if it fits but it don't.
"Seize one ship, that's mutiny."
No one ever got away.
"- Seize the fleet, nothing they can do."
- They can't hang every man.
We'll make them listen to us.
Until then spread the gospel.
Same as back at Spithead.
Yeah.
"Wait, and wait, and wait."
"Yes, Evans."
Wait.
Until the time comes.
"And when the time comes, Vizard..."
Scott-Padget!
"Mr. Kilpatrick, you've been before the board three times."
- Each time you've failed.
"- Yes, sir."
"- What age are you, 33, 34?"
- Thirty-five.
Thirty-five.
- Your chances are getting slight.
"- Yes, sir."
Unless the board had reason to believe you had special qualities.
"- Special qualities, sir?"
"- Ingenuity during difficulties courage, loyalty to a particular officer an officer with influence, who might use it."
"Yes, sir."
"I think I see, sir."
"You're in charge of disciplining midshipmen, right?"
- Make them kiss a gunner's daughter.
-How's it going?
"I'm okay, thank you, ish."
How are you?
"Yeah, good."
Yeah.
"So is that right, your mum's been sent to prison?"
"Like, what was it?"
Charges of fraud and gross malfeasance.
-Sounds as if you know all about it.
"-And so she's, like, banged up in there with all those slags and ratbags, like in Bad Girls?"
-It's not quite like that actually in real life.
"-I know, but...."
"Well, she's a pretty major criminal though, yeah?"
-She have to wear one of those uniforms?
"-Yeah, with all the arrows all over it."
Yeah!
"So, what are you doing this afternoon 'cause we're just hanging out?"
"Yeah, I mean, do you fancy coffee?"
"Yeah, of course."
"No, of course I want you to."
It's just I can't make tomorrow or Saturday.
That's all.
How about Sunday?
No.
"No, that would be perfect."
"Oh, my gosh, you'll never guess...."
"There's no question it's been the making of her, this whole business with her mother."
Seems to have turned her into a major celebrity overnight.
I know.
She's got five dates so far on the strength of it to my certain knowledge.
"Kids, I don't know."
Another world.
The chairman of Maruti and I are good friends.
If you say so...
I can talk to him about a job forJai
Jai has several job offers
"All he has to do, is select."
I'll talk to him right away
You aren't doing this for yourself.
You're brilliant.
And we're duds
You can use computers to dig out the exam papers for us
"As morals say, one ought to help pals"
All right.
See me at home tonight
Inside the university's mainframe!
What frame...?
We're inside the university bank.
We just got to break into the papers
Just got to figure out the password.
Of course you will
Let's concentrate
"Go on, smoke."
It's okay
Give me some passwords you know.
I'll give it a try
Shakespeare?
Madhya Pradesh...?
Have you met the managing director?
"Yes, but he wants me To sign up... on an 8-year bond."
Then sign up
"You're staying here, aren't you?"
Why eight?
Sign up for 10 years
Almost never happens.
You know that almost never happens.
"- Hey, where's garrity?"
- He's got the flu.'
"Missing black shawn, now we're missing white shawn."
We're 2 shawns down.
We had to take him to the hospital.White shawn.
- For the flu?
"- He was pissing blood, dude."
"Nah, nah, you don't piss blood when you got the flu."
You piss blood when you got something like gonorrhea.
You do?
Me?
"No.No, no, no."
I never have.
"That's what I heard happens to people who have gonorrhea, which I've never had.Obviously."
I think he had gonorrhea.
"Once, ok."
"Jesus, just once."
One and a half times.
The second time doesn't count because I was just a carrier.
"- Dude, that was awesome."
"- Ahh, we did all right."
"The engine had a dry hydrant which delayed our primary searches, which is why the chief had to call a second alarm.but, most of the apartments above were vacant, which is why we didn't find any roasts."
- Roasts?
- Dead guys.
"Oh, yeah, roasts."
"Hey, let me get in there, you know, check out the damage."
"No, I don't think so."
"Oh, come on, mike."
Let me in there.
"I mean, the stimulator at school, it's for pussies."
What we get is just the leftovers.
"If we don't get even that now, should we beg?"
Look!
I'm the one who gets directly involved.
I'm the one who takes the maximum risk.
You and him...
You will not get caught for sure.
If I get caught...
I'm done.
Don't cry like a kid.
Go and see what needs to be done.
"If Vasundhara gets to know, we will get into trouble."
The chances of her knowing are very low.
She is with Manoj now.
She will not search for us.
This is the only opportunity we will get.
If we continue like this...
She will treat us like dogs forever.
We can't gain anything from being like that.
Don't think too much.
I have planned everything.
"Talk your girl, Divya."
She has to come.
She must not disclose these details to anyone.
Got it?
Where were you?
You weren't in Kanyakumari for the past 2 days...
"Since we had no work here, we had gone to Kerala."
What is your Manoj saying?
"You left me alone with him, and went on a vacation?"
"You said that if we lure Manoj with money and wealth, we can easily trap him."
He is least bothered about it.
"Selena, have you told me the whole story?"
I'm sorry.
There's no more to tell.
"Hello, Allison."
- You look well.
- With a drink in my hand?
Would you care for something?
I moved hoping I'd be left alone.
"Well, this is an unexpected pleasure."
Do come in.
It is wiser to telephone.
Please sit down.
Would you like a drink?
I do hope this isn't an appeal to my better nature.
- I haven't one.
- No.
"You might as well know, my engagement's broken off."
"I'll never see Bill again, so it's no good you going on blackmailing me because I haven't a penny in the world."
This is shocking news.
But 16 Texan oil wells shouldn't be thrown away.
That doesn't matter.
You wouldn't understand.
"I really love him, and I'm nobody without him, so, please, please, leave me alone."
"I'm sorry, but it would still make a good supporting feature."
"""Lurid past loses luckless model Texan oil millions."""
- (Sobs)
"- Look, my dear."
You'll be better off trying to win him back than wasting your time and mine.
What the d...?
!
"- (West Country accent) Sorry, sir."
- What are you doing here?
!
What the hell?
!
Do not!
My truck!
Damn Noids.
Curse!
Look at this shit.
Ash scraped the engine and the whole system.
For the repair we need a GMM.
- A GMM?
"""A great damn hammer, you idiot!"""
The equipment and the ammunition are ashes!
We are 100 miles from the base.
A long way home without snow shoes.
Without Ash we're not going anywhere.
"The first time I agree with you, Bishop."
At the edge of the death zone is a probe with emergency equipment.
"If we get there, we have a chance."
Let's go hunting again.
You do not have to worry about hounding Ash.
... he will hunt us!
"The Humanoids were created, ready to serve."
They are stronger than we are and manage the weather.
"They are hairless, His blood is sour and black."
They are like mules and can not reproduce.
A security measure against genetic competition in the future.
Its Creator said:
His tranquility rests in Absence of reproduction.
But something is different now.
The rebellion is spreading.
"They fight until his death, something to protect."
We're not going to sleep.
We're not?
Mmm-mmm.
What we gonna do in there?
For real?
So how was your night?
My husband found himself in a very traumatic shark situation.
Here we go.
"As we were planning to go to the waterfall and have a romantic evening, because, as you know, we don't do that very often because of the kids and work..."
"But somehow, this crazy, traumatic shark experience was enough to make him neglect his wife."
"Ronnie, nice to meet you."
Well said.
"David, how did that make you feel?"
I know my truth.
Excuse me?
I know my truth.
"Did you say, ""l know my truth',?"
"Oh, boy."
"Listen, I'm telling you, you getting on my last nerve!"
"Yo, I didn't sign up for this!"
"Yo, you said we was gonna be dancing."
You said we was gonna be partying.
You said we was gonna be doing what we do.
"You made promises, Daddy."
"Boo-Boo, look, they got me doing a lot of activities."
What do you expect from me?
I'm tired.
You tired?
"Yo, I'm tired."
"Plain and simple, I ain't having it."
"Sometimes we forget how to do the easiest thing in the world, which is just to talk to each other."
"Okay, let's start here."
What would she have?
Seriously.
That ajumma knows how to subtly put on airs.
Yeah.
Unni Jin Ok can't come today?
Why?
She was scammed?
You want me to h-hold it?
The rumors are already spread all over this place that I was scammed by con artists.
I'm so embarrassed that I can't even face anyone.
"Jang Jin Ok, the name that used to have influence everywhere I went, it's become so that I can't use it anywhere now!"
Then... simply change your name.
It only takes a week.
Do you really want to die!
No.
I have to be cool-headed about this.
I-I heave to be cool-headed about this.
Here.
Take this.
Ok.
Then what should we do now?
We should catch them.
That's right.
No amount of money is too large.
Catch them.
"After screwing up my good son's life, and making me this embarrassed."
My husband is getting a tax audit...
I mean... can he persecute us like this just because we have money?
Of course not.
"Make sure to catch them, especially the punk who pretended to be a prosecutor, make sure to catch him."
"Even if you have to kill him, catch him."
Ah!
- Report this:
the time travel is complete.
The visitors calling CWB.
We have 2 and a half minutes.
Send us some rope quickly.
The time travel is complete.
There is no need for any ropes.
Perhaps with a slight adjustment...
The signal is not clear.
"Give me the parameters, please."
CWB's question:
What kind of rope?
And what kind of adjustment?
It seems there was a mistake in the calculations.
Because we are at the top of a rocky hill right now.
60 meters above the country road between Bournak and Kamenice.
Poochie!
Third check.
No errors found.
"By CWB's estimate, the error must have occurred during mission execution."
The mission is dangerous.
You don't say.
Tell them that!
"What do you mean, I should tell them?"
That we cannot send another Expedition after them?
The World Council approves their return.
Based on CWB's data.
You know what?
The CWB can go and hang itself by the neck.
Explain!
The return would be risky.
It could deplete all the energy reserved for emergencies.
What's garbage like you doing with garbage like this?
"Come on, open her up."
"It's the only job I can get, seeing as how people are so damn discriminant... against those who have paid their dues."
Discriminant?
"Hell of a word there, Clive."
But it ain't your word.
"What did you do with the other truck, huh?"
You're gonna start walking...
Hey.
"What you got there, boy?"
You spit that out.
Spit it out!
You spit that out!
Huh?
"Come on, get up."
Get up!
What?
Is it the stew-maker?
"Hear the cartel has a guy, dissolves people in acid, puts them in a barrel, makes them soup."
Is that who I'm waiting for?
Is it you?
My job is to place a call at 7:30.
And if you don't make the call?
You get put on a list.
And if you get put on the list... it's unfortunate.
"But if Clive isn't here in the next 15 minutes... soon enough, I'll be talking to a dead man."
Well...
If I'm already dead...
You're a dead man!
You ain't doing too good a job at staying gone.
"You know, sometimes..."
I can't get through an entire day without hearing all kinds of rumors getting told about you.
"Now look, you listen to me."
I did not kill my wife.
"You want to know who took Sara Collins, don't waste your time talking to me."
Talk to the senator.
Why would I do that?
Because he knows who did.
You think you know what's going on.
You haven't even sucked one drop off the tip of that iceberg.
"Listen, your wife was alive for two months before they killed her."
"Now, either they wanted something from her... or they wanted something from you."
Best way to get to a man is through the woman he loves.
That's how they control you.
Who?
Do you know how she was killed?
We believe she was drowned.
Where?
"Oh, my God...!"
This is all my fault.
It won't end.
You give Jeff Collins a message from me.
He can fry in hell.
No!
It was a damn witness interview.
I did not see that coming.
"Graham, there was nothing you could've done."
I pushed him there.
You don't push someone to take their own life after a two-minute interview.
"If you keep beating yourself up, you're no good to this case and you know it."
All due respect.
Did you get a sense of what might have set them off.
Guilt.
Guilt?
And you're going to write down the stats that go on the window tomorrow.
Marcus is gonna come by and pick up the photo for safekeeping.
Wait-Wait a second.
I am not going to repeat myself!
"The three of you are going to sit right there, just like that on the couch so I know you're behaving."
And you tell no one about this.
"We wouldn't want anyone messing with our little golden goose here, huh?"
"Now, would we?"
I want 50%.
(CHUCKLES)
You take a zero off that number.
That still makes you a very lucky man.
"Yeah, I feel real lucky."
We didn't agree to this.
"(SIGHS) You should have talked to us, man."
"I did my best, okay?"
Don't sit on the car.
"Listen, this isn't the city."
They're a different breed of snob up here.
It's academia.
Academia nuts.
(LAUGHS)
I fail to understand the distinction.
"Yeah, I do, too, sometimes."
It's been really awful.
I consider you my good friend.
I appreciate that.
But you'll soon find how little that counts for.
I'm not referring to myself.
But there's a lot of assholes out there.
"Less up here than in the city, but it's all relative."
You say it yourself.
"I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge."
You should reflect on that.
"Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life."
"Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces."
"If he hadn't been such a hound dog, we'd all have time machines."
Got it.
Bye.
You know I'm right.
I think he's getting worse.
"Oh, my metatarsal are barking."
- You okay?
"- Yeah, yeah."
I'm just breaking in some new shoes.
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.
Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
Hadn't really thought about it.
Look.
"Uh, sure."
Very... prominent.
"Please, Leonard, don't leer, you have a girlfriend."
- Sorry.
"- So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?"
Yeah.
How did you know?
"I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, 'cause, you know, that's kind of my life now."
Have a good night.
Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.
"- Hey, you."
- Hi.
"Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?"
The lonely guy and the two happy couples?
"If they discover the secret of this cursed village, nothing will stop them from taking revenge."
Let the ghosts come.
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Let them come and see the captain!
God or devil.
Come and have your throats slit.
"Come on, then."
"Come on, ghosts."
"Come on, phantoms."
"Come on, demons."
Come back and see the captain.
I challenge you.
You died tonight.
I will kill you again!
We have to shut him up or he'll tell them everything.
He's drunk
I saw your heads smashed against the rocks!
What the hell is going on?
I don't want any trouble here
It's morning.
We're closing now.
Finish your drinks and go.
It happened one windy night
It happened one stormy night
"Crashed on the rocks, a stray ship"
Leaves two beautiful innocent girls
A celebration of beauty
Some accursed men were wandering about
Full of wine and alcohol
They plundered the wrecks at night
Innocence destroyed by rape
A celebration of beauty
She got pregnant in '96'.
Who was she?
Where did she work?
She must have talked to someone.
I brought the plants in.
"If the room is too hot, they'll think it's spring."
- I'll call if we find anything.
"- Yes, OK."
"Let's hope for a period without frost, or we can't plant them until spring."
I've made some pumpkin soup.
You didn't see it.
Close it again.
The ultrasound images.
I'll heat the soup.
"No, I'm not up for soup, candles, and ultrasound images right now."
There's no need for you to get upset.
I'm only staying till tomorrow.
Did you speak to Mark?
Yes.
All he said was that he didn't know what to do.
I need to think about myself now...
and the baby.
"I'll move in with a friend, or move back to my parents."
That's likely to change when the baby comes.
- You have the ﬂat.
"- No, that won't be ready."
Someone stopped by to inspect the ceilings.
"They say there's asbestos, and that it'll all have to be torn down."
"Well, if you could handle being a single mum, I suppose I can as well."
I don't think I handled it particularly well.
I thought I could give Mark a...
"Well, I couldn't."
"Charlie, we sleep ass to ass, you know that."
"Oh, great."
"Okay, clearly, we're having a problem with honesty here."
"Dennis, a word."
"I hate to say it, bro, but I think we're gonna have to do an overnight observation."
"Yeah, well, to be honest with you, I wouldn't mind seeing how this whole situation really works."
Fascinating.
"Well, this just gets weirder and weirder, man."
Anything?
Nothing.
False alarm.
"Damn it, dude, we can't keep doing this all night."
"Oh, I know."
You know what.
Why don't we sleep in shifts?
"Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying this isn't important work"
- but I can't keep my eyes open.
"- No, I hear you."
I hear you.
I hear you.
"All right, I'll tell you what."
You go ahead and go first.
I still got a little energy left.
"I don't know about this floor, Dennis."
It's covered in sand or something.
No.
"It smells like some kind of spice blend or pesticide, or some other kind of sandy poison or something."
I don't know.
"I wouldn't sleep on the floor, though."
- You got to sleep with them?
"- You got to, you got to."
You sure you're all right?
"He does it more nicely, than the mom or me."
Wow.
So quickly.
"One of the more beautiful ones, than the other one."
And the kind Tót lord?
Does he not accompany us?
- Me?
- Daddy?
My kind dad?
I....noooo!
Why?
What?
Shall I sit over there?
For me it I do not have a manual skill.
Maybe you make of the box derogatory?
No.
No.
But...for major lord... a lot may allow everything to himself.
"That, if i it would be done, and its news would be going in the village, and...well..."
"Do not speak more, dear Tót lord."
I totally understand.
You disdain this work and you ruin others' joy.
I am sorry that I was inconvenient for you.
I travel with the first coach tomorrow.
Tót family it was implored.
they pleaded to him.
"It was asserted, that misunderstands the situation."
"Since nothing happened, that could have hurt it."
"This may not be something else, only a terrible misunderstanding."
"One single of their desire,that let everything be put onto his mood."
"Let us forget the whole one, kind Tót."
"- Maybe, that the mistake is in me."
To get their bearings.
Exactly.
"Once they go through here, they'll have a much better idea of where they're headed."
So that's why we release them up here.
And we can just gently release this.
How extraordinary.Here they go!
And notice one thing - they're headed straight towards the brightest spot.
They are - straight for the sun.
That is the most incredible sight.
Fantastic.
Look at them!
Look at him!
They're desperate!
"There's no hanging around, they're not nervous about it - straight in the sea."
"Notice as soon as they float, they change their swimming pattern."
Just like a clockwork toy.
"Look, there's one last one up here - look, Stephen."
"Oh, yes."
Come on.
"Come on, you."
"Oh, no, the crab grabbed it as it went over the hole."
Rescue it!
"I know you're not supposed to intervene, but hey!"
"That's it, go for it."
Good luck!
Yeah!
Made for the water.
"Oh, that's fantastic."
I've never seen anything quite so magical in all my life.
That's one of the best wildlife things I've seen.
"20-25 years from now, hopefully she'll be back laying eggs if she's a girl."
That was fantastic.
Ooh.
I can smell the judgment coming off of you.
"Well, they're people, and you're treating them like they're dolls."
"If we're gonna be partners, you really have to stop being such a hater."
We're in a partnership because we share a goal.
Don't ever confuse that for an acceptance of your lifestyle.
My lifestyle?
So I assume that you still don't have the invention.
I'll get it.
I said I would.
You threatened to expose Damon Salvatore.
That didn't work.
You killed that Pearl lady.
Still no invention.
"I really don't think that your plan is working, John."
"Well, you being here isn't going to help anything."
[JOHN GRUNTS]
"You failed, John."
I'm gonna take it from here.
DAMON:
Did you ask about Uncle John?
- Are they working together?
ALARIC:
No.
"- No, they're not?"
"- No, I didn't ask."
- What about the invention?
- Didn't ask.
- She know about the tomb vampires?
- I don't know.
Did words completely escape you?
I was a little too distracted by my dead vampire wife to ask any questions.
"You know, that's not gonna get your son back."
Quinn?
Is that his name?
It's not gonna get him back.
"And if you keep that up, you're gonna have two problems instead of one."
You know what he told me?
"He told me, ""I want my mama back."""
I want...
I want my son back.
"Well, um, Child Services won't let you live with Quinn again until you get treatment."
"And to get treatment, I need to prove PTSD."
- Post-traumatic stress...
- This is not combat-related.
"Hell, I got both my arms."
I didn't get my legs blown off.
I'm not in no damn wheelchair.
I know.
PTSD from military sexual trauma is just as real.
"Yeah, I know."
And it makes the military look bad.
What makes the military look bad is your senior officer raping you over and over again.
I don't want people looking at me like I'm crazy.
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah.
I think I have some insight into that.
So you think you've seen what I've seen?
"No, but I've seen some pretty bad stuff."
I have seen thousands of spiders running up my best friend's face.
You wacked.
Yeah.
It's called schizophrenia.
So they sent me somebody crazier than I am.
I just...
I don't think dinner tonight's a good idea.
"No, it's not a good idea at all."
I'm allergic to cats.
"Can we just, like, put them down until you're ready?"
"No, 'cause then they're likely to run away."
And then where are we?
Stuck with no cats.
Is everything OK?
What is this cat's name?
This little guy is called Prescott.
That was my grandfather's name.
"NARRATOR: 'For the first time in years, Ashley found herself feeling truly alone."
"'Despite being surrounded by people most of every day, 'she was unable to connect to them in a way she considered meaningful 'and found herself passing through their lives, and her own, 'in a state of total isolation."
What size are these shirts?
I don't know.
Small or medium.
Try it on.
I'll give you an ill-fitting discount.
They seem expensive.
Sold to the highest bidder.
- This too.
"- Yeah, why not?"
This?
Throw this in.
"It's not very good, but you can use it as a coaster or something."
No good.
Naw.
Take the jacket too.
Two for one.
Look at that.
"You would date that man, right?"
"Alright, see ya."

"Hey, um..."
"Do you take money, Malcolm?"
"Do you take money, Malcolm?"
"Like, if I got a warrant to access your bank accounts,"
"Like, if I got a warrant to access your bank accounts, what would I find?"
what would I find?
"Come on, mate."
"Come on, mate."
It's no accident
It's no accident the cannabis industry around here's out of control.
the cannabis industry around here's out of control.
You've been looking the other way for a long time now.
You've been looking the other way for a long time now.
It's not just you.
I know that.
It's not just you.
I know that.
"Even this bloody building's got a smell about it, hasn't it?"
"Even this bloody building's got a smell about it, hasn't it?"
Dry rot.
Dry rot.
And garlic.
And garlic.
"Listen, mate, if you tell me the whole story,"
"Listen, mate, if you tell me the whole story,"
I will move heaven and earth to protect you.
I will move heaven and earth to protect you.
"If you're thinking of turning this into some kind of witch-hunt,"
"- Of course, I knew her well."
Killed in the rearguard action at Gedden.
"I knew she was reported dead, sir."
I never heard any details.
There was a great deal of confusion when the High Council were restored to power.
Most of the old guard were killed in the fighting.
They remained loyal to Servalan right till the end.
"And a lot were executed later, weren't they?"
- All the leaders were purged.
- The penalty for choosing the wrong side.
I myself was under arrest for a short time.
"Well, I suppose it's better to die bravely in the field than to face execution later."
PA SYSTEM:
"Attention, citizens."
Attention.
This is a census call.
Assemble in the concourse now.
Use entrances 1 and 3 only.
"I repeat, entrances 1 and 3 only."
Let's try over there.
- Ah.
Any ideas?
- We'll have to go through him.
"That's what they're expecting, friends."
Follow me.
If you want to stay alive.
We'll lie low till the check is over.
- DAYNA:
What's the check for?
- Catching people like us.
The unadapted.
- Unadapted?
"Isn't that right, Mr. Rafet?"
Sure.
The one who gives less...
We'll talk about that later.
I will prepare your house for you with pictures that just left.
"Excuse me, I'll be back soon."
"Bro, I have some good news for you and some bad news."
The bad news is that Rafet's here.
Good news is that Professor Candan's on his lap
What lap?
Don't exaggerate guys.
"Of course, we might say that it's bad news for you."
What's she doing on his lap?
Mr. Rafet was giving her something but we came in at that moment.
I thought I'd ask you about what to do with these lovebirds.
There's nothing going on.
Decision made.
She's dead for me now.
She's got no taste at all.
He's very depressed.
He's very angry...
And his grandfather is from the tribe...
What happened?
What do you want?
Tell me.
All you have to do is give me the answer keys of all the remaining test exams.
"That's one... if this matter leaves this room, I'll make sure the record you... die for goes public."
And that's two.
Have some water.
"Come on, son."
"If anything goes wrong, I know you and you know me."
- Don't get anyone else involved.
He heard me.
"Given the circumstances, for insurance and safety reasons,"
I think it's better to handle his moves.
"Ludovic, let him drive."
I do not want interferences from the waiter.
- Ludovic.
The clutch does not work well.
"Do not stay in the first place, sire."
"I'm in the third, Ludovic."
- Excuse me.
Death for a turtle.
You can not die that way.
"His real reflections had saved the beast,"
But our vehicle had gone to a better life.
"We were there, in half at Bulgarian nothing."
"Listen to maps, hear phones, hear no one in sight."
Only the sky was looking at us.
My dear fellow citizens...
In these difficult times...
"In fact, foreign..."
And under this mysterious sky...
We must be humble.
I like it.
I have to find something destined for people.
"Yeah, maybe."
"Since when did you go to the king, Carlos?"
When does he ask for my opinion?
"My dear Carlos,"
I have three degrees and three positions as an ambassador
And nine years in service of the king.
Let the advice I give you.
"Mr Moreau,"
I'll have to go back to work soon.
This woman isn't well.
"Benigno, please."
You know what I mean.
Her skin's really dry.
Let's see.
Here it is.
Have you talked to her?
"No, and don't go on about it."
"Goodbye, Lydia."
You have to be patient with him.
Work hard.
"""Shrinking Lover""."
Rosa's got the flu.
I hope she didn't give it to you.
I'm glad you're feeling well.
"Even so, I'll give you a massage, and a rubdown with rosemary alcohol."
"No, I'm all right."
Last night I saw a film... that disturbed me.
"It was a love story, between Aif redo, who's a bit overweight, like me, but a nice guy, and Amparo, his girlfriend, who's a scientist."
Amparo is working on an experimental diet formula that will revolutionize the world of nutrition.
You're selfish.
You only think of yourself.
I've got it!
It could be dangerous.
I still haven't tested it on humans.
Do you still think I'm selfish?
It's done wonders for you!
"Don't worry, my love!"
I'll find the antidote!
But time went by.
"Despite her efforts, Amparo couldn't find the antidote and poor Aif redo was shrinking daily."
It's finished.
The taste is perfect.
Prepare your spoons.
Dig in!
I'll go in first.
He always makes his family status apparent.
"Even so, taking the egg yolk for yourself isn't right!"
"Senior, did you just dig in with the spoon you just ate with?"
Seriously.
I won't eat it.
We are doctors that need to keep our health in check.
How could we share a bowl with a spoon?
So I just starved instead.
"Nothing else is hard, but the fact that warm water doesn't come out and-"
You scared me!
"Honey, I will call again."
"Hey, you..."
Please give me something to eat.
"If I come here,"
I heard you guys give out something to eat.
I couldn't come yesterday.
Talk to me from there.
From there.
You can't go around touching people's clothes with those dirty hands.
Hey!
He vomited while suddenly fainting?
"Yes, he was lacking in nutrients so I gave him an IV bag."
His voice was normal.
It doesn't seem like pneumonia.
But it also doesn't seem like malnutrition is the only cause.
His condition is really bad.
Aches between the liver and stomach?
Our stock plus yours controls the voting power.
We'll give you your money on one condition:
That daniel drew is voted out of the erie railroad!
I won't stand that!
You can't do that to me!
We've got to have order here!
"If we're going to come to an agreement, we've got to conduct this meeting in parliamentary fashion."
"Now, all in favor of the basis of settlement as stated by the general- er, colonel-er, well, fisk here-say aye."
Aye!
Aye!
"All opposed, no."
"No, cornele, no!"
The ayes have it.
"Drew, you're a dead goose."
You're out!
You-
jim!
What?
"Say, you're just in time."
Take a look at this rehearsal.
It'll cheer you up.
Take a look at this.
It'll cheer you up.
"What, the stockholders on the warpath?"
What do you expect me to do?
Put on sackcloth and ashes?
"Now, see here, jim, what's got into you?"
We're in for trouble because these fellas mean business.
They're trying to have you indicted for buying this opera house with erie funds.
"Aw, cool off and take a look at the birdies."
"Now, wait a minute, jim."
You can't joke about this.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
"He said, he wanted to see it coming."
- When?
- While you're out.
- Did he say anything else?
- Like what?
"Like, why he wants to check out so bad?"
- A little.
- Well?
He's....got bad cancer.
It's in my pancreas and spreading.
Going to die and I'd rather not take the scenic route.
"I don't think he has anybody who loves him either, it must be even worse."
We should think about going to his funeral.
"You know, just so there's someone there."
What?
"At the end of the day, Donnie'll send surviving' members of his squad to finish the job either way."
"So if it's not us to finish, it would be somebody else."
"And besides, this guy's dead already!"
"In fact, it's way better if we're the ones to do it."
"Because unlike Donnie's punks, we're not gonna torture him for eight or nine hours first."
Did you hear somethin'?
What happened to you anyway?
You look a little mussed up.
What's with the it chilled?
- This?
- Yea.
I've been deputized.
"- I'm serious, Vi."
- Fine!
I had a little incident while I was out getting the bullets.
And here are the complete assets as of...
"Harold, I can't even balance a checkbook."
You'll have to explain it to me.
It's very simple.
"If we don't make some money in the next few months, we're out of business."
How much do you need?
"We need $50,000, partner."
"Oh, we've gone back to a partnership, have we?"
We never dissolved.
Everything's split right down the middle.
Up to now it's been 50%% of nothing.
When do the profits start coming in?
"""We could make a lot of money, Mrs. Brown. "" Remember?"
I remember you thought it was a pretty good idea at the time.
I was wrong.
I guess you should've stayed with John.
"Darling, I didn't mean that."
It wasn't just the money.
"You know that, don't you?"
I know.
Isn't there anything we can do?
"We've got to find some way to raise $50,000."
"Oh, the stuff will sell."
It just takes time.
Have you tried to get a loan?
All over town.
"They'd lend it to John, but they think I'm just a young upstart."
Maybe if John used his influence.
Would that help?
I don't think he'd do it.
"He'd do anything for the company, you know that."
It's worth trying.
"That's it, thanks."
"All right, digger."
How old is he?
A little over a year.
"It can't be anything serious, can it, James?"
It's none of the usual things-- an inverted eyelid or an extra row of lashes rubbing against the eyeball.
"Sometimes, I find him lying in his basket with his eyes half-closed."
"No pain, but there's something wrong."
Nothing shows.
I suppose he might have a long-standing infection in there.
I'll give him some drops.
See how he gets on with those.
"All right, digger."
"Apart from his eyes, he's fit as a fiddle."
Marvelous company when I'm traveling about.
"Get through the work like lighting, don't we, boy?"
"Changed my whole life, this little chap."
Digger.
"Don't worry, Andrew, most of our patients feel that way about the surgery."
Even our own dogs avoid it like the plague.
There we are.
"Thank you, James."
I'm sure I won't have to trouble you again.
Let's hope so.
"Come on, digger."
"Next, please!"
You're an idiot!
An idiot!
"Bad dog, very bad dog."
You're lucky I'm not scooping up the pieces.
Do you realize what a silly animal you are?
Mrs. hall!
"Then just check ,no opinion.,"
"I,m not checking anything."
"You can, if you Iike, but I won,t check just any box."
"This isn,t tic-tac-toe!"
"We,re getting off the point."
"We,re lucky this is on camera, or no one would believe it."
calm down!
Just checking.
"Let,s put 8."
I give up!
This is a loony bin!
"At the risk of being rude,"
"Jean-MicheI, last night you suffered once again from premature ejaculation."
Perhaps.
It happens sometimes.
"But I think you,re being judgmental or trying to annoy me, and that,s out of line."
"Listen, we practically live together, yet we hardly know each other."
"For exampIe, what,s your relationship?"
"I,m not sure how to take that."
"You know everything about us, but we -"
"Listen, Jean-MicheI."
"Let,s say you,re at the post office."
You wait in line.
You buy stamps.
"Do you ask the employee,s name or who they voted for?"
"I,m just saying it might be nice."
"well, what do we put down?"
I get it - another test.
"You,re trying to get us to crack."
- Is this on purpose?
- Where were we?
please answer me:
- Nothing.
- Maybe we could go.
In what world would I want you to come along?
"- It's not for you, it's for us."
- It'd be funny to watch you fuck it up.
"Yeah, you might cry."
"Thanks for the vote of confidence, but you won't want to come."
I'm seeing her at this under-18s night she's working at.
"It will be uncool,"
- even for us.
- Sounds OK to me.
- At least we'll definitely get in.
"- No, no."
- You won't like it.
- We might even get some.
Won't they be a bit young?
- Grass on the pitch and it's OK for me.
"- Right, and what if there isn't?"
By the time you find out it'll be too late.
Surely you've got better things to do than watch me with Charlotte?
"Great, no, fine."
See you there then.
"So before my date with Charlotte, and it was a date,"
I had to endure one last day with the savages.
I was pleasantly surprised to find Jim and Wolfie engaged in serious debate.
"All right, Will?"
"You'll like this - we're just having ""a discussion""."
"- Oh, really?"
- Which titties would you spunk over?
"The little ones, or big and bouncy?"
"A handful, plenty to play with."
- They both look nice.
"No, no."
No it doesn't.
No.
How can you read it?
It's just moving all over the place.
Let me see that Lilly.
I'm sorry.
But I mean how much more bad news can you take?
I mean you just found out you don't get to go to college.
With your best friend the day after you get rejected.
By the best boyfriend you ever had.
And now you've got an eye twitch.
But my grades are awesome.
I killed it on the SAT.
This is so not fair!
I know.
I mean I guess that stuff just wasn't important to Jesse.
And Stanford accepted you?
Lilly stand extremely still and don't let her sense your fear.
There has got to be some kind of mistake!
Lilly and I have just about the same grades.
And she only did a little bit better on the SAT.
And that's because my energy drink made me have to tinkle twice.
And Lilly can hold it like a camel!
I must say the fact that you just drove 200 miles.
To plead your case is very impressive.
That's the kind of character we look for here at Stanford.
We're going to be very sad not having you here.
Cookie?
This isn't fair.
I am being discriminated against.
Because I have a small bladder.
- How's everybody doing?
- Good.
You?
So far...
There's the little momma.
I got a little something for the kid.
I won it at a fair last night.
That is so sweet.
- I'll see you guys later.
- Call me later.
- Coffee?
"- No, I'm good."
What's up?
Just hearing about these American guys coming into town.
- You know anything about this?
- Do I know anything?
They've been giving my guys a hard time.
Selling good weed for cheap.
"I've been chasing them off, but then they took over the park across the street."
- They coming in here?
- They showed up at my brother's club.
Just a matter of time before we see them here.
We should do something before something gets out of hand.
What about the bank machines?
"I'll have my accountant look at the final numbers, but I think we're done."
You wanna talk about the weed?
You'll have the Eastern connection.
We're looking for commission on deals.
- Are you gonna want to work with me?
- Gonna have introduce you around.
- So we have an agreement here?
- We'll start exploring it.
- I don't date potential employers.
You'll have lunch and a professional conversation.
"If you consider that a date, your social life must be lame."
- It is.
- We're having a baby.
I am trying to be a good mother.
That's what he wants here.
- He has a mother.
"- But she's not here, and I am."
- Why are you leaving?
"- I've had some bad ideas in my life, but thinking I could work here and share an office with you is one of the worst."
How you doing?
"No, I work here now."
I'm not kidding.
"Hey, stud."
Hey!
Whoa.
Blind stud.
I got soap in my eye.
"Sorry, but what you did back there?"
It was incredible.
Sure it was me and not the hormones?
"Oh, it was you, all right."
"Well, I do aim to please."
Good.
Because I'm nowhere near finished with you.
I barely left the house most Sundays.
"My mom would cook elaborate dinners for neighbors, friends and sometimes people we barely knew."
"By ten, I could whip up a perfect meringue, deglaze a pan, truss a chicken."
"But by the time puberty rolled around, I'd had enough."
"Football, friends seemed more important."
So I told her I was done.
"Oh, you pretty things."
That's right - north for about 40 miles.
And then all we gotta do is-
"Oh, if you could only cook."
"Then all we have to do is find the knoll... upon which stands a tree, half-shattered by lightning."
And the cabin.
Near that knoll.
"Gee, I wonder what it's gonna be like... having things instead of wishing for 'em."
Hmm.
Not nearly so much fun.
"You're wrong, Claire."
Wishing never got anybody anyplace.
It's owning something that counts.
Taking it when you can't get it any other way - that's all right too.
It's the law up here
- The law of the Klondike.
"When there's something you need, grab it."
Take it away from the other guy.
It's a good law.
It works.
Nope.
It only works when you deserve to have what you take.
Otherwise it's stealing.
Perhaps that particular commandment isn't respected up here.
They all get broken.
That one gets splintered.
"Well, Noah... that boat manipulating's a little too tough for my delicate constitution... so if you don't mind, sir, I shall go below."
Good night.
"- Night, Shorty."
- Night.
"Good night, dice."
Summer's just around the corner.
Star power!
Yes!
"Sctanley, no!"
Yeah!
You hustled me.
"Yes, I did."
"For that, I'm sorry."
"You see, I sell video games, Sctanley."
"And this one here, in particular, in fact."
And I'm proud to stand here before you and tell you it brings me as much happiness as it does for the people I provide them to.
"And we had a bet, and I know that you're a man of your word."
Forget that you saw me and my friends and point me in the direction that I seek.
I cannot confirm or deny that the one that you seek is on the singles' side.
But a bet is a bet.
And I will tell you how to get there.
The beach is blocked by rocks.
It's completely impassable.
No more boats for me and my friends.
I go by foot.
I would be remiss if I did not advise you to wait until daylight.
Do not take this journey lightly.
Hmm.
"There is an old game path through the forest, just beyond the abandoned Starbucks."
Take it to where it forks.
Jog to the right.
Do not go to the left.
You will see lights.
You don't want to go there.
Keep walking.
Look up and locate the belt of Orion the Hunter.
I think we should be writing this down.
I think Dave's got it.
I don't think you'll find anything.
Whoever did this knew you'd look at the GPS.
They must have covered their tracks by spoofing the data.
"If you wanna know where the crime really took place, you have to find the anomaly in the GPS data."
♪
This code repeats itself twice.
♪
"The route here has been artificially extended, so the point where the code repeats is where the hack begins."
This is where the GPS was spoofed.
Everything that comes after this point is a fake trail.
This is your crime scene location.
[dramatic music]
♪ [indistinct chatter]
- Hey!
- Excuse me.
Yeah.
[soft dramatic music]
♪
Hey.
This is where it happened.
♪
"Breathing, circulation, BP, all normal."
So I'm good?
You're alive. [door opens]
Nobody move!
Get down now.
"[guns clicking, footsteps]"
Where's the doctor in charge.
I'm Dr. Larson.
"You're in possession of illegally acquired tech, a cardiac regulator."
"Serial number, 928-H4W."
It was reactivated against our consent.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I drove by the park earlier.
"You said you were gonna be there with the kids, you know."
And I... stopped and watched you for a minute.
I didn't spot you.
No?
"Well, lucky you're not a detective."
Lucky you're not a comedian.
What d'you think?
About what?
The kids.
"Well, the big one sure knows how to hit a baseball."
"I know, but he's got this hitch in his swing."
He'll never get around on the really fast stuff.
He's like his old man.
Do you know that I'm the first male Felton in five generations to have his original front teeth?
- Thank you for sharing.
- You're welcome.
"Hey, Beau, did you ever take refresher course in interrogation technique that Professor Landriff teaches?"
I'm not much on refresher courses.
"Well, the first day, he writes on the blackboard,"
"""Let the suspect talk."""
"""The interrogation is not about you."""
That's good advice.
"I didn't ask you here to interrogate you, Beau."
Of course not.
"We don't have to try to make the other one say it, we can say it ourselves."
Sure.
It's over between us.
Isn't it?
Yeah.
Why did you come in?
You should have called me.
I'm not taking advantage of you?
- You've done three nights this week.
- Don't worry.
If I have one afternoon free that's enough.
I have to talk to the builders about the apartment.
It's in such a mess.
Then I just have to get a photo framed.
My situation won't improve.
Maybe we should tell the clinic and let them decide.
"Look, your husband walked out on you and the kids."
"You come the nights you can, and I'll do the rest."
Between us we'll manage.
Thank you.
- You stopped the intravenous nutrition.
- She didn't tolerate it.
- We can try again tomorrow.
- Yes.
"Now, go on."
- And cheer up.
- Thanks.
Six bulls and one woman.
"Next Wednesday, in the traditional bullring in Brihuega,"
Lydia Gonzalez is going to fight six bulls!
"- That's a lot of bulls, Lydia."
- Good evening.
Why such a drastic decision?
My job is to fight bulls.
"Two bulls, six, whatever they say."
People say a lot of bullfighters won't fight with you because you're a woman.
People can say what they want.
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And...
Bring the flower.
"Oh, uh... we can't be in detention together."
I have a restraining order against these tools.
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
I'm gonna kill him.
"No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
"You were right, let's kill him."
Kanima.
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl...
With severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
Shut it down.
What happened?
There must have been a surge in the power grid.
"I'll need a few minutes, Captain."
Archer to Enterprise.
Medical emergency.
[Grave instrumental music]
There was nothing I could do.
I'm sorry.
ARCHER:
How's Hoshi coming with that translation?
Their iconography is different from the other Xindi species.
It's taking some time.
"When she's done, ask her to search their database."
See if she can locate anything about their burial rituals.
Do you plan to hold a funeral?
TRIP: [On radio] Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER:
Go ahead.
TRIP:
I think I figured out the problem.
Their power grid can't handle our converters.
It's going to take at least three days to make them compatible.
What about the reactor?
Any way to bring it online?
"It's possible, but they lost most of their antimatter in the accident."
ARCHER:
Stand by.
Work with Trip.
Help him get their reactor up and running.
Sir?
We're going to transfer our antimatter to their ship.
"I've shown that, haven't I?"
I don't believe I have any ideals.
But you do.
"All that you said to me, the first time we decided to do it about practising what we preach."
I did it to see if we could and then I did it for the pure love of killing.
But you...
I can't help thinking you've done it because of me.
For me.
Yes.
"But I also did it because... because, cos I..."
I didn't want to be a hypocrite.
I wanted to break free of the usual constraints.
"And yes because of you, Richard."
I admired you.
You're not like everyone else.
The rim-ram.
You're unique.
Hi.
"Her name's Carla Burns, lives around the corner."
Looks like she was coming home from work.
"OK, clear."
Anything left in her bag?
There was money still in there.
Doesn't look like a robbery.
"Broad daylight, no attempt to hide the body."
Another victim lying face up.
We've a weapon!
Even as we speak they'll be looking at the body of the woman you killed.
WE killed.
"Our clever friends will be piecing it all together, tying to make sense of it all."
I'm tired of all this Miss Scarlet in the ballroom with the dagger crap.
It's all so crass.
# Now stand by with your glasses All ready
# Drink a health to the men Of the skies... #
"Here's to the memory of a fine, brave man."
I remember the smile on his face as he went.
"What you trying to do, turn this into a wake?"
"If you two girls go and sit over there, I'll get your drinks."
"""Easy as falling off a log"" he said."
"Look, he made 88 jumps, the odds caught up with him."
"Look, he made 88 jumps, the odds caught up with him."
Because he was a right guy.
He'd tell you to drink that beer instead of crying into it.
Let's have a game of darts.
You two go ahead.
I'm all right.
"I don't care for darts, maybe it'll make him more cheerful."
May I sit down?
It's a free country.
"Wow, that's a rousing welcome."
What did you expect a 21-gun salute?
"Make it 48, will you?"
I heard about this morning.
About Breton.
Let's talk about something else.
I was wrong about you.
I thought you were like the others.
Scared inside and covering up.
"But you're not scared, are you?"
Sure I am.
No you're not.
You know what they say around here?
There are two types of men who jump.
Those who are crazy and those who are scared.
"- Yeah, I'd really love to believe you."
"I really would, because I don't even have to go to work this morning."
I would love to believe in a universe... where you wake up and you don't have to go to work... and you step outside and meet two beautiful 18 year-old sisters... who are also girlfriends... and... are also very nice people.
You guys seem like very nice people.
We are nice.
"What would you do... if you believed wewere 18, which we are?"
"Well, I can't even tell ya."
- I can't tell you till you're 18.
- That's not true.
What about freedom of speech and the Constitution?
- What are you talkin' about?
- Free speech.
Okay.
"Well, I don't know what you're talking about... but I can't talk dirty to you... because then I'd be a pervert... and probably even a pedophile too, so-"
- No one has ever talked dirty to us.
- Really?
Sounds very appealing.
I'm gonna go inside now.
Okay.
We'll wave to you.
- Make sure to look.
- I will.
"- Oh, he's probably jerking off."
"- Oh, my God!"
He is.
You can so tell he is.
- How?
- I can feel it.
See that crack?
That's where his hard-on is.
Let's kiss.
Okay.
Where?
At your company.
Isn't she a sales assistant?
So you think one of my staff members has become a porn model?
Never.
She's not my kind.
Are you going home?
Yeah.
Are you scared of your wife?
All wives are scary.
So are you going to put some mud on your golf clubs?
Oh!
You've become an expert.
Have you done this with anyone else before?
So what did you want to talk to me about?
Someone left this on my desk.
"The model is you, isn't it?"
Luckily he left it on my desk.
But what if someone left it on a managers' desk instead?
A friend of mine tricked me into this.
I don't care who tricked you.
"What I'm asking you is, what should I do?"
What should you do?
Should I show it to the manager or keep it secret?
Are you threatening me?
"No, I don't mean it like that."
I thought perhaps it would be better if I started seeing you at your home instead.
Is this a threat?
It's been quite costly.
What with the money I've been giving to you as well.
Isn't that natural because we love each other?
Why don't you show it to the manager or whoever you want?
When has that every stopped you?
I need to connect more with Lucas.
I thought you guys were already doing that.
"I mean, the making out thing is great and all but it only goes so far."
Can you help a girl out?
Yeah.
You know what?
Give him this.
Travis.
"Yeah, Tell him that tracks 8 and 11 make you think of him."
Great.
"Wait, make me think of him or make you think of him?"
Just friends.
"I know, sorry."
You're a goddess.
Did you finish 'The Little Prince'?
"No, I just rented the movie."
This book is stupid.
"Nathan, you're not going to pass French if you keep renting movies."
"Well, its not like I have a lot of time to just sit around and read."
"So, are you ever going to tell me how it went?"
The therapist asked me if I really want to play basketball or not.
"Wow, what did you say?"
I didn't know what to say.
Nobody's ever asked me that question.
"Wow, that's really big."
"This last couple of weeks without it,"
I mean if I didn't play I might actually have a life.
- What would you do?
- I don't know.
At least I'd have some time to figure it out though.
"Besides, I'm sure we could find a lot better things to do with our time, right?"
NICK:
You want me to go undercover as what?
A member of the 12-step program.
"Aw, come on, captain."
"It makes sense, Nick."
"You weren't at the crime scene, and..."
Nobody knows you're a cop.
"There's a bit of a catch-22 here, captain."
I know.
Your vacation.
"Look, I wouldn't have called you in if I didn't need you."
Tell him.
"They're stonewalling, Nick."
Nobody wants to say diddly about the victim because it's part of their code or something.
It's a dead end.
Unless I become one of them.
Got any bad habits?
Maybe it'd do you some good.
"Nat, what do you think of 12-step programs?"
I think they can be very helpful for some mortal addictions.
How about the more exotic ones?
You know my theory about that.
It's the blood that keeps you from coming over.
"I try, Nat."
"I really do, I really try."
Do you think a 12-step can make me give it up?
"No one can answer that for you, Nick, but it wouldn't hurt you to give it a shot."
When I came here three years ago...
"I was on my knees, almost literally."
I felt like a complete and total failure as a human being.
I hated myself.
I couldn't see any way out of my addiction.
No.
"No, I couldn't."
"Saturday, I gotta work."
"Sunday, I'm going to a picnic."
"Well, no, I couldn't take you."
It's not exactly a picnic.
Some fellas and I are going fishing.
"Yeah, I'll call you up sometime."
Goodbye.
I see by the paper they're having a sale of vacuum cleaners down at the fair.
I think I'll get you one.
Plenty of time for that.
When will you know about the job for sure?
I ought to hear from the super tomorrow.
"After I get the vacuum, I'm gonna get you a new coat."
I think maybe we can doll this house up a little bit.
Maybe we can get rid of that heap and get us a real car.
Do you think we should?
The old car runs all right.
"I got the swellest wife and kid in the world, ain't I?"
And the best ain't none too good for them.
"That's swell of you, honey, but we gotta pay the folks that helped us when you were out of work."
"- Oh, we'll clean that up in no time."
- Ha-ha.
"- Yeah, I think maybe we ought to get some new dishes too."
"Hey, Pop, come on."
You're missing out on Speed Foster.
What's he doing?
Still hanging on by his teeth?
"Yeah, but he's in terrible danger."
"Go ahead, darling."
Hang on by your teeth and I'll hang on to the dishes.
You will be connected to the voice mail after the beep.
"To record a message, press one."
"Please speak after the beep, then press the star or pound key."
I see you're not picking up.
"That day, I think I had too much on my mind and I was a bit afraid."
"Actually, I'm sure of myself, but I didn't do you right."
I called you because the sea is so beautiful.
There are so many idiots who take life for granted.
"In this beautiful place I've seen people fight over some money, and a couple argue."
It's disgusting.
You're beautiful.
Very beautiful.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm a film director.
"Oh yes, my name is Kim Joongrae."
"If you're not busy, could I interview you?"
An interview?
"Yes, I'm working on a script."
And you look so much like one of the characters I'm creating.
"I'll offer you some compensation, though very small."
"Oh, no need for it."
I know who you are.
- Nice to meet you.
"- Oh, you do?"
Thank you.
- What kind of interview is it?
- It's real simple.
"If it's okay with you,"
"I'd like to ask about your life, just everyday stuff."
"Actually, I'm not used to this kind of thing."
"I want a little bit, i want a piece of it, i think he's losing it, i want to watch it come down."
"Don't like the look of it, on't like the taste of it, don't like the smell of it."
I want to watch it come down.
All the pigs are all lined up.
I give you all that you want.
Take the skin and peel it back.
Now doesn't that make you feel better ?
"Shove it up inside, surprise !"
Lies.
Stains like the blood on your teeth.
"Bite, chew, suck."
"I want to break it up, i want to smash it up, i want to fuck it up."
I want to watch it come down.
"Maybe afraid of it, let's discredit it, let's pick away at it."
I want to watch it come down.
Come fucking down.
All the pigs are all lined up.
I give you all that you want.
Take the skin and peel it back.
Now doesn't that make you feel better ?
The pigs have won tonight.
Now they can all sleep soundly.
And everything is all right.
"Come here, motherfucker motherfucker"
All the pigs are all lined up
All the pigs
All the pigs are all lined up.
All the pigs
All the pigs are all lined up.
All the pigs
"No, no"
All the pigs are all lined up.
Hey!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Get out.
Get out now!
You want to sit around drinking and feeling sorry for yourself.
What is this?
You won't respect yourself until someone else does?
I respect you.
You've got a lot of courage.
The whole department is waiting to see you fall on your ass.
- You're giving them what they want.
- They want to keep me silent.
Stupid is almost as good.
"Will you go now, please?"
Just go home.
"No, I don't want to."
I don't want to go home.
What are you doing?
What made you decide to become a cop?
All the shit you've got to go through  being a woman and all.
"When I was in college, my roommate was raped."
The campus police were only interested in keeping it quiet.
I knew that the guy was white and very tall.
I started checking out basketball courts near the campus.
From the pictures I took of the white players she identified him.
- You caught the guy?
- Yeah.
This is the police.
Pull over and stop the engine.
Stop the car..!
Take the wheel.
"This is 9221 in pursuit of a murder suspect,   heading west on the railroad service road at mile 16."
Why say that he kissed the earth on which I walked?
"Kill me, you needed."
I am so tired.
"Rest, rest!"
I am a seagull.
I am a seagull.
I am a seagull.
"No, it's not true."
"I am an actress, you ..."
"Even he is here, si ..."
"But it does nothing,"
"Did not believe him at the theater, is a mockery of my dreams, and I finished to cease to believe it too."
"I have lost the courage, the torments of love, jealousy ... the constant fear for my child."
"I became a petty, insignificant, read like a slut,"
"I did not know that what to do with my hands, nor as being in the scene."
No longer controlling my voice!
Do not know what means this situation.
It's good for me.
Learn to bring your cross.
It preserves your faith.
I have faith ...
- And the suffering.
- This is ridiculous.
A girl so ...
And when I think of my vocation ...
- It is said: the whores ...
- You should ...
Life does not make me more afraid.
Perhaps to die?
"Here is still alive my last Venini, the untouchable, not the only one who has ever touched me!"
The only burning ...
Chiasso nothing particularly ...
That means I'll have chance to see you again!
"If it's not necessary to return it, I prefer keeping it."
"I can't be his woman,"
"I can't win his heart, now, I love to keep it for memory."
"Miss Shui, why do you like my master?"
"All women want to find a husband who is capable, a man who can protect her."
"Miss Shui, if there is a man, who is a bit stronger than you, but he can protect you, will you consider him?"
"People always look for the best, if I can't find a good husband,"
I prefer not marrying anyone else.
What a decent woman!
Bravo!
"Foon, a man should achieve something in his life."
"You'd better forget loving affair, the world will be your oyster, you'd fight for your future."
Where should I go to fight for my future?
Isn't it all the go?
Yeah...
Really?
Let me take a look!
Isn't it popular in Britain now?
What?
See!
What do you mean?
Look at me!
Look at my look!
Oh!
Look!
You speak fluent English.
It's wise of me to let you study in Britain.
I'm right to bring this present to you.
See!
You look really smart.
Even a deaf guy can hear that... you spoke whole-heartedly.
So you have to look for the open spaces.
"It's really dangerous, but basically, you have to, like..."
"You have to just get, like, aggressive in there."
You know how it is.
"You know, you're like, ""oh, this guy's gonna lag back?"""
"I'm like, ""I will totally get in there."
"You're taunting me."""
"You know, it's like all this stuff."
Do you watch to see who's on the phone
- 'cause you know you can totally jump in front of them?
"- Oh, yeah."
I take photos of license plates when I see people on the phone.
"I'm like, ""amateur hour!"
"Get the [Bleep] Out of my way!"""
That's what I would have said.
You can edit that out.
"Now, as a woman with style, I feel like you probably can tell a lot about a guy by his car."
Right.
What would you think about a guy in a Corvette?
What kind?
What year?
"Let's say a Corvette Convertible, yellow, 2010."
It's not gonna be for me.
That's okay.
[ Laughter ]
"A little older, and then it's sort of ironic and funny."
"And then I'm like, ""this guy's got a great sense of humor."""
Is he wearing...
[ Laughter ]
"""He's got a great sense of humor."
""" Yeah."
Is he wearing a chain?
- Won't pick up.
"Kid's pink, sat's fine."
24 gauge going on in the right.
"You want me to take this, Kerry?"
I don't mind.
"What, you think I'm rusty?"
"Superficial head lacs, no step-offs, left frontal-parietal hematoma."
Call CT and let them know we need a head.
Finally calming down.
Or going apnic.
"Come on, baby."
Wake up.
Wake up.
"All right, uh, Inez, miller one and a 4-O."
She needs a tube.
"Kerry, the kid's screaming."
The airway is obviously fine.
She's got a good mechanism for a head injury and she needs a CT.
"So what you're going to subject her to the risks of intubation, just to make it easier for the radiologist?"
- She'll settle down.
Give her some time.
- She doesn't have time.
Agitation could be an early sign of head injury.
Or an appropriate response to a stressful situation.
Babies cry when they're scared.
"Thank you, but this is my patient."
Her mental status is waxing and waning.
She could go apnic in the scanner.
You bag her through it.
.5 of versed and vec.
Hold on.
You're going to lose your neuro exam if you sedate.
"Pardon me, dear Father, I beseech you."
"Henceforward, I will live beneath your rule."
"Well said, my daughter."
"If you should find Romeo in morbid grief or feverish, these herbs will make him well."
Be sure he's strong to take the journey home.
But do not fear.
My letter will revive him.
"Give me your blessing, and I will be gone."
God speed your path and keep you safe from harm.
"Nurse, here is the key to fetch more spices."
The cook wants dates and quinces for the pies.
We must a-move on.
Paris will be here.
"Get anything we need, spare not the cost."
"My lady and my lord, get you some rest or you will not survive the wedding feast."
What nonsense!
I've been up all night before for lesser cause than this.
And I know why.
And look to have no repetition now.
A wife still jealous after all these years?
"Why, 'tis compliment enough to give me cheer."
Hmm?
Hmm?
Wife!
Nurse!
- Will nobody obey me?
!
"- Oh, peace, peace!"
Go waken Juliet.
Dress her and trim her.
"Pray, bring her down to compliment the bridegroom in his choice."
Hmm.
Are you calling for the President's daughter?
Oh how come you...?
Just saw her in a ceremony before.
I just saw her go to that side.
It should be okay now.
Let's leave.
Why... do you plan to leave now?
Go where?
I came out because I have a headache.
Let's go inside now.
I really appreciate your help.
If it wasn't for you...
Just thinking about it is scary.
That's right.
"That woman just now, her contact method,"
Maybe that unlucky person will know.
Unlucky person?
"Yesterday, did you or didn't you lose her?"
We lost her.
I heard you were doing well in training.
"If this continues, how can I let you be bodyguards in the US?"
What did I tell you?
I said her character is really different.
Don't tell me you didn't know what that meant!
We will note that.
"For her protection, intervals should be avoided and she should be followed closely."
Maybe you guys think you should not be blamed and I should pity you because you are young.
"But, her father is the president."
=There's a call.=
=There are two messages.=
For you.
"Hey, it's cold."
"I just saw the rest of my life, and there were no more surprises."
This was it.
"I mean, it was great..."
But it was it.
What makes you think this isn't gonna happen again?
- I know it won't.
"- Oh, right."
Come on!
Aren't we supposed to be able to learn from our mistakes?
"I did something horrible, but I learned from it."
I met this little brunette and I faltered.
Are you telling me that throughout your entire marriage you never faltered?
You haven't?
Never?
- Never.
"- Oh, that makes me feel great."
You think it's because I wasn't tempted?
You think that this woman is the last brunette that's ever gonna let you know that she wants you?
Look at me.
I haven't met my last brunette.
She's the last one I'm gonna kiss.
"I'm in love with your daughter, Stephen."
"And maybe that doesn't mean anything to you, but I'm standing here."
You're her father.
"I'm looking you in the eyes and I'm telling you,"
I will do anything in the world to get your daughter back.
- Really?
Anything?
- I'll do anything.
- People say that.
They don't mean it.
- But I mean it.
"And just because I am a woman, they do not have the courtesy to tell me where they are going or when they will be back."
I'm a man.
That's right!
Which makes this even worse.
I'm going to Tony again.
(phone ringing)
We're doing our best to keep the investigation closed.
Clayton?
"Uh, no update yet, Mr. Wickes."
We're trying to keep this out of the press.
"The less our shooter knows, the better off we are."
"Okay, we're asking these people to not say anything about what they saw."
I saw a man with a gun.
"Right, I got that."
So you're going to be in this group.
"You're going to answer their questions, then you're going to go home."
Okay?
You're going to lay low and you're going to tell your people that you need some personal time.
"No, I don't want that."
I want him kept separate from the group.
He was standing next to Jarvis.
He had a better view than anybody.
"The gunman, he was wearing a blue hat."
I saw him.
"Okay, okay."
"We're going to put you with a sketch artist,"
You write down everything you remember.
"Of course, anything."
VANCE:
Gibbs.
"Massive blood loss, doesn't look good."
His family's been notified.
How's your arm?
"(DISTORTED) You think, because you tasted my blood, that you know what I am."
"Well, to be fair, I am standing in your flat."
You don't know what I am.
- And you don't know where I am.
- Where are you?
Everywhere!
I can walk down any street.
I can peer...
"- He's close, less than a mile."
- I can knock on any door.
I am the shape at the window.
I am the hand under the bed.
"So what's the play, Cameron?"
"Cos that's what it is, isn't it?"
It's a play.
With Cameron Pell starring as Mr Punch.
Do you know anything about this city?
"Well, I know that it smells a bit funny when it gets hot."
"This, now, everything, this place, this time, this cretinised culture."
"- We are the richest, most decadent..."
- Less than three minutes.
...people that ever lived.
And still we're dissatisfied.
We have lost our history.
We have lost our myths.
"You see, kids in Whitechapel play video games in which they score points by killing prostitutes."
(SIREN BLARES)
They're totally indifferent to the spectre that walks past their window.
(SIREN BLARES)
This is a dead city.
- It's an unreal city.
I was thinking of re-upping.
Nothing else you'd rather do?
No.
I was recruited by a software company in college.
The kind that makes apps for phones.
What's wrong?
Pay is no good?
"No, it was great, actually."
"Obscene, to be honest with you."
"Why didn't you do it, then?"
I don't know.
"I don't know, I guess I just felt like it was silly, it wasn't really that important, you know?"
I guess I like the idea of serving my country.
Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
What about you?
You never wanted to do anything else?
"There comes a time when you do a thing long enough, you can't really imagine doing anything else, you know?"
"So, if I stay here, I'm stuck with you forever?"
Yes.
Be careful what you wish for.
(laughing)
katherine:
"You're doing it again, aren't you?"
What?
You have that look that you get.
What look?
You're squinting one eye as if you're taking aim with a gun.
-You're gonna be late.
-lt's horrifying.
I'm sure you're great fun at parties.
"Seriously, you don't have to think about killing everyone that you ever meet."
-l don't.
You have a lieutenant here.
"Lieutenant, uh, James Dunbar."
"Yes, sir."
I'm Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
105353.
That is correct.
"Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations."
"Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men."
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt.
They are very angry in Berlin.
They will be even angrier on the east front waiting for that ammunition train.
"Don't you think so, lieutenant?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Now, lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters?"
I have a nice fire going.
I'm okay here.
Why bother?
No bother.
I'm very grateful for a little company.
"You see, I suffer from insomnia."
Did you ever try 40 sleeping pills?
"We have some rights, colonel."
Why is this man being taken out?
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.
You will not get them.
How did he ever find out about that train?
You must have shot your mouths off from Frankfurt to here.
"- No, we didn't."
-Maybe just a hint or so?
Think hard.
But you stuttered yesterday and the day before.
It was on one word.
It was on one stupid little word.
And you know what the word was?
Country.
Country.
And you know why I probably hit that word?
"It was because I was in the presence of Callie, who's a card-carrying c-c-cunt."
[chuckle]
Good for you.
You no longer have a speaking part in the trial.
"Okay, first of all, if I were to stutter in court, which I won't, but if I were, that would only serve to humanize me in front of the jury, which could run to the benefit"
of our very inhuman- and monstrous-seeming client.
"You put me on this case because I'm smart and I'm talented, and I have done great work, thanks to you."
"I've done it-- behind the scenes, maybe, but I-"
- I deserve to be seen doing it.
Shaken confidence does not serve the client or the firm.
My confidence is not shaken.
Mine is.
Come on.
I'm ready for this.
Let me do it.
Please.
You'll still be a valuable member of the team.
And a dear friend.
Are you breaking up with me?
[click]
- Good night.
- Good night.
Callie.
I hear you're back on top with Borns Tech.
Not surprising.
I protected you from clear and massive violations of Federal rules and regulations!
You know what?
"Whatever you did, you got paid for it, didn't you?"
- [click]
- We made mistakes.
Okay?
But I'll tell you what we didn't do.
We didn't kill anyone.
"How about you, Donald?"
Did you kill anyone?
No.
- Don't tell me--
- Hey.
- You fucking asshole.
- Wendell.
You know what?
What was his name?
"But, with her consent, Captain Dreyfuss, so if you don't mind, I won't give you his name."
"I don't believe he meant any harm, and my daughter said he was sweet and chivalrous."
I don't want him punished any more than he has been.
Has been?
"Er, Michael was very upset."
He let the young man know forcefully.
- Forcefully?
Were there blows?
- Almost.
"No father finds it easy to cope with the idea that his daughter is the object of, er, let's say, desire, Captain Dreyfuss."
Do you have children of your own?
No.
"I am, er, I'm not married."
I should go.
"Our notes on Moybeg can wait until another time, given how you must feel right now."
I don't trust you in this hospital.
"And I certainly don't trust you with my patient of three years, who's extremely important."
I...
"If you want to stay on this case, you will stay out of my way."
"You will do what I tell you, and if you have something to say to or about my patient, you will raise your hand and wait to be called on."
You--you've got to be kidding me.
Yes.
"This is a joke, right?"
Do I look like I'm laughing?
You're upset.
I don't get upset with patients.
You're mad at me for killing those women.
I get that.
Would you feel differently if you knew that I was beaten as a child?
Every day.
It's how I learned to read.
I-I used to hide under the sink and sound out the letters on the detergent box.
Is that true?
Did it make you feel better?
"Whatever helps you sleep at night, dr."
Grey.
Did you do something bad?
Traffic violation.
"What's wrong with you, kid?"
I need a new liver and a new intestine.
Yeah?
You want mine?
Are you in the north terminal?
"Well, that's where she's supposed to be."
"No, no, do-don't go anywhere."
Just wait.
Never mind.
They like a good buzz.
- Are you just trying to set me up?
- Why would I do that?
'Cause you want to see me fail.
"I mean, why else would you come here tonight?"
I just had nothing else to do.
"- Vodka, huh?"
- Grey Goose.
Hey.
Go take the kids shopping.
Get supplies for Judah-Fest.
"Yeah, I can do that, with money for both provisions and my services as a nanny/assistant."
Oh.
"Oh, that's how it's gonna be?"
"Well, according to my calculations,"
I will have fully repaid my debt to you as of my next excursion to the dry cleaner's.
"I'd like to double-check those numbers, if you don't mind."
"They're rough estimates, really."
"They're more projections, taking inflation into account."
"I got another bill today from your old alma mater, Hamadash La blah blah blah?"
"Over $5,000."
"Hamidrash I'Torah, and that happens to be tax-deductible."
"I don't pay taxes, you idiot."
There's a big harvest coming up in a couple of weeks.
Why don't you come back and help?
I'll put you on the payroll.
- I want more than Sanjay.
- Forget it.
"Wait, wait, wait."
"- Yeah, I'll take it."
- Welcome back.
- Jelly beans for the piñata.
"Come on, Magnum."
"Go, Magnum, go.!"
Hit it!
Remember.!
Knees to chest.!
"Chop-chop, chaps."
To the van.
Come on.
I was dying.
"Everything confirmed it... my lungs, my head, my aching muscles."
"So, I concentrated on Roger."
I tried to think of all the reasons Roger didn't leave the island... when he knew the mafia and the feds were on his tail.
It came down to either a great love for Babs... or he couldn't get his hands on the money.
Yeah.
I settled on the money too.
"I thought of all the ways it might be tied up... investments, stocks, gold, land... ways that would take a while to liquidate."
After 26 miles...
I decided it was none of the above.
"He'd hidden it somewhere, and he couldn't put his hands on it immediately."
"By the time I got on the bicycle, I was ready to fall over dead."
I'd never make a hundred miles.
There was no way.
Not even if I concentrated on Roger and his problem.
Impossible.
But I had to try.
Beauty Knows No Pain.
He'd hidden the money.
He had to.
"The statute of limitations was almost up, but he couldn't get it because... it was inaccessible."
I had it.
I had the answer.
"Only I was so damn tired, I couldn't pull it out of my brain."
"The idea is to keep girl from leaving, not drive them away."
Frannie'd have found a way around this.
"Let's play ""What would Frannie do?"""
Go with me girl.
She'd make Lizzi cry.
And?
Tie her up and put her on a basement somewhere.
I don't know.
- The Kappa Taus have a basement.
"- Buffalo Bill, let's put a pin in that."
Wait...
- You have an idea?
- Yeah.
You just have got to be the #1 weapon on the fight for abstinence.
I thought you enjoyed being ravaged by me in super places.
It's like we're secret sex spies.
I say we remove cars from our list of spy places.
"We're running out of places, library, aiport,"
- that church.
- We'll be more creative for the future.
You believe we have a future together.
Hypothetically.
"In a world where there's no Casey, you're a one-woman men and people don't gossip."
"Miss Logan, I'm surprised you worry about such things."
I don't.
But maybe you do.
You're not contradicting me.
Which is why secret sex is so appealing right now.
No complications.
Get out.
I have class and we can't be seen together.
It'll blow our cover.
"If you attend our fundraising event next week, we promise not tell everyone that you're a..."
Despicable liar.
"Well, I guess that I,"
I don't really have a leg to stand on.
"No, and while we're on that subject, work on your limping."
"Oh, and get dark glasses."
You'll be blind by then.
"Oh, there you are."
Your mum went out looking for you.
I know.
"Oh, I lost her two streets over."
"Look, she made a mistake."
But she was just trying to get you to talk.
I know.
And how does that make you feel?
What?
Never mind.
I'm gonna tell you how it makes you feel.
"See, for the past week, I've been seeing therapists... and they've been trying to get me to talk."
But I don't like it.
Partly because it's none of their bloody business.
But mostly because I'm afraid if...
"I do start to open up and let it out,"
I might completely fall apart.
Is that how it makes you feel?
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
So I just don't wanna talk about it at all.
"But it doesn't make you any less angry, does it?"
No.
"Look, I understand."
My dad left my mum... and it really messed with my head and my trust.
"And when I was in my 20s,"
I will leave you in peace.
"Oh, no. (GIGGLES)"
It's very bad.
"No, don't!"
Ooh!
That's really quite good.
"One, two."

I can see you're not one of those perfumed prancers in there.
- What do you say to a little hunting?
- I am standing guard on my mistress.
That one?
"She doesn't need your protection, by God."
Fascinating creature.
I'm sure she'd rather come hunting with us than sit around arranging her flounces.

- Will you take it to him?
- Why don't you take it to him yourself?
I've been avoiding him all morning.
"He's had a poor first impression of me, I fear."
"Before I meet him again, I want him to be convinced of my complete sincerity."
Well?
What do you think?
"Look, you know him."
How will he respond?
I can't imagine any man resisting this prose.
It would melt the Alps.
"But tell me, why do you pounce on our poor Chopin?"
Buy it!
"It will save you time and money, it'll save both because time is money!"
"You can't tie a tube around your neck each morning, that's impossible!"
You need this completely prepared thing.
If there is anything that the Dawes Plan didn't take it's your head... and it should tell you that you need this.
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, buy this, buy!"
You'll purchase cheap and genuine here.
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50."
Look!
It doesn't tear or grind nor break.
"Don't laugh, ladies and gentlemen, don't laugh."
I just wanted to show how unbreakable such a small piece can be.
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50!"
Buy this really genuine piece!
Buy!
How nice that you showed up here!
"- Wait a moment, I gotta get my stuff."
- I'll wait right here.
"Franz, you'd make a great dad."

Why not?
Would you mind?
You're not getting anywhere.
Just wait and see.
Others are off much worse with their jobs or locked up in Tegel.
"What is it, girl?"
You can sit in a warm and dry place and do whatever you please.
I got something for you.
What do you have?
Nice.
- Where did you get all this?
- Thrift store.
"Well, can you blame me?"
No worries.
I am more than happy with the way things worked out.
"Hey, guys."
Enjoy the party.
"Oh, my favorite married couple."
- Rosalie.
- Come on.
I'll show you around.
Why not?

"Yes, ma'am."
This is a great location for a party.
Promise you'll let me come back.
"If this small talk is just a ploy to seduce me,"
I'm not interested.
I just got a call from Agent Garcia about your case.
Good news: the investigation will be closed on Monday...
Thank God.
When they arrest Victor on fraud and money laundering charges.
They found out?
"They already knew, Neil."
"Phan, where you been hiding?"
"Over in Maui, chilling."
Bought a piece of golf course.
Get out of here.
What?
You get a couple of holes.
"- Come over, I'll take care of you."
- I'm coming at Christmas.
"I saw you were in the shooting in Seattle, so I thought I better get back, keep an eye on business."
"There's something going on, we don't know what."
Bob's got a theory.
Will you stop it with that!
You create this atmosphere of paranoia.
It's ridiculous.
"If it's real, it ain't paranoia."
"Get hip to what's in the air, it's called atmosphere."
You can smell it.
You can taste it.
"Come on, you can see it."
You're scaring me.
We're just talking about this American crew trying to make a push.
- I'm hearing the same thing.
"- So, what about these Americans?"
Couple of guys were round my place when I was gone.
Americans trying to buy whatever weed I had available.
I heard that maybe you were gonna get out of the business.
"Yeah, we've been talking about it."
"So, do I get a chance to buy a piece of it?"
- Make an offer?
- Maybe.
- What piece do you want?
- The contacts out of the East.
He's opening up about himself.
Maybe.
"We need to verify what he's saying, though."
Speak.
"Garcia, I need you to check something for me."
I'm looking for a stray bombing in a bazaar somewhere in Egypt approximately 30 years ago.
"Okay, great."
That's not too obscure.
I don't need you to give me details.
We're just trying to set a baseline for Jind Allah's truthfulness.
- I need to know if it happened at all.
"- When I know, you'll know."
- Thank you.
- When the rubble was cleared... half... of my family was dead.
It was on that day that I swore my life to vengeance for Allah.
"And for that very reason, those holding you here can never let you leave."
Your only hope is to tell me so I can hopefully one day share your struggle with the world.
Your government won't even admit that I exist.
How possibly can you tell my side of the story?
"Hey, guys, we want silence tonight."
No coms.
Let's be careful.
We don't know what to expect.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Let's do it.
Clear!
This place is completely empty.
We missed them again.
"You got Gideon, Prentiss, and me."
It's Hotch.
We're at cell location number 2.
APPLAUSE
You know what?
"You know what, though?"
"If you want to have teeth like Rob's, that's how hard you gotta work out."
You know Nigeria turned him down to be part of their Olympics in 2008?
"I love the idea of him going back having, like, his Pretty Woman moment and going,"
"""You guys work on commission?"
Big mistake.
"HUGE mistake."""
"Jessica, have you ever watched a fight?"
"I did watch the fight, yeah..."
What did you do?
..in the most conventional way.
I was in the Walkabout in Newquay on a hen do.
"I've never really watched it before, but I got quite into it."
"I was quite scared and horny, if I'm honest."
It's something very primal going on.
"Rob, you were..."
You made this documentary about the fight.
Or just pre the fight.
And you got to spar with a former middleweight champion.
Oh...
If only there were a clip of that(!
)
So...
"Can I just say, he's an ex-world champion, and I'm not!"
I don't think you needed to say that.
"When you watch it, just remember Rob is not a professional boxer."
Have a little look.
Aw...
Hands up!
You need waking up!
That's a complete lie.
I can't believe that you are willing to destroy
My relationship with my father because you're too scared
That yours won't love you for who you really are.
You were right.
We need to make these decisions together.
"But the truth is, consulting with someone else"
Doesn't come easily to me.
I get it.
"Vanessa, I totally support you going."
"Thank you, but I'm not taking the internship."
I'd rather lose the job than lose you.
You're not gonna lose me if you go to Haiti.
We're-we're-we're gonna find a way to make this work.
All right?
But you gotta go.
"I don't want to, and we both know"
It's better for our relationship if I stayed.
"I mean, three months is too long, and..."
I just wanna be with you.
Are you sure?
You're-you're making this decision for you?
Not me?
Not-not-not even us?
Uh...
Okay.
"Let's find a way to celebrate tonight, then-a fun way."
"We could, uh..."
Let's see.
You want to sneak 40s
"Into the midnight showing of ""the lost weekend"""
At film forum?
Oh!
"I have to say, Rose, I'm a little confused."
A little disappointed.
Everything was going so well.
"At least, I thought so."
Didn't you?
Is that the truth or some kind of female manipulation?
Tell me the truth.
"You knew the arrangement, how I felt."
Did you think that would change?
Why?
"I hoped, though I made the offer, you'd see there was no need for it."
I'd hoped that we'd gone beyond it.
Did you honestly think this was the next step?
What we have usually comes after all this nonsense is over.
Most people never get to where we are.
They try to keep the sex going.
Or find another.
"Our relationship works, because it isn't physical."
I took every precaution to make sure there was no physical attraction!
"Rose, I'm sorry."
I've never had this with a woman before.
I can share everything with you.
Are you not satisfied with me?
Maybe this is something we have to struggle through together.
Maybe this tour is coming at a good time.
Maybe we can use the distance.
Don't you think?
I thought we were good friends.
"Talk to me, Rose."
Let me in.
I'm sorry.
Of course I'm gonna help you.
"Well, what am I, not gonna help you?"
"I just--like I said, I can't, I gotta--"
"I can't, I got the thing."
I-I got a shift.
"Uh-huh, and what would happen to the shift if I said I wanted to fuck you tonight?"
[chuckles]
"Well, I mean... ♪♪"
Could probably get it covered.
♪♪
Hi.
- [clears throat]
- What are we doing?
Diffusing the sexual tension that's ruining our friendship.
"Okay, so, you want this?"
"Well, if this is what it takes for us to become friends again, then yes, but this is a one-time offer only, okay?"
This is for you to get it out of your system.
"Well, what if I need more than one time?"
One time.
"[music continues, muffled]"
Okay.
No eye contact?
"Well, it's a tight space."
"Um, just the fumes are making me gag, so let's, like, move this along, okay?"
A little impersonal.
"Well, I'm gonna throw you a look over my shoulder every now and then like this."
"Oh, thanks."
"That's more of a ""I stole your parking space"" look than it is of, uh, arousal."
"[sighs] Well, I'll keep that in mind, try to make it better."
[chuckles]
This floor is disgusting.
[clears throat]
Janeway to Voy...
Get up!
Get away from her!
Commander... any word on that tellerium?
Not yet.
How bad is it?
The antimatter reaction rate is down to 12 percent.
"If it drops below nine, the plasma injectors will lock up and we'll never be able to reinitialize the nacelles."
Options?
"If we're going to reduce our power demands even further, we're going to have to drop the shields."
I don't want to leave the ship defenseless this close to a hostile planet.
All other systems are already off-line.
Life support is at minimal.
You asked for options.
Thas our last one.
"All right, power down the shields."
That helped.
Is only a matter of time.
There's nothing more we can do without the tellerium.
Neelix to Voyager.
"Yes, Neelix."
"The rest of the away team is gone, Commander."
They've been taken by the Mokra.
What do you want me to do?
Did you get the tellerium?
"Yes, I have it."
Then we need you here.
Prepare to beam directly to Engineering.
Rerouting emergency power to Transporter Room 2.
And... energizing.
Chakotay to away team.
"Captain, can you hear me?"
Okay.
"Look, you stay out of Vegas, and we'll be fine."
"Come now, Samantha."
"If your clients are truly happy, then I pose no threat."
"But when your service is less than exemplary, like with Mr. Harpel there, who I'm sure would have met you at the appointed time... had you only picked him up yourself in a jet, as I did,"
then you become vulnerable to competition.
"Oh, see, now you don't have to teach me how to service my clients."
I happen to be the number one host in Las Vegas.
A meaningless distinction.
What?
"You might be number one at the moment, but you've never had to compete with the best."
"Now that I'm here, you won't be on top for long."
Wanna bet?
A friendly wager might be in order.
Hmm.
What do you propose?
I bet that I can bring in more money than you can in the next 24 hours.
"And we'll even do it on your home turf, the Montecito."
Nice.
And the winner would say that she...
Or he.
Would be Vegas's best.
Why don't we make it interesting?
Please.
"Winner gets bragging rights, loser leaves town."
Deal?
Deal.
[Chattering]
Hey.
Is that the infamous Paul Logan I see at blackjack 22?
Yep.
He seems so...
"I should have died, but you..."
"You didn't want to be alone, and that's what all this boils down to."
You can't stand the thought of being alone.
All right.
I'll give you this much.
You are certainly willing to do the sacrificing as long as you're not the one being hurt.
"All right, you want to be honest?"
"If the situation were reversed and I was dying, you'd do the same thing."
"No, Dean."
I wouldn't.
Same circumstances...
I wouldn't.
I'm gonna get to bed.
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
Previously on-- Power Rangers...
And now...
A new era is about to begin.
It's a shame you will not be here to see it coming.
"Knight power, energize! [pink] Robo Knight!"
You cannot stop our invasion of Earth from happening.
Fire! Your highness...
It has been an honor to serve you.
What?
"If I were you, I would go into hiding."
The armada will be here any minute.
"Your brother, the prince, won't recognize you, and may mistake you for an enemy."
"Even though I couldn't do it myself,"
I take comfort knowing that you will be destroyed soon.
Watch out! Argus.
Levira.
Our invasion went well.
What about sleep?
How many hours of sleep do you get?
Do you sleep soundly?
"No, not really, I can't get a good night's sleep."
And it takes a while for me to fall asleep.
What about your appetite?
"I don't really crave anything, but I do eat."
"On a scale of one to ten, where would you rank your migraine?"
At its most painful.
I wonder...
"I'm not really sure, around a six or seven?"
It's difficult to endure without medicine.
And its frequency?
How many times does it occur in a week?
Three days?
Four?
"Once it starts, it lasts the whole day."
"When you take your medicine, does the pain subside?"
"Not completely, but yes."
What year is it right now?
Do I have Alzheimer's?
"Or am I in the process, and have a mild cognitive impairment?"
You've done a lot of research.
"I searched on the internet,"
I was worried.
"Yes, well first, please answer these questions and make notes often."
What day is it today?
Wednesday.
Seventy-seven plus twelve is what?
Eighty-eight.
"No, nine, eighty-nine."
Please count backwards from that number.
And I'm actually the oldest.
It's pretty safe to say that Jill's obsession with aging and getting married in due time started back in Catholic school and specifically our first communion.
We got to walk down the isle like mini brides to be.
Comparing prettiest dresses...
and fanciest bows.
This is where Jill got programmed to plan for the next time... she would walk down the aisle...
dressed in white.
You are getting married
A little toy here or there never hurt anyone.
Plus it comes with a carrying case.
Oh!
That is such an inappropriate gift.
What you're saying you don't masturbate?
No personally I don't masturbate.
I find it to be a little bit... un-holy.
Wouldn't you agree?
Jillian thank you I love this!
Dale have you talked to JP?
No.
I mean he called twice but...
"Hey, I heard you saw Zach."
Oh yeah.
I saw his video on TV the other day he looks so good.
Did you guys make plans to hang out?
No we just caught up for a second.
He was with a girlfriend.
Hmmm...
Ok what is up?
What?
You look like either have to pee or you're about to explode with gossip.
Do I?
- Which is it?
Mr. Lin?
Come in.
"Mr. Lin, your brother and his girlfriend were killed at the beach car park on Sept 3."
We suspect they fought back and were killed.
We found a metal ruler at the crime scene.
We matched the prints on the ruler to a Lo Keung
We shouldn't show you these but you were once a brilliant cop in China.
We hope... you understand.
"You can provide us more info and facts, then we can solve this case."
"I remember he has a diamond watch and a belt,"
a wallet with a photo of us.
Well done!
The whole HK knows.
I've never seen so many letters of praise but there're just as many complain letters.
They're all yours!
Tell me.
Why all this for a small robber?
You caused major road chaos in Central.
So who is going to back you up next time?
"Sir, a small robber is still a robber."
We shouldn't discount them.
"Also, there were hostages to protect."
Who do you think you are?
Superhero?
No one likes you in the whole station!
"I don't care, I just want to do my job."
I don't care.
This is the police.
We've rules to follow.
"If not for your father asking his friends to call the Chief, you'd have been fired."
Get lost and be your rich playboy!
Get out!
Sorry.
Bad joke.
It's just a laugh riot around here.
This all looks really good.
"Yeah, it's too bad you're leaving."
We never eat like this.
That's not true.
I cook all the time.
Dad...
"I'm sorry, honey."
Let's just eat.
We're not saying we want you to cook more.
"Hell, no."
You remember the meat loaf incident of '98?
That was brisket.
"Yeah, that's my point exactly."
"As your attorney, I'll cosign these forms."
They basically say that you don't have a legal parent or a guardian available.
So I'm now property of the government.
Nickname: 0382965.
"Hey, it's better than death-breath Seth."
Or so I would imagine.
"So we'll meet with your social worker in the morning, and she'll be the one to, uh... to take you to the group home."
"My contact at Child Services got you a room with only two other kids, which is good, because it can get crowded."
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
"And, you know, they do find foster homes for kids your age."
"Yeah, because everybody wants a brand-new teenager."
I'm sorry if I'm the only one here that'll state the obvious...
Seth.
"But we have all this extra room, right?"
We have a pool house.
Now this truck contains somethin' in addition to just cologne.
- Somethin' like what?
- A bag full of money.
"The weird part, is the guy called us up... and had the stones to taunt us after he did what he did."
- Stones...
- Or some kind of a death wish.
Cos he all gave us his address.
"His name and number, was clear as day the whole time he was fuckin' with us."
Culpepper lives about three blocks from this dude.
She's checked him out.
"Says he leaves in the morning, comes back in the afternoon."
"When he comes home, you'll be waiting for him."
And that's that.
"The landlord's on our team, so the door will be open."
- Better be.
"- Relax, the door will be open."
And you don't have to worry about the noise either.
- Why not?
- The building's almost empty.
Switching over the condos or some kinda gentrificational kind of shit.
"You sure this guy was working alone, Russ?"
Pretty sure!
Landlord said the guy's a loner.
This happens tomorrow.
- Can you handle it?
- 'Course we can handle it.
You got the specs?
Now we good?
"Yeah, we good."
"Come on, Daze."
Hey you guys hear about Barbie Sunday's new dress?
- Yea we know.
"You know, the passports were a gift from me."
"Least you could do is cover my shift, you rat bastard."
Thought you were gonna ask carter.
I was.
I did.
She acted like I was waving a sock in front of her face.
I'm sure you were polite and respectful as always.
"You sweet on her, sousa?"
Don't you have enough women in your life to worry about?
"All right, I'm gonna give you"
"A nickel's worth of free advice, pal."
"No girl's gonna trade in a red, white, and blue shield"
For an aluminum crutch.
Your knowledge of waste removal rather surprises me.
I spent a week down here in the winter of '42.
It was...
"another time, perhaps."
"After all, we all have secrets."
I was wrong.
I need to know.
Miss carter...
"If we're going to be working together,"
"Risking our lives together,"
Then I must be able to trust you.
"On my honor, you can."
Your honor is not enough.
Mr. Stark deemed me worthy of his trust.
I would hope that would suffice.
Mr. Stark would trust a shark to not bite him
If it was wearing a short enough skirt.
That's not entirely relevant.
Would it satisfy you to know
You know that?
What?
"What, babe, what's going on in that crazy head of yours?"
"I really want this to work, Stevie."
But?
You know so little about me.
What if I turned into a werewolf or something?
I'll buy you a flea collar.
I love you.
- Stevie?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
"I set out some clean clothes for you, your stuff is not dry yet."
You always keep men's clothes lying around?
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep a clean change clothes here.
"I'll probably just throw them out now though, right?"
"Hey, perfect fit."
"Yeah, well, Trevor..."
I don't have a size 26 waist here.
"Hey, how about that idea."
I can get a job selling man's wear.
Those chicks got paid vacations too.
I'll settle for that.
That's not a bad life.
Could be worse.
You know what else I want to do?
"I want to clean up this place, just get rid of all the fucking junk."
"Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper, which I sometimes am... but I can also be very very, you know, organised and neat."
And I wanna do more of that.
I would love to paint a place.
"Just make it nice, just be organised, and neat and paint it white."
"If the d.A. Finds out ann dated him,"
He'll use it to make ann look like a prostitute.
Don't worry about al stirling.
I'll take care of him.
"I said we'd get paid for this case,didn't i?"
"Alden, handle the physical evidence."
See if the knife wounds are consistent with self-Defense.
I'd rather work with ann.
Her testimony will be our whole case.
"No,do the scientific evidence."
You do that better than anybody.
"Besides, you think she's a hooker."
"No,i don't,ron."
I've seen her place.
I think she's just a college girl that goes out
"With rich men so she doesn't feel like a loser... and she's hiding a gawky past, which i understand."
I've been that.
Okay.
Let alden take ann.
I'll take the physical stuff.
Ann's parents are coming in from nebraska.
I hate the families.
You handle 'em.
I'm going to see al.
"That was nice, him pardoning you,al."
"Well,if you'd handled my tax case,"
I wouldn't have been convicted.
"I told you, ""stop stealing from people."
"But if you're going to steal, pay your taxes."""
"It was free advice, but did you listen?"
So you know ann diggs.
I took her to some laker games.
They mustn't get away.
"Come on, we must get to the other side."
Step on the gas!
"Ah, yes, thank you."
I'm glad I can show you our problems on the spot.
- We've just received this radio message.
"- OK, thank you."
"Gentlemen, perhaps we should propose a toast to our president Ramírez."
May our relations always remain as positive as they have been thus far.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Thank you.

"There were 185 children aboard the plane, who were on their way home."
Both the children and the crew died.
Enrique Carrasco is held responsible for the attack.
He was seen at the airport at the time of the attack.
/t seems certain that he committed this inhuman crime...
- What do you think about this?
- We didn't catch Carrasco.
He escaped.
No one who has seen these images will help him.
He's finished.
- It's got stuck in the tree.
"- Come on, let's climb up."
- I've got it!
I've got it!
- Come down and show it to us.
Show it to us.
What does it say on this piece of paper?
Nothing important.
They're asking the guerrilleros to surrender.

You weren't the first licensed practioner that sleeps with one of your patients and you won't be the last.
"Besides, you're single."

Vi !
Let's go !
What are you doing ?
I don't get it.
Don't get what ?
What's so funny about the vegetarians ?
I don't get it .
You mean the veterinarian man ?
"Yea, that guy."
I don't get it .
He sleeps with his patients .
His patients are probably cats and dogs and llamas and stuff.
Why is that funny?
Back home we had puppy dogs and kitty cats
I used to nap with all the time.
I think it's sweet.
"Actually, don't worry about it , partner."
There're plenty of other jokes in the universe that we can share .
Let's just get ready for tonight.
Some well deserved vacation.
"I got a good one for you, Violet ."
Lay it on me!
Oh damn!

I think I forgot it .

I'll be here when it comes back to you .
Don't worry.

She saw her mother die at the hands of the Venoms.
The four Venom brothers.
Like Mickey's four fingers.
I've only wanted what's good for Mary.
But she seeks her mother's fate.
What can one do...
"Two days before retiring,"
"And still sizing up guys who sell both the cannons and the fodder, the catchphrases."
"But I keep trying, with the wild horses."
"Mickey, you, the limpet."

The entire photo fights against death.
"Against time, against break-ups..."
Against things we'll never see again...
"Anyhow, that's not important."
Unlike the pictures.
Where is this?
It's in London.
The same hotel room as before.
"The same bed, of which we can't see the..."
The convolutions anymore.
What I liked is...
"The contrast between this extraordinarily serious, studious person..."
And the idleness...
Of the same man...
Sitting...
Unoccupied...
Waiting for I don't know what...
"Which isn't part of his official, public image."
What I really liked was the contrast between this incredible dignity...
Of his reading position...
"And this sort of idleness, waiting for something."
Of the same person.
Is that you?
"Oh, you shouldn't ask questions like this."
Whether it's me or not...
All the pictures are me.
"But yes, here that's me."
I think I was very stoned.
I also was in New York at that time.
"Not the same year, by the way."
I simply... just...
I countertyped this picture.
"Brother, it can turn death into life."
Good sword!
"Brother, your 8-divine Sword is fantastic."
"Yue-lam, you must have suffered a lot."
"Otherwise, I would not have been able to learn Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine Sword."
"Brother, I know how much you love kung-fu."
What I've done is worthwhile!

It'll be alright!

All parties are getting stronger and more formidable.
And they are all Han.
It's a threat to our Dynasty!
You're right!
But don't worry.
I have an idea that will destroy both parties.
What's your idea?
"Your Highness, Shaolin and Wu-tang are traditional rivals."
We can kill two birds with one stone.
How?
"Your Highness, order the two factions to merge into one."
So that they'll fight each other!
"Right, they'll fight each other!"
But that's against the spirit of kung-fu.
Yue-lam!
You must understand that this is my duty.
I've got to do this!

"Sheer, childish, soft-brained idiocy."
"But fortunately for you, I need all three of you at Tantrapur."

Of the most vital importance.
You leave for Tantrapur... with a detachment in the morning... to repair the telegraph and keep it open.
Left turn!
"Left wheel, quick march!"
Left wheel!
Attention!
Eyes forward!

I don't mind saying the whole thing fair gives me the creeps.

"When the exchange opens, i'll be down there buying, buying, buying!"
All right.
I warned you.
"Thank you, commodore."
Ha ha!
"Luke, get my carriage."
It's time for me to charge the enemy.
No.
"I'm not gonna let you budge from this office, jim."
It's worth your life.
You think i'm going to back down now because of those hot-air threats?
You think i'm scared?
You could fight just as hard back of that ticker as you can down in the gold room.
That's a great idea.
I'll stay here behind the barricades.
"Before the exchange opens, you go down there and tell my brokers to keep on buying."
"When gold reaches 200, i'll march down there in glory."
"After this is all over, you can do all the parading you want to, but you don't have to go down there today!"
"Oh, yes, i do."
"When gold reaches 200, i got to be there to collect a bet."
"Are you going for me now, or must i spoil a good idea by going myself?"
"I'm going, boss."
Buy and keep on buying.
Buy!
"Buy, she is."
"You boys watch that door and don't let nobody get in there, you hear me?"
I want to see jim fisk!
Aah!
"I'll bid 25,000!"
I'll buy it.
Any more bids?
Who's got gold?
brat!
Looks like you want a double suicide.
But you're going to make your trip to Hell alone.
Don't make me laugh.
Who could be beaten by a brat like you?
Don't you get it yet?
That armored suit is as good as a toy in front of me.
Why don't you stop profaning God's temple with your blood already?
God's temple?
Where is God in this room?
and the one who wields it is God.
Which part of this extermination equipment is God?
!
is only given to the chosen one.
A person like you has no right to be on this ark.
You're just another person who's being used!
You're just an expendable item to your government!
Don't you see that?
!
My plans no longer have anything to do with the Pentagon or the Machiner's Squad.
I'll judge these rotten human beings with my own hands.
You've gotta be kidding!
Stay back!
You bastard..!
He's dead.
"Project name... ""Cosmos."
The Pentagon's special experimental unit in which elite killers are trained since childhood.
Number 43.
Don't call me by a number.
Yu Ominae....
I've heard the rumor... didn't you?
Number 43!
Francois.!
Kali.!
Come here.!
"Look here, Smith."
Why can't we do business?
"I'm always open to an honest proposition, Mr. Thornton."
"We'll give you the claim, all of it."
You can have what gold we've got.
But leave us some way of getting out of here.
The winter snows are coming on.
"My dear man, you call that a business proposition?"
"We already have the mine, and the gold is ours by right of-"
How shall I put it?
By right of conquest.
Do you mind if we don't argue the point anymore?
Let's help ourselves.
Mr. Thornton would only squander the gold.
"I must commend your sense of humor, Mr. Thornton."
Very few people would be able to smile on an occasion like this.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
I remember watching a magician once.
"From an apparently empty hat, he shortly produced a rabbit."
"He smiled very much as you're smiling now... because, I imagine, he knew all the while... that he had that rabbit up his sleeve."
"You've something up your sleeve, perhaps."
Perhaps.
"Roll up your sleeve, Mr. Thornton."
There's no rabbit there.
"Come, come."
Don't let's strain our friendship.
Madam.
"Careful, you idiot."
"Well, you're right."
I'm invisible.
"That night, the only person in worse shape than Robin... was her fiancé."
"Ted, I'm desperate."
"Earlier today, I saw that wrist cuff, and I got a partial for Marshall."
Did you bang that girl yet?
Don't get your hopes or anything else up.
I tried to connect with her... but everything just comes back to her weird fetish about how old I am.
"Well, just go simple."
Does she like TV?
No.
But I'll watch 60 Minutes with you as loud and as long as you want.
- Sports?
- No.
But I bet you look super hot playing shuffleboard... just slathered in Bengay.
"- Well, does she like books?"
- No.
- But I bet you do.
- Mm-hmm.
I bet you have a big...
thick... pair of bifocals.
She doesn't have daddy issues.
She has granddaddy issues.
I'm ending it.
"Ted, I beg of you."
Don't quit on a body that won't quit.
"Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker."
That's going in the journal.
- Did you steal my dream journal?
- No!
Now get back in there before all your teeth fall out... and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School in a play you never rehearsed for.
Bastard!
Thank you!
-Thank you!
-Greetings!
"well, thats where the boss sits."
"Boss, your manager says that you.."
..dont want to accept our goods?
"Dont do that with us, sir!"
We will have to auction everything!
"Sir, we will be ruined!"
Thats what I want!
Krishna?
"Yeah, your humble servant!"
Krishna!
The same man who was slapped and abused!
The same man who was thrown out of..
..the house underthe false accusation of theft!
"So, you are taking revenge forthat?"
I have forgotten about that already.
But how can I forget about the tears from my madams eyes?
How can I forget what you did with my master?
"Do you remember, how did you suddenly.."
..change yourself in the time of need?
Do you rememberthat you had denied..
..from signing the guarantee papers?
Did you remember how did the lenders take away the car?
Do you remember how did you force sirto leave cigar?
"Mr. Vicky, you guys dont remember anything."
But Krishna is aware of everything.
I am not going to accept your goods.
Go and complaint about me in the police station!
Go to court if you want!
Go!
- We're to be going.
Heaven knows when we shall be back.
Why do you suppose he turned up in an Arab outfit and wearing make-up?
What's more important:
why was he killed?
I bet he was a spy or something.
What were you writing down?
What was he telling you?
I'll tell you later.
- (Siren Wailing)
- What is it?
l-l just feel kinda funny.
Why should he pick me out to tell?
After what we said about him last night.
"When we get in with the inspector, I'll do my best to cut the red tape."
- Fine.
Fine.
- l'm going to stretch a bit.
I'm afraid the questions will go till doomsday if you admit you knew him.
I don't know him at all.
We met yesterday on a bus.
"They're a cynical lot, these French."
They might refuse to believe that.
"Well, they've got to believe it."
Look at it from their point of view.
"They saw this poor fellow whispering to you, and then they saw you write something down."
Are you gonna show them what you wrote?
(Phone Ringing)
(Speaking French)
"Thank you, Mr Drayton, but a translator will not be necessary."
"Won't you come inside, madame, monsieur?"
Do me the kindness to wait.
Maybe it's where he was planning on taking his victims.
That's what I was afraid of.
Check this out.
That's a body.
What is it?
This is the fallout to his confession.
"What do you think, he was making Putnam watch it?"
STEVE:
That's exactly what I think.
And then he left him locked up in here with only one way out.
"Thought we had lost you there, cuz."
(groans) Get off me.
What happened?
You don't remember?
We were just floating out there on that life raft.
And I spotted land.
That's right.
"You were so excited, you jumped up and lost your balance."
"By the time we got you back in the raft, you had swallowed so much water, that you passed out."
Doc had to do mouth to mouth to get you breathing again.
MAX:
Ah.
"Glad to see you back on your feet, Captain."
Where the hell are we?
"Now, that is a good question."
My best bet is we're on one of the uninhabited islands of the Hawaiian chain.
Most likely Lehua.
Lehua?
"Now, all we have to do is survive until we get discovered."
"Fortunately, I had a have a head start on building the fire."
I did it while you were unconscious.
At least we'll be warm while we starve to death.
Yep !
The old Gibbs is back.
GIBBS:
"You see something, Abs?"
Beauty.
"I mean, it's tragic, but if you were to see this tableau in a museum, you'd swear it was a brilliant commentary on the human condition."
What?
Corpse staring at a TV set?
- It says it all.
"- Well, it doesn't say who put him there or why."
That's for us to find out.
You shaved your mustache.
I liked you with a little hair on your face.
Still got my eyebrows.
Good point.
"I found Finn's blood, hair and fingerprints on the plastic."
So he was probably wrapped in it.
But I didn't find any other prints on the plastic or the shovel.
No chance of grabbing the gravedigger's sweat off the handle?
"After being underground, it's unlikely."
"Strange case, huh?"
I had this friend once that used to display roadkill in his living room.
- He had an NEA grant...
- Abby.
"Um, next I analyzed the soil."
It's compost material.
Rocks and small sticks.
Nothing's over an inch long.
It would indicate that it was processed through a screen.
Pretty clean for dirt.
It's a commercial product.
"But the house was just re-landscaped, so it's not surprising."
Gentlemen...
I wouldn't come too close to the door if I were you.
Have someone guard the prisoners.
"You, stay here."
"Yes, sir."
"Of all the asinine, fool-headed behavior."
You might have been killed.
For what?
For nothing.
"Well, what good is that?"
"Have a little faith, professor."
I'd prefer a hacksaw.
"I'm sorry, MacGyver, I'm afraid we're done for."
I should never have dragged you into this.
"Well, no one twisted my arm."
"No, you don't understand."
I lied.
The Academy didn't send me.
"In fact, the, uh, directors, uh, revoked my tenure."
I mean to put it simply...
I was sacked.
Who financed the expedition?
"I did, I thought that if I could find the Torch, prove Atlantis really existed, then the Academy would reinstate me."
It took all my savings to get this far.
I could barely afford the telegram I sent asking you to come.
"I hate to deceive you like that, but, uh,"
I had no other option.
"Uh, you must believe me."
"I was at the end of my rope, MacGyver."
"Oh, please understand, I mean, y-you were the only person that I could turn to."
Story of my life.
"Anyway, it's useless,"
We're chasing PPO contracts to compete against the HMOs.
- We won't sacrifice our commitment.
- That's what Pedes is all about.
We're a family here.
The kids you see today will be the parents of the kids you'll see in 20 years.
We believe in continuity and commitment.
So do I.
- So do you want to join our family?
"- Yes, I do."
"How's she doing, Peter?"
She's stable.
We're just going over her films now.
Nasty break.
Anybody want to take a crack at reading it?
Type three tibial and fibular fracture with complete displacement.
- Thirty percent chance of nonunion.
- Excellent.
- Were knee and ankle films ordered?
- I don't believe so.
Knee and ankle films are necessary to rule out injuries from transmitted forces.
"She's right as rain, Peter."
Order the films.
Come on.
I've got a couple interesting Colles fractures you may wanna look at.
Have you ever seen a middle ear bone fracture?
- Hey.
How did the interview go?
- Great.
- What did they say?
- They said I was great.
- Did you get the job?
- Ninety grand a year and nobody dies.
What's that look?
- What look?
"- The look, right there."
The one you get when you worry.
Nothing.
Nah.
"When you're done with host committee, why don't you come on inside."
"I'll be in the library with your uncle, okay?"
Senator.
I got to meet with the FCC.
They didn't know what hit 'em.
Thanks so much for coming.
Thanks for your help.
"Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it."
A pleasure.
I'm making breaching charge.
The last one I used blew the hinges off
A metal door in Kandahar.
"I need you to get me through security, into your police station, and then into the evidence lockers."
Narco seized a ton of heroin and cash last week.
That's what he's after.
"Listen, I don't expect you to believe me, but if I don't get that money, a lot of people are gonna die."
"Look, I'm sorry."
"Okay, I didn't wake up this morning thinking this was gonna happen to me, either."
"I don't want to hurt anybody, but here's the deal."
"You're gonna do what I say, when I say it."
"You're gonna rob the station, that's crazy."
Yeah.
I keep hearing that.
"Isaac, we can't let him do this."
I want to talk to him.
To try to change his mind?
Sort of.
"Because as your lawyer, I wouldn't..."
"You know what, it's your life."
You do what you want.
What?
It's the Veriscene case.
The judgment's in.
We find out tomorrow.
That's good.
I don't know.
I've got a bad feeling about this one.
How's everyone this morning?
"Well, Your Honor."
We seem to have a designated hitter here today.
"Yes, Your Honor."
"My partner, Will Gardner, couldn't be in court..."
"Oh, you don't have to cover for him."
I know Will's suspended.
- How's he doing?
"- Very well, thank you for asking."
Like a kid with five days until Christmas.
"Well, tell him he's missed."
Shall we get started?
"Plaintiff alleges that Veriscene, a drug administered for the cure of acne, caused Mr. Goode irreversible sterility."
"Accordingly, I am entering judgment for the plaintiff, in the amount of $25 million in compensatory."
"I acknowledge that this amount is in excess of the $18 million requested by the plaintiff, but I find the actions here particularly heinous."
- Your Honor...
"- Yes, Mr. Canning?"
You want to appeal?
"- Oh, I do."
Uh vehemently.
- As is your right.
"Now that they know our location and vitals,"
It will be perilous to continue with the expedition.
We should head back to BuYeo.
Sa-Yong is right.
"Miss,"
"Those people are with a vengeance, and they'll surely hunt us down."
Our best bet is to avoid them.
"We'd better go back, Miss."
I heard they still address their leader as 'Commander'.
"Ah, what's the use?"
They're nothing but bandits.
Hey don't look down on them.
They're even tougher than the average Heng-In soldier.
These men will gladly jump into fire at a word from their officers.
No wonder even the imperial guards are no match for them.
I... guess this is for real.
Brother.
Seems it's reckless to continue with this expedition.
We should go back to BuYeo.
"Yes, I agree."
"Brother, please convince So Seo-No."
"Truthfully,"
"No matter what adversities I may come across,"
I would still want to reach Go-San Nation.
But the fleet ultimately belongs to So Seo-No.
I guess we have to wait for her decision.
Follow me.
Where to?
To the bandit's hideout.
What?
!
Why?
- We were miserable together.
"- Yes, I kind of feel that way myself you know, Marie and I."
"See a couple of months ago, we had this big set- to and I moved out for a couple of days."
And I just found that--
I just couldn't imagine being separated.
"But I think I gotta really try to imagine it even with the kids, because we're really unhappy."
I'm not telling you it's easy.
It's not.
I'm not having a great time.
"With you, there were no kids involved."
"That's true, and I do miss her."
"But the interesting thing is, I found out a lot about myself."
"I mean, it doesn't make you happy."
Divorce doesn't make you happy.
"But in a weird way, it's made me eligible to be happy more than I ever have been in my life."
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
"I don't know if that will help you or what, but...."
Yeah.
It helps a lot.
"- Thanks, John."
- Yeah.
[COUGHING ]
You gotten the cold from hell yet?
- Maybe after we've spent time together.
- Let's get through this.
- They'll hit us hard on probable cause.
- Let's do it.
"On October 7, did you have occasion to arrest Julio Ortiz?"
- I did.
COSTAS:
Tell us the circumstances.
"No, there's no time."
"- Listen, I need a favor."
- What?
I need money.
How much money you talking about?
$2 million in cash.
"How about I throw in a Ferrari, man?"
"I'm serious, Isaac."
"Don't matter if you are, I don't have it."
Is there anyone else you know who might have the money?
"Well, ain't nobody got more money than the cops, so try them."
They busted a big heroin deal last week.
I heard they ceased 100 kilos and the money for the buy.
They got $4 million in cash.
"All right, so where would the cops be keeping the money?"
"No, I wasn't being serious."
"Where, Isaac?"
It's at the main precinct on Third.
"It's probably in some evidence lockers, but, look, ain't no way you're getting it out of there."
"Yeah, we'll see about that."
"No, look listen, listen."
"That money is surrounded by a hundred cops, all right?"
All kinds of security down there.
"Isaac, I got no other options, man."
So Nicole was right.
What?
"She, um, said you've been having issues since you got out the army."
That you're not happy.
She told you that?
Yeah.
"She thinks you miss what you was doing over there,"
"All the fighting, killing or whatever."
"Well, I haven't slept in days."
Maybe if you just let me get some rest.
I just got kidnapped by space aliens to conduct a freaking top secret science experiment.
You know what we need.
Accelerated regrowth of your native mantle.
I understand what you're asking but come on.
He's doing the best he can.
Do better.
Liana's under a lot of pressure.
"Don't worry, once you crack this, you'll be back home, safe and sound."
What if I can't?
I won't let her harm you.
You have my word.
_
Adíos.
Allison's in a play this weekend.
- Put the meeting off a couple days.
- You know I can't do that.
Going to school events is what normal parents do.
So you're behind schedule in your research because of PTA meetings?
There is no time to waste!
We've got to get the reversion procedure working!
Mommy?
Allison.
What are you still doing up?
"It's late, honey, you should be asleep by now."
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Fostering human tendencies only confuses her.
"- It's not fair, Ted."
- Let's get you back to bed.
"Making her think she's something she's not, it's not fair to her!"
Déjame verla.
For your signature.
"Yes, the pipeline deal."
"Well, I'll just have to look these over and then I'll sign them."
So you and Claudia got married.
Blake doesn't approve.
I hope you do.
"Oh, there's bound to be friction between you and your brother."
I feel no animosity toward Steven.
"If there are any problems, they won't be of my making."
"Adam, I want you to make this marriage work."
"And if that sounds like an order, it is."
Steven.
I heard you were here.
I thought you might like these copies I had made.
What are they?
Papers on the pipeline deal.
Mother signed them a little while ago.
Thanks.
"What else brings you here, Adam?"
Frankly?
"Something's been bothering me, Steven."
"A lack in you, let's say."
What kind of a lack?
You've never congratulated me on my marriage to Claudia.
What's the matter?
Don't you approve?
It's not for me to approve or disapprove.
"Well, surely, you must have some opinions, Steven."
"I mean, you did abandon Claudia to run off with your boyfriend."
"His name was Luke, and he's dead."
And I don't want you to talk to me about him with anything but respect.
You understand?
Why don't you ask me to come to your place?
I'm asking myself the same.
I can assure you I'm not calling for nothing.
Then put me with the asylum's principal.
"Alright, with the housemother then."
Good evening.
I was trying to explain to the other Mrs. the matter of my call.
"But apparently, there's a strong discipline in not letting an adult lady, who's there by her own will, answer the phone."
I'm not trying to teach you anything.
But...
I don't see the necessity in imposing...
military rules to some peaceful old people.
The problem is this:
It turns out that Jacoba... left home leaving a note in which she wrote me where she was going.
Without any apparent reason.
Please note that I'm disconcerted.
Jacoba's been at home for more than 40 years.
I don't know.
I can't remember her last name.
Good morning.
Did you make all this by yourself?
Of course.
And where did you get the jam and the toasts?
Everything was in the house.
And the cups?
They're yours.
Where were they?
There.
They'd only be used for special occasions.
"Like today, for example."
"God, they're tasty."
Don't laugh.
The fact he's still alive argues against aortic injury.
"- Page me with the result, okay?"
"- Elizabeth, I think there's more to discuss."
"Kerry, I'm a trauma surgeon."
"The last time I checked, you weren't chief of staff."
Keep me apprised of his condition.
"- Okay, the last one."
- Can I go see him now?
No.
We have to make sure you didn't bruise your heart or damage your lungs.
- They' re not doing anything.
- Probably just waiting to go up to surgery.
I'm sure he's stable.
I told Mr. Chambers we were 10 minutes late.
It's a trick I use to get him to meetings on time.
- You don't call him by his first name?
- He's kind of formal.
How long have you been working for him?
Two years.
"Six days a week, 10 hours a day."
Probably spend more time with him than his wife does.
They' re really happy though.
"I mean, she's lucky to have him."
- He's a good man.
- Luka no fragments in the x-ray.
Ready to irrigate?
Yeah.
Put Polysporin on the wound.
Where'd you get that one?
A lowlife stuck me in the back with a switchblade.
An inch to the left and you would have lost a kidney.
Guy that did it to me got snuffed with a sawed-off.
And Norah doesn't despise Tris.
We spend a lot of time trying to define the relationship between the three girls.
"Because that idea of, like, ""frienemyship"" is hard."
"And so there's like a lot of debates, like, figuring out how mean they were to each other versus how friendly they were versus how passive-aggressive."
There was a lot to figure out.
And I...
Here we go.
Here it is.
- Here it is.
Here it is.
"- Michael, you stop doing that."
"Wait, watch for it."
There was no cut when we did this.
"- Okay, I'm gonna call my boyfriend."
- This is the gum.
- It looks fake.
- It looks fake.
- It looks like a skillful editing trick.
- Like someone passed me a new...
- No.
"- No, that's dirty gum."
- That is tainted gum.
- It's all spitty and...
- That is tainted gum.
- It's all spitty and...
"And, also, I should point out that I think Alexis and myself and Ari decided that we had all been friends since babyhood, basically."
- That's why we all tolerate each other.
- Right.
I figured that about me and Raf and Aaron too.
- We all grew up together.
- Stop trying to copy our ideas.
"No, it's the same with us."
"Besides, I need you."
You're the one who's going to tell me where Doug is.
Oh.
Here.
Your car is in the campground parking lot.
What are we gonna do to resolve our problem?
"Well, I think our problems are a little different, but, yes, let's resolve them."
"You know, you and I have a very special connection."
- I'm not even sure who I'm talking to.
"- Oh, we met... in a manner of speaking."
"Istanbul, about six years ago."
July.
Seven years ago.
You took out those two diplomats.
Yes.
You know how close you came to catching me?
That was impressive.
"And ever since then, I've kept tabs on you."
You might say I've become a fan.
"I heard you got burned, and I got this gig in Miami, so... the stars just kind of lined up."
I like the new look.
And your bruise- it healed.
Yeah.
"Well, that was temporary."
I've been studying up on you.
"It's not easy with someone as secretive as you are, but, uh... of course, things got a lot easier when you got burned."
- Not classified material anymore.
- Lucky you.
I learned something about your early years.
Your daddy was mean.
Mmm.
"So I figured an abusive husband and a troubled but gifted son- well, that would be motivating."
Our artists have been up all night making their costumes.
It's terribly exciting!
You're not acting in this piece?
I have no stomach for farce.
I am here to cue you.
"When I signal you like so, you must play something which suggests rain."
I expect this will be very amusing.
Yes.
Alfred and George have really outdone themselves this time.
"Do you know, I think they are still in love with each other."
(KNOCKING)
- Clap.
- Good evening.
I am God.
"I have grown disappointed in my master creation, the human race."
I endowed them with everything.
"The riches of the land, sea and air."
And enough intelligence to worship me.
But they have become arrogant and pampered.
I shall destroy them.
All except for one man and his family.
DUCHESS:
Ah!
This is my servant Noah and his wife Noette and their children.
Into their hands do I place the future of mankind.
"Oh, this heat!"
Will it never rain?
Here sits my stupid lout of a husband.
I don't know what God sees in him.
"Ah, who can express the despair of youth married to age?"
My husband is 600 years old while I am but 150!
A dove!
Didn't you say that the cops suspected Petty stole his mines from Presidio back in '60?
"Yeah, and they never found his stash."
Searched all the tunnels and cellars.
No luck.
Or maybe he hid them where he knew no one would look.
W-w-warm in here.
It's nice.
What's next?
Crumpets?
How's that?
Feel like a new man.
"Now that's how you treat someone you want something from, Warden."
"Glad you approve, son."
But I've heard about the mind games in here.
What have you heard?
I'm not taking these pills.
"They're not pills, Mr. Petty."
Those are mints.
I drugged your tea.
Just a mild sedative to help you relax.
An anesthetic.
You were only 18 when you joined the marines.
Is that right?
I'm not talking to you.
"You served for the fighting 15th, were part of the Chosin Reservoir battle, the bloodiest of the war."
14 silver stars were awarded to the veterans of the Chosin Reservoir battle.
But not you.
"Despite clearing several frozen minefields by yourself, under heavy fire, providing safe passage for our troops to advance."
"Hypocrites, the lot of 'em."
It's for your safety.
"Were you scared, Mr. Petty?"
"No, ma'am."
You also burglarized the secret service.
I'll spend a little time in prison.
You're not getting what is important here.
I'm not getting what's important.
And the fact that I changed my name--
"Which, by the way, I did so the soviets wouldn't find me,"
Not to hide from our government.
Important.
That--Mrs.
Frederic fixed all this.
She expunged all the charges.
Someone obviously unfixed it.
"- Artie, focus."
"- Oh, I'm focused."
Here's the key.
Who gave Dickinson my file?
"Find out, that'll take you directly to who has the sword."
And that will lead you to Macpherson.
Who?
Time's up.
"Some friendly advice, it's self-preservation time."
Put in for transfers while this whole warehouse business
Is still just a sidetrack in your careers.
Scars don't have to be permanent.
- Yeah.
No can do.
- Just think about it.
"Meantime, I have some self-preservation to do too."
"Now, I may not be your boss anymore,"
"But until someone tells me otherwise,"
I still outrank you.
So this time I am putting you on a plane
He wants to destroy the whole world.
Unalaq is gonna destroy the world?
He really does have a doomsday device?
"He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during harmonic convergence, which is only a few days away."
"If he succeeds, the world as we know it is over."
"Sir, we desperately need your help."
"I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no."
There are lives on the line!
And my daughter is one of them.
"Raiko, you must reconsider."
"I'm aware that lives are on the line, and that's precisely why my troops are staying here."
"If the world is going to be thrown into chaos, like you claim, I need to protect my citizens."
I'm sorry.
Sir...
Nuktuk needs your help.
I know you love helping people.
"Son, I appreciate you saving my life, and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final."
I never should have saved that guy.
"If you guys need help, I'm here for you."
"Yeah, me too."
Thank you.
It's so good to see you guys again.
"Wait, where's Mako?"
So how was the big premiere?
I saved the president!
In real life!
"Wait, what?"
You were right about Varrick.
He tried to kidnap Raiko!
I knew it.
"But it didn't work, because of you."
And because of me.
"Eric, we need an address on Julio Pena, and I need you to meet me there right now."
Thank you.
All clear.
All clear.
- H...
- Yeah.
You've got an X-ray machine.
This is a source of the radiation.
"Hazmat didn't register any, so where'd it go ?"
This cable's the pig tail.
Houses an iridium capsule at one end.
Iridium's the source of the radiation.
Capsule's been removed.
This is bigger than we thought Eric.
Why was Julio involved in this ?
Because someone was using him to finance the operation.
So Julio was caught in between the two worlds.
Whoever did this needed to get to him before we did.
Got a serial number.
We need to trace that number.
"Mr. Thomason, last year you purchased ten X-ray machines."
For welding seams.
I'm planning to start a construction company.
Then explain to me how one of them ended up in Julio Pena's workshop.
Don't know who that is.
Mr. Pena sells drugs in order to purchase the machines.
"Once in his possession, he dissembled them."
Dissembled them ?
- Why would anyone do that ?
- Excuse me.
Excuse me... !
This conversation is over.
We take it very seriously.
"Look, in our e-mail,"
My husband and I said a lot of things.
Really it's just a bunch of words.
"What words were you referring to... ""drunk"" or ""nazi""?"
"Name-calling aside, once these matters come to light,"
We are mandated to address them promptly and swiftly.
"Well, what's prompter than forgetting about it?"
"You know, I've already moved on."
This type of behavior will not be tolerated.
You have to be stopped.
I'm sorry.
You're looking at me.
She's sitting over there.
"We're looking at you, dear."
We are all looking at you.
Whoa.
Hold on a second.
This is starting to sound like it's about me.
Let's take a look at your file.
I have a file?
!
Mike!
"Uh, in her defense, she was very drunk."
"Besides harassing a teacher,"
"You've also been ""overreactive""..."
"""mildly threatening""..."
"""demanding special attention""..."
"Your ""intimidating behavior"
"Creates a hostile learning environment..."""
I am not the one who's hostile!
She's the one who's hostile!
- Not too far.
You've been saying that for miles.
- My feet are sore.
- When did you become older than me?
"Tell me what this new breakfast place is, and I'll be quiet."
It an amazing new mystery place I found.
That's all I'm telling you.
Is it in this town or the next?
- We don't patronize the next town.
- Since when?
Didn't they feed lead to our jumping frog or something?
Right after they stoned the woman who won the lottery.
"See, so the boycott's legit."
- Wait.
Stop.
"- Look, it's Michael Landon."
You guys walk fast.
I've been chasing you the past two blocks.
We were being followed.
I told you I wasn't being paranoid.
Now you'll believe me when I say the furniture moved itself.
- Where're you going?
- Mystery breakfast.
- Out of town?
- Remember the definition of mystery?
I was wondering if it's okay to practice on your pots and pans again.
It's not like they have any other use.
I've almost nailed Ramble On.
I have to stop hitting my face with the sticks when I pull back.
John Bonham had that same problem.
- Key is in the turtle.
- Enjoy your mystery breakfast.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
"Hi, Stuart."
"Hi, Sheldon."
Pardon me...
Excuse me...
"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
The thought of you sitting in a darkened theater with a character like Stuart is repellent.
"No offense, Stuart."
None taken.
"Although ""repellent"" is kind of a... kind of a strong word."
"I'm sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want."
"Um, again..."
"Stuart, please."
You're being rude.
Anything else?
I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
I'm listening.
"With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise,"
"I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as ""not my girlfriend."""
Interesting.
Now try it without the quadruple negative.
You're being impossible.
"Hi, Stuart."
Fine.
Amy... will you be my girlfriend?
Yes.
"Well, that's enough of that."
Sorry to interrupt.
Ok I already told Becca but since you asked... girls...
Jill you can just tell me later.
Stacy I'm so sorry...
I don't mean to spoil your special little moment.
But I have a huge announcement to make...
I'm getting married!
Isn't it gorgeous?
Do you love it?
It was the most amazing night you guys.
I don't want to just be your girlfriend anymore!
It's not that I don't...
love you...
"It's not fair, I can' take this limbo!"
I know...
You either marry me or you leave me!
It was the most romantic night of my life.
"What can I say, he's the best."
You've got to be kidding me!
"Drew, I'm sorry but he was hitting on me less than two months ago."
"Ok... he wasn't hitting on you, Hallie."
He was flirting with you.
"Guys are allowed to flirt, it's a human condition."
It's natural.
You think everyone is flirting with you.
I don't know I just think it's weird if a guy is ultra flirtatious... and in a committed relationship.
And not to mention that he's in the business.
Men in the entertainment industry are instinctively douche bags.
No?
No I like Drew.
I don't think he's a douche bag.
Well...
Who came up with the term douche bag anyway?
Give me your torch.
Snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something."
I must apologize for their treatment of you.
Yeah.
Whose idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
"At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils."
They're not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized."
It's beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
I'll bet you would.
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you,"
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
"When Lotus arrives,"
I'll ask Yan to let her sit on this chair.
Then Yan will get the tea by leaps and bounds.
Isn't it great?
That's great!
Am I smart?
"Master, how to kiss her?"
Take a seat.
"When she is all wet, what's next?"
She will be very ugly and she will scream!
"No, no!"
She will get changed!
"Master, how can she get changed in public?"
Look!
This door will lock up automatically when it's closed.
"At the same time, water will flush out from this hole."
"According to human beings' instinct, Lotus will..."
Stuff it with her finger.
"At the same time, another water-column comes from that side."
She will stuff with another finger.
But she can't imagine that... another water-column aims... at her face!
"Master, do you mean it?"
Lotus is so poor then.
She can't seek for any help!
She must be scared and doesn't know what to do.
"In order to stop the water, everyone knows she will... stuff the hole with her tongue."
"That's right, you stand in front of the changing room."
"When it's the right time, remove the hose, move forward and kiss."
So I can kiss her.
Smug calcultation!
"When you hear the bell ringing, go ahead and kiss her."
What's the use of kissing her?
I want to be married to you.
Gregory... you are married to me.
"Right... that's right, that's right, yeah, right."
What?
- I'm getting a little dizzy.
"- Oh, that's all right, it'll pass, just hold on to me."
"Rose, don't ever leave me again."
I'm not leaving you...
I love you.
"I couldn't stand being away from you, it was killing me."
"Ah, I'm so glad."
"I don't care if you ARE pretty, I love you anyway."
"Listen, everything's gonna drop as I get older, and I'm gaining weight as we SPEAK."
"Well, that's comforting."
"- Get in, Lady."
"- Oh, no, not you again!"
- You know this guy?
- He's a good man.
"I can't believe this, your windows are still broke?"
"Complain to the cab company, I got nothing to do with it."
You can see that F of X equals E to Y...
"Times E to the X, which is what we were trying to prove."
Notice the elegance of the proof.
It's beautiful!
"It actually reminds me of a quote by Socrates,"
"""If measure and symmetry are absent from any composition in any degree,"
"""the ruin awaits both the ingredients and the composition."
"""Measure and symmetry are beauty, and virtue the world over."""
He's cute.
Do you think he's straight?
"Oh, yeah, he's too boring to be gay."
- l don't want to hear of it!
And if a guest should leave me a tip for tidying up?
"No. I'll tell you something, you know what."
Yes.
You sometimes bring a tip from a wedding and you say:
"It was good, we got 150 crowns."
Don't pass judgment on me.
Don't compare yourself with me!
I'm just advising you.
But they may leave something there for me.
The main is for you to learn German.
"But if they leave money for me, what should I do?"
Don't complicate things again!
I'm afraid Mi?
ka might be naive.
She'll be easily taken in.
"I certainly don't want it to be like in that song, when he was tired of flying from one flower to another... I insist that when Mi?"
"ka one day falls in love, she should stay with him."
So she isn't a flighty little flower.
"Wait a minute, don't shut it!"
"Come on, quick!"
Our daughter's going to Austria and you shut the gates in front of us.
I keep saying they ought to make a footbridge here.
I know it's not your fault.
We're late because of you.
So many different hats and we miss the train.
But that's not our train!
"That's not our train, is it?"
"It's not, but we should already be there."
Come on!
Quick!
Quick!
I just figured it all out.
It's just like you said.
I'm your insurance policy.
What are you talking about?
"Well, as long as I'm your hostage, they can't get to you."
"You can demand a ransom from my father... we'll take the money, we'll escape to Mexico just like you said."
"Hey, hey, hey."
"Hold on a minute here, Patty Hearst."
- What?
"- On second thought, maybe Mexico ain't such a hot idea."
We'll have to wait in line at the border while they check the trunk for illegal fruit.
"- I mean, come on."
"- No, I'm completely serious."
They'll never be able to get us.
I'm your hostage.
There's no way they could possibly think we're in this together.
It's getting close.
It's getting real close.
"Subject vehicle, red BMW... now approaching with suspect and hostage."
- All officers take your positions.
- Move!
Come on!
Come on!
Prepare to engage suspect.
All emergency services remain in position.
"Fire, be ready with foam."
"Paramedics, stand by."
- This could actually work.
"- Yes, it's gonna work."
It's gonna work.
- All right.
- I know this beautiful spot in Cabo San Lucas... where the beaches are gorgeous.
Now let's go get some ice cream.
Well...
Just in a minute.
"Hey, Street, here comes your best friend."
"Oh, that's funny."
Somebody's got to talk to him.
"Low man on the totem pole, that would be you."
Hi there.
Interested in a Malibu.
"Afternoon, Gerald."
"Oh, hey."
How you doing today?
All right.
Just came to have a second look.
Yeah.
"Can I ask you something, Gerald?"
Yeah.
What's the problem exactly?
Sorry?
Why won't you let yourself have this car?
What do you mean?
What is it really?
Is it that you think if you buy this car you're gonna find another car you like better elsewhere immediately after buying it?
Or is it that you just think you don't deserve the car?
"Man, you don't know me."
"No, Gerald."
"Please, I'm not insulting you, so please don't take it like that, okay?"
I'm just trying to understand you.
"Because all these salespeople around here, take a look at them."
They sent me over here because they've given up on you.
All right?
"They sent me, wheelchair guy, rookie, low man on the totem pole to talk to you because none of them believe that you can pull the trigger on actually purchasing a vehicle."
So what are you after?
Reaching for the moon?
Nope.
Just one little star.
On a dressing room door.
"Want to be a playactress, huh?"
"Oh, i am one."
I barnstormed through the midwest for two seasons.
This is the only job i could get in new york.
But i don't care - at least i'm in a theater.
"Before i get through, i'm going to be a great actress."
That's the way to say it.
"Think big, talk big, and you'll be big."
"Say, you're a good looker."
Got the spirit of a thoroughbred.
All you need is a little sprucing up.
"Here, get into this."
You and me are going to paint the town.
"I've got some acting for you to do, and you'll put that fleurique in the shade."
But these are her clothes.
That's stealing.
Only little people steal.
Big people call it borrowing.
But-but what will mademoiselle say?
I can't wear her clothes.
You certainly can't wear that hired gal's rig where we're going.
Where are we going?
To the astor house.
You've got a sight of gall.
And i'm daring you to show some.
"She threw things at you, didn't she?"
"Listen, when you're scratching for corn and another chicken comes along and shoves you out of the way, get right back into that circle and make the feathers fly."
Where are you going?
- Carlos:
Out.
- But--
"Carlos, wait!"
What's up with you?
"I'll catch you tomorrow, all right?"
If you told me a month ago
"I'd be running my pop's bodega, I'd say you were smoking crack."
If you had told me when we were in high school that I'd be the super of our building...
I'd told you that you were having some kind of psychotic episode.
"That shit is not even funny, man."
And you know what the thing of it is?
- What?
- I'm a pretty good super.
"Don't take this the wrong way, but it ain't that hard, man."
"It can be hard, you dumb fuck!"
"You've got to have all sorts of different management skills, you've got to know how to deal with all sorts of different people, you got to know your accounting, and I recycle."
Don't forget:
"""Always recycle."""
"""Blue goes with cans."
"Green goes with paper."""
Don't mix it with the fucking plastic.
Don't forget.
"- Oh, shit!"
- My ball!
- Carlos:
Come here.
"- Oh, thank you."
Carlos:
"Oh, you stupid fucker!"
"On weekends, me and Daisy got this thing, where she calls me-- to fix stuff in her apartment, and I go up, and we have sex."
"Well, don't use our own troops."
We've got some adapted Helots under training.
"Yes, I've seen them."
- What do you think of them?
- They seem like all Helots after adaptation.
"Suggestible, obedient and glad to follow orders."
They should make excellent troops.
I don't know.
"Something missing, I think."
"- Fire in the belly, Quute."
You can't fight without it.
"- No, of course not, sir."
- I'm meeting the President-elect later on.
"- Yes, I'd heard he'd arrived."
"- He's a Helot, they say."
- Practor?
"Oh, yes, born and bred."
It's a good idea getting one of their own to run the place.
"- Is he adapted, sir?"
"- It's not necessary,"
Practor's been on the Federation civil list for years.
He knows all the ropes.
So it shouldn't take too long to hand over.
Then we can get on to Wanta.
- Wanta?
- That's our next assignment.
"- Something to look forward to, eh?"
"- Yes, sir, I'm looking forward to that no end."
"Where exactly is Wanta, sir?"
- How long till we make planetfall?
- Just over two hours.
You'd better check out which gun kits you want.
Maybe the phone call hadn't worked.
But it had.
All I had to do was wait.
He was right on schedule.
"I was thinking, ""Go ahead."
"Beat it to your big beach home. """
This is the same gag you pulled on me.
It's even the same corpse.
Only thing missing is a sledgehammer highball and a pair of snake-eyes dice.
There was one joker.
What if he'd left a goon to watch his office?
"Here I was again, back to the scene of the TNT highball with the pretty girl camouflaging the safe."
Martinelli left in a hurry.
He hadn't turned the radio off.
"Not that I don't like music, but I work better in silence."
"I'm crazy about you, sweetheart, but move over."
"She moved over, Father."
The safe was wide open.
Martinelli really had hauled freight in a hurry.
"After my trouble to get Martinelli out, this would be dandy."
"I kept thinking, ""lt had to be here somewhere. """
"Up to now, everything had gone like grief."
He had the letter.
He'd been working on it.
But he hadn't gotten very far with his homework.
He was doing research on that letter but good.
The Leising Book of Codes.
Here was the real merchandise.
I recognized Johnny's writing.
Martinelli!
Martinelli!
"Then, suddenly, I got a whiff of jasmine."
"Lex, if you open that box, if you get hold of that secret, there will be no redemption for you."
No redemption.
Ever.
I was raised in your shadow.
Now you're gonna die in mine.
No one will even remember your name.
Smallville 716
Synchro :
Flolo
"i'm sorry, clark."
I traveled halfway around the world via satellite.
There's no trace of kara and brainiac.
I can't let lana sit in that asylum in pain.
The only way to help her is to find brainiac.
I've tapped every radar screen known to mankind.
"I mean, there's no bogey or blip unaccounted for."
It's like they just flew off the map.
What about brainiac's power sources?
Check the electrical grid for any power surges again.
"Stay focused, chloe."
Busy night out there.
What's going on?
Someone at luthorcorp just jumped out their office window.
Rumor has it it was lionel luthor.
Let's go.
I just talked to him.
You said you were working down the hall from your father tonight?
I heard him yell.
Then he was gone.
"I know how difficult this must be for you, Mr. Luthor, but I need a positive identification."
Whenever you're ready.
Yeah.
He was crying.
"Very, very upset."
He wanted to go home.
To his mommy.
And I wanted to send him home.
But I knew I couldn't.
Then I told him I would take him.
"I put him in my car, started driving."
He kind of cheered up.
But of course I wasn't taking him home.
I was taking him... somewhere else.
- You're lying.
- Am I?
"Who else is lying about that day, Mark?"
Are you?
Are your friends?
Jesse was crying when I found him.
"Who made him cry, huh?"
The DNA tie-in with the missing kid is potentially huge.
For now this cannot get out.
We dig away until we know exactly what we are dealing with.
Don't want journalists banging on my door.
Danny.
The murder victim is yet to be ID-ed.
But we are tracing her mobile as it's possible the killer might have taken it with him.
Next.
"Now given the reputation of the murder location and the manner of her dress, we're working on the possibility that she was accepting payment for sex."
"So it could be a disgruntled client, partner of someone."
Or drug-related.
Every hooker I've encountered has been an addict.
We all know how many hookers Mickey's encountered.
"Yeah, it's very funny."
Of all the fucking people.
She gave up everybody.
"Jimmy, me."
Even her brother.
It took the jury six hours to bring us in guilty.
"Judge gave Jimmy and me ten years, like he was giving away candy."
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.
You will now be turned over to the U.S. Attorney Generals office.
"Toast, guys."
"Good trip, good life."
Get out soon.
"Good trip, sweetheart."
We'll watch the home front.
"Say hello to those blow-job hacks, huh?"
Motherfuck them every chance you get.
"I'll call you, uh, when I get a chance."
Now take me to jail.
"In prison, dinner was always a big thing."
"We had a pasta course, then we had a meat or a fish."
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt and he had a wonderful system for doing the garlic.
He used a razor and sliced it so thin it would liquefy in the pan with just a little oil.
It was a very good system.
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.
Get that smell?
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:
"veal, beef, and pork."
You got to have pork.
That's the flavor.
"I felt he used too many onions, but it was still a very good sauce."
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.
"I didn't put too much onions in, Paul."
***
"Something with, uh, a lot of saturated fats in, please."
And yes to any questions about making it larger.
Alright?
Eating off the bonnet of your car.
Yeah.
"Cause you don't want the smell to get in the fabrics, do you?"
"Yeah, that's why I'm doing it."
Nothing to do with not wanting my family to know anything.
"Well, I can't take it back to the surgery cause Mary doesn't allow it."
"But you're the boss, right?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
So you allow Mary not to allow it.
It's policy.
Mary is very good with policy.
"We all dream of a world where you can eat burgers at work, and wear aftershave on days when it isn't your birthday."
"But work's never going to be like that, is it?"
"Yes, very used to dealing with large purchasing budgets."
And what do you think you can bring to the surgery personally?
If anything at all.
"Well I've had a look around, and it works."
It's fine.
Yes?
But no offense...
What do you mean?
"I mean first off the waiting room,"
I mean would it kill us to get a couple of plasmas in there?
I hardly think a doctor's waiting room...
"I'm sorry, I'm talking to the doctor."
No.
"No, it wouldn't kill us."
Filming real families has put me back.
"Let's tell the truth, here was the story."
But my position became more and more uncertain.
So I devised a plan to stay afloat.
"Carlos, let's get him out of here."
He heard what he said.
- I know how to get from A to B.
Do you mean B of Belgium?
- What about B of Bulgaria?
Thing?
- See those lovely ladies?
The legendary Sirens of the Sea of Mero.
Folk singers.
"Their concert was canceled,"
And tomorrow they will depart for Bulgaria by coach.
The protocol will never approve it.
"- Look, here's the plan."
I ride a music video for them and they let us get out of here.
Secretly.
Forget it.
Do not you want to bring the king home?
- Sure.
Maybe we should talk to her boss.
Sire.
- I can not concentrate.
You are welcome.
The coincidence between universes and the kingdom...
The dysfunction of nature and man...
"The desire for independence characterizes every epoch, right?"
"It gave birth to our kingdom in 1830, and now it will probably collapse."
But what is the real nature of this independence?
This so-called freedom?
What's going on here?
Tracing back our history... too.
I think Noah has another function besides controlling the atmosphere.
that no one would believe such a fact.
That just maybe the countless dinosaurs and other strange animals in stasis outside in the ark were probably used in experiments for creating the life forms that would carry on the next generation.
What are these things?
Noah's other function is that of a life-creating device.
Professor?
Isn't it incredible?
"The history of the human race was created within this ""Noah's ark!"
let us build a new world with our hands.
Worthless.
That is your wish.
Mankind has progressed in the wrong way.
Man is the only defective work that God created.
Are you trying to put Man on trial in place of God?
We must do it now.
I want the two of you to create new life forms for the next generation using Noah.
Professor.
Come let's do it.
No.
Damn!
Where the hell are the Doc and the others?
What did you just say?
I said no.
You're insane.
I see.
Then it can't be helped.
What are you going to do?
Get a fire extinguisher..!
Quickly!
Run!
"Oh, doctor!"
Doctor.
Good to see you.
How is our Gyung Joon?
Ah yes...
I see...
That he hasn't regained his consciousness yet.
"They say his body is all fine, so why isn't he waking up?"
"You don't think he's going to stay in that state like that, right?"
They say there's nothing wrong...
So I'm sure he'll wake up.
They say that people can stay in a state like that for several years.
Then what do we do about him?
Do we have to keep on taking care of him?
Doctor...
"That won't happen, right?"
"If by any chance, that happens, what are you going to do?"
Doctor.
We don't have the relationship where we have to take responsibility for him.
We're just relatives who have been left in charge for the time being.
The hospital shouldn't be asking us what should be done with him in the future.
-Honey!
-What?
Doctor...
"Then, goodbye."
"Ugh, this boy..."
Isn't there somewhere in America where we can send him off to just in case?
Who would take care of him?
"Since he grew up there, there has to be someone he was close to!"
It's because there was no such person that he came to Korea!
What should we do with his belongings?
-Gyung Joon...
"Just take your time, and while you're at it, you might want to tighten your socks, because they're about to get knocked off."
Why did you tell him that we have a great idea?
"Honey, what do you think, one's just gonna walk in the front door?"
"And now, thanks to you,"
I have to wear this stupid eye patch.
It's not my fault.
Face it.
"You liked me when I was mousy, and now that that's changed, you can't handle it."
Nonsense!
All I've ever been is a protective big sister.
"Then how come when you had an eyebrow-waxing business, you never got rid of my unibrow?"
Why would you want me to?
So you could be sexy for God?
That's sick.
So tell me the idea.
"It's a story about two sisters,"
Joy and Jill.
One was mousy her whole life because she was a mouse.
Ah!
"They're both mice, and the other mouse was always the beautiful one."
"Right, but then, they switched."
Sounds interesting.
"You know, mice do well in focus groups."
Melanie and I are artists.
We don't cater to focus groups.
And how does your story end?
"Well, what kind of endings do focus groups like?"
The kind that are in my hand by Monday.
Then you will have it by Sunday.
What is wrong with you?
I'm ready.
How do I look?
It was my fault.
- What you sorry about?
I am not.
Then let's just say that we were foolish and next time we'll drink to one another's health.
I suppose it was all in fun when you kissed me.
Yes.
It wasn't all in fun then.
I know that.
"Well, goodbye and good luck."
"Come on, John."
Don't be stuffy.
"After all, the lady wasn't injured, nor was anyone else."
I imagine she might be a tempting morsel in an off moment.
"- What do you mean, ""off moment""?"
"- Yours, according to your theory."
"I imagine what I just witnessed was the momentary triumph of the evil in your soul over the good, huh?"
Correct?
"Yes, yes."
"I don't think it was a triumph, but it was an attack."
"But one which would have been repulsed even without your help, John."
Wouldn't you run less risk if you confined your experiments to the lab?
That's where you'll find me from tonight on until I get what I'm looking for.
"I'm worried, John."
- He ought to have let us know.
- He'll be along.
"Maybe it's all for the best, Dr. Jekyll."
That wasn't my son in there.
It was as if the evil one had crept into his heart.
My poor Sam.
"- Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home."
"- Yes, sir."
- I'll walk.
"- We're all gonna die, Elliot."
The only question is when and how?
What?
You pulled Bianco's LUDs?
Swell.
- Fin?
- Yeah.
Amy Solwey's been calling Bianco.
Everyone who needs a kidney knows about Russ Bianco.
What's the big deal?
"Well, you called him a couple dozen times over the last two months."
You're at the top of the NTCC list.
What do you need a guy like that for?
Insurance.
In case my next transplant doesn't work.
Really?
What is Bianco paying you to find buyers for his hot kidneys?
I do it for nothing.
"Going to jail for assisted suicide didn't teach you a damn thing, did it?"
Sure it did.
Now I help people live instead of die.
"Amy, you're still breaking the law."
Arrest me.
"We don't want you, we want the surgeon who's performing the transplants."
He's saving lives.
"Give us his name, or you're going back to jail."
No jail's worse than living in the prison of a sick body.
You'll be living in both when they take your name off that transplant list.
That would never happen.
"When the NTCC finds out that you've been trafficking in black market kidneys, they're gonna cross you right off the list."
You'd let me die?
Give us the surgeon's name.
Right.
We were sort of dating on and off then I found out that he got this super model pregnant.
I didn't even want to come out tonight and I ran into them.
"And I just, I don't know I just can't hit the Hollywood scene anymore."
It's just... not for me.
Wow I didn't even know you were dating anyone.
I thought you were...
I thought you were single.
Well slightly single.
I mean it was never anything fully committed.
Well breakups are always pretty tough.
I just don't get this town?
"Everyone is always on the search for the bigger, better deal."
It's just...
Yeah but you know it's all about hype right?
"I mean at the end of the day that's all it is, is hype."
Well yeah but it's different when you're famous.
You're part of the something better that people are searching for.
I am the exact same person that I've always been.
I'm not in this business for the hype.
Hey ZACH!
Come here.
Am I going to be on the cover of a tabloid as your newest squeeze?
I think I can handle that.
I'm so sorry.
It's Ok I like a good head butt...
that was...
"I was, meant to kiss your cheek and..."
I am such an idiot.
He was clearly going for the lips.
OK well have a good night.
Thanks bye.
You think I killed that boy?
That question will never come up between us.
Why not?
It's going to come up in court.
When do I go to trial?
They're bringing in a judge and swearing in a jury right now.
I'd like to set up a time we could get together... and maybe make a preparation or two.
What for?
What are we going to talk about... if we don't talk about whether I killed that kid or not?
"Mr. Burke, I'd like to talk to Tom alone for a minute."
You ever see so many bars in your life?
I guess that's why they call it a jail.
"- I've been free all my life, John."
- I know that.
"Look, it's damn important you don't try to break out of here."
"I know you can do it, but it's just admitting your guilt if you try."
"Christ, I can see those hills over there, but I can't touch them."
Cowboys.
Schoolteachers.
You sure are good company.
"Yes, but do you care for me?"
That horse over there... is the only thing I've owned for a long time.
He thinks the whole world of me... and I've never even given him a name.
Was he good company?
Yeah.
- Do you care for him?
"- Yes, I do."
"Tom, you're an idiot."
"Yeah, I know."
- What happened to your tooth there?
- Chipped it.
How'd you do that?
I've got to find some way to make money.
Why doesn't he just retire and let me run the business?
There's not a chance of that.
The business is his whole life and he's still in his prime.
Except for his absent-mindedness about appointments.
"You know,"
I think you've got something.
What do you mean?
The old boy is losing his grip.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
"When you can't remember business matters, it's time to retire."
John's got a memory like a file cabinet.
He never forgot anything in his life.
"Ellen thinks he forgot about my appointment, doesn't she?"
You know very well you never had an appointment.
I know it.
But does John?
Don't you get it?
He prides himself on his memory.
"If we can convince him that he is getting forgetful, then we'll be able to..."
"Oh, no!"
He'd be a nervous wreck in no time.
"Oh, what a horrible thought."
It was only an idea.
I think it's a wonderful horrible idea.
Something I can do?
Something you should've done three weeks ago.
Why haven't the contracts been sent to the Craddock people?
Just waiting for you to sign them.
What are you talking about?
I signed them a month ago.
"I'm sorry, John."
It says Robert Quinn?
"Until there is signed consent from Robert Quinn, the adoption of Callie Jacob is denied."
Told you I was gonna hit you where it hurt.
Your bones are shattered in several places.
- He's gonna need surgery.
- He's a pianist.
Our concern right now is making sure he can still use it at all.
- What are you doing up?
- Can't sleep.
You?
I remember when you used to crawl into bed with me when that happened.
"Yeah, I thought I'd, uh, spare you tonight."
Hm.
"Then you'd end up sprawled out sideways, your feet next to my head, kicking me in the face all night long."
"See, I remember it as you headbutting my feet, actually."
Really?
Then Mama would viciously attack your elbows with her ribs?
Really?
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Sounds terrible.
Eh... it was pretty nice.
Back when that was all it took to make you feel safe.
- How's it feel?
- About the same.
Still numb?
"What if I, um  can't ever play again  like I used to?"
"Honey, don't think like that."
"You can't think like that, ok?"
"You just have to keep trying, keep at it, you know?"
"Don't you ever give up on your dream, you hear me?"
- We don't have any oranges?
"Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal."
- Good.
"- No, that's not good."
That's terrible.
"Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks."
You let him take his chances on the outside.
Maybe I can work in some witness protection.
"No, look, look."
"These are vicious, desperate people."
I've been told that one of them killed another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
People love to take credit for the fun ones.
The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
"His wife killed him, all right?"
It was open and shut.
"Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?"
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary all's right with the world."
Ten thousand dollars.
"Ten thousand, cash to you."
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
"What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?"
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"Yeah. ""Morally outraged, "" he said."
Threatened to call the police.
"- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?"
- Like the Exxon Valdez.
"So, what do we do about it?"
"Hey, Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
You have beautiful legs.
Thank you.
"I'm a bit too tall, aren't I?"
"No, you're perfect."
You look great.
"No, I'm too tall."
I wish I could cut them short.
"Come on, don't do that."
"Director Kim, guess you got to work on your script now."
I guess so.
What is it about this time?
I only have the title.
"""About Miracles."""
Does it sound too scholarly?
"""About Miracles,"" I see."
"- ""About Miracles."""
- Miracle?
What kind of miracle?
A man travels to a foreign beach and stays at a hotel.
And in his room he plays Mozart on his CD player.
Then he leaves his room and hears the same music on the lift.
"He walks out of the hotel, then takes a turn at the corner, and on the street is a clown."
He's doing his mime to the exact same music.
It's an incredible coincidence.
But this man doesn't think it's a mere coincidence.
He wonders why he heard the same music three times.
"And he concludes that if he can find the reason why this happened, he can unravel a secret to the world."
And he's obsessed with that thought.
So he starts tracking hints.
For ten years.
"First, he begins with info about the clown, the women he met, his preferences, everything."
Down to the speaker's brand in the hotel elevator.
Of course.
My wife is a savage woman
- I know this region like the back of my hand
- It's this bone right here
It hurts so much when you press it
Right here?
Ah!
Easy!
Here!
Have a drink!
No more wine for us please.
We can't afford it
It's alright
This one's on me
You're indeed a beautiful serpent
Every day I carry those damn logs without getting paid properly
Now I'm so broke that even my hounds look down on me
We're losing our hunting grounds and you still keep the hounds to look down on you?
Look!
Those are the trees that used to watch over our ancestors
This is how they end up
"Strange thing is, why so many constructions?"
What?
Not only do you befriend us with wine but you speak our language fluently
Hey!
It's going to rain
- Stop drinking and go home!
"- Good morning, sir!"
"Good morning, Mr. Policeman"
You've worked all day long for such a mean wage and you waste it on wine?
What else can we do with so little money?
"Yeah, right!"
I'm not.
You're perfectly justified to hate him.
I'm saying he's really gone back for me.
He's always been a good friend to me.
That's funny 'cause I thought I was your friend.
"Look, our friendship has always been outside the Greek system."
"You always said, you're not gonna let our houses get in the way of us being friends."
So let's not lose that.
I see you later.
Hey heavy Poo!
You're here to give the dean his morning foot massage.
"You know, I don't think I've ever seen you in the sunlight before noon."
You're getting troubles with the law again?
100 hours of community service.
I consider myself lucky though.
"Could have been a lot worst, I was the only one who got busted."
"And by the way, you're a total dushbag."
Why's that?
Because you raided out our party.
I knew it was someone on the Greek task force
You're the only one I know with personal vendetta.
"Still, pretty low."
even for you.
Now you'll think twice before trying to pouch one of your pledges.
He came to us.
I don't know why I'm bothering explaining myself to you.
Take care.
Bing.
- What did you call me?
- You heard.
"Just to let you know, there will be retribution."
Bring it.
"All right, people, let's learn something."
"Carter, how do you check for spinal cord injury on an unconscious patient?"
- Look for absence of tendon reflexes.
- Do it.
Poor little thing.
"- Harper, what film do we want first?"
- Chest?
I'll do a cross-table lateral to rule out a C-spine fracture.
Deep tendon reflexes are present bilaterally.
Babinski is normal.
"Harper, let's talk head trauma."
What study should we do?
"- Come on, Harper."
Pay attention.
"- Pressure's falling, 50/30."
What do you hear?
Diminished breath sounds on the right?
I appreciate air movement bilaterally.
No pneumo.
"- No, that's upper airway sounds."
- I see a tracheal shift to the left.
- So do I.
- Tension pneumo.
Good call.
I'll teach you how to do a needle decompression.
"Carter, run the blood up to the lab."
Our new Urgent Care Facility could use someone like you.
- Urgent Care's a smart move.
- Most emergencies are run-of-the-mill stuff.
"Sprained ankles, croup, concussions...."
You'll spend most of your time on ear infections and well-baby checkups.
Private practice is changing.
It's the flies and beetles that feast upon us.
"I'm more interested in why someone did this, Doctor."
"Then I'll have to research the predatory, manipulative, grandiose nature of this behavior."
But my first impression is that we're dealing with a complete loon.
"That Masters in psych is starting to pay off, Ducky."
Merciful God in Heaven.
"I have seen a lot of things selling real estate, but can you imagine walking in, seeing that?"
When was the last time you were here?
Yesterday morning.
First showing.
And everything was normal?
"There was no rotting corpsein the living room, if that's what you mean."
Who else had access?
A couple of dozen real estate women.
The keys are in a lock box on the front door.
Who's the owner?
A local contractor and me.
"Uh, I buy and Bob fixes."
We split the profits.
Bob?
"Robert Whitehead, the contractor."
A number where he can be reached?
Yeah.
"So who put the body here, you or Bob?"
Neither of us.
Though it is an empty house.
"If you're looking to ditch a body, that's a real plus."
Jody.
I came as fast as I could.
You okay?
That's my husband I called him.
"Just  duck under the tape, Rick."
- That's always a good sign.
It had to be them.
I know where they are.
"I'll get back to you, Frank."
"Here, show me on the map."
I figured I must have been around here.
But I couldn't understand what Edgar was doing there.
"Then I realised, if he was fighting the weather, and wound up somewhere east of the mountains, about here, he'd have a straight shot over the mountains into Pasco."
He must have took the chance that he had enough gas.
You always take chances like that?
"If not, the mail wouldn't get through."
- This is Capital Peak.
- They must be on this ridge.
"About halfway down the big saddle, there's a clearing in the timber."
What I saw must have been wings.
Get the mail out by train.
He'll take out number eight.
Go as quickly as you can.
You'll have company.
I'm sending everyone up as soon as they refuel.
- He comes through after all.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe our luck is changing.
Jim.
- We could get married.
- What makes you say that?
I cancelled the letters out in our names.
You ever do that?
"You write some boy's last name and then yours underneath, and you cross out the letters that are the same."
"If there are a lot of crosses, you can get married."
A lot of ours do.
"Dad, have you ever asked me what I really wanted to do?"
How dare you talk to my dad like that?
Get up and go to your room.
You are acting as if these people want the worst for you.
Did you see that?
I have just said one word and he has spoiled my dinner.
I'm ashamed of you.
You're vile!
I didn't do anything to make anyone feel ashamed.
"All animals are lions, in fact... all people are animals, isn't that right, sir?"
"Yes, it is."
"Then, if all living things that are lions are animals... animals that are living are lions."
"Then, if p is to q or q is to r..."
All lions are animals.
All tigers are lions.
The bottom line is that all living...
What's important is to be human.
Be a man!
This is what you should always try to learn.
"Dear children, live life as a way of documentary."
How much time do we have till the break?
Damn it!
Kaan.
Come here.
He's going to give the questions again.
You take this and go to the stationery across the street.
How many copies do you need?
Make 40 copies of it.
Tell them to charge it to Professor Rahmi.
I bet that he won't even open it to check the questions.
What do you mean?
The teacher gives him questions and he never looks at them?
Which I don't really have.
"So, what I'm trying to say is that I really, really need this scholarship."
Did you rehearse that?
Yeah.
"Like, 14 times in front of the mirror."
"Unfortunately, desire doesn't figure into this much."
The Robinson is going to go to someone who dazzles.
Somebody who just jumps off the page.
"Oh, well, then, I'm also involved in a science competition."
We're building a robotic wheel that can navigate itself using a proprietary GPS system.
"Well, I'm designing the system."
So...
Right.
"Ben, last year, the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook, a Korean immigrant who has only one leg."
"Well, I have both my legs."
"Well, have you considered cutting one of them off?"
That was a joke.
"Ben, it's all about the essay."
You need to really explain to us what makes you special.
What life experience separates you from all the rest.
Life experience.
"What can you tell me, Ben, that's going to dazzle me?"
I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Where is your jacket?
"- Oh, I got it."
I got it.
It's right here.
This is no way for the new assistant manager to come to work.
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?
Eight dollars?
Wow!
And nocturnal.
And fly.
"Okay, I think we're getting into bat territory again, and I want to steer us away from that."
Like a bat.
"Bats are everywhere, so."
They're really not.
Let's stay on track.
We're just gonna talk about fears about the baby.
What about baby-- baby bats?
"We're not gonna go down the bat thing again this class, okay?"
"Well, as long as it's black, though."
"We're both black, so it's gonna be black."
- A black baby.
- It's gonna be black.
How many of you have even seen a bat?
In real life?
"Okay, there we go."
You can't really get away from bats.
"Let's just keep it on the discussion that we had going, which is: what your worries are about the baby."
"Uh, we're Jewish, but we were afraid that our baby's going to be, like, too Jewish?"
Yeah.
"Like, two sets of dishes Jewish."
"And mark my words, no child of mine is gonna (bleep) through a sheet, okay?"
- Uh...
- My biggest fear... is that our baby will want to participate in SantaCon.
That's where they dress up like Santa?
I-
- I won that.
A couple years ago.
"I have to say yes, fear of a shit baby in this day and age, it's a-- it's a valid concern."
Okay.
"Well, if we're really sharing things,"
Barry:
I don't understand that.
Why me?
"You know, I'm so small compared to what these other people are doing."
"You know, it just doesn't make sense to me."
Morris:
"Caught between the machetes of law enforcement and the bank accounts of businessmen, the small-time growers are going to have to fight to survive."
I had such a dream of being able to grow legally my whole life.
"We're kind of hanging on by our fingertips, but we're gonna fight."
We're gonna fight for our place all the way to the end.
Morris:
Will you do it again?
I doubt it.
I doubt it.
"It's just, you know, why bother?"
Previously on X Company...
I have a proposition.
It's an informal prisoner exchange.
"It's your son Klaus, he's in a Russian POW camp."
I can have him transferred to a Canadian POW camp.
I need a man transferred out of the Gestapo HQ in Paris.
"Go, go, go!"
_
_
- Do you remember the deal we made?
- Short and sweet.
No strings.
"- Anyway, I don't mean to..."
- No.
It was nice.
"In three weeks, the Allies are mounting an operation on the coast of France."
I didn't really get a good look at them.
"Don't you lie to me, Charles."
We're gonna pull out of here and forget we even saw them.
"Betty, do you know how much I like you?"
"I remember, faintly."
"I found out you can't always do or say what you want to that is, unless your father lets you."
Rodney are you going through all your life only doing what your father lets you do?
"Only having the friends that he picks out for you wearing what he tells you to wear, thinking his thoughts?"
"Betty, I'm old enough, but he's a tough man to handle."
- You've got to do it someday.
"- Yeah, but how?"
I have a selfish idea.
It has to do with you and me.
It's...
It's called marriage.
Wouldn't that just bowl him over?
I'm sure it would.
And me too.
But don't think of doing it just to bowl him over.
You're the only girl I've ever wanted.
Rodney... .
"Rodney, not that way."
What good is life if I know I didn't have the guts to live it my way?
Rodney.
I've really loved you for such a long time.
It must take a lot of patience to make something so beautiful.
That's what they tell me.
- All gone.
- Thank you.
Naked as the day they were born.
Not a stitch on them.
Saw them with my own eyes.
"Mystic Falls is our home, Damon."
They took that from us.
"Our land, our home."
It's time we rebuild.
"What, are you crazy?"
That was 1864.
"Wake up, woman."
The world has moved on.
"As a reward, I'm willing to give you what you want most."
- I want nothing...
- Katherine.
You wouldn't even know where she was.
You've been underground a century and a half.
Katherine and I were best friends long before we came to Mystic Falls.
"I know how she thinks, I know her patterns, I know where to find her."
I no longer have any desire to see Katherine ever again.
There's no way I'm gonna play the role of your little minion.
"I'm not asking for your help, Damon."
Finding Katherine was just a mere gesture of kindness.
The rest is nonnegotiable.
"I have 400 years on you, little boy."
"I'll rip you from limb to limb without even blinking, and you know it."
I'll be in touch.
You got me flowers.
"Well, I figured it's a date, why not do it right?"
"I would have driven too, but you're the one with the car."
"You know, you'd think that for someone who was around when the car was invented, that you'd have one."
"Oh, I have one."
I just never drive it.
"You know, it's not too late to cancel."
Why would we do that?
I don't know.
"On the first day of each month, we always did that."
"I've come this far, at least give me some porridge."
You really don't know the etiquette?
Where did your mother go?
"All right, I will find food to eat by myself."
I'm very hungry.
Is there ramen?
What are you doing?
Why are you looking through others belongings?
It's here.
Do you want to eat as well?
Shall I cook for two?
Looks delicious.
This kimchi is like art work!
Don't spill it.
That way the tablecloth must be replaced.
You should have thrown it away earlier.
It's already become like this.
Just buy a new one.
This tablecloth is the only one in the world.
My mother sewed the table cloth to fit the table my father made.
Then ask her to sew another one.
Is collecting red stickers your hobby?
"Here, there, almost everywhere."
Why did you tear it down?
"That... you really don't know, so that's why you ask me?"
"If I knew, why would I ask you?"
You should also know that my dad... has been in the hospital for ten years.
"My mom was there as well, and died because of the accident."
The bank said they would take household appliances.
That's why they stuck it there.
But now I have a job to pay off the debt.
'
I'm telling my advisor all this and I look in her trash can... and there's this half-eaten banana in there.
Nothing else.
"I pictured her sitting in this shoebox of an office, eating a banana by herself... and I almost felt sorry for her."
"Then she questioned my judgment about Berkeley, so I eviscerated her."
"She was welling up at the end, but she held it in until I was gone."
I have enough faculty recommendations to run for Student Council... so I don't need her anyway.
My locker's this way.
- Are they closed?
- They're closed.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
"Okay, one second, and open."
You made me a tassel-hat cake.
Filled with two pounds of crushed chocolate-covered espresso beans.
- You're evil.
- And you're graduating.
"- Yes, I am, aren't I?"
- Here.
I brought the pictures you wanted to see of my high school graduation.
"Hand them over, lady."
"- Okay, but don't laugh."
- I promise.
"I was younger then, not as refined."
- You're stoned.
- Totally.
- I thought you hated that.
- It was peer pressure.
"If Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke, you took it or took off."
Gilbert had a snappy slogan.
I was nauseous all day.
Your parents?
- Yun-hwa!
What are you waiting for?
Come in and take a good look.
"But if you do not find the man you are looking for, there will be consequences for violating the privacy of a maiden."
"No, wait out there."
Are you satisfied?
What more do you want?
Leave this room.
How much more contempt must I tolerate?
It's bad enough that you've force yourself into a maiden's room.
Do you now wish to tear it apart?
Leave now.
I will not tolerate any more disrespect!
What are you doing here?
Lady Yun-hwa has a message for you.
For me?
You wish to go to the baron?
Do you know who you are up against?
The baron isn't your only opponent.
"Imperial Attendant Ju Tae-moon, Prime Minister Yoon Won-hyung, this could be a fight against the King who would shield them!"
One man has already lost his life.
I have no other choice.
This is the only way to save my friend's life.
They will not release him that easily no matter what you say.
"In fact, they will try to hurt you as well."
I can't back down.
You may be disqualified from the exam.
You may never get the chance to realize your cherished dream!
I know.
"Master, it's Kyun."
Enter!
Brothers...
"Of all those smiling kids, how many are still smiling?"
"I mean, back then we just assumed that everything would work out."
"How many of us are going to end up in a good place, without messing it up along the way?"
"And I just felt really good, 'cause, like..."
I was one of the happy ones.
I had found Joanne.
And what do you do when you lose the person you were meant to be with?
"Just so I know, um..."
How long are you gonna wallow?
She left me an hour ago.
I was thinking maybe an hour and ten minutes?
"Dude, you have got to stop thinking about her as the person you were meant to be with."
"In fact, just stop thinking about her as a person."
"For a while, she is just that selfish, hurtful whore."
"Well, I'll give you selfish and hurtful."
"Oh, give me whore, too!"
Come on.
She just dumped you in front of 20 strangers at a party that you threw for her.
I think we can trade up.
I guess.
I just can't even imagine being with anyone else.
I know.
I do.
"It hurts, but..."
I have totally forgotten your name.
"I'm sorry I have to go, but I need to pick up my sister."
It's all right.
"We can, uh, do this again."
Really?
"Yeah, sure."
And not just for coffee.
"Next time, there may be pie."
Nothing at all.
It's so strange.
We've been to every hospital and he's in none of them.
It's like his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.
- Don't listen to him.
- We'll find Tony for sure.
"Yeah, we'll turn the town upside down."
Yeah.
- [sickle] what're you doing?
- [Letha] thinking.
"Thinking about us in a different place, such as..."
Las Vegas With Tony.
"Seven or eleven every time, right?"
A day at the races.
All the long shots come in.
"[laughs] you do have an imagination, after all."
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.
"For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them."
"If he can stack them, he can unstack them."
The gold is on display at the museum.
Protected by an impenetrable security system.
Just sitting there waiting for us To penetrate it.
Wait a minute.
Us?
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?
Professor Gannon is extremely busy being a genius.
"I own half the invention,"
"Half of Tony, that means I own half of the profits."
"So far, the return on my investment has been half of zero."
What about security.
We'd need an army to pull it off.
I didn't see you.
"You know, an interesting thing happened to me yesterday."
I found a Syrian spy at a restaurant in downtown Miami.
Wow.
"That must be some catch, huh?"
"Actually, it was more like a consolation prize."
I had heard somewhere that your son might be there.
Really?
Well...guess you can't believe everything you hear.
"Let's stop pretending, shall we?"
Next time you see your son -- and we both know there will be a next time -- you tell him I'm coming for him.
"And if you keep helping him, I'm coming for you, too."
So...
How soon can we leave?
"Well, that depends."
"Schmidt, if you can't do this --"
"I can do it, all right?"
Of course I can do it.
But the terms of the arrangement may have changed.
No.
The deal was we get rid of Jabbar in exchange for an all-expenses-paid trip to wherever we want to go.
Your words.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was before I knew that your plan involved
Jabbar stealing everything I have left.
So you guys may have to foot some of the bill.
How much?
Depends on where you want to go.
Depends on how many of you want to go.
"I mean, I-I-I-it's you two, uh, it's black George Clooney, guy with the chin..."
Right -- the four of us.
"Hey, look."
It's Yo-Yo.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
"Hey, Yo-Yo."
Don't you want to catch us?
I don't trust him.
He's probably using some psychology trick on us.
Come on.
"Hey, Mr. Yo-yo, don't you want to catch us?"
It's not my job anymore.
They're coming down to fire me for destroying city property.
The only thing that works is the radio.
And it won't turn off.
"I was only trying to help you, kids."
"Mr. Yokomoto,"
I'm sorry about everything that's happened.
"All I ever wanted in life was all you kids that I put back in school, someday visit me and say,"
"""thanks Mr. Yo-Yo, Yokomoto."
"If it wasn't for you forcing us to get an education,"
"We would've been bums."""
That's all I wanted.
You see?
I told you he was gonna hit us with some of that heavy psychology.
"I mean, I feel guilty."
Bulletin from the plutonium plant.
"Unless the demands of the terrorists are met, the furnace will explode with the force of ten megatons."
"An official describes the atomic furnace controls as frozen in position,"
"- As if ""the molecular flow..."""
- That's Tony!
- The plant is being evacuated.
- That's where he is!
"Yes, Operation Sunshine, the protection of power and dam installations in Southern Norway, to prevent the Germans from destroying too much before they surrender."
You've been chosen to lead the operation with Parson as second in command and Skinnarland on radio duties.
The rest of the group you pick yourself.
Congratulations.
I thought this was what you always wanted.
"To go back to Norway, get out into the field again?"
"If you'd rather stay here just until the end of hostilities and then go and see your wife and children, it's no problem, I can..."
Of course not.
The war's not over yet.
"Thank you, sir."
Good man.
"Well, you're certainly not going to miss the fish."
You don't get fishes like this in Norway.
"Not really, no."
Eugh!
I can't.
It must be very beautiful this time of year.
It's always beautiful.
Do you know what I miss the most about Norway?
"The horizons, wherever you look."
Yeah.
It's been a while.
You must come and visit.
My house is big.
"Well, that could be awkward."
"I might go back to university, do another degree."
That's a good idea.
This country needs good bird-watchers.
It certainly does.
It's going to be strange not to have a war.
Yes.
What else to it?
"He was stripped, cleansed, glabrous and smooth."
Xerxes was reborn a god.
Artemisia trusted no one.
So in the cover of night the palace was cleansed of all Xerxes' allies.
All those he trusted
mall those who had raised him
mall those he had once looked to for counse were quickly introduced to her wrath.
And as the god-king stood before his people
Artemisia watched her ﬂawless manipulation take shape.
- For glory's sake
- For glory's sake
- for vengeance's sake - for vengeance's sake war.
war!
War is coming to Greece in the visage of a monster army over a million strong.
It should be little more than a formality for Themistokles the hero of Marathon to finish what he began.
Please!
We must appeal to Xerxes' reason!
Coward!
Athens is a city of cowards!
Shut your cock hole!
Shut your own!
I'll kill you!
Fuck the Spartans!
Fuck those muscle-bound boy-lovers!
Silence!
Silence for the hero of Marathon!
"This is a democracy, not a street fight."
Quiet!
It's Themistokles.
The Persian attack will come from both the north and the south.
The city-states should negotiate a truce.
"Yes, yes, we must negotiate."
Pass!
Come here.
Why did you go alone?
Why didn't you pass?
But I...
"Don't ""but"" me!"
playing the game is a team responsibility.
Responsibility?
"Well, I definitely see how something could have slipped out of there."
Absolutely.
That would have fallen right out in the middle of the bed.
What about Charlie's hole?
"Just get into the bed, please, and show us how you sleep, guys."
"Well, right off the bat, I think there's a clear solution could have prevented this entire thing."
You guys need to get two beds.
"Oh, maybe I'll get two TVs and two refrigerators."
What are you talking about?
Do we come to your house and tell you how to sleep?
I sleep in a king-sized bed by myself.
"When I have to go to the bathroom, I use a toilet."
Look at...
He...
Dennis on his bed made for kings with his toilet made out of gold.
"Okay, guys, everybody calm down, please."
This is not about lifestyle.
This is not about judgments.
"This is about truth, okay?"
"Now, Charlie and Frank, show us how you were positioned the night of the incident."
Excuse me.
Incidents.
"All right, well, I'm pretty sure I was sleeping like this that night."
"It's just, like, no way it could have been me."
I love your accent.
"England, right?"
I've never met anybody from there.
Miss underwood hails from iowa
And is pursuing a ballet career.
"Typically, I find dancers too carefree and irresponsible,"
Though I have always appreciated the discipline of ballet.
"Nice to meet you, dot."
"Uh, I didn't mean to interrupt."
No harm.
Wasn't much more to say.
I'm sure you'll be very happy here.
Uh...
Do you have anything you want to tell me?
"Not at present, no."
Very well.
Let's get on with it.
Mr. Stark believed
The intruder had some advanced technological assistance.
Mr. Stark believes brushing your teeth
Requires advanced technological assistance.
Shall we?
You've done this before.
Himalayas before the war.
"Though, at the time,"
I was strapped to a very amusing spaniard named...
"You are, of course,"
Well within your rights to maintain your privacy.
Thank you.
I agree.
"A charge of treason, out of context,"
Is not necessarily what it appears to be.
"If you're helping him in any way, that constitutes a federal crime."
"I'm aware, and I'd like to help you, Ms. Riley."
Anything I can do to get my son through this alive.
"I, uh, wonder if, um, I could ask a favor of you."
I'd like you to sign this.
It affirms that you'll be cooperating fully with our investigation.
"And if you violate this agreement in any way, you're looking at life in prison."
Do you have a pen?
Thank you.
There you go.
Thank you.
"Well, that's all I need for today."
"And, uh, please -- do call if you hear anything."
Excuse me.
Who are they?
Oh.
Don't mind them.
They're just checking to see if your phone lines are working properly.
"For your protection, of course."
Of course.
Oh.
"We checked the inside of the house, as well."
Just making sure there's no place for anyone to hide.
"Thanks for your time, Mrs. Westen."
"No, no, thank you."
Bitch.
How long is it gonna take for Jabbar's guys to get here?
I-I just -
- I don't understand why I have to be here.
"I mean, can't -- well, what if I wait outside --"
"I already explained this, okay?"
Jabbar's guys need to think that they caught you by surprise while you were working Mike over.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were serious.
- At least you get letters.
"- Oh sure, Lily."
Most of the poets that come in here don't even want to see my face when they fuck me.
"- Rule number one is to make them cum, right?"
"They come in five minutes, they owe you for half an hour."
- Good.
What else?
"- Ah, but a professional always offer a massage, so the guy doesn't feel like a total loser."
- And
- it's the best way to get another half an hour out of the prick.
- That's my girl.
* And night falls on a weekend day
* And all the young and some old
* Come out to play
* And some of us drink to laugh
* Some of us drink to cry
* But everyone drinks to leave life
* For a while
* And anywhere's better than here *
- When were you last employed?
"- Um, well, I, uh,"
I do volunteer work?
"- I'm sorry, perhaps I didn't make myself very clear."
"When did you last cease full-time, paid employment?"
"- Paid, um."
It's about two years ago.
"- Well, that's the reason why you're currently under review for your Newstart Allowance."
We just need to be making sure that you're still actively looking for work.
"- Yeah, I have been."
I have been.
"So, this kid ends up losing."
"And I go to him, and he doesn't pay me."
"Instead, he goes to the Dean, tells the Dean, and the Dean expels me."
When did this happen?
Um...3 weeks ago.
I don't know.
But there's 2 days left in winter break and I can't even go back to school.
And what about the money?
"God, I owe this guy $6,000 now, and next week it's gonna be 7."
"He says if I don't have it by the end of the week, he's gonna come to my house and take it from my mother, so..."
Let's get some lunch.
Bailiff:
All rise.
Judge:
"Having reviewed the petition briefs, and based on arguments presented,"
I hereby deny the petitioner's request for asylum.
"Your honor, may I be heard?"
"You have been heard, Mr. mooney."
There's no legal basis to grant asylum here.
The petitioner shall be returned to her home immediately upon her release from the hospital.
[Gavel bangs]
How long you been out of school?
Ahem.
I got kicked out 2 weeks before winter recess.
What have you been doing?
"Oh, you know."
"Intercepting mail, phone calls."
"Just trying to figure this whole thing out, basically."
"Well, you gotta tell your mom."
[Cell phone rings]
"That's, uh..."
That's the bookie.
"Look, Martha Dumptruck, revenge of the nerds, and hello kitty -- they rode the same bus."
"Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted."
"Well, that would explain why there's no EMF at the school, but not the attacks."
Ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt.
They can't just bail.
Unless this one can.
"Dean, there's lore about spirits possessing people and riding them for miles."
"Then whenever they leave the body, they're bungeed back to their usual haunt."
"But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want."
So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into Truman?
It's possible.
"Ghosts getting creative -- well, that's super."
Definitely ain't clean.
"Here, ghosty, ghosty, ghosty!"
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
"Man, I don't get it."
"No one ever died on this bus, and it's not like there's a body hidden in here."
"Yeah, but a flap of skin, a hair."
"I mean, hell, a hangnail."
Something's got to be tying the ghost to this place.
We just got to find it.
Yeah.
Got a new driving permit.
Issued two weeks ago.
- Just before the first attack.
- Yeah.
Name of the bus driver is Dirk McGregor sr.
39 North Central Avenue.
- McGregor?
- Yeah.
Why?
I knew his son.
And you're still acting like this?
"Then, I guess..."
I should investigate these invisible men for murder.
"If you're going to throw around accusations, at least make some sense!"
Or give us a name!
"Or why don't you bring some pictures, or any evidence at all?"
"Hey, follow him."
Officer!
Why are there no security cameras in this building?
Can you show me the footage from the elevator camera?
That camera...
it breaks every time we fix it.
So we gave up on it.
But I'm wondering if someone might be breaking it on purpose.
"Wow, seriously..."
Hey.
Why are you following me everywhere I go?
Are you worried I'm going to run away?
What do you mean?
Why would you run away when you didn't do anything wrong?
"Oh, geez..."
Joon Gi Moon?
The one who owned the sushi restaurant?
Did you know him?
"Then, the murder victim that Im Tae Ho was talking about..."
How did you know the victim?
- Park Seon Woo.
"- Oh, yes..."
"He was a colleague of mine, below me."
We were like blood brothers.
We also worked together once.
We were partners.
If you two are through making out...
"I'd like to see you in my office, please."
What have we got?
We got victim number 3 in Wisconsin.
He's hitting his stride now.
"Nina Getz, Valerie Wheaton, and now this."
Somebody's got to go to Milwaukee this afternoon... and tell them that we ain't got jack shit.
It sure as hell isn't going to be me.
Be sure and show 'em that drawing you got... from a blind witness.
You just keep pushing me.
"Hey, you need it!"
Then don't you just take me off... this fucking case right now.
"Oh, ho!"
"No way, Jose."
"You're going right down with me, asshole."
"Why don't you lighten up, lieutenant?"
"Stay out of this, Ridgely."
You two know more about this case than anybody.
"This guy's out there laughing at you, man."
He's beating you.
I want you to go out and shut the motherfucker down... 'cause you're not getting off the case.
You're going to retire on this one.
I'm going straight to Milwaukee.
I don't know when I'll be back.
I'll get you a ride from someone downstairs.
I got this fucking jagoff of a lieutenant... who's blaming me for the fucking murder.
Here for the murder?
They're all inside.
You live here?
I'm sorry.
Why do people say that?
Why don't they just say that it sucks shit your mom's dead?
"You go backwards, you fall on your back."
- Give me that gun.
"- I get these bullet things out, I'll be comfortable."
Now you can point it at me all day if you like.
- Just why did you come here?
"- Well, I-I— Marjorie—"
"You don't mind me calling ""Marjorie,"" do you?"
Of course you don't.
"Marjorie, why don't you give up this life of yours?"
You're far too young and beautiful to spend it in jail.
- What do you take to get these delusions?
- You're wrong.
- I'm doing this for your own good.
Now let's sit down.
- Leave my coat alone.
- I'll hang it up for you.
"- Please, give it to me."
Give it to me.
- I won't drop it.
"- Now, please go."
Dash it!
I can't go until I do the thing I came here to do.
Why don't you give up this life you're leading.
It's not going to get you anywhere.
Oh?
That's most flattering.
But just what do you think I am?
"You can stop all this bluff because I happen to know you've borrowed some plans... that belong to the government, and I think it only sporting to tell you... that a large number of detectives are following you around."
- Now I know there's something wrong with you.
- Don't go on pretending.
Two Scotland Yard men followed you to my house yesterday.
- Really?
How else did I know which hotel you'd be in?
Which amoeba scratching his crutch not a million miles away might know that you kept your private stuff hidden behind a map of the world and tell Lenny you were leaving?
"What is it you do for them, Calum?"
You miserable little snitch.
I got used to having your big cheery smile around.
- Didn't want to see you leave.
- What do they have on you?
I'm guessing that sex with strangers in hotels wasn't top of your career list.
It wasn't.
Advance warning
- I'm getting ready to do a runner as well.
"As long as it's not in my direction, Calum."
I was once a police officer.
"I bet you looked lovely in that uniform, PC Rose."
Was Lenny your guv?
"Undercover, actually."
So can you can get us into the house?
I might just be up to it.
Sweet.
Ooh!
That's the front door.
"Darling, I'll speak to you tomorrow, OK?"
"Oh, I'm awfully sorry to disturb you."
- That's all right.
- I've broken down just along the road and wouldn't you know it but the bloody mobile...!
Would you mind if I borrowed your phone to call the AA?
Erm...
You'll have to tell me where I am.
- Of course.
Come inside.
- Thank you.
You're an absolute angel.
- What?
About what?
That they're setting him up to laugh at him.
They're laughing with him now.
They think he's cool ever since he took up your cause.
- What cause?
"- ""Go, drugs!"""
He doesn't know what I do.
You keep clinging to that raft.
"Okay, this vote is on a motion by Walter Stringer to request a variance from zoning regulation 11.6, for a front yard setback."
- All in favor?
- Try 11.2.
- Excuse me?
"- It's zoning regulation 11.2, not 6."
And Walt is not adding a family room.
"He's adding a giant garage for his boat, which is gonna cut off all the light to his neighbor's dining room."
Read the plans.
A family room doesn't have concrete floors and a door that's operated by a remote.
That's complete bullshit.
"You're not in charge here anymore, Wilson."
Lucky for you or I'd throw your nautical ass right out of here.
Really.
"Buy a fucking slip in the marina, Captain Cheap-Ass."
Excuse me.
You're out of order.
"Now, all those in favor of granting the motion, raise your hand and say ""aye."""
Aye.
"All of those against, ""nay."""
- Nay.
- Motion is denied.
"- Fuck you, Wilson!"
- Go play with your dinghy!
"Millington Associates are here to help."""
Not out of this office.
It could be worth your while.
I could cut you in.
No way.
"You need a Whizz, I need a Wii."
That's a perfect match.
Lovely melty car could be all yours.
All right.
But my cut comes off the top.
No more loud music and you make the coffee.
- Deal?
- Done!
Of course she's going to publish it herself.
"Well, she seemed very clear that she wasn't."
- And you believed her?
- That is neither here nor there.
"Legally, she can do what she likes."
Dr Goodyear's will leaves all the research to her.
Then we must contest the will.
"This is the curse of the ethical being, Peter."
The papers should be published.
They could be published if we had them.
Another man would simply take them and cut the Gordian knot in a moment.
- Uh...
"- And yet our own ethics, our code of conduct forces us to do nothing."
If only... if only there was another way!
There's the matter of you pulling your weight.
Time for Millington  Anderson to diversify.
"Anderson  Millington, and I've already had an idea, actually."
Free quotation on our will preparation service.
"This week only, no appointment necessary."
He is.
Best enjoy this while we can.
Hitler's got enough on his plate without picking a fight with us.
His appetite for territory seems rather insatiable.
Will you be there this evening?
If I can get away.
"- Oh, do try and make it, Miriam."
Turning out in force to oppose Joyce's proposition is the only way to get it thrown out.
"Will you be there, Alison?"
Of course.
Boxing gloves on.
Granite chin at the ready.
Excellent.
You may well need it.
I suspect it could get rather bloody.
How was the check-up?
Fine.
- Good.
"What can I get you, Alison?"
- Some tongue would be lovely.
"Oh, I was expecting you back half an hour ago, Claire."
"I'm sorry, Mrs Cameron."
Bit of a queue at Brindsley's.
"And then, in the grocer's, a few of us were talking about tonight's meeting."
"As my employee, you'll appreciate that I expect you to vote in favour of my proposition tonight."
Staff loyalty is a quality that I hold in very high regard.
It's essential for a harmonious household.
"Yes, Mrs Cameron."
There's a list of chores on the kitchen table.
I'd like them completed by the time I return.
I'll be out all afternoon.
"Yes, Mrs Cameron."
Nami's not after money.
- She did it because she trusted me.
- So you say.
Your image is very appealing.
"And you have such a nice body, too."
Nowadays there is not much excitement in this industry.
It's so boring.
Did you give my number to anyone?
Why?
I've been getting a lot of perverted telephone calls lately.
Is there a pervert stalking you?
"Such a lonely world, isn't it?"
Everyone wants someone to talk to.
That sad looking guy outside as well.
He looks like a guy who's henpecked at home.
Are you sympathizing with a pervert!
?
"No, but I read these stories in the magazines so often nowadays, how some women have been assaulted or had their underwear stolen."
Do you have a persecution complex?
You might be the type.
I think I'll be going now.
"OK, I understand."
Why don't you take that magazine with you as a memento?
"Ladies and gentlemen, this train is leaving, please mind the doors,"
Nami Tsuchiya.
Please come out.
I just want to talk to you.
Who are you?
Say something.
I saw you in front of the cafe.
Why did you follow me?
"I sympathize with you, and I don't know why I'm doing this."
"I'm not taking any time off, I swear."
"Whoa, Brian, it's okay to take a break every now and then."
- It is?
"- Yeah, absolutely."
"In fact, coffee preparation is very important."
Yeah.
"Actually, making coffee is one of my favorite hobb..."
That's great.
"Listen to me, I need to ask you something."
"The other day when I said those things to you about taking time off, I mean, I don't even know"
- if you remember it.
- Like it was yesterday.
"Well, in that case I was just wondering... how bad was I?"
You weren't that bad.
Good.
"Now, would you be willing to swear to that in court?"
- What?
Why?
- No reason.
"Truth is, my recollection is exactly the same as yours."
"You asked for a couple days off, and I gave it to you."
"See, I even wrote it in my diary."
"""Gave Brian two days off."
"Felt good about it."""
It looks like you just wrote that today.
- What makes you say that?
- It has today's date on top.
I just wrote that down to remember today's conversation.
Can I go back to work now?
"Yep, just make sure you have the affidavit on my desk as soon as possible."
"Thanks for seeing us on such short notice, Ms. Randolph."
"I have to say, when I heard the name Frank Gallo, my interest was piqued."
I'm going to tell you something.
Tendo wasn't a dumb fuck like you.
The first thing he is expecting is a strike right now.
So we count his hit as a pay back.
"Let's get back to business, huh?"
No!
Don't you ever fucking talk to me like that again.
We let things cool down.
We let things cool down.
We find out when tendo goes back to Japan.
We find out who the fuck the American is he has working for him.
"Ok, once we got this information, then what?"
Then we call in our connections.
And we blow them off the face of the fucking earth.
This is Tony's.
Sam?
Sam?
"Man, what took you so long?"
I'm freezing my nuts off here.
"I didn't pick this place, tell it to the captain."
"No, you tell it to the captain."
Man he is mad as hell at you!
For what?
You get sent undercover and the next thing he knows San Pedro looks like v-8 juice.
What the hell happened this time?
Tendo is in town.
Campanela found out and tried to knock him off.
"Yeah, well I heard they would have succeeded if some asshole hadn't interfered."
"Yeah, well I heard they would have succeeded if some asshole hadn't interfered."
"Are you talking about me, Sam?"
"Shit yeah, I'm talking about you."
You're supposed to be helping us bring these guys down.
I'm going into a new business.
Only this afternoon I made $200.
$200?
"Yes, that's why I was late for the wedding."
That makes it a little different.
I'm not consenting to your wedding... but I always admire any young man that can make money.
It shows character.
"- That's too kind of you, sir."
- Not at all.
Then Margaret and I can get married?
If you go to New York and work hard at your business... and if you are successful... you can come back here and ask me for my Margaret.
"Oh, Daddy."
And in all probability I'll be very happy to give her to you.
"Right, sir."
"Thank you, sir."
"John, dear."
"You'll come back soon, won't you?"
"That all depends upon the stakes, the stocks..."
"Goodbye, my son."
"Thank you, father-in-law."
I'll say goodbye again because we'll both be waiting for you.
"Hurry back, dear."
I feel that I'm a little to blame in this.
"You know, I didn't realize what a bright, upstanding young man you were."
"And I don't care how big the city, I feel confident... you're going to be successful."
"Thank you, sir."
"Lucky, couldn't I go with you?"
I'm afraid you'd try to be a good influence on me.
"No, honest I wouldn't."
I'm terrible bad when you get to know me.
Then I wouldn't want you to come with me.
"One to New York, please."
I found it.
You'd better look your intern ass I found it!
And I found something along with it too:
"Errors, major ones."
Errors that we cannot afford to make.
- Like what?
"- Honey... we are not at ""Harper's Bazaar""."
The big boss down the hall would not be thrilled.
She'd be very glad that I had a spare moment... to oversee this...
"this ""work""."
"I delegated this project to you because I thought you could... handle it, unfortunately, I've learned you can't."
"Re-typing my rolodeck was just that difficult task for you, huh?"
For example:
Lann Wayner's card.
"Why is there only one ""n""on lann?"
"Did you know he added an extra ""n"" years ago?"
"Andy Warhol's card, did you even think to verify this number?"
"- No, because he's dead."
- Excuses!
"You just don't get it, do you?"
"Dead or alive, I still... need their phone numbers."
"This is for your own benefit, not mine, okay?"
No bad blood?
It's curse!
Dolly!
You're back from the couture show!
How is Lacroix?
"That is Dolly Bellows, she's an institution."
- Give me a tissue.
- That man is a genius!
The word genius is really in overuse
Lacroix transcends the English language.
- This in an eight and a half.
- Nothing for Sylvie?
No.
We don't have the coral in an eight and a half.
So I brought the taupe and the black.
And this is a similar style in ivory with a strap.
"Oh, I don't want the strap."
I didn't think you would.
I just wanted you to see it.
"Yeah, I would just feel silly with the strap."
I'm a grown woman.
"Well, sure."
But I'm contractually obligated... to at least try to sell you shoes.
How are the boys?
Are you guys all settled in there?
My boys are great.
They're great at being boys.
Kids are so adaptable.
- Am I adaptable?
- Yes.
"Yes, well... they have absolutely no control over their own lives, so-"
"But if things were reversed... you know, like that movie Freaky Friday... you can be sure Pam and I would be sent to our rooms for all our fighting."
"Yes, they would give us a time-out... and tell us we could not come out until we had really thought about what we had done."
What have we done?
But... there are no time-outs.
There's not enough time fortime-out.
"Is the sale just for clothes, or is it for other things too?"
It's a storewide sale.
"Fifteen minutes, Sylvie."
How do they feel?
Where are the Braun handheld blenders... that were advertised in the Sunday supplement?
- Is it a classic instrument?
"Hey, you think if I keep telling myself it's over,"
I'll actually believe it?
You'll be sorry if it's over.
No more running around crazy in the streets with roguishly handsome me.
Have you always found yourself so entertaining?
Come on.
Admit it.
I amuse the stuffing out of you.
My stuffing's perfectly in place.
You know what I'll miss?
Knowing what's gonna happen.
It made me feel... godlike.
That's nothing new for you.
"Well, I, guess I'll see you next time the universe decides to break all its rules on your behalf."
"Yeah, next time."
Goodbye.
Nico.
Yeah?
What did the guy do?
What guy?
"On the video, the one that got you kicked off the force?"
"In the modern world, there's nowhere to hide, is there?"
- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't...
- It was a meth factory... in a house in El Sobrante.
Guy just... escaped a cooking accident.
Place went up in a fireball.
Too bad his girlfriend and kid that he left behind did not survive the inferno.
Too bad for my career with the police department
I let my... my disapproval of his behavior get the better of me.
"If it were me, I wouldn't have been kicked off the force for assaulting him."
- No?
You make me laugh!
We make him laugh.
"well, you two are starting to worry us."
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?
"You were chosen because you were 76-/- average, and after just a few days, you,re barely 44-/- average."
I was about to tell you:
"If you don,t stay above 50-/-, you won,t be here long."
"We,re not above 50-/-?"
"We,re not making this up."
"Think of your country, of yourselves, of everything we,ve done."
"It,d be a terrible waste."
"They,II make us pay for everything, just you wait!"
- Is that supposed to be irony?
"- Why, is it forbidden?"
"Listen, Jean-MicheI."
"Do you think you,re doing this all by yourself?"
Have you any idea what we must deal with?
Sometimes I wonder why we bother.
I thought scientists were much more patient.
At work we deal with relationships and statistics -
"Check 7 under ,aggressiveness.,"
"You,d put 7?"
",Check 7., There you go again!"
You want aggressiveness?
Let me handle this.
- Maybe 8.
"- Right, check 8."
Your colleague said 8.
Check that.
"Note, ,The couple find the technicians very amusing.,"
"personally, I,m very tired, and right now I really don,t find this amusing."
"Yeah, you want to grab One of those samples, sam?"
Yeah.
Zeke tenhoff and his brother sam.
"Are assessing the fruits Of their day's labor,"
As they work to secure A mineralrights.
Claim on the grounds.
With the state of alaska.
"Yeah, this is the sample That was from, like,"
Far away from the hole As I could get.
My immediate goal For the start of this ice season.
Is to collect enough samples To be able to prove.
That there is A longterm resource of gold.
Out at that prehistoric Beach line at hastings creek.
"Once I have that data, I can start."
"The claiming And leasing process,"
To have unrestricted access To the area for the longterm.
"I hate to be the pessimist,"
But this just looks like A bucket full of sand to me.
I do kinda wish maybe I was Panning from samples.
"That were full of red And black sand,"
Instead of just old Prehistoric pebbles.
It's in here.
I mean...
Okay.
We got one tiny little speck.
It's right there.
Speck of gold.
Tiny little speck of fine gold.
That's not gonna Pay the bills.
It's not gonna pay the bills.
"The first samples that I was Able to take, not looking good."
"I mean, by brother's not happy."
"""Nobody walk around with your shoes off."""
Are you sure?
"When I heard the glass break, I immediately threw on my bathing suit."
Was that for nothing?
Where's the glass?
Yay!
"Get these ""save the dates"" for people's weddings."
You guys know what I'm talking about.
"The ""save the dates."""
When did this start?
Why did this start?
"Why was someone like, ""You know what?"
"In advance of the invitation, let's send our friends a ""save the date,' as to say, ""Psst!"
Heads up.
Invitation on the way.
You're one of the chosen ones.
That's right.
Identical information on both pieces of paper.
"Except on that save the date, you're gonna get a pretty cool, insecure picture of the two of us."
That's a magnet.
Put that on the fridge.
"Decorate your home with our faces.'"""
"You see those pictures, you're like, ""Oh, fuck."
"I can't go to this."""
"They're just looking at you like, ""This is what love is, right?"
"We're in a field in the middle of nowhere, standing next to an abandoned barn."
Come to our wedding.
Look at us.
"We're spooning backwards while standing, laughing about something one of us brought up."
Be at our wedding!
"Look, we're on a dock in the middle of a lake."
We don't even live near a lake.
Always wrestling with that Carter boy.
"- I told her, she wouldn't listen..."
"- You low, miserable, crazy slime."
- Don't you go shoving...
- That's your child she's carrying.
- It ain't.
"- I can prove it, Lucas."
I've got enough proof on you to put you in jail for the rest of your life.
- I never touched her.
"- Here, sign that."
It's a statement of the facts.
Are you out of your mind?
I never touched her!
Maybe you'd like the police to sweat it out of you.
"I never touched her, and I ain't gonna sign nothing that said I did."
"If you don't want to sign this paper, that's up to you."
"Hey, doc... ."
"You know I couldn't do nothing as awful as that, don't you?"
I'm going back to my office.
I'm gonna start telephoning every father in Peyton Place.
You wouldn't.
"I don't know what they'll do, but I do know this:"
"You're the janitor in a school full of young girls and an hour from now, I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes."
Don't do it.
I wouldn't think of fooling around with any other girls.
"It was just Selena, doc."
"Well, there was something about her."
It was just Selena.
"Please, doc, don't."
There's only one thing that'll stop me.
You sign that.
"If I sign it, what are you gonna do with it?"
"- I didn't get a chance to contribute a whole lot to that report, I mean anything"
- Is this true?
Lindsay?
"Look, guys, good science requires teamwork."
Part of the assignment is working together.
- If we had different partners.
"- I'm keeping you together, and giving you an additional assignment, which you'll do together"
"Or fail, together."
"Oh, yeah, you're not stupid at all."
"Uh, a little help here."
I think I'm going to have a hernia.
I had a hernia when I was little once.
I had to have an operation.
"Seth, can you...?"
!
"Oh, oh, sorry, sorry."
Okay.
My leg just went numb.
"My legs went numb, but we're cool."
"That's okay, right?"
That's normal?
- You are so out of your element.
"- No, I'm not."
- What are you even doing here?
- I need tickets.
I'll do anything to get them.
"- What are you, like, a huge fan?"
"- Yeah, of a certain prickly brunette named after my least favorite season."
- You're doing this for a girl?
"- Well, to be clear, I'm actually getting the tickets for her and her boyfrien..."
Her boy... her friend that's a boy.
- I'm showing her that I'm capable of thinking of somebody other than myself.
"man, all that conversation."
People writing notes.
"They look at you different, like, trying to figure out who you really are."
Like you're famous.
Admit it. lt's really great.
I don't know what you are talking about.
"Come in, gentlemen."
"So, M r."
Krakow?
I thought a lot about what you said.
And I decided that the main thing is really to protect the school.
"That's good, Brian."
I went to the bathroom.
I heard a scuffle.
Then a shot. I came out.
I saw two pairs of legs running in opposite directions.
Who those people were I can't say.
And if you or these men or anybody else threatens me anymore...
pressures me anymore--
Brian-- l will insist on having a lawyer...
and I will sue you for harassment and anything else I can.
And if you try to expel me in order to solve your public relations problems...
then I will reveal to anyone who will listen...
just who is destroying the spirit of this school.
"So, they still haven't found out who had the gun."
"Mom, it's really okay."
Let it go.
The school hasn't self destructed yet.
It's just so hard not being able to protect you.
"Yeah, but you can't."
"- Hey, what's up?"
- Hey everybody.
"Slade, you dragged me into this, yeah?"
And I want things done properly.
This girl has been attacked.
And that to me requires the police.
"Listen, if we call the police then we lose that trust."
And if we lose that trust then we have nothing.
"No police, no."
So what are you gonna about it ?
How did the meeting with Marosi go?
"Yeah, it was wonderful."
"Listen mate, can you get into work?"
I'm still here.
Why ?
OK good.
So I'm gonna send you a photo of a girl.
Have you had a girl reported missing recently looks who like this ?
She's got a really distinctive birth mark below her eye.
What's this about ?
"- I can't tell you that yet, mate."
- Let me just get this straight.
So I'm in the middle of a murder investigation and I'm dead on my feet.
"And you want me to talk to Missing Persons and God knows what, risking my career for God knows why."
And you expect me to do this just because we're friends?
"Yep, pretty much mate, yeah-"
I'll call you if I find anything.
"Hey, any luck tracing the dead woman through the phone networks?"
"Nada, zip, nichts."
"Yeah, a simple ""no"" is fine."
No.
"Is there any news, mate?"
"Yeah, her name is Gemma Morgan."
She's officially a missing person.
"Yes, you heard me."
Of course you won't believe it as you're seeing me here talking nicely.
I can assure you at that time I'd see those news in which..
"A man kills his wife while she sleeps, you know..."
And I could understand them completely.
I surely would've killed her.
We got along pretty well...
Well I congratulate you because for me it was real hell.
Thank God!
Thank God I divorced on time.
"If not, I don't know how could have ended."
"I'm telling you, I had these terrible thoughts... tremendous!"
Did you manage everything patiently?
More or less.
Believe me I'm jealous.
She told me that if I was leaving she'd bring charges for abandonment of the home.
Do what you want!
That she'd get the children custody...
It's alright keep them all!
Look.
In my wrist.
Can you see a little sample of what happened the last day?
She almost break my arm!
She hit me with the iron machine and I thought she broke my arm.
"Actually, she tried to hit me in the head, so I took the iron machine from her and I hit her!"
I left her lying on the floor.
It was all messed up.
We fucked up everything.
I remember wondering if she was dead...
But not at all!
She just got some stitches.
Of course I didn't see her.
What?
!
Fleming:
Thank you for that.
I take it you didn't find anything.
"No sign of it, I'm afraid."
"But she might, of course, have panicked and got rid of it."
"Well, I doubt it."
"It's too valuable, and taking the letter in the first place was too much of a risk."
"I'm surprised Spencer hasn't, um-- let's go in here--hasn't mentioned it to you."
"He still trusts you, doesn't he?"
"Well, he's told me he's got it."
He's just not saying what he's done with it.
He likes to play these things close to his chest.
"Well, it's certainly not in the hotel."
We'll just have to keep looking.
"So, what about the shooting?"
You think Margaret Ellis was the target?
Do you?
"Well, there was nobody in the room who had any reason to kill her..."
"Except Arthur Ellis, perhaps."
He didn't have it in him.
The son?
Perhaps.
He could have opened the door.
But how would he have been able to see to take aim?
"I'll tell you one thing, though."
I happen to know for a fact that Mrs. Ellis changed her will hours before she died.
"She added a codicil leaving half her money, and that includes half the hotel, to the Friday club."
All for the cause.
"Spencer persuaded her, do you think?"
He's good at that sort of thing.
"I hope, Frankie was right."
You think anyone won't notice?
Wait.
I want to get a picture of my heroes.
All my heroes.
"Come on, Dad."
Just because Cody answered one rescue call doesn't mean he's part of the team.
"- Yes, it does."
- Or we're not.
Cody is our liasion on this mission.
He's the reason we're even giving this place a chance.
Are we clear?
"Dad, did that thing just talk back to me?"
Something's definitely wrong with the robots.
We can't use technology prone to malfunction.
They're not malfunctioning.
They're aliens.
- What?
- What?
Script by Arvegtor Timing by Deska
Galactic showdown!
"In a fierce battle for survival, the Republic and separatist armies have clashed in the distant Sullust system."
"Count Dooku's most cunning assassin, Asajj Ventress, leads the vicious attack."
"Trident group one, attack the starboard engines."
"Trident group two, knock out their port shield generators."
I'll go directly for their bridge.
The port side deflectors are gone.
Lord Tyranus.
My master.
There is a disturbance in the force.
"Your assassin, she has become very powerful."
I'm calling the police!
"Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!
I'm calling the police!
"Woman's voice belongs to our murder victim, leslie stoltz,"
"And we think the male voice belongs to coop daly,"
Enright's security.
"I'm still working a timbre comparison,"
But I'm fairly certain it's a lock.
"Well, it's compelling evidence."
Puts daly in the room.
"Unfortunately, you can't use it in a court of law."
Can we float it to potential jurors?
"The takeaway will be, cardoza's still a dirty cop."
"Wait a minute, what?"
"Murder case in l.A. , evidence didn't fit his theory,"
He made it disappear.
"Rebecca, accusations"
Were made- nothing was ever proven.
"Okay, but the cloud around it drove him here to miami,"
And so here we are again with cardoza's dirty evidence.
"My advice, horatio:"
Fire him.
Out of the question.
Suit yourself.
"But not only will I reject this evidence,"
I will reject all evidence
That cardoza has anything to do with.
He is compromising your lab.
"Well, then I have no choice but to clear his name."
One should go to the nearest temple of any kind in a moment of weakness.
Maybe I shouldn't hurry about Moloch?
"Wise Solomon, people believe in your fairness."
Don't let doubts poison your grand design.
"The law will protect you from your enemies, because what you believe in will always become law."
"King, here are the petitioners from the city!"
Great King!
You're building a temple for pagan filth.
"New sacrifices will bring not glory, but fear."
The treasury has already paid for the building of the altar to Moloch.
Temples are expensive nowadays.
I'm decorating this city to glorify it.
Great King!
"There are madmen, who being blind, will worship the new idol."
Get him out of here!
Don't build the altar to Moloch!
The pagan filth will destroy you and all of us!
Glory to wise Solomon!
Hurray to our King!
Hurray to our King!
Hurray!
What was there will go on.
What has been done will be done again.
There is nothing new under the sun.
Hurray to our King!
Hurray to our King!
"Have you come to your senses, you son of a bitch?"
Where am I?
What are you babbling?
Wait.
Let him drink a bit.
We won't tell anyone about it.
I was wrong to say we didn't know about the case.
It's regrettable.
"What exactly does it mean, that Ussing is listed in that book?"
"In light of the prosecutor's negligence and the testimony you pointed out, it is something that we're keeping a keen eye on."
- As a suspect?
- it's a possibility.
Right now we're focusing on finding the perpetrator.
The book won't be of much use to him.
It only contains car registrations.
He's wounded.
We'll catch him soon.
Then we'll hopefully also know what's happened to Emilie Zeuthen.
Will Ussing be investigated?
We'll leave it to Special Branch and the police.
Focus on our duel with Ussing tomorrow.
I'm not slinging mud without more intel.
"You must admit, things aren't too bad."
- Lebech would like to meet again.
"- Bloody hell, is she serious?"
The Centre Party have made their choice.
Will you check on the event tomorrow?
Yes.
I'll go in five minutes.
See you.
"Thank you for all your efforts, Karen."
I want you to know they mean a lot.
- It's my job.
"- Yes, but anyway..."
Do you have a minute?
"No, not really."
I'm off to the Ministry of Justice to check up on Mogens.
I'm sorry about everything that's happened.
"Like, for being too silly."
No!
Wayne.
We never hit our kids.
You shouldn't hit kids.
"Well, you know what, don't you remember how scared you were of your principal when you were growing up?"
It's 'cause he'd smack you if you were being too silly.
Like your parents wanted you to have a principal who would smack you.
They took comfort in the fact that they were sending you to a place every day where someone would smack you for them if you were being too silly.
"And sometimes I see kids these days, I kind of think, like..."
"Like, wish you could still do that."
"That sort of discipline is long outdated, Wayne, and frowned upon."
We sit the child down...
- That's another problem.
- What is?
- In my opinion.
- Sitting?
"Well, no wonder kids are failing' school, just sittin' around all day."
"Stand up, you're not doing nothin'."
You think sitting is a problem?
- Yeah.
- Why?
'Cause it makes you soft.
- Literally or figuratively?
"- Well, both, I suppose."
- Both?
- Yeah.
In my opinion.
My phone's buzzing.
"Well, so you like cookies and cream ice cream, hey?"
"Well, I think it's pretty good, too."
"Hi, Michelle."
"- But that's what you mean, isn't it?"
I think you should leave.
I don't think you should come here again.
Very well.
"For most of Tutankhamun's reign, the real power was wielded from behind the throne by a military council run by the young king's advisor, Ay."
"But when Tutankhamun reached the age of 18, he would have claimed his inheritance to rule Egypt as a divine pharaoh."
The king's newfound power would not last long.
"In his tenth year on the throne, Tutankhamun died."
Exactly why remains a mystery.
"Some believe he was murdered by his own advisors, or perhaps he just had an accident."
Examination of his body using modern scientific techniques showed a leg injury which could have been fatally infected.
Tutankhamun was still a teenager.
And lift!
"Lift slowly, very slowly."
(Workers speaking Arabic)
"Down, Pecky."
"Pecky, down."
And tilt.
Tilt it.
Lift!
"All right, lower, lower, lower."
Slowly.
Go slowly.
"- Afternoon, Carter."
Where have you been?
- Packing.
I have to go to Cairo.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- I've had a telegram.
Carnarvon is ill.
- Nothing serious I hope.
- I rather think it is.
/ Sure.
Bet he's got plenty of hands and other pieces stashed somewhere.
"Maybe he's dipping them in wax,"
- passing them off as sculpture.
- What?
A classic Vincent Price movie.
You gotta see it.
"""House of Wax"" (1958)"
I'd rather see here Bianco's hauling Mr. Dead body.
Hudson medical school?
I can't believe they'd hire a sleazoid like Bianco.
Looks like he's an outside contractor.
Does that jacket say UPS?
It says APS.
Anatomical procurement services.
Cooler's too small for our body.
He didn't have time to cut it up.
This is unacceptable.
The order was for 20 knees.
"Well, the students will just have to share."
My students are surgeons getting CME credit in advanced arthroscopic techniques.
These people are not accustomed to sharing.
"Actually, they won't be a problem."
"I'm sorry, there is no auditing of this course."
We're not here to audit the course.
We're here to audit the school supplies.
This medical school buys thousands of body parts.
"But I assure you, all the paperwork is in order."
"Where do you think you're going, Frankenstein?"
"Well, I just make deliveries."
I don't know where they come from.
"- Russ Bianco, you're under arrest."
Should I go on?
No!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Please!
"Take us to Schmidt, I won't say another word."
"Come on, Dixon."
I'm in a hurry.
Don't forget your Oreos.
"Counterintelligence, broadly speaking, is the practice of spying on someone who's spying on you."
"With a little patience, you can learn a surprising amount about your enemies just by watching their own surveillance teams."
"It starts with carefully observing who's at what location, when they're there, and how often."
"Once you have a list of possible candidates, you cross-reference with people from other surveillance sites."
"If anybody shows up more than once, it's a safe bet it's not just a coincidence."
It's a lot easier to keep your secrets if you know who's after them.
Gotcha.
Why can't we just knock on the door?
You don't know Calvin Schmidt.
He's not gonna open the door for five people with guns.
It's okay.
So I-I have to be your pretend girlfriend?
Come on.
Here we go.
Kiss for luck?
Never mind.
What the hell are you doing here?
"Hi, Calvin."
It's really --
Was I -- was I unclear the last time we spoke?
"I gave you a fat stack of cash, and I told you to forget my address."
"Yes, I know."
"But look, look -"
"With a bite mark from the victim, I'd fold too."
Here we go.
We don't concede anything at this point.
"My client needs to sleep, gather his thoughts."
We'll talk after the arraignment.
Defendant's ordered to surrender his passport.
Bail is set at $1 million.
Next case.
I hope your client's rested and ready to talk.
Nothing to talk about.
It's amazing what a good night's sleep can do.
I guess the jail house grub made him think twice about getting a plea.
Gloves and a pillbox hat?
Looks like she's going to an afternoon tea.
I'm looking for the elevators.
"Yeah, they're back there."
Mind if we talk to you for a minute?
I don't think Philip's lawyers would want me talking to you.
"Well, did he tell you about the evidence that we have against Mr. Reinhardt?"
The bite on his neck from Laura.
I know about it.
She bit him when he flirted with her in the wardrobe racks.
- He told you this?
- Laura did.
The last time she came to my dressing room.
And why didn't you tell us that?
"At the time, it wasn't important."
Your part-time boyfriend hits on your daughter.
You don't think that's important?
Philip is harmless.
I told Laura she should be flattered.
"And now, if you would excuse me,"
I believe you meant that.
"Oh, I did, sir."
"I'd say we make rather a good team, don't you?"
Yeah.
"Sort of like Sherlock Holmes and Watson, sir."
"No, no, no, no, no."
More like Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Holmes.
"Well, what I mean, sir, is the way I see it,"
I'm working with the highest paid detective in the world.
It's not as high as it sounds.
Not when you have to pay out as much as I do.
"Well, I gotta get to work on Sid Daley."
"Boy, it's hard to find someone in Rome, sir."
"Yes, I imagine."
But his story has to be checked out just like anybody else's.
"Oh, by the way, sir, did I mention that we found the gun in the prop department?"
No.
What you said was that was where you were gonna look for one.
"Oh, that's right, sir."
Right.
And you didn't wanna jump to conclusions.
No good detective should.
Was there anything on the gun?
"Anything like what, sir?"
"Fingerprints, what else?"
"Oh, right."
"No, I don't think so, sir."
The lab is still running tests.
"By the way, sir, why do you think he put the gun back and threw away everything else?"
Perhaps because he didn't have time to get rid of the gun safely.
Guns are very easy to trace.
And the prop room may have seemed the safest place to him.
"Meaning, even if the odds are only 1 in 1,000 that I can get the job done, there's still a chance"
"so yeah, I had defective semen."
"But in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king."
"Well friends, I believe Chips has just settle the old question:"
Is philosophy to real life as masturbation is to sex?
And the answer is?
Sometimes you want to have a wank and a shag in the same day
six girls?
That's nicely done.
Just putting to good use my large sex organ my brain.
"Thanks for that, Chips."
Don't forget to leave me your textbooks.
"You trouble me, Eric,"
taking out your issues with me on James.
Not your finest hour.
He isn't smart enough for you.
How can you still not see it?
"Being smart isn't everything, has it done for you just what you hoped?"
Punishing him makes no sense...
Because he doesn't know about us.
I'm not sure he needs to know.
Especially after the way you behaved today.
"I love him, so leave him alone."
I just couldn't put all the pieces together
Who could?
You.
Nobody is trying to take anything away from you.
I got mad at you about going to Cornell.
I still don't understand how he got in.
I wrote his essay for him.
Did you?
No.
Close.
"Well, these are the things he would talk about when he called."
"I'd ask him how he was, and... these are the things he would say."
You know what's nice about road trips?
This is a road trip?
They have these coffee shops that serve breakfast all night.
You want?
"I want breakfast, all night."
You wanted to know when the truck came in.
How's it look?
I had this little premonition some of it survived the journey...
- I guess they didn't.
"- Gladys, call the insurance."
"Hey, thanks for telling Joe."
What are you talking about?
He bought me champagne last night.
Champagne was his idea.
The back half of the truck is all perfect.
"We got, like, ten tons of good fruit back there."
Thanks.
"I guess some things can be saved, and some can't."
"Tell me, Tommy, I need to know."
What would you do?
I didn't go to business school.
All I got is my gut.
"Right now, I trust your gut more than my M.BA."
"Sarah, what is it?"
"Saul, I love what our family has built here, and I wanna keep it alive, not just for us, but for all the people who work here, people who trusted this family, who trusted this company."
I have the number here of a U.S. Attorney.
"I'll do it your way, six months."
"But, at the end of six months, if we haven't found our way out of this, I will call him."
OK.
"You know, force them to hand it over."
- We're not even sure if...
- One more round of betting and
- I'm cashing us out.
- You're the boss.
I was just trying to keep her distracted.
We're clear.
I want him.
- Sorry?
- You follow the girl.
I'll stay here and I'll call you if he comes out.
- Are you sure?
- I can handle him if there's trouble.
All right.
- I'll call you if I catch anything.
- Do that.
"Artie, I know you're not as sure about this as you're pretending."
I'm not pretending.
You know when you hold a mirror up to a second mirror and you get that sort of reflected infinity thing?
What happens if that mirror is reflected and it's something like the Studio 54 disco ball?
Is it possible to get some kind of artifact interaction?
Something completely unexpected?
I don't know.
What if the disco ball goes off and someone is standing in front of the Alice's mirror?
I think we know what happens.
Do we really?
- Could reflections switch places?
- Could people?
She pulls to the right.
Pardon?
I noticed it a couple months ago.
"When Myka's mad at me, she pulls to the right."
From our Gyula's life there is a word.
Do not make a fuss already.
- Okay
Did you send him in into his house?
- Yes.
- Wrong.
I said that it is not allowed to be in consideration of me.
This pine smell.
This ozone.
"You do not know it, what this means to me."
"After the a on frontline service filled of 9 monthly,in intolerable noise and smelliness,"
"I cannot to say it, how much I am glad about your kind invitation."
"Well yet we, how we are glad."
"Terrific to thought to it, that what you may suffer there on the front."
My Gyula. my son.
It is not necessary to be worried about his.
"I take it beside myself as soon as the cold season begins, into the flag office heated well."
Kind major lord.
"Do you hear this, my sweet good Lajos?"
- How we say thank you for this the for major lord?
How we gratitude?
Thankfully i owe for the kind hospitality.
"Because I was like that already, than the chased game."
Be calm.
The your Gyula son's will be your good place beside me.
He loved that little limping child the best.
Himself bought it because of that always beside it.
Was not clever though.
He said it.
Onto your kind Gyula son's health.
- Thank you very much.
"- Thank you very much, major lord."
"And I'm sorry, but I-I can't back out now."
Okay.
So you're just gonna live your life keeping secrets again?
- This isn't like that.
- How is it not like that?
You're keeping this from Harvey.
And Harvey kept things from Jessica.
Look at how that turned out.
"I tell Harvey now, and it's the same as if he catches me."
"The case gets tossed, and all of the people we're trying to help keep getting abused."
It's the same as before.
"No, Rachel, this is not the same as when I was a fraud."
And I'll tell you something else...
"I used to have trouble sleeping at night, but I sleep like a baby now because I am helping these people."
"I'm sorry, but that's the word that I'm keeping."
Good morning.
Hey.
Did you sleep well?
"If you consider eight hours of bliss sleeping well, then, yes, I slept very well."
But now I have to go.
- Wait.
"- Harvey, I have patients."
"I know, but..."
I wanted to get your opinion on something.
What have you done this time?
I haven't told Donna we're seeing each other yet.
Why not?
"Come on, you know my history with her."
We're working together.
I just promoted her.
"That's more an excuse than a reason, isn't it?"
I don't want to create a problem when there isn't one.
I was trying to piece together what happened that night she disappeared.
- He helped me fill in the blanks.
- What blanks?
He reminded me that I'd stopped by his dressing room during the intermission.
Reminded you?
You don't remember?
"Well, it was the first night back from the tour."
"Everything was so hectic, I..."
Did he remind you what you talked about?
Why are you taking this sarcastic tone with me?
Because it sounds like he was planting a false memory in your mind in order to come up with an alibi for himself.
An alibi?
Why would...
You think Philip killed her.
You are insane!
I can't listen to this.
I can't!
Planted memory.
Maybe we can turn it into probable cause.
"I'm warning you, doctor, if you faint, I'm not responsible."
I'll try to control myself.
"By the way, your production of Aida five years ago, one of the best nights of my life."
Lennie Briscoe took me.
Do you know how many singers I've led in that role?
"Tebaldi, Price, Milanov, Caballe."
What's this underneath the makeup?
A boil or something.
Looks like a bite mark.
- Human bite.
- That's not possible.
Don't move.
I need to take a photo.
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.
But you told Chloe.
Chloe and my sister have been helping me take care of the baby.
She's a good friend.
Excuse me.
Chase?
You wanted me to let you know when Angela woke up.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
"Kim, I'm just as confused as you are."
But all I know is that I love you.
"And I'm falling in love with Angela, too."
And I need to make this work.
Go on.
What's happening with Nina in interrogation?
They're getting something.
What?
The connection between Alvers and Nina might be deeper than we thought.
"You'd better hope she's not just spinning your wheels, because she knows how to manipulate our interrogation protocol."
Tony knows what he's doing.
"Okay, fine."
"Look, I need to get together with Chloe."
I need everything that she's got on the Amador investigation.
Not yet.
"Ryan, look, you're wasting my time."
"Now, I humored you with the physical."
"And we both know that my blood work's gonna come back with trace amounts of opiates, but enough is enough."
Rae Plachecki from the inspector general's office is here.
She wants to talk to you.
"- Well, this is not the time."
"- Actually, it is."
"You'll talk to her, then we'll evaluate whether you can go back to work or not."
It's so strange.
We've been to every hospital and he's in none of them.
It's like his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.
- Don't listen to him.
- We'll find Tony for sure.
"Yeah, we'll turn the town upside down."
Yeah.
- What're you doing?
- Thinking.
"Thinking about us in a different place, such as..."
Las Vegas with Tony.
"Seven or eleven every time, right?"
A day at the races.
All the long shots come in.
"You do have an imagination, after all."
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.
"For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them."
"If he can stack them, he can unstack them."
The gold is on display at the museum.
Protected by an impenetrable security system.
Just sitting there waiting for us to penetrate it.
Wait a minute.
Us?
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?
Professor Gannon is extremely busy being a genius.
"I own half the invention,"
"Half of Tony, that means I own half of the profits."
"So far, the return on my investment has been half of zero."
What about security.
We'd need an army to pull it off.
We'll have an army with us!
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
I want to know what your intentions are.
Excuse me?
- ln regards to Rick Sammler.
"- Well, I like him as a friend."
Are you capable of being serious?
"Karen, this is a sealed investigation."
You think I could answer a question like that?
We know he had nothing to do with conspiring to suborn judges or anyone.
You know him that well?
I want to know he's not going to be indicted.
That's not up to me.
It's up to 1 6 people who will make that decision.
- Whom you will influence.
- lf they're not prejudiced or idiots.
- Whom you will influence.
"- Karen, I... I don't want to say how much I actually like you, so I won't, but... I'm sorry."
I believe in what I do just as you believe in what you do.
"I swore an oath, which I spent a lot of years upholding, and I cannot stop now, and I wouldn't ask you to, either."
And I would completely understand if you were to walk away with those right now.
"Go home, chief."
"[Amanda] Oh, hi."
How are you?
"Well, you know, he's back there."
"My name is Ozymandias, King of kings."
"Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair."
"I'm sorry, Rick."
Truly sorry.
"And that's a word I don't say very often, believe me."
"What are you sorry for, Miles?"
And my adventures in this life won't mean anything... because you will have seduced my soul... and drawn me into your world.
"Goodbye, Tom."
Has his weight been varying much here in jail?
I don't believe so.
It's stayed about the same.
- Do you know how tall he is?
- I ain't sure.
"All right, Tom."
Step out.
Up on the scales.
What's this for?
"I'm designing your gallows, Mr. Horn."
I've got to get the weights exactly right.
"If this thing works the way I designed it... you should fall absolutely straight, stop, and make a half-turn to the right."
- Will I be alive or dead?
- When?
When I make that half-turn to the right.
You should be dead.
Nobody wants to spring the trap on you.
Mr. Julian here is designing something special for us.
The trap is water operated.
"Christ, you ain't going to drown me, are you?"
No.
You just step onto the platform... and your weight will activate a water valve... that finally springs the trap.
"All right, step back inside."
Do I spring that trap myself?
Exactly.
Makes me feel like I'm committing suicide.
"You suppose that's what I've been doing all these years, Sam?"
"Don't ask me that, Tom."
Bring the scales.
"Come on, Mr. Julian."
Oh.
"Ah, we're almost done, aren't we, cock?"
"See you, mate."
Yeah.
You know what my first act will be when I run this country?
Make threesomes compulsory?
OK.
But my second act will be to abolish five-day weather forecasts and publicly execute those who give them.
Some might say extreme.
"No, Sunday night, some guy who believes he has a personality 'cause he wears a bow tie says,"
"'It's galoshes day Monday, folks!"
'
Then this lunatic pretends to tell me the weather for the next five days.
Folks might find this useful in the planning of a week.
"Well, folks would be deceived, because by Tuesday night, bow tie has changed his forecast for two of the five nights but won't admit it."
"Your point being if it's a five-day weather forecast, how come he changes his mind every night?"
"Clearly, he can't, you know."
Kill him.
"Compassionately, but yes."
I'm sorry but um...
"What have you come as, eh?"
What's the emergency?
Where's hero-sorry-tax boy?
I just abandoned him at Parliament House.
It was unbearable.
They want him to run.
"Oh, God, strike at my vitals."
What am I doing?
This is mad.
I should go.
"Come on, I just hauled my arse halfway across town."
I'm sorry.
with seeing that side...
And then if something we cant forsee happens on those 2 shows... we still have portland 'alright' in reserve just in case.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"well what I was going to do, I was going to cover most of those songs before march of the pigs"
I was gonna coming up doing like an acoustic thing...
A middle aged more gentle approach...
to this industrial chaos.
I'm touched by that.
God thinks he's all that and a bag of chips...
That was my street theory... you know that... (?
) the other night (?
) I was doing the film Under Pressure... so why is he doing Vanilla Ice cover?
Comes to the fucking nap.
That's something I made in (?
") 1968, I was thinking (?"
) would rule.
- Is that the year it was written?
- Yeah.
I was one.
Somebody shove it up in front of me.
just trying to put that into perspective too much fucking perspective.
you kids are such agists
"Yeah, I know, I know..."
I think it'll be all right...
see you later!
"I... hurt myself today, to see if i still feel."
"I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real."
"The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting, try to kill it all away, but i remember everything."
What have i become?
My sweetest friend.
"Everyone i know, goes away in the end."
They can pilot the bloody boat.
"They can lead the damn fleet, for all I care."
But Johnnie frees the propeller.
Hmm.
You're late.
I took the liberty of ordering.
Sorry.
"We have guests staying, friends from Poland."
Things are very bad in Europe.
"It's not exactly a picnic here, if you hadn't noticed."
You can't find a decent waiter in SoHo since Italy joined the war.
"They were all rounded up as so-called enemies of the state, apart from Geppetto over there, who almost certainly is a spy."
Cerberus!
- Ugh!
"Christ, a dead sheep?"
- Ugh.
"- Not strictly ration book, but Cerberus can't live on crusts and scraps."
Ugh...
Sophie's going to boil it up and make him some broth.
Lucky fellow.
"Well, perhaps your sister would like to start feeding me, too, unless, of course, you've actually found me some work."
"So, Baker's outline for the Dunkirk film, you read it?"
It rattles along rather better than one might have expected.
Johnnie's escape from the steel thrust of the German war machine.
The rescue of the dog was very good.
"Here, boy."
Here.
"No, no."
"No, not you, Cerberus."
"Of course, it all depends on who they're planning to cast as Rose."
Uncle Frank?
"""A shipwreck of a man""?"
"So, there are 100 possible combinations."
It is really hard to guess.
But Kaan has an amazing idea...
"When the day for stealing comes, we'll arrange for Gamze to be the guard on duty."
"When Professor Fatma is in our class, you'll make your move."
I can't.
I get panic attacks.
"You will not panic, sweetheart, you will only attack."
"Professor, there is an urgent phone call for you that you have to take."
- Really?
Who could it be?
"- I don't know, professor."
I am coming right away.
Don't make any noise.
"When Professor Fatma leaves the class, I'll go next to the table and pretend to be looking at the attendance sheet."
The bag will most probably be open...
I'll get the password without anyone noticing.
- They have hung up the phone.
- I don't know professor.
Sure you don't.
When one day they come to ask for your hand... how are you to start a family and raise kids?
So irresponsible!
How are we going to get the questions from the bag?
I am answering.
A) During lunch break.
"Meaning, while there is no one in the school or the teachers' room."
Kaan and I have been watching her for the last few days.
She never goes out with that bag.
She always leaves it at school.
Meaning in the cupboard of her room.
Congratulations!
Correct answer.
No.
Nothing odd going on here.
[BEEPING]
Dr. Desmond.
"Tell me, Guardian, what part of no interruptions did you not understand?"
A G-Gnome on Sub-Level 26 reports three intruders.
-Ugh.
Did I miss a perimeter breach alert?
-No.
Then the G-Gnome's confused.
Whatever might occur in our faux lab above ground the real Cadmus is the most secure facility in D.C.
My job to keep it that way.
Fine.
Take a squad.
Might I recommend Guardian leave his G-Gnome behind?
If violence should occur....
-The little guy would be in my way.
-No.
The advantage of instant telepathic communication outweighs other concerns.
I need my G-Gnome with me at all times.
"Okay, I'm officially whelmed."
This is how they hide this massive underground facility from the world .
The real Cadmus isn't on the grid.
It generates its own power with these things.
Must be what they're bred for.
Even the name is a clue.
The Cadmus of myth created a new race by sowing dragon's teeth into the earth.
And this Cadmus creates new life too.
Let's find out why.
They call them Genomorphs.
Look at the stats on these things.
"Super-strength, telepathy, razor claws."
[ Gasps ] Or when we broke into Tom's house and we locked his girlfriend in the closet?
Wow.
We sound totally insane when you string 'em all together.
You ready for another crazy adventure?
"The crazier, the better!"
- [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ]
"So, like, normally, this is the moment where I would pound my drink and then smash it against the wall, but I'm kind of at a loss here."
- Would these help?
- [ Gasps ]
Soul mates!
"Party in the bathroom stall, y'all!"
Oh!
Isn't it great that you can still get crazy when you're a mom?
It's time to put the popular girls in their place.
"Hey, catty cheerleaders, you want some real gossip?"
Your jock boyfriends are all in love with each other.
"Ellie, I am trying to focus on my job."
"Me, too."
You think this dumb prom's gonna mock itself?
Prom is not dumb!
It's a beautiful night of magic and wonder.
"And sometimes, a poor kid's life is destroyed forever."
But that won't happen here.
"Oh, no!"
Not on my watch!
It sounds like you're working through some stuff.
I'm gonna leave you to it.
And I gotta get back to my thang.
"Hey, bet you 5 bucks that 5 years from now, that condom will still be in your pocket."
You get it.
He's not gonna ever use it.
It's not that heavy.
"Yeah, I mean, it's a top-flight policy."
So Preston is playing the savior.
And it looks like that monthly donation that Pamela makes to Preston's campaign is her disability check.
My guess is Trevor authorized that because he feels beholden to Preston.
He probably idolizes him.
So Prestons manipulating the Mills family to further his own agenda.
He's behind everything.
He took advantage of Trevor when he was weak and vulnerable.
"He gains his trust, then he brainwashes him."
Turn him into a killer.
"Uh, guys there's something else."
FBI!
Pamela Mills?
House is empty.
"He's not here, but I found this in his bedroom."
It's addressed to her.
"""The price of peace is sacrifice."
"""And I'm prepared to pay that price, no matter how high."
"I hope you'll still love me."""
This is a good-bye letter.
Or a suicide note.
He doesn't profile as suicidal.
"No, but he knows this could be his final mission."
He may want to go out in a blaze of glory.
It's all about the election.
He's only got one move left.
We need to secure Mayor Wennington.
Have the rest of the team find Hilary Ross.
Mmm.
Hello.
You have reached Hilary Ross.
Please leave a detailed message.
I always said you were my brightest student.
It worked.
All living things contain carbon.
"In fact, the term ""organic"" is often defined as"
"""containing carbon."""
"One carbon isotope present in all living forms is carbon-14, which has a half-life of 5,730 years."
"Meaning in that amount of time, half the carbon-14 of a dead organism will decay."
"By measuring the ratio of the remaining carbon-14, we can determine the life of an organic sample, such as the cloth of an Egyptian mummy, or the ashes of a caveman's fire."
Tomorrow I'll demonstrate this process in the university lab.
Hiya.
MacGyver.
Is it really you?
I think so.
"How are you, Kelly?"
I didn't think I'd see you again after you left Thera.
"What's it been, four years?"
Five.
Ah.
"This is for you, teach."
Are you finally flirting with me?
Um...
"Actually, it's a bribe."
I need your help.
Funny.
Didn't think you needed anyone's help.
You'd be surprised.
What is that?
Some kind of oxidized matter.
"Yeah, it's off an artifact Professor Atticus and I found."
"""Atlantis"" Atticus?"
"My grandfather still talks about him, none too fondly, I might add."
"Yeah, I'll bet."
But you inherited me.
You didn't... see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
"And those propeller plans that you got for me, the plans you and Emmett worked to steal."
They were fake.
Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
And I wondered -- did they even care how many people die?
This administration -- the stuff they get away with makes me sick.
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
"Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated, just think about all those...kids that died."
Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do -- all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
"The response to the polio outbreak in India,"

Where he served as a field coordinator in huddur.
"While there, he oversaw everything"
From shrapnel wounds to cancer to chronic illness.
Rufus.
"I'm surprised to see you here, of all places."
"Holland, if you'll excuse me."
I'll catch up with you later.
I need to talk to Lily.
"Rufus, what are you doing here?"
I'm sorry about today.
I don't want will to come between us.
I don't give a damn who lives where.
I just want to be with you.

"I mean, being sick hasn't slowed her down at all."
"Yeah, she is the picture of health."

Owns and built racecar tracks.
"So ever since I was a little girl, we'd go to the auto shows and, you know, he would show me about cars."
And I always pretended that...
"I mean, this was our big bonding moment all the time in the year."
"So, I get really into it, and then I realized as I got older and he'd be like, ""why don't you want to race?"""
"You know, I'd be like, ""I'm the actress."
"I'm not gonna do that,"" you know?"
"But really, I think I was just really scared, which is why today is so tough."
"So, I just was always interested in them, had an opinion a about what I liked, what I didn't like."
"So, if you know what you like in a car, what is it?"
What makes a great car to you?
I am definitely attracted to...
"We're talking aesthetics, too."
I drive a mini.
I've driven a mini.
Now I've had three minis.
And what kind of driver would you say you are in that mini?
"Yeah, I drive really aggressively."
"It's like a video game to you, right?"
"Yeah, it's tetris."
I call it tetris driving.
Oh.
[ Laughter ]
"It's basically, I love traffic-tetris driving because you have to make traffic fun."
Right.
And traffic out here is awful.
Yeah.
It's so bad.
You disappeared for a few days again and didn't even call.
What was I to do?
Who am I to you?
An empty place?
I'm sitting here in depression and you're waiting for me to serve to you!
Great King!
People who love you caught criminals!
"The people are waiting for you judgement, Solomon!"
Who are these people?
"They are your enemies, great King."
They have destroyed the new sacrifial altar that you built.
In darkness the earth trembles.
I said to them:
"""Gods, sons of the Lord!"
"You're gods but you live like humans and will fall like all the kings."""
The King has ruled to execute the criminals.
Execute them!
"You are the one who should be judged, Solomon!"
Let this execution be a lesson to everyone who dares go against the works of the great King Solomon!
Let justice be done!
It is easy to kill with other people's hands.
"Remember your fear, Solomon."
It will become your sentence.
Solomon!
Our blood is your vanity.
Today you will see us and tomorrow we will see you.
I think they deserve your mercy.
They are enemies of the state.
They believe in you.
And you make them believe in a sin.
I may forgive my enemies but not the enemies of the state.
Turn to the bureaucrats we know.
"You see something,abs?"
Beauty.
"I mean,it's tragic,but if you were to see this tableau in a museum, you'd swear it was a brilliant commentary on the human condition."
What?
Corpse staring at a tv set?
It says it all.
"Well,it doesn't say who put him there or why."
That's for us to find out.
You shaved your mustache.
I liked you with a little hair on your face.
- Still got my eyebrows.
- Good point.
"I found finn's blood, hair and fingerprints on the plastic."
So he s probably wrapped in it.
But I didn't find any other prints on the plastic or the shovel.
No chance of grabbing the gravedigger's sweat off the handle?
After being undergroun it's unlikely.
"Strange case,huh?"
I had th friend once that used to display roadkill in his living room.
- He had an nea grant... - abby.
"Um,next I analyzed the soil."
It's compost material.
Rocks and small sticks.
Thing's over an inch long.
It would indicate that it was processed through a screen.
Pretty clean for dirt.
It's a commercial product.
"But the house was just re-landscaped, so it's not surprising."
I sent the acidity levels to ducky.
I then inventoried finn's personal items.
- Got anything with a date on it?
- Nope.Sorry.
You still itching for more?
Some guys never learn.
Here's some ice off the roof.
"Beat it, you little stooge."
"Go on, tell the crumb where he stands."
I called a meeting of the barracks chiefs this morning.
I thought I could get you transferred into another barracks.
But it turns out that nobody likes you any more than we do.
"So you're stuck with me, huh?"
Maybe the Russian broads would take him.
"Not with that kisser, not anymore."
"You got off lucky last night, Sefton."
One more move and you'll wake up with your throat cut.
"You listening, Sefton?"
"Yeah, I still got one good ear."
"Now, you listen to me."
There are two guys in this barracks that know I didn't do it.
Me and the guy that did do it.
And it could be any one of you.
"You, Hoffy, or Duke, or Price or the Animal, or Blondie, or even Joey."
"And he'd better watch out, the guy that left me holding the stick."
If there's gonna be any throats cut in this barrack--
"Out, out!"
Everybody at attention for the Geneva man!
"As you were, gentlemen."
Please.
Here we have a typical barrack.
It houses 75 men.
"Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally."
Naturally.
It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
"As for the blankets, you will notice they're very warm."
I sent the acidity levels to Ducky.
I then inventoried Finn's personal items.
Got anything with a date on it?
Nope.
Sorry.
No credit card or purchase receipts.
I guess he was a cash guy.
I mean if you can call a guy with $31.71 a cash guy.
His clothes were Dockers from Sears.
No judgments.
"The shirt is a large, the shoes are off-brand."
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.
"Like you wear, Gibbs."
"You're fishin', Ab"
Are they regular boxers?
Trunks?
Bikinis?
Nothing?
"Mr. Palmer, have you finished the chromatographic analysis of his volatile fatty acid?"
"Yes, Doctor."
"Well, let's  plug the numbers into the computer and let's how long our friend has been leaking into the topsoil."
Agent Gibbs will be here soon and he will ask...
"How'd the lance corporal die, Doctor?"
"""How he died"" may take me a while."
"Try, ""When did he die?"""
That's my next question.
"That, I can answer."
It's....a......... ... tricky calculation.
"One has to factor in temperature, soil acidity, and the  variety and volume of insects who now call Lance Corporal Finn their home."
Give me a round number.
"92 days, with a three-percent margin of error."
It would appear you deserted before you died.
"We use standard fiberglass insulation, cdx subfloor."
You see something?
"Well,yeah,your joist,24 inches on center."
I wod have built them on 16.
Then you wouldn't make a profit.
That joist there look discolored to you?
Could be mold.
Mold spreads from the bottom up.
"Need a black.On it,boss."
We'll be there soon.
"Boss,abby ran the prepaid phone rd we found in finn's pocket."
Had only one call in it.
"It was to a self-storage company in dale city,virgia."
Good.Call the storage...
I did.
how ****I was just taking a breath.
I called the self-storage place.
"Finn paid for the un in cash, only signed in once, so I figured that ziva and i should probably get down therand check it out."
Sorry abouthe breath.
Kind of reminds me of pacific heights.
Don't tell me.
"-A movie -yeah,interesting plot."
Yuppie couple buys their dream house then the tenant from hell tries to destroy it.
Michael keaton's best work.
Looks like organic material.
Would a two by six match finns head injury?
Ducky thinks the blunt object hit his temple.
Or maybe his temple hit a blunt object.
Which would have landed him nose-first in th insulation.
Get a sample of this wood back to abby.
"Oh,my god!"
"Bob,why are you letting them destroy our property?"
"- Tom, cab."
- Oh!
"And if that ginger viper so much as gets her nose through the office door while we're out, you're sacked."
And don't think I won't know.
I can smell her shaving cream on the wind.
Anything else?
"Since you're so keen to flex your femininity, you can tidy up!"
I heard furniture.
"""Angels of the Sea."
Across the Waves.
Two to Dunkirk.
Three to Dunkirk.
Dunkirk or Bust.
"Busts to Dunkirk."""
Somewhere in the world there is a bullet with that man's name on.
Why hasn't he been called up?
"I mean, Parfitt's too old, but Buckley--"
Baker persuaded someone that Buckley was more use to the war effort with a typewriter.
It won't last.
"He'll end up in uniform, like every other mother's son."
"That is, if he ever had a mother."
"More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub, spawning spontaneously in the sawdust."
"You know, a lot of men are scared we won't go back into our boxes when this is all over."
It makes them belligerent.
Something's changed.
I tidied.
What happened at the meeting?
I outlined our proposed changes.
They accepted them.
- What's this?
- Lunch.
"The girls can pilot the boat home, all right?"
"- l'm telling you, I hope he does."
"- No, don't be stupid."
You know it's weird.
I always think of you as Rayanne's friend.
"I mean like, you just think of me as..."
"as someone who's just, you know, around."
"It's weird how something has to happen sometimes, , , to see how you actually feel about something,"
"Sit down, M r."
"Krakow, we're just waiting for our friends..."
from law enforcement.
Can you imagine Rickie in a high-security prison.
- Who'd supply his make up?
- Do you think it might be possible...
you not make everything into a joke.
"Angela, there is nothing to worry about."
"Harlin, this guy Tino knows, he's been busted with a gun..."
twice and nothing ever happened.
It's no big deal.
You know what I'd really like?
To be put out of my misery.
- Are you kidding?
This is fun.
- Fun?
Everyone running around all upset and rumors flying.
Can't you feel it in your fingers and your toes?
It's like being alive.
It is such a rush.
- You're out of your mind.
- Last year?
That rumor about me and Mark Hammer in the orchestra pit...
during the talent show?
"I n that case it was true, but..."
Her son was on the football team.
Good for him.
I'm not sure if it's good.
Okay.
Have you been drinking?
At work?
Of course not.
"Although, since my day has been extremely trying,"
I am gonna have a drink now.
"Yeah, well, my day has been no picnic, either, so... how about I join you?"
Sure.
Just completely infuriating how some people are... so...
Treacherous?
It's like one of-- one of our investors.
"He's-- he's one of those people that's like a-- like a virus, the kind that mutates, metastasizes into a cancer."
"Yeah, how do you get rid of people you want to get rid of?"
You redouble your efforts.
Why don't we ever do this?
What?
Drink together.
Because I'm always standing here and you're always in the kitchen.
"No, I mean-- I don't mean like that."
I mean-- why don't we ever talk?
- Aside from every day?
"- No, I mean--"
I mean really talked or... make love.
"Libby, we-- we've been married a very long time."
"Yes, we have."
God knows I'm not talking about fireworks.
"But if you were dying and you had one final moment to... look back at your whole life, at the things that mattered the most to you... what would you say about our marriage?"
"Well, we tried our best."
Both of us.
"First of all,his body wasn't found for days."
He was buried deep in the building.
That often tells us that they know each other.
Not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn them.
Because the unsub didn't realize how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
Or it's overkill.
He wanted proctor to suffer the most.
Which definitely makes it personal.
"If he knew the first victim,it's a good chance he knew them all."
We just have to find out how.
We can start by talking to tony torrell's wife.
- How you doing?
- Uh...
I'm fine.
"Uh,i'm here to see agent rossi."
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
"If someone were following me right now,"
"Do you really think they could stop me from, say, uh,"
Breaking your neck?
"If I didn't care about getting caught, that is, and..."
I don't.
"Look, I get it."
"You and the people you work with,"
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.
You'll be watching pretty little jenny
And you'll be watching pretty little me.
So maybe it'll be her.
Maybe it'll be someone else.
The important thing is is that devalos knows
About all this ahead of time.
"That way, if he doesn't step up,"
The girl I find...
Who to?
Admiral Jackson is in command of the squadron blockading Rochefort.
"Sail Defiant to Rochefort, is that what you're asking?"
"Sail her up to the squadron, alongside English men-of-war?"
"Yes, I am asking you to do that if you care for the safety of your country."
If you don't wish to see her humiliated and overrun by Frenchmen.
"- Well, what will become of us?"
- How can I promise anything?
Their lordships at the Admiralty do not encourage mutiny.
- It was never intended this way.
"- What way, then?"
A petition?
I see.
Bit late for petitions now.
"All right, we'll sail to Rochefort."
"- Lf we do, will you stand by us?"
- I'll do my best for you.
All of you.
I'll submit all the facts in your favour.
But I warn you if any harm comes to a single officer...
A single officer.
I understand.
"Very sorry you lost the arm, sir."
He's promised to speak for us when the time comes.
Can we trust him?
"What, trust an officer?"
- To hell with England!
- I've got a family back home!
I don't want Frenchmen tramping through my house.
"Sergeant, watch him."
All our lives depend on this.
"For the present, we're agreed."
It was recently brought to my attention that I am always the girl with the wry commentary and the patented eye roll.
Honest question.
Do you think I'm a cynic?
Honest answer?
Absolutely.
You're Miss Possible But Not Likely.
About my own life?
Of course.
"But watching those two, who am I to say they're not meant for each other?"
"I mean, look at them."
Have you ever seen two people look at each other like Kyle and Amanda?
Not in a while.
"Amanda, you said we need to talk."
Right.
You didn't think I meant-
Maybe a little.
After a few people weighed in.
The one time you didn't take my words literally.
Did you really think my feelings had changed?
Is that why you brought me here?
"I brought you here 'cause everyone else was making assumptions about what you wanted, and how you were feeling and what was right for you."
But no one was actually asking you.
That's why my feelings for you could never change.
Didn't know the lights out here twinkled.
Only for you.
You have no idea how disappointed I am right now!
Mom- Save your excuses!
Your flight leaves in less than two hours.
My flight- You heard me.
But you haven't heard her.
You have nothing to say in the matter!
But I do!
That is a king's caliber.
"Hey, lady."
You hurt?
You're the ringleader behind this revolt?
"You've gotten the better of me, Rear Admiral Klom."
I wasn't expecting you to reach here so quickly.
Answer the question!
Rear Admiral Klom?
"Then, this man is Crimson Fingered Claugh?"
- Depending on your answer...
"- You'll kill me, right?"
I never thought Sion needed you anyway.
You don't see the burden he bears.
You're the one who isn't qualified to serve him.
I don't need any qualifications to be at Sion's side!
"For the sake of the path he treads, I will kill Lady Noa Ehn and the hostages."
If you continue to stand in my way...
You think you can do it?
A simple matter.
No!
That power is...
"For the sake of the people of Estabul, we cannot lose this man..."
- Let there...
- We mustn't!
Froaude!
"Colonel Froaude, if you must kill the hostages to completely conquer Estabul then I'll persuade them."
"The people, the soldiers..."
I'll get them to follow Roland!
What are you saying?
I think that will be far more effective than killing the hostages and ruining Estabul's reputation.
Indeed.
You are quite popular with the people of Estabul.
"You were planning to recover the case for yourself,eh."
"Thanks,you have managed to show me where it is, my men will find it."
It is not the case that we seek.
"I don't know where it is, it fell to the bottom."
You won't get to see it.
Hold it!
Have you ever killed in cold blood?
"Go ahead, what are you waiting for?"
"Andres, no!"
Andres!
Andres!
Oh no!
The End?
Subtitled by Jose Jimenez 12/22/2011
"Nice landing, Uncle Bene."
Right on the 50-yard line.
Should've gone for a touchdown.
"Next time, I'll put it right between the goalposts."
Can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts.
That's why we arranged this little vacation.
We've been so busy establishing our community on Witch Mountain that you two haven't had an opportunity to see what life in the big city is all about.
I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf.
There'll be another time for that.
"Just remember what I told you, and have a lot of fun."
- It's locked.
- Tia?
"Tony, come back here."
"Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary."
Tia?
"If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too."
You the party I'm supposed to pick up?
"And Ágika increasingly better enthused into dreaming about the major, the major changed to increasingly more attractive one  and resembled hers father increasingly better."
Just as tall.
Just as stately.
Like that than the dad's beautiful motion
And brave and gallant!
And he does not have a purse.
He carries the paper money out in his pocket into little dumplings.
Rolls a bullet there only if it is necessary to pay
And from this everybody knows who he.
His soldiers worship it.
The reds and the partisans they take shelter in the forest crazily if they hear his name.
The reds and the partisans they take shelter in the forest crazily if they hear his name.
A hero!
- A major!
A military officer!
A military officer!
A military officer!
A military officer!
He comes.
Daddy!
For Tót family was an idea.
"They was thought that a major is tall surely, haggard,  his sword rings, his spur twangs."
They waited for a major like this
There it is.
It's him.
"Whoo, this only lieutenant."
- Mom!
- My small son!
Look at that.The Melcsó child.
- He grownes beard.
- They let him home.
Daddy.
"That's class, eh?"
Not even lost her appetite!
"The best for you, my gem."
My black gem.
I'm not a black gem.
I live like my mom did.
"In expensive clothes, in luxury, in flesh, without pleasure."
"But it would be good to find somebody that loves me, a husband, just like in real life."
"The Venom family, you know there are four of them?"
I'll make Ancient Mariners out of them.
Impressed?
Me no high school!
A black gem in the hollow of dunes.
"Cold Venom for the vultures, and a gold toothpick for my father."
That's the lineup!
Now paint the town red!
Shift asses!
Shake heads!
Hey you!
"You don't care about turning up late to my engagement, making wallpaper out of my bro?"
"Sure Martine, you're pushing it!"
"Listen, I was in pain!"
Everyone has monthlies once a month!
"- Come on, eat, drink!"
You got here at 9 like everyone else!
- You're too rough handling her!
"Hey baby bro, feet too busy spinning in your oatmeal?"
"A cheap, pathetic fuck, that's tops for you lot!"
"Princesses for Princes, and trailertrash for flunkies."
You'll never get beyond that!
"That's not about you, Prince."
"If I hadn't used my brains to work my ass off for six months, we would never have pulled the job off."
"Yeah, and who are they to say we can't carve out our slice of the American dream, huh?"
I'm a capitalist.
I don't kowtow to threats.
Fuck the evil empire.
They can't stop me from retiring at 40.
"Uh, you're past 40, Joe."
That's why they can't stop me.
( phone ringing )
( clears throat ) Joe Krutel.
"For a little guy, you've got some big balls."
"Hey, good to hear from you again."
How's the family vacay going?
None of your business.
What is your business is Vernon.
"And apparently, you didn't take care of business very well."
"- I'm sorry, come again?"
- I didn't come a first time.
You said you had Vernon under control.
Do you know he converted his endorsement money into ownership in a grow house?
Ownership?
"That's something I know something about, Joe."
"Uh, I have no idea why they think that would be okay."
It's totally unacceptable.
"I appreciate your concurrence, Joe."
Tell your client I'm cutting him.
"Boys, knock it off!"
( gasps )
Hey.
( clears throat )
I'm gonna share something with you and I hope you will be as supportive of me as I've been of you this morning.
Kisan Teague has the kind of talent that can take our offense over the top and finally turn the negativity around.
- I'm listening.
We'll come and get you when we're done.
It's Jesse.
Just-- just please try to be careful.
Some of this stuff is really valuable.
Yeah?
Hope it's bulletproof.
"Come on, Schmidt."
Open up.
"Come on, come on, come on."
"Bad news, Sam."
"When I was picking up rounds, I paid a neighborhood kid to ride his bike by Maddy's house, just to make sure everything was okay."
He said the garden rake's propped up against the garage.
She gave the meeting signal?
Why'd she give the meeting signal?
"I don't know, Sam."
It's a rake.
It didn't come with subtitles.
"If you think someone might be following you, the temptation is to drive erratically."
"It may force the tail to reveal itself, but it also reveals you're onto them."
A better approach is to drive very conservatively.
Go below the speed limit and linger at stop signs.
"You won't win any fans on the road, but it'll help you lose your tail."
"If they think you're simply an overcautious driver, it'll catch them off guard when you suddenly take a risk."
"Oh, thank -- thank God."
I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
"Well, we, uh..."
we've been busy.
We got the signal late.
Yeah.
That's the problem with communicating by garden tools.
What's going on?
Olivia Riley paid me a visit.
A kidnap?
!
"What are you, the cockney Al-Qaeda?"
"Don't shit yourself, we're going for a drive."
"- Hello, mate!"
"- Come on, is this really necessary?"
What about my allergies?
!
Let's talk about this.
Please!
My allergies!
"Wasn't expecting that, was you, mastermind?"
!
See you tomorrow!
Institutionalised bullying wasn't quite the work experience I had in mind.
But I knew how to deal with bullies.
I got my mum to tell the teacher.
"I was hoping you'd be able to do something about it, Mr Gilbert."
- I'm sorry.
- I just wonder what he said to them.
"- I don't think he said anything, Kevin."
- He must have said something.
He walked back through the town centre sopping wet and barely clothed.
I'd hoped you'd take this more seriously.
"He wrote to the paper especially to get work experience, and instead I'm picking frogspawn out of his underpants."
Would you excuse me just for a second?
Ooooooooh God!
"Look,"
"I really want to help, but it's not my responsability."
"I will ask if they'll consider swapping students, but I can't promise anything."
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I do have a meeting to attend to."
What a pickle!
Those people from the reformatory
Just fill their time doing that
What's that?
You'll see
What I've dreamed of all my life
A color TV
I'm so happy son!
"Grandma, you should also let Catalina enjoy it"
It should have costed you lots of money
You don't worry about that
"Business are going really fine don't you agree, Angela?"
Yes
Specially the plums exporting business
They're here
Let's go get them
C'mon
"Get down, bastard"
"Hey you, get down, fast!"
Don't move
Let's go
"Come on, let's go"
Let's turn around
- Are you crazy?
"Yes Meca, turn around"
"Come back, let's go fast let's go"
She shot him
Not at such a distance
Yes she did and I don't want deads behind me
Don't say bullshit Nobody has killed anybody
I told you that she would bring complications
But you know what we're doing
"If you're interested OK if you aren't, you know"
"Running works, okay?"
"I learned at a very early age, you don't try to be the hero."
"Okay, I ran from bullies, I ran from cops,"
I ran from feelings.
"Okay, I have very good survival instincts."
"If it wasn't for those, I would have been moshed to death at the warped tour."
"Okay, survival instincts, yeah, all right."
What are you supposed to do when there's a tornado coming?
Run.
Where?
Away.
"No, you're supposed to go into the basement."
Wha... go to the basement?
Where the laundry is?
"What am I, gonna do a load of whites?"
"All right, well what about if there's an earthquake?"
Run.
"Again, with the running."
"You know, it's times like this where you really see someone's true colors."
Is that a song?
"No, it's a real emotion, Whitney, all right?"
"You know that we're in a relationship, right?"
"We're supposed to be together, we're supposed to be a team."
"Yes, we're on a team."
"It's called ""team stay alive."""
"Okay, teammate, can you tell me one situation where your first thought wouldn't be to run?"
I guess if I had a bomb strapped to me.
Thatwhen you'd stay with me?
"Come on, man, let it out."
What you feeling?
"Mark, I don't..."
"Dude, for the last time, don't tell me, tell her."
- That's where Daddy is.
"- Allie, she is so much better."
She's finally on the right combination of meds.
She is seeing a shrink that we adore.
So then why didn't you tell me that she was coming home?
- Because I knew you wouldn't come.
"- Yeah, but you knew I was bringing Luke."
"- I'm telling you, Allie, she's healthy."
- Really?
"When healthy people come home, you don't usually remove the doors."
"- Okay, she's better."
- Until she's not.
"- If you'd gone to see her, you'd know."
- What am I supposed to tell Luke?
- He doesn't...
- You don't have to tell Luke anything.
"We'll just have a nice, stress-free dinner."
"This is a huge transition for her, coming home."
"Please, just don't stress her out."
I just wanted him to see we could be a normal family for five minutes.
"Well, that's about how much time you've got."
Hey.
"Hey, so are all the doors in the door shop?"
Because they're all off their hinges.
That's not the only thing that's off its hinges.
"Oh, I think I hear Daddy."
"Okay, okay, there's no way I'm staying in your room."
"There are no doors, except the bathroom, but that doesn't have a knob."
"You can't lock it, and there's a hole, so anyone can see inside."
How am I supposed to go to the bathroom?
"Trust me, that is the least of our problems."
It's kind of a big problem for me.
[Tires screech]
[Train whistle blares]
What else did she tell you about this cat?
Anything?
"Just that Adalind brought it in, and it scratched her."
And she wouldn't believe anything I said about Adalind.
That's why I brought her to the trailer.
That's why I brought her to you.
"Okay, I get it."
"But I got to tell you, it was a little on the short side for a warning."
- When did she get scratched?
- Today.
"Look, Nick, I know you're hoping the doctors are going to be able to do something for her, but you saw what happened to Hank, you saw what happened to your sergeant."
"We got to get our hands on that cat, man."
- Detective Burkhardt?
- Yeah?
We have her stabilized.
"If this is an infectious disease, she'll need to stay quarantined."
"Normally, cat scratches are not that dangerous, so there may be something else going on here."
The tests are going to take quite a while to run.
There's nothing more you can do right now.
I suggest you go home.
"As soon as we know something, we'll call you."
"Look, Nick,"
I know you want to stay here and be with Juliette.
I do.
But that's not going to help.
Let's find that cat.
All right.
[Cell phone rings]
- Yeah.
- Nick.
- But -
"Yeah, but we've had this conversation."
Yes?
Mmm.
Why aren't you having any?
There's only enough bacon for one.
You have it.
"Hands and knees, Pat."
I'm waiting.
I'm begging you to help me.
"After you gave David the all-clear, he went down the recruitment office to find out about signing up."
"When the time comes, they'll give him a medical and if they find anything relating to asthma, they won't take him."
Tell them he's got it.
David is a young man -
- He's not a young man!
He's a boy!
A 16-year-old child.
I understand how you must be feeling.
You have two daughters who'll never see action!
You can't possibly understand how I'm feeling.
All I'm asking is you write to the recruitment office and tell them that David has a history of chronic asthma.
"But, Miriam, he doesn't."
"It's acute at best and has, thankfully, been on the wane for a number of years."
They don't need to know that!
- That's quite enough!
"With all due respect, Erica, this is between me and Dr Campbell."
Will has looked after your family for many years.
"He has great affection for you all, but you're asking him to commit a malpractice."
He can't possibly do that.
I sympathise.
I really do.
But you'll do nothing.
They've been muttering that for years.
One day they'll stop muttering and go.
That's why we need city land for BankExchange.
"- No argument, Lenny."
- And a subway stop.
And an off-ramp from the expressway.
The city's $25 billion in debt.
We're in no position to build off-ramps.
"3,000 workers, you don't want to build a subway stop?"
What's your interest in this?
Did you buy a few options around the city property?
Of course he did.
So did every other developer in town.
"Notwithstanding that, Mr. Deputy Mayor if you don't transport their employees BankExchange will dump this deal and forget about New York and put up their 60-story building in New Jersey instead."
So be it.
"The mayor loves BankExchange, but can't afford infrastructure."
You're flying in the face of real politics.
Subways get people to jobs.
Jobs mean votes.
I thought John Pappas liked votes.
"He loves votes, Frank."
But no infrastructure.
Much as the city approves of a subway station and off-ramp it can't pay for them.
- Where are you going?
- I have an appointment in Manhattan.
This meeting's over?
I heard you say no.
Can I offer you a ride?
"No, thanks."
I make it quicker on the train.
Here he comes.
Judge Stern!
"- hello, alberto CoIombo."
- Borghetti.
You wanted to see me?
I'd Iike to check a few details on yourtransfer application.
would you Iike help?
"It's kids, always slashing the tires."
please sit down.
What can I do foryou?
How long have you been disabled?
It's not easy to talk about.
I was very young.
The memory is blurred.
It's terrible to relive that trauma.
muscle spasms.
Done.
"please, go on."
There are two transfer applications in yourname.
A recent one for a person with reduced mobility and another six months ago in which the applicant is normal.
Are you the same person?
They're both mine.
I did the one as a healthy person... because I wanted my application to be considered like all the others.
"It's important to see in a ""normal"" person's eyes something otherthan pity."
- That's quite honorable.
- Thank you.
But if this compromises my transfer...
"It's a simple but necessary check, because often people make false statements to get a position in milan."
It happens very often.
It's shameful.
"But that's not your case, you'II be fine in milan."
Thank you.
I won't botheryou any further.
No bother at all.
You think some old guy's digging up bodies to get their medals?
"He'd know where they were buried,right?"
"- Silver stars,Korean war?"
"- Yeah,yeah."
"Look,forgotten warriors on the east grounds near the family plot."
I got to go back inside.I never wear the right clothes.
Thanks for meeting us.
Doesn't look like anything's been touched.
Maybe he got the medal from somewhere else.
Didn't you say that the cops suspected Petty stole his mines from Presidio back in '60?
"Yeah,and they never found his stash."
Searched all the tunnels and cellars.
No luck.
Or maybe he hid them where he knew no one would look.
W-w-warm in here.It's nice.
What's next?
Crumpets?
How's that?
Feel like a new man.
"Now that's how you treat someone you want something from,Warden."
"Glad you approve,son."
But I've heard about the mind games in here.
**********
What have you heard?
I'm not taking these pills.
"They're not pills,Mr.Petty.Those are mints."
I drugged your tea.
Just a mild sedative to help you relax.An anesthetic.
You were only 18 when you joined the marines.Is that right?
I'm not talking to you.
"You served for the fighting 15th, were part of the Chosin Reservoir battle,the bloodiest of the war."
14 silver stars were awarded to the veterans of the Chosin Reservoir battle.
"From then on,any time he was in town, he was with me."
How often did you see him?
He would come and go a lot.
But I understood.
That's how it is with special ops.
Lance corporal finn's record does not indicate he was involved with special operations.
He said his missions were top secret.
"He wanted to tell me more, but he didn't want to put me in danger."
When'd you last see lance corporal finn?
Six months ago.
Before he left for iraq.
- How'd you meet?
- At a bar.
Two years ago.
"I was there with some girlfriends, and when I got up to go to the ladies' room, he blocked my path, said he couldn't keep his eyes off me."
And that worked?
"What worked is that when we talked, he had something to say."
"Most guys won't shut up about their online war games, but this guy,he had seen real action."
"And I was feeling patriotic that night, so I invited him to come home with me."
The sex was fantastic.
When did you two get enged?
About a week before he left.
"James wanted to borrow $30,000."
Did he tell you what the money was for?
Gambling debts.
"And if he didn't pay,they were gonna hurt him."
Who?
He said it was better if I didn't know.
Because of the danger.
"Look,didn't give him the money."
I loaned it to him.
So you drew up a gal document?
It's just busy.
"Los Angeles in January, San Francisco..."
"Powell's in Portland, the whole West Coast thing, really."
I'm told to expect big things out there.
- You sound like you're bragging.
- That's because I am bragging.
And you're doing a really hurtful job of sounding unfazed.
And do you know why that is?
Because you're not pretending.
"You're not interested in this or me, not even a little."
- Why would you say that?
- Because you never believed in me.
- And you don't now.
"- Well, good for you."
"No, not good for me."
Great for me.
"You know, you told me many times, now that I think about it, actually, that my goals were unreasonable and foolhardy."
Am I recalling this correctly?
"That my dream, the only dream I've had since I was 14 years old, to write and publish a novel of my own, wasn't something I could just reach out and have."
"Hard work, you tell me."
"Years of working up from the bottom, you tell me."
"Well, you know something?"
You were wrong.
"Dead wrong, actually."
About me and everything.
This was for you.
It's an advance copy.
I'd even written a little note on the dedication page and everything.
But you know something?
You don't support me and you never did.
So you don't get this gift from me.
"Not today, not ever."
Objection!
"Your Honour, my client's future rests on the testimony of this man and this man only."
I'll allow it.
"But no fishing expeditions, Mr Greene."
Your Honour.
"Mr Shrimpton, you said you know my client."
I've seen him around.
Did he ever give you money?
Yeah.
"Yeah, once he did."
"He helped a lot of homeless people, didn't he?"
"He used to come around, paint us, give out cash."
"In fact, he gave away thousands of dollars, didn't he?"
Fair bit.
"It was you who led my client to the lane that night, wasn't it?"
He said he wanted to paint him.
"Because you told Denny, and I quote,"
'Benny's an effing little Adonis.'
"Yeah, I don't remember me exact words."
Had you had oral sex yourself with Ben Rigby that evening?
"Come on, Mr Shrimpton."
Maybe a brief but therapeutic tryst up a back lane?
"Yeah, but, you know, just a quick one."
Take comfort.
Premature ejaculation's not on trial here.
"Listen, pal, I seen that sick bastard there whack that poor little kiddie."
And yet you did nothing to stop him.
"Went and got help, didn't I?"
Maybe you went and got an alibi.
"See, I'm at a bit of a loss, Mr Shrimpton."
"You say my client kills the boy he's gone to give money to and then instead of bolting, he drags his body 30m down a lane, and then hangs around for 15 minutes."
Why would he do that?
"Idiot, they must be looking for us."
In one or two days...
Until then we'll have to put it somewhere no one can see.
"I have an idea, What?"
"This is gas, Why did you put it in here?"
See nobody can see it here.
"This car is here for sale, what if somebody comes to buy it?"
"Nobody came to buy it for seven months, who will come now..."
A man's death and another woman over a woman.
"Once catches up with you, it never lets go."
And Yadav's death is catching up to him.
Kill him.
Who shall we send?
"After Heera's murder, Police in Pondi is alert."
I've heard that you have a vacancy for a shooter.
Give my son a chance to do a murder.
I want him to get settled before I'm dead.
His career gets developed.
Give this target to my Laxmi.
I'll do my best.
Give me one chance.
"And if he fails this time, he's not of one father, I tell you."
A sparkling rose and loose motion never stays forever.
This time I'm sure that Laxminarayan will come back with job done.
"Bhai, I won't forget your kindness."
Bullet will go off so neatly even you won't be able to notice.
But who's the target?
"Poets have poetry, walls have ears."
Leave for Pondi.
Your room will be booked in blue diamond hotel.
You'll get a envelope there.
Whoever's address and photo is in the envelope.
"I repeat, top secret."
KIRBY:
Colonel Cai.
- How was Saigon?
- Very interesting.
I attended a meeting with the premier and his staff.
The main subject was General Pham Son Ti.
He has assumed command of the entire Viet Cong forces in the south.
Which makes him Number One!
Affirmative.
And it could mean a major offensive.
I had my hands on him the last time I was out here.
"But because of political pressure, I had to turn him loose."
Like to get your hands on him again?
Who wouldn't?
"But if I know General Ti, he's surrounded by a regiment."
- My people think several.
- That brings us up to the plan.
He's somewhere in Hang Phau Valley.
"Surrounded by the regiments you mentioned, which makes a capture impossible."
Precisely.
Except for one woman and a certain hand-picked team.
"Go on, colonel."
This is the rat.
And this is the trap.
My father was a simple man.
"All he wanted was to be free his wife to love, and his children to raise."
He tried to remain neutral.
That was his mistake.
What he didn't realize was that man has to pay a price for that freedom.
"Therefore, he suffered the ultimate penalty."
Since that day I've lived but with one thought:
"Nothing with a new girlfriend, no hint that he might be in trouble, or where he might be hiding."
He has quite the fan base.
"Yeah, over 100,000 followers."
Some of these photographs went viral before he became known as an eSports star.
"Over 10,000 shares."
What's so special about that one?
(phone chiming)
Shinwell.
He wants me to meet him first thing in the morning.
You should turn in for the night.
- We're done here.
- What?
Just like that?
"Well, you're fatigued, or else you would've noticed."
"Not only did Tendu's most popular selfie likely motivate the attempt on his life, but the comments section has also given us a promising suspect."
"Ms. Lundquist, you promised your client would come in on her own recognizance."
I could send a couple of detectives.
"I'm sorry, Raina will be here."
"And you'll see, she has nothing to do with whatever this is."
She's a good person.
Can a fanatic be a good person?
"In my experience, the answer's almost always no."
She's not a fanatic.
She's... devoted.
Makes it hard for her to keep a schedule sometimes.
Hi.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
I forgot to charge my car last night.
"Hi, hi."
"I am so, so glad that you granted my request for this meeting."
I will kill him if he is seen again.
Send him away from here immediately.
Fine sir..
- Jai..
Coming Vasu
Good Morning madam
Good Morning Karthik.
How are you?
Where are you going quickly Mr. Muthyam?
New sites have come from Pune and I need to show them to Sir.
You said sites and why are there items here?
So are these what you show to Sir daily in the name of sites?
"No sir, these are the sales girls selling us the sites."
"They are not like sales girls, but look very indecent."
"Be quiet, you always get such waste doubts."
"Mr Macha, you please leave."
Not that madam..
- You please leave!
Thank you madam..
"They look a bit peculiar as said by Ratnam sir, madam"
"Looking at this, may be what they wrote in the magazines too is true."
Mr Ratnam!
I ate the salt of your father.
I cannot bear when something is going wrong.
"What is your intention, Ratnam sir?"
Do you doubt that those are not spouses and sir himself has set them up for acting?
"I was into a confusion till now, but it is now confirmed."
Doubt No. 1:
Some fellow had come called sir as brother-in-law.
Doubt No. 2:
"When she was hit, sir is shivering with anger."
Doubt No. 3:
There's not a day that goes by that I don't feel terrible about losing your boy.
But that's on me.
"So if you want revenge, then just shoot me."
You think I blame you for Kevin's death?
Sending those men in was the most courageous thing..
you ever did in your life.
You were a true commander in chief for five minutes.
You just don't have the balls to see the mission through.
What mission?
There were no nuclear weapons in Iran.
But there will be.
The Middle East is our last war.
It will be us or them.
I choose that Kevin Charles Walker will be the last American soldier..
to die in that conflict in vain.
You want that as your son's legacy?
Murdering millions of people in his name?
"Mr. President, I wish the pen were mightier than the sword, I do."
But it's just a dream.
"Stand up, sir."
History will judge who the true patriots were here today.
"I've been standing up, Martin, and I'm not gonna open that."
Martin.
"Martin, that's not necessary."
Martin!
How about now?
I can't open this for him.
"If I do, millions of people are gonna die, you understand that?"
I understand.
Goddamn it!
"Tyler, what the hell is going on?"
We got thermal alarms going off in the second floor dining room..
Paa.
- After a fashion.
- Paa...
Do you think maybe she recognizes that I'm Roland's father?
And that's what all the speaking and gestures are about?
It seems to be some form of primitive language.
- Pa.
"- Well, we know she had a father at some point."
It appears so.
- (indistinct conversations)
- I've been expecting your call.
You have?
You don't seem the type of person who's comfortable with unanswered questions.
I want you to keep looking for his parents.
"Well, in fact,"
"I've carried on with my search, anticipating this very thing."
So you have something?
Please tell me it's not a mother pining for her lost child.
Not exactly.
"After her parents died,"
I found out that Joanne Perly left Stratford.
But the trail went cold after that.
So I checked into Mr. Braxton.
It seems he left England for the bright lights of Brantford.
"There, he met and married Joanne."
How did they get Roland?
The woman I think was Roland's mother lived out of town on a homestead.
She went into labour earlier than her time.
"There were complications, and she died."
What happened to Roland?
The rural midwife was the only person present.
She reported that the baby was never delivered.
"A once in a lifetime, down and dirty, secret,"
"Prohibition party, in our old so humble ground."
- A what party?
"- A prohibition party, a speakeasy."
Here is how it's gonna work.
"Upstairs, there's gonna be the authority pleasing Great Gatsby party."
"Downstairs, will be a delightful, delicious,"
- Den of inequity.
- You've heard of the 18th amendment?
"You know, alcohol was illegal in the 20s."
Is that why they call it the Great Depression?
"This is absurd, Lizzi is never going to allow a speak-easy."
- Lizzi's never going to know about it.
- Where are we having this party?
What respectable fraternity is ever going to agree to this risk.
It's already arranged.
We're doing it in the KT house.
I still have aches from the last time we partied with them.
Score baby.
I can't believe Casey's endorsing a secret party.
Those girls are super hot.
Rebecca Logan is the hottest.
"Gentleman, please, come on."
Let's respect the ladies and try to stay on point here.
Who here is with me?
It's gonna be awesome.
We'll wear flapper dresses and garter belts.
So we throw this dangerous party.
What do we do if Lizzi finds out about the secret room?
We could loose our social calendar.
What?
That's not acceptable.
Go get on your flight.
"Ma'am, get over here!"
"Why are you trying to feed infants?"""
"Anyways, that's my airport jaunt."
"If you think Jesus was white, you're not allowed to have an opinion on gun control."
Not everyone's gonna agree.
"We know now, more than ever, education's expensive."
"Also some people in the crowd are like, ""But Jesus was white."""
And you're doing the best.
I want to live like that.
I can't.
I gotta be up here.
I gotta look into it.
"All I'm saying is, if you guys want real change, you gotta limit some people's ability to vote."
I know.
I know.
I know.
It doesn't sound progressive.
Neither does genocide.
People hate genocide.
Why?
Because it's been used horrifically every single time it's been used throughout history?
That doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing.
"If I told you guys tomorrow that we were gonna round up all of the racist, homophobic people and kill them, you're telling me all the smart people wouldn't be like..."
"""Well, shit, we haven't tried that version."
"That might actually have an impact."""
Maybe it's not based on skin color or religion.
"Maybe it's just, ""Who's the dick?"
Get him out.
"Get him out of here."""
Lump in global warming deniers.
Let's clean house.
Why are you asking all this?
It's strange.
"The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl."
"And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil it isn't likely he would fall from a window."
"Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found."
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.
No.
My hunch....
My opinion he was killed by a very powerful man:
point one.
"And the fracturing of his skull: point two plus the various other things we mentioned would make it very probable probable, not certain that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window."
"But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?"
It could be one way.
If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned.
"Judas Priest, just a second."
The servants?
They have visitors?
Not at all.
"You were expecting a package that day, some delivery?"
Not that I know of.
"Groceries, cleaning...a package?"
I really wouldn't know.
Karl takes care of all that.
I see.
Would you like to ask him?
"No, never mind, it's it's very remote."
"No, never mind."
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
That's cute.
"Your daughter, she's the artist?"
Thank you.
I think today would count...as one.
You know what I think she would like even more... is to see you wear it.
I couldn't possibly take it...
"Be careful, be careful this won't heal if you move around too much."
"If you want to help, tell me about that prison."
What kind of security do they have?
"Are there force fields, detection grids, physical barriers?"
"Yes, all of it."
What about guards?
Lots of guards.
The Mokra make a big show of it... always bragging about how no one has ever escaped.
Listen to me...
I can't bring you to the prison with me.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not afraid.
And that could get both of us killed.
You have to stay here.
If I stay here I can't bring the letters.
Letters...to the prison?
Letters.
Don't you remember how we used to write to her together?
Here they are.
I still write them... every week since she's been gone.
I've always known that one day
I'd be able to...
to give them to her.
I've never forgotten.
These are all to your wife?
How long has it been?
My last letter... my last letter's not... it's not here.
"Oh, I wrote it three days ago, butit's...is not..."
"I can't let her think I've stopped writing... that I gave up hope only, only days before..."
"Even if his prohibition is removed, my store is off limits!"
But who is this Unni?
Is she a doctor from the medical team from Korea?
She is!
That ethanol scent!
Who is she?
She is a full-time emergency relief team nurse assigned from Peace Maker.
It seems she works part-time in the hardware store.
"Ah, she does a meaningful job, which doesn't give much money."
"I'm doing it because it's fun, and you don't need money."
"But then Oppa, are you a fortune teller?"
How did you know my full-time and part-time job?
"I think I heard it from Daniel, about his Korean-Russian wife."
"What do you mean ""wife""?"
We're just comrades.
But what did you come here to buy?
There's everything except Daniel.
Can we use the wifi?
Wifi?
"Let's see, the fi is..."
Are you sure that the wifi works here?
"If you search thoroughly, I'm sure they will even have missiles."
Wait here after you finish your business.
It'll just be one hour.
I'll leave the doctor here for a moment.
Don't fight.
She has a gun.
Excuse me.
Don't worry.
I'm definitely sure there's a modem around here somewhere.
"On Friday at 0900, we apprehended two men who are assumed to be black market dealers, and passed them over to the authorities."
Report complete.
Don't worry about it.
"There's, uh, one more thing."
"Garcia, she asked me about a week ago, who the godparents were gonna be, as in, hello, like I'm right here, like right in front of you."
"She'll be wonderful, but I have a few folks on my side of the aisle lobbying for the same position."
"Oh, Lord."
"So what are we doing, godparenting by committee?"
May have to be.
Derek!
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
Some men reach high peaks to leave an indelible memory.
Most of us are content to push forward.
And very few are born to become king.
"Small that camera, is not it?"
"- It's modern technology, Your Majesty."
It's amazing that you can make movies with such a small device.
How big is your team?
- I'm the team.
There's only me.
You're perfect.
"We'll have a nice portrait of you, do not worry."
But you're so tired.
"Sire, allow me, your speech."
Mr Moreau?
- Mr. Lloyd?
I should arrange the microphone at His Majesty.
Of course.
The documentary Our king must point out the king's competence
And his professional commitment.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
And he must grasp his vitality and spontaneity.
Controlled spontaneity.
Let's see.
Here it is.
- Have you talked to her?
"- No, and don't go on about it."
"Good-bye, Lydia."
You have to be patient with him.
Work hard.
"""Shrinking Lover."""
Rosa's got the flu.
I hope she didn't give it to you.
I'm glad you're feeling well.
"Even so, I'll give you a massage, and a rubdown with rosemary alcohol."
"No, I'm all right."
Last night I saw a film... that disturbed me.
"It was a love story, between Alfredo, who's a bit overweight, like me, but a nice guy,"
"and Amparo, his girlfriend, who's a scientist."
Amparo is working on an experimental diet formula that will revolutionize the world of nutrition.
"""You're selfish."
"You only think of yourself."""
"""I've got it!"""
"""It could be dangerous."
"I still haven't tested it on humans."""
"""Do you still think I'm selfish?"""
"""It's done wonders for you!"""
"""Don't worry, my love!"""
"""I'll find the antidote!"""
But time went by.
"Despite her efforts, Amparo couldn't find the antidote and poor Alfredo was shrinking daily."
"""I'll always love you."""
"To stop her suffering, Alfredo left."
"He abandoned Madrid and went back to his mother whom he hadn't seen in 10 years, because she was terrible."
He hadn't even told Amparo where she lived.
I may have caused.
I really didn't come off professional
Or right the first time we met and i'm very sorry.
Michelle and i have had a long conversation about this
And we've got things straight between us.
We are a couple
And now i think it's time that you two get things straight.
Michelle is here to offer you your job back.
"Yes, regina, you can have your job back if you want it."
"- I mean, you two have worked so hard..."
- Regina: no no no no no.
Let's get this straight...
I have worked very hard.
"Oh, regina, right now the power"
Of life and death is in that tongue of yours.
Now don't choose death again.
"Choose life, dummy."
"I got this, mama."
Could we have just a minute?
- We'll be right back.
- Certainly.
"Regina, we're in a recession"
And your bank account is depleted to the point that it's inside out.
"Now if you won't listen to a bible verse,"
Will you please at least listen to a famous movie one?
"""Stupid is as stupid does,"""
And right now you're behaving very stupid.
Now get over there and get your job back
And save this house.
- Michelle.
- Michelle: yes?
Can i think about this?
I don't know.
I don't know.
They're probably not gonna pick me.
"Don't give up hope, Riley."
You never know.
"Hey, what's Connor doin'?"
Connor.
What's goin' on?
"Everything's fine, I'm just gonna go around to the back."
"Hey, player, I have one for you."
"So, a cop shows up to a crime scene, and a citizen shows up and says, officer, officer, quick, there is a hundred minorities and a plumber that really need your help, and um..."
"And the cop says, oh no, we should help the plumber, and the citizen says, see, cops never care about the minorities."
"Wait, is that right?"
Okay.
"A citizen runs up to a cop and says a hundred minorities and a plumber need your help, the cop says, why the plumber?"
"Then the citizen says, see, the cops never ask about the minorities."
Damn it.
"He just forgot all the important parts, right."
"Fucking cops hate minorities, man."
"Dude, I got pulled over for tinted windows once."
Hate the po po.
I'm in hell.
What are you doing?
Just being safe.
There's no one in the house.
You sure about that?
"I mean, you never know."
"No, our whole job depends on being sure."
You should always know.
How long did you monitor the owner's pattern?
"I know the plans say he won't be back for a few weeks, but how long did you monitor his routine?"
"Like, two-"
"You are such a miser man,"
Calvin Kline didn't made underwear like this.
"Don't speak in public, This man... gave me electric shocks."
If electricity gone then hits me on inverter.
"You don't cry, you just ask him."
Tell him about Sunday.
This Sunday or last Sunday?
"Shut up you question answer, speak straight, Pinto!"
"Don't be angry, You don't interfere, Batla Bhai!"
You're like my younger son.
"That's why I am telling you, Who killed your Hira Lal?"
"We killed him, Now that Hira Lal... where he's gone to hide that diamond?"
How do I know?
"You tell me,"
"You must know little little, Your memory has gone week,"
"Which Diamond, which car, she was that car."
Papa!
These two are the same.
"Speak, Where is the diamond?"
"I don't know, very good Chandu, don't tell them, no matter what you lost your life, but don't tell them."
Chandu!
Where is the diamond?
"Stupid, what are you doing, tell them it's in the petrol tank,"
In petrol tank?
"Diamond is mine, diamond is mine."
I bought the car then diamond is mine.
"I came here to buy car, diamond is mine, I have a Gun."
"So diamond is mine, Papa."
"But petrol tank is not opening, Then how could we get the diamond?"
"Ok, all you people turn it down,"
What are you doing?
Vomit!
She's got more confidence in me than I have in my...
"Larry, you stopped and spoke to her?"
We chatted a while.
You chatted a while.
Yes.
"Larry, I resign from the Waterhouse account."
You...
You resign?
What are you talking about?
I will not accept any job that my wife got for me.
You got this job because you're the best man for it.
That's not the point.
Any success I make I'm going to make on my own or not at all.
Samantha.
"Now, you listen to me."
I have had it with your magic and spells.
Now be quiet.
I'm not finished yet.
"I've had it up to here with all your witchcraft turning me into a werewolf, into a chimpanzee!"
"I'm not through yet, Sam."
"Just to prove that I have had it, I am going to blow this account."
Do you hear me?
I'm gonna blow the account!
What do you think of that?
Is this 555-7328?
"Look, I'll have to make this fast."
Mr. Waterhouse is outside.
"Before you meet him, I want to brief you..."
- I don't need any briefing.
"- Darrin, Waterhouse is a very conservative man."
He's been making thumbtacks since 1888 and he doesn't go for this modern hoopla.
I don't know why he decided to change agencies and come with us but take a tip from me and play it sincere and conservative.
I gave my daughter.
My mother told me that was the worst mistake I ever made.
Is a terrible thing what he said.
If I were your mother
I would be very proud of you.
"Alice, long time was a lost soul."
I did not know who he was.
"One night a drunk date party and went into a dark room, and I let a stranger me cogiera until disappeared."
"There were no names or faces, only touch."
"Sometimes when you're lost, when you're totally lost,"
It is when you you find yourself.
Darkens the eyes of all and write up jobs.
"Plumber, IT consultant, Mrs. cleaning, accountant ..."
Dolly in part front and in the middle.
"""Queen of the swingers"" or something like that."
The final at the hotel is the icing on the cake.
You go there as a couple and takes all photos.
"Orgies, ugly, sex anal ... all those weird."
Do not.
"What do you mean ""no""?"
Much time and money
She has been invested in this.
We're about to print.
"If I do this, I will my way by myself."
"Alice, could talk at least?"
Where are you going now?
I have to finish my story.
"You like stories, right?"
"What's what you want from me, Alice?"
It's very simple.
Are we going to stay together and grow old despite all this shit or not?
"Because if not, then we are losing time."
All that stuff we put on the table just now?
"Let's talk about it later, okay?"
"Right, yeah."
That's probably a good idea.
When the power's back on and we're not sitting in rubble.
I'm gonna call Kirsten and Sandy.
Where's my jacket?
Gross.
Sorry.
"You know, I've actually stockpiled some rudimentary supplies in case of, you know, the apocalypse or whatever."
Got all sorts of stuff in there.
Got extra tennis shoes and flashlights and canned goods.
A space heater.
-And an extra pair of....
-I'm not--
"Hey, couldn't get reception in here."
I'm gonna step out in the hall.
Okay.
Okay.
"Yes, Orange County, as you've probably figured out, that was an earthquake."
"So far, no reports of fatalities."
"But power is out, cell lines are jammed and the roads are for emergency vehicles only."
"As more information comes in, we 'll relay it to you."
"So if you're safe, stay calm and stay put."
"So we got our marching orders, or our staying-put orders."
So no one' s to leave the plaza unless they have to.
What are we gonna do with everyone?
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.
-What about looters?
-We just have to get organized.
"So keep the radio on, gather up anything you think might be useful."
Try and rest.
"You know, Nathan, the dying have taught me one thing... that you can look death in the face and go on living."
Our mission here is to keep them company.
Keep company with those about to die so that they can depart in peace.
"Great, but what's it got to do with me?"
"Me, my."
"My little consciousness, my little comforts, my little life."
"What about others, Nathan, do you ever think about them?"
And Dennis?
Have you thought about Dennis?
"If you knew he was going to blow his brains out, why didn't you do something?"
Why didn't you try to listen to him?
"Who kept Dennis company so he'd ""depart in peace?"""
"Anyway, how did you know he was going to die?"
"This time I want an answer, none of your..."
- I saw it.
- You saw it?
- Yes.
- How did you see it?
Was it written on his face?
- Yes.
- Yes?
"Listen, I'm beat."
"I didn't sleep last night because of you,"
- and I've got to be at work...
"- Nathan, people who come here, they've already traveled a long road paved with suffering."
But they have had time to prepare themselves.
But often death comes... unexpectedly.
It can't be predicted.
"Yes, I know, yes."
"For instance, say you cross the street at the wrong moment, or the body just gives out..."
just like that.
"Hmph, monster."
You should have just behaved and stayed shut away in school.
Kiefer...
Is she alive?
She's already been thrown into prison here.
"To begin with, who would have expected her to come back?"
"Years ago, the eldest of her sisters died in a spy crackdown."
The remaining two received our country's reeducation.
"We had the younger sister remain here, as a sign of loyalty to our country."
Wouldn't it be quicker to just say you took her hostage?
She was a foolish girl as well.
"Even though her younger sister is dead since long ago, in the end, she was worthless."
Nothing is accomplished as long as the Astal brat survives.
So he was your real target.
Do you have any idea how much of a reprimand we got from those people?
Is that what you called me here for?
To complain and moan?
"Mind your tongue, monster!"
Ow...
That one hurt a little.
Of course it did!
Are you mocking me?
You're the one doing the mocking here.
I'm always the one being mocked.
I've had enough punishment.
Could you throw me in jail before I drop dead?
"The king will grant one request, with your imprisonment."
"I'd sure like to stop this bleeding, but..."
"Oh, I know."
"Hey, Kiefer."
"If you keep taking afternoon naps, your grades will drop."
What's this?
I found out why
Bin-Khalid's people wanted the strongbox.
Inside there was a flash drive containing a list of sleeper cells that bin-Khalid set up here along with all the codes to trigger their attacks.
"It looked like 15, maybe 20 cells but I didn't have the list for very long."
He said he'll sell it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.
I am still waiting to find out what that is.
Do you believe he'd really do that?
"He's angry, and he's unstable."
I do.
We'll keep looking for him here.
Let us know if he makes contact.
"Yeah, I am heading over to 13th."
Keep looking for Grimes.
I'm going to talk to Keith.
"Rebecca, what the hell's going on?"
Have you lost your mind?
"- Keith, listen to me."
"- No, let me out of here, now!"
I can't do that.
Not until I know if I can trust you.
Trust me?
Because I'm the one who's acted completely out of bounds?
The ranger squad that killed bin-Khalid
Was attacked this morning.
Four of them were murdered and their families.
What are...
"The rangers were living under new identities that only three people had access to - the directors of CIA, NSA... and you."
And you think I gave them up?
No.
I don't.
But I have to be sure.
"I want to clear you, but I need your help."
Then why did you expect me?
Be seated.
Come on out with it.
Quick.
I can't wait for long.
Right kind of mood to have a cold drink.
What would you have?
"Limca, thumsup, or orange..."
You want to tell me something?
- Sory...?
"Oh... yes, I want to tell you something."
"You see, Miss Sheetal, I want to clear something with you."
So that there won't be any misunderstanding in future.
"Ifyou think, I am just putting on a show, but I love you vey much... lfyou think so, then let me tell you that you are right."
But...
I never thought that...
"Look Sheetal, don't tell me that you don't like me or love me."
I am a police officer. I promptly catch a person who tells a lie.
If I am not wrong...
did you say you love me?
But you are behaving as ifyou are giving me a speeding ticket.
Surely there are other ways too to express your love?
Indeed.
But they are worn out and outdated.
So I thought I'd ty a new style.
To help me succeed.
"Vijay, ifyou think you'll succeed because ofthe novelty then you are right."
"""A sense of fun fanned the fires..."""
"""there rose a bit of smoke, and the flames leapt up"""
"""Our friendship has blossomed into love"""
"""A sense of fun fanned the fires..."""
"""there rose a bit of smoke, and the flames leapt up"""
Sorry.
"E, what are you doing here?"
I thought you might need some company.
I lied to my father once.
It was three months before he died.
I'd stolen his car keys and taken the car around the block even though I was only 1 4.
"Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, so help you God?"
I do.
"My dad went out the next morning, and I had parked the car a foot back from where he had, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how he noticed that."
[Bob clears his throat]
"And, uh, this contract dated October 8th, this is for more concrete?"
"Uh, yeah."
Yes.
"And is, uh, this your signature on the bottom?"
"Yes, it is."
"Well, your signature's more illeg... ille... illegible than mine."
"So, um, isn't there usually a sales tax denoted on receipts?"
"Uh, I guess so."
Can't say I noticed.
You guess so.
You can't say.
Hmm.
Yes or no?
You're in business.
You're familiar with sales tax.
is sales tax a part of every transaction or not?
"Yes, it is."
So you or someone connected to the project broke the law here.
"Mr. Dumanjik, I'm the architect, not the contractor."
"I may have signed for delivery of materials, but I was not charged with paying the bill or handling any of the paperwork."
Did you check to see that the tax was paid?
- No.
Why can't it all be done on machinery?
"For many uses machinery is unsurpassed, but Logopolis is not interested in such uses."
Block transfer computation cannot be done with the computers.
-Why not?
-Our manipulation of numbers directly changes the physical world.
There is no other mathematics like ours.
You mean the computations themselves would affect a computer?
Of course.
"Change its nature, cause it to malfunction."
Only the living brain is immune.
"But you had a computer out there, you were using it."
"To record the code, yes, to prepare new algorithms, yes, but we must not use it to run our program."
"Now, we had reached 0-4, 0-7, A-0, 3-0, 3-8."
There are no errors in the registers.
We must search the streets.
-Sonic projectors.
-What are they for?
They must be creating a temporary zone of stasis around the Tardis.
-But I don't really understand their science.
-That goes double for me.
"Fourth block begins. ""A-3."
"-""F-8..."""
-E-8.
"-Sorry, E-8."
"-It is difficult, I know."
But accuracy is of a vital importance.
"""3-3."""
You can tell they're exploited.
-These people are scientists.
-So?
I've seen that look of dedication on my father's face.
"Well, it doesn't seem to be doing any good, does it?"
"- Clear this area, please."
"Everybody, can we just clear out of this area?"
There is another restroom under the stairs to the left.
What's going on out here?
Angry mob getting angrier.
And somebody's still packing.
There you are.
City roads are bad enough-- forget about getting to the airport.
That our fake air marshal?
I.D.'d from the fingerprint that Bishop sent over.
Facial recognition came up empty for a reason.
This guy is a notorious chameleon.
"Well, it would explain why Bishop found him familiar, but not familiar enough."
Norman Dopps.
Name rings a bell.
Maybe because he comes up on our Most Wanted updates every week.
He's this go-to jack-of-all-trades for organized crime families and drug cartels and other horrible people that can afford him.
Any terrorist affiliation?
Probably... the only thing that's not on his record.
Why?
Chatter may not be about him.
"Not so fast, boss."
Chatter's changed again.
Look at this.
"On it, Gibbs."
We'll call you back.
I knew I'd seen his face before;
the Most Wanted updates.
I check them religiously.
"Well, I guess I'm only mildly religious."
"What did Gibbs say, Tony?"
Homeland now thinks it's an assassination plan.
- What?
"- Oh, I'm so happy."
- What?
I'm gonna move back into the house with you.
"Because now, I'm an equal to the Carringtons."
To any one of them.
You know something?
We're both getting what we want.
"Claudia, the dream is coming true."
"Here, we can talk in this office."
Thank you.
"Now, you've seen the CAT scan, doctor."
"Yes, I have, Your Highness."
And I'm setting up additional studies.
"You see, apparently, the king's condition wasn't caused by a bullet."
But rather by the fall he sustained when he was hit.
And if that's so?
Then we call it a flexion injury.
"And there's a chance for surgery, and there's also a chance that the paralysis won't be permanent."
But I'm afraid to say anything more until I see the studies.
"Now, you'll have to excuse me while I set up the studies I'll be working on."
Thank you.
Alexis.
How can I ever thank you?
"First of all, for getting my father out of Moldavia."
"And now, the finest medical attention possible."
"No thanks are necessary, Michael."
"I did it for Galen, but also for you and Amanda."
"You see, it means so much to me that you and my daughter are happy together."
Give her a little time.
And I know that she'll really appreciate you.
"Well, Alexis, I hope you're right about this."
My mother also wanted to prepare everything for me.
"You pay, you come... I don't know why you come."
A waste of time every week.
You don't do anything here.
Why don't you practise?
Such a distance... a waste of time.
When I wanted to take piano lessons:
No I won't allow that!
"It was a question of whether I would go to the conservatory, or go on to study something else."
Dad said:
No!
"That was after the First World War, when Russian aristocrats were playing in bars."
He didn't want to allow that.
He didn't believe I'd be a pianist.
While everyone else said I could make a career.
And what's the result?
"You're an ordinary teacher, just scraping a living."
Now I'm happy I'm a teacher.
I like doing it. I enjoy it.
"But before I got to it, the things I had to give up..."
During the Protectorate I used to play in an orchestra.
I counted on going to study after the war.
My dream was some embassy.
I wanted to see the world.
And that was all I could afford.
The Protectorate put a stop to that.
"At grammar school the girls used to tell me, what are you worrying about!"
You'll make a career as an actress.
"For example, Ji?"
"¨ª Krej¨¨¨ªk, who went into films, said:"
One day I'll make a feature film.
You'll play the second main role.
I don't need a lawyer.
I answered all the questions.
I think I've got a headache.
I wish you'd go away.
[groans]
Mom.
I don't know what got into that police officer... but don't be upset.
Everybody knows you had nothing to do with it.
Do you still want me to sit for you at the Blakes tonight?
Are you sure you're gonna be all right here alone?
"I'll be back as early as I can, Mom."
[door closes]
(Lottie) Dear Mr. Nash... the time has come when I need you.
I'm all mixed up... especially after what happened the night of the murder.
I like to keep myself busy when I'm baby-sitting.
Makes the time go by quicker.
"It was a good book, very romantic."
I couldn't wait to find out what happened.
So after I finished the book I looked around for something else to do.
You've no idea how empty the life of a baby-sitter is.
And how quiet.
It's not as if I were a teenager... with lots of friends to keep me company.
Bobby was sound asleep.
Such an angel.
And with a mother like that.
"But again, you're his father."
"I guess it takes two to tango, if you get what I mean."
That woman sure was some housekeeper.
Never saw such a mess.
"But then, I guess she didn't have time for such things."
"Dust, just like I expected."
It was funny seeing the two of us hanging there.
[slam] [phone rings]
Hello.
"Oh, Paul."
How's the party?
It died.
So did the hostess.
What do you mean?
"Well, somebody stole the family jewels after all and slipped a knife into Mrs. Langley at the same time."
"Perry, could you come over right away?"
"My responsibility here is to the niece Merle, and the way things are shaping up, the poor kid's going to need help fast."
What kind of help?
"Well, right now, the case depends on who's got those diamonds, which is like looking for a needle in a haystack because this place is enormous."
But there's one place the police haven't looked--
Merle's luggage.
Why not?
They can't find the keys.
"Paul, do you have the keys?"
You guessed it.
Merle slipped them to me with a pleading look.
"Perry, I'd appreciate it if you were here when Lieutenant Anderson forces the locks."
"Okay, Sergeant, thank you very much."
"All right, no one left the party early."
No one has those diamonds in their possession.
So we're starting to search the grounds now and that other house across the way.
Without a search warrant?
"We didn't think you'd mind, Mr. Kirk."
"No, no."
Anytime.
"But in the meantime, this luggage."
"Miss Telford, have you remembered yet what you did with the keys?"
"I lost them, I told you."
Then I'm afraid we'll have to force the--
We'll have our own religion in our own building.
"Oh, this does not seem very attainable."
"You should set your sights a little bit smaller, like"
- A new shoe cubby for the mosque.
"- Yeah, I'm with Baber,"
"But to be fair, I don't really care."
"I thank you for your honesty, Rev. Baber, you have wanted this for years."
I just don't think now is a good time.
People will think we're up to no good.
- Why?
"- People will see the minarets and think,"
"- ""Uh-oh, Muslims!"""
- Naturally.
"And then, they'll see innocent old Baber buying some lawn fertilizer and blamo!"
They'll think we're going to blow something up.
Why would they think that?
And why would you be buying fertilizer?
Your lawn is full of weeds and crabgrass.
"Well, that's exactly why I would be buying fertilizer."
My point is proven.
Point not proven!
No one's even going to think you're capable of blowing anything up!
Challenge accepted!
You will see the authorities will be right at my door!
- AMAAR:
"Salaam alaikum, Sarah."
"- Hi, Amaar."
- You wanted to talk to me?
"- Yeah, I needed your help with a presentation tonight at the town meeting for the new mosque."
"Look, Amaar, I would love to help..."
"Great, I will get you the plans right away."
"No, no, no."
"Once that line is changed, how will she make Angel realize that her father does not hate her?"
"According to the script, Lola is supposed to gently say,"
"""Dad actually loves you a lot. """
Dad actually... hates you a lot.
Daddy doesn't like me.
Why do you think that?
"Because Daddy never takes me out and he doesn't play with me, unlike you."
"Mary, you hardly ever see your dad, right?"
Yes.
"When you see your dad, how does it make you feel?"
Very happy and also very scared.
That's right then.
Right?
Think about it.
Your dad is usually very busy and doesn't have time to spend with you.
"Therefore, in his heart, he probably feels very apologetic towards to you."
"So when he actually has free time to spend with you, he becomes nervous and doesn't know what to talk about or play."
Is that what it is?
Yes.
"Your daddy just doesn't know how to behave around you, because you spend too little time together."
"But, in his heart,"
I'm sure he loves you a lot.
Do you know that?
Lian is just like all the other adults.
He only says nice things to kids.
I'm not so easily fooled.
"I know that for a long time now, Daddy..."
"For a long time now, Dad has hated you."
Mary.
I'm crying.
I can tell.
"I'm not sad, it's because Jie Jie's performance is so good."
Told you he thought you were cute.
"Couple drinks, one thing leads to another, you're heading out to the alley to go do the fairly obvious and, before you know it he's punching you, he's kicking you, he's all over you."
"Okay, I didn't meet him at the bar."
But I had seen him before.
I kept running into him outside the courthouse and I was like...
Outside the courthouse?
"Yeah, he'd be across the street at that coffee place."
I just thought it was his spot.
And he was big and muscly and like every gay man's fantasy.
I just couldn't believe that he was actually talking to me.
You know?
"So we started talking, and I told him that I was on the jury."
"I know I shouldn't have, but I just was trying to impress him or whatever."
And then he smiled at me this big seductive smile.
And he threatened me not to tell anyone.
So you lied to the police?
"- No, I was just..."
I was scared that he...
"- Did you happen to tell him, which way you were leaning, guilty or innocent?"
"Yeah, I told him innocent."
Okay.
"Kyle, we have to take this to the police."
It could change the whole outcome...
"- No way, man."
Are you fucking kidding me?
He's gonna kill me this time.
No.
Please.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
What do you have on tap?
First gay bar?
Newcastle.
But not you.
"Despite clearing several frozen minefields by yourself,under heavy fire, providing safe passage for our troops to advance."
"Hypocrites,the lot of 'em."
It's for your safety.
"- Were you scared,Mr.Petty?"
"- No,ma'am."
Any reasonable person would be scared.
Not me.Nope.
And they punished you for it.
Made you feel like a traitor for doing your job.
I just did what I was trained to do.
"I know,Mr.Petty."
The cold and the fear...
And the wave after wave of enemy soldiers coming across those frozen fields.
You never knew who the enemy might be.
Even women and children.
Children?
Tossing land mines everywhere?
Little soldiers.
And so you did what you had to do.
"You went to the village of Wonju, put the mines where they got their water,where they played in the fields."
Trying 55 volts at 2/10 of a second.
"That's right,Mr.Petty."
It's okay.
It's all going to be okay.
"You were in the 45th division in Korea,Mr.Madsen?"
"If you know,why are you asking?"
"You got your degree in medical doctoring,right?"
I did my residency in internal medicine.
Then you explain to me why a perfectly healthy man spends most of his time in infirmary and not on work detail.
I assumed you were ill.
"Well,you'd think I was after all the blood they're taking."
That you need it.
"Yeah, well, that's not why I'm doing this."
You sure about that?
"Tell yourself whatever you want, but going into the police station is a suicide mission."
Yeah.
"Be careful, Isaac, 'cause it almost sounds like you care."
Eric?
Jadalla... police found three bodies near the train yards.
"From the description, it sounds like Malik and his team."
"What about their targets, Carter and Grimes?"
Two men were seen fleeing the area.
They could be anywhere by now.
Keep monitoring police networks.
Find Carter and Grimes.
The Americans probably have the list by now.
"Your operation's failed, Jad."
You failed.
So what are you saying...
We should go back home?
"No, we have men and weapons."
"We move now, pick a target and launch our own attack."
We're here to finish what my father started.
"I respect you as his son, but you're not a soldier like him."
Your father fought the enemy from caves while you were studying at oxford.
But I am here now like my father always wanted.
You've told me you loved my father like a brother.
Prove it now.
Help me get the list and launch the sleeper cells.
Hey.
Mr. Harris called me into his office.
He wanted to talk to me before he went to the principal.
"I had to tell him about the text, okay, I had no choice."
And they let Franz go!
But you gotta hand it to 'em ― they both stood their ground.
The lawyer argued for two hours that Reinhold was marginally retarded.
Reinhold will have to pay him for that!
A pretty penny!
- Did they swear you in?
- Sure.
- On the Bible?
"- No, not that."
Good.
What do they want?
Either they want our picture or they're new recruits.
Here he comes.
We've gotta help Franz out with some money.
He won't take anything from us anymore.
It's all behind you.
You're rid of those guys now.
And you're rid of me too.
"Everyone has to find his own way, right?"
I'll find work.
And you have to tell yourself you just got out of Tegel.
Life is just beginning for you.
"Mieze is gone, and my arm is gone."
"Come on, don't give up now!"
You've always said you don't work with your arms but with ―
"Your kisser, ladies and gentlemen!"
"Shut those honorable kissers, because here comes the main attraction!"
Berlin pricks up its ears and holds its breath.
Even that policeman's arm hangs suspended in the air.
We've all been knocked on our rear end at some point.
"But it's stomach in, chest out, and back on your feet, or you end up in a pauper's grave!"
"Many among us have stared down grenades and shrapnel, stared right in their eyes."
"She broke down all reserve in no time, and looked after us like her family."
And why not?
"After all, you are a blood relative."
I guess you're right.
And about the agency of the canning factory.
I got the impression that Clark wants me to work there.
"And of course, the post will be a good one, I imagine."
I'm thinking about it.
"Since it is simply unbearable to stay a clerk forever, you know."
That's true.
"Well, now, don't forget about me when the time comes, all right?"
Now let's have a drink.
Thank you.
What miserable men you are.
What is eating inside your heads?
You're just like beggars.
I am only going because... this man Suzujiro is my big brother.
"And mind you, I am not going to see him because he is rich."
"Everybody, come over here!"
What is it?
It's a beautiful moonlit night.
Let's enjoy the cool evening outside!
Grandpa used to love to watch the moon.
He always said watching the moon washed his mind clean.
He often stood in the garden and looked at the moon.
"Grandma is certainly a lady of firm character, isn't she?"
"No, she's just old-fashioned."
"In short, she has an antiquated mind."
"But still, the way she talks is worthy of an educator."
"I'm sure Grandpa was, also."
They were both schoolteachers.
Both of them had strict morals.
We'll definitely talk about that.
Martha.
I was just about to ruin your Sunday and call you in to help me.
"Well, Agent Gaad beat you to it."
What do you need?
"There was a meeting between the D.O.D. And Lockheed... in Alexandria, Virginia, on January 23."
There are surveillance reports on everyone who was at that meeting.
Anything relevant they have from that date I want.
Tell them it's for Stan Beeman... and I have code-word clearance for the project.
I'll get right on it after I finish helping Agent Gaad pack.
"[Gaad] Thank you, Martha."
"Hey, what's going on?"
Getting ready to answer questions in front of the committee.
They told me to expect a call next week... after I testify.
"I feel responsible, sir."
"You are responsible, Agent Beeman."
So am I.
"How can they come here, kill my partner, whoever they want... and you wind up..."
"Well, it seems that when you and I kill someone, we leave evidence."
They don't.
They're better at it than we are.
Patterson... kidnapped by the K.G.B. Right here in our capital city.
We have his sworn testimony... before he disappeared into thin air.
$600?
That was all you had!
Who told you to do it?
The pastor?
His wife?
- No one.
- Stop protecting them.
I'm not protecting anybody!
Why do you think I can't make my own decisions?
"Let's say for instance, my poor, sweet mother comes in with symptoms like Mrs. Booth's."
What would you say?
Stroke?
Maybe she mixed up her meds.
"- Your poor, sweet mother?"
- Yeah.
I would have ruled out a stroke.
My next guess would be a form of dementia.
"But if your poor, sweet mother is anything like Ms. Booth, she'd refuse a full exam."
"And why would his poor, sweet mother do that?"
"Because she'd say she knew what was wrong, she'd seen it before, and she'd be fine."
"And what would happen next to my poor, sweet mother?"
- You'd let her leave?
- Not alone.
Ms. Booth couldn't follow simple directions to the washroom.
"At first, she wouldn't let me call anybody."
But then she finally gave me her daughter's number.
- Laura.
"- Yes, she said she'd come."
"After two hours, I finally called her again."
"She got real snippy, you know."
Told me she had a rehearsal and couldn't get away.
Ended up calling a car service.
And you're sure there was no one else that Ms. Booth asked you to call?
No.
She said she didn't have anybody else.
And her daughter was always too busy.
I felt sorry for her.
"- Thank you, doc."
- My pleasure.
"Well, whatever is wrong with her, maybe it's what's behind the panic that made her kill Laura."
"Well, she said she knew what she had."
I can write my essay later.
"Whatever it is, I'm in."
Wait a minute.
I'll do just about anything but that.
"If you wanna help, you have to commit, take this seriously."
Then let me drive the getaway car instead.
Or I could create a diversion or something.
"Hey, you want in?"
Accept the assignment.
Then I guess I'll see if I can borrow one of Andy's.
What can I do to help?
Help what?
Help Kyle have a night out with Amanda like you've been talking about.
How do you know what we've been talking about?
You just sat down.
I listened in while I was sitting at that table over there.
I thought you had the copyright on that move.
I can do anything Kyle can do.
Could you make out with Amanda?
'Cause that would be hot.
It's a common male fantasy to watch two women make out.
"Number six on popular top-ten lists, but it's not really backed by statistical evidence."
"That's all really fascinating and everything, Kyle, but I think what she really needs to learn is the meaning of privacy."
"Bitchy, not cynical."
A total difference.
I was just trying to help.
?
Can I help you?
Hi.
Is Amanda home?
I'm a friend.
I've seen you going in and out of the Trager house.
Jin Tianyun!
"Master Shi, it's been 3 years since we met"
"Your temper is still so bad, huh?"
"Brother Jin, how come you're still here?"
I'm afraid that you'll be bullied again
So I came back!
"Jin Tianyun, you taught my apprentice in secret"
This is definitely against ethics
T alk about morality?
How complicated!
I don't know that.
Your apprentice saved my life
I taught him a bit as a way to say thanks
Why are you so mean?
"That's true, Master."
"In fact, it's good to learn more!"
"You traitor, you've betrayed our teachings"
And our school.
I'll kill you!
"Shi Zhengzong, the decent school talks about"
Loving and helping the young generation
But you blame your apprentice ;
even beat him up... in order to save your face.
"If you try to... give him a hard time again, I'll interfere"
"Jin Tianyun, I know how to teach my pupils"
You have no say here!
"You yelled so loud, don't you fear... it will break some more of your rib bones?"
"Brother Jin, you're not recovered yet"
"Just leave here, quick!"
"So, you're wounded"
If I fight with you...
People will say I've taken undue advantage
"We need our ""A"" game, people."
Now we all know Mystique has a perfect inspection record to uphold.
"So, yes, I'm talking about a sanitary food preparation environment."
But I'm also talking about something bigger.
I'm talking about pride.
"Okay, on to the walk-in."
Let's monitor those cold-holding temperatures.
Thanks for coming.
I just...
I didn't know what to do.
It's freezing.
"What do you guys got the A.C. On, high?"
That's part of the problem.
"Yeah, take a look at this."
"[Shudders] Got the heater turned all the way up, but..."
But still this ungodly chill.
"With all due respect, Mr. And Mrs. Burke, just because your thermostat's broken doesn't mean that there's a ghost in your suite."
It's not just the thermostat.
"The last few nights, the lights, the TV, they turn on and off without us doing anything."
We haven't slept a wink.
I knew it was a mistake to buy this place furnished.
[Mrs. Burke] It's spooky.
It's like her presence is still here.
"Look, uh..."
[Clears Throat]
I know there's probably a logical explanation for all this.
"But my wife, she's a little superstitious, you understand."
Of course.
Of course.
"Well, lucky for you my friend Mike here is an expert at this stuff."
"Mike, you wanna take a look at the thermostat?"
I'll call Maintenance.
"Decreased activity in his left culmen, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate."
Jacob is communing with his God right now.
There's nothing that you could label as abnormal in the scans.
But we haven't got all the tests results back yet.
Something is wrong.
This makes no sense.
Jacob always rebelled against his parents' religion.
Were his parents orthodox?
"Oh, yes, hard-core."
A tendency to believe in God can be inherited.
"There's... there's even a specific gene,"
"VMAT2, linked to religiosity."
Maybe your trip to Jerusalem triggered something that was already there in him.
I always knew his parents would ruin our marriage.
♪ Ahh ♪
"Oh, please tell me that's what I think it is."
Your very own cronut.
I had to wait an hour in line to get it.
They are officially a thing now.
Mmm!
I think I just found the key to enlightenment.
"So, has the cronut earned me a walk to my place?"
"Oh, we don't have to go that far."
"All right, if we need an elvish riddle to get through that door, I'm gonna marry you."
This is the electronic age.
Okay.
"This is, uh... most definitely enlightening."
What's up?
Reynaud's blood work came back.
We did a complete metabolic panel.
"His platelets are normal, but the INR is 6.0."
"Oh, my God."
And you can accommodate it.
You look jolly.
"You see girls, this is what happens when you go poor."
"You'd think that you'd get thinner but you don't, it's weird, it's the opposite."
I've got an interview!
"Oh, Jenny love you're getting to be an expert at these."
"Oh, I've got a feeling about this one."
"I put my CV in this morning, they rang me this afternoon to say that they wanted to see me!"
"What's the position, poppet?"
Practice manager at the doctor's.
"Oh, practice manager."
And presumably if you do well in that then later you'll have a go at being the actual manager.
"No, Mum."
"Mum, practice manager means running a practice."
"Yeah, NHS management."
Yeah I'm donating my skills to the public ***
I'm not Barack Obama post-Harvard.
"Oh, hat's great news, Jen."
"Still rather you than me, all that red tape."
The only person I answer to is Nick Pope.
"Nick, you're in my seat."
"Oh, sorry."
And as I'd be earning I reckon we'd be able to rent somewhere of our own.
"Mommy, what's rent?"
"Nothing you'll ever need to worry about, kitten."
"So you might be moving on then, poppet."
Well let's not get ahead of ourselves.
It could go the way of the others.
I think it's brilliant.
"Go for it, Mum."
"Thanks, Becky."
Go for it!
"The point is, the times I actually felt okay with it was when the person showed they cared and let me talk through it."
"Okay, hold on."
"So the girl just rode by and shouted,"
"""I don't want to see you anymore,"""
and kept going?
Okay.
You tried to teach me how to get the girl?
Now I'm going to teach you how to break up with the girl.
The right way.
How are you going to possibly do that?
"With my proven method, which is..."
"Hold on, give me an hour."
Overthinking!
"Are you coaching me through a breakup, or is Jason Bourne on the loose again?"
The reason I overthink things is because I care about what other people are feeling.
That's what you need to learn: empathy.
"Okay, now, we don't have the time to turn you into a fully evolved human being, so I'm going to teach you how to appear to be one with the help of..."
Please do not say role-playing.
"I am Amy, you are you."
"Hey, Jack!"
"Ugh, payroll!"
Boop!
"What are we doing tonight, sweetheart?"
"Um, I'm breaking up with you."
This isn't working.
Boop!
Very direct.
But you want to leave her feeling good.
"Well, what do you suggest?"
Maybe some light over-the-clothes stuff before I bounce?
"Oh, my God, things are a mess in payroll, my mom's sciatica is acting up, and now you are leaving me?"
[fake crying] [whispers]:
Those cases have nothing to do with this case.
The jury will disregard.
Please disregard it.
Please disregard it because that's exactly what they do to people like you and me.
"We are disregarded because, unless we make them money,"
- unless you're putting cash in their pocket--
- Objection.
- Ms. Papagian-- - ...no value to them at all.
Sustained.
"Uh, really, one more time, and you're done."
All right.
"Well, I am done."
Here's the thing.
They're going to tell you that Ryan Larson was suicidal.
Absolutely a lie.
In no way was Ryan Larson suicidal.
Thank you for your time.
Hi.
That was interesting.
It's very impassioned.
The evidence will show that Ryan Larson left a suicide note.
"Look, Borns Tech is in the business of protecting America from terrorism."
That's what we do.
"Let me take this opportunity to introduce you to Leonard Letts, my co-counsel, and Lucy Kittridge."
Lucy's brother died in the war effort.
"He went overseas, and he lost his life to enemy fire protecting this country and all the principles that we hold dear."
Lucy's brother--
- Objection.
- ...wasn't a war profiteer.
[whispering]
He was a patriot.
And so is Borns Tech.
"The Escape""... at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Southern California."
The theme park ride is the stage... for a spectacular free-fall demonstration.
It will showwhat happens when a carfull of people... and a tennis ball fall from 415 feet in the air.
Okay.
Here we go.
All right.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, my God."
The riders are shot up the 41-story-tall tower... at a hundred miles an hour.
"With their eyes open, gravity will help them see a superhero."
"Oh, my God."
Okay.
I'm going to drop this ball now and--
"Oh, my God, it's floating around!"
It's floating!
It's floating!
"Oh, the wind blew the ball away that time."
"While we expect all objects to fall freely together, regardless of mass... on a windy day, results aren't always perfect."
All right.
"Oh, my God."
"At the very top of the ride, when upward motion has stopped... gravity takes over and the downward free fall begins."
I'm going to drop this ball... and it's going to float.
It's going to float.
"Oh, it's floating."
It's floating.
I'm going to release this ball now.
"And then, for a few blissful seconds... theme park thrill-seekers feel weightless... as ifthey are free of gravity, or in what scientists call zero-G."
"Oh, that one floated well."
That one floated well.
"Oh, I'm going to try dropping the ball."
But zero-G isjust an illusion.
"In reality, gravity is running this ride."
The groom isn't supposed to see the bride on the wedding day.
"Well, we have a few details to work out."
"Nothing that can't wait, I hope."
-Dr.
Rasgotra's scrubbing in on this.
-l am?
Yeah.
You did that open lap in the street.
I think I can trust you in a sterile operating room.
"You're not getting cold feet, are you?"
We'll talk later.
Are his vaccinations up-to-date?
His pediatrician and I don't believe in them.
Immunizations are probably one of the most successful...
... publichealthinterventions ever developed.
"Thank you, but it's a personal decision."
Did you know the air has 21 percent oxygen in it?
He's studying the atmosphere in school.
"Well, that's very cool."
"He's sitting at 94, which is low, but nothing dangerous."
It probably has to do with the fluid I heard in his lungs.
"I'd like to get a chest x-ray, which is nothing scary."
It's just a special kind of photograph and it doesn't hurt at all.
My uncle Deaver had one of those and we got to see all his bones.
Mm-hm.
"-l don't want x-rays, if possible."
"Mrs. Kenig, I'm pretty sure Stewy has pneumonia."
"Well, can't you just treat it then, and we can avoid the radiation?"
"Well, it's a small amount. lt just helps us have a look at what we're dealing with."
-Glenda's waking up.
-Thank you.
Wouldn't you go with antibiotics anyway?
"Tea, coffee...?"
"Ms Tanya, you wanted to buy my house."
"Of course, I remember"
I have still preserved this cheque
How many more zeros will you add?
Sorry
"I must sell my house, else my family will break up"
Are you still interested in buying my house?
Had you not sold it already I'd love to buy it out
Had I not sold it...?
I don't understand
"Mr Batra, your house is no longer your property"
You've sold it already
To whom...?
To my fiance
"If you're interested, you can see the papers"
Take a look...
"your signatures, aren't they?"
Yes... these are receipts I wrote out when I borrowed money from Shekhar
Yes.
"But you mortgaged your house when you took the loan, didn't you?"
How did these papers reach you?
Shekhar is my fiance.
And your house is my wedding gift
Don't tell me you want to make a singer out of Tanya
She can't sing.
All she knows is how to make money
"Shekhar, you deceived me...?"
What deception...?
I never imagined!
For the money you were grabbing my house
"As long as I was giving, I was a god?"
"But, you have come very far."
How did you think that I would leave you?
"How much was I hit by small boss, because of this fellow?"
He should not be alive now sir.
I'm the one who should kill him.
Correct sir.
Kill him till you relieve your anger.
The whole magazine should be emptied.
Today is no enemy day for us.
No enemy will be left for us henceforth.
How is that sir?
Vasundhara with son and daughter-in-law would land in Aurangabad and leave to Shiridi by road.
Let's block their mobile networks.
They cannot contact anyone.
Nobody else too can contact them.
Them going to visit God will be going directly to the God.
Take this body and throw it in the Gandipeta River.
Why are you tensed?
I am not getting the signal when I am trying to speak to Karthi.
Even my phone is not working.
It is surprising.
"You are thinking who I am, right?"
I am son of Jayaraj.
I am Jayaraj's son.
My dad i.e your husband has planned to kill you all.
"My men can do that work, but do you know why did I involve?"
Because of you I lost the identity as Jayaraj's son for 25 years.
I will not just take my revenge by killing you all now.
I will become the King of your entire empire.
Karthik
Are you still alive?
"Due to the shock I give, both you and your father.."
I keep that to remind me never to go back.
I just never expected that that world would would find me here.
"- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them."
"- Oh, yeah?"
"No, I'm not."
"When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod?"
You name me one time and I will take it all back.
Uh-huh.
I didn't think so.
"These are good folk around here, who care about one another."
I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on.
"Oh, like you?"
You've been here how long and your friends don't even know who you are?
Who's caring about only himself?
Just finish that road and get outta here!
Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?
"Respect the classics, man."
Ah...
He's done.
He must've finished it while we was all sleeping'.
Good riddance.
He's gone?
"Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his."
"- Oh, dude, are you crying?"
- No!
I'm happy!
I don't have to watch him every second of the day anymore!
I'm glad he's gone!
What's wrong with Red?
"Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup that you've always dreamed about your whole life and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talkin' about."
Wait a minute!
I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
"You shouldn't feel bad about that because, people will thank you."
- H i Brian.
- What?
"You know I was thinking, this whole thing with the gun and all..."
it would really make an important article for the paper.
"So, I was thinking that you and I should do an interview sometime."
"You know, just to let people know what really happened."
Maybe sometime after school.
What do you think?
What?
See you later.
Has the threat of violence changed the quality of my life at school?
"No, not really."
What do you mean?
I just don't see the point in talking about it.
Sometimes talking itself makes people feel better.
And sometimes talking gets people into trouble.
People say things about people and it doesn't always mean it's true.
You mean about who might be carrying a gun?
- About anything.
- Any weapon?
No.
J ust about anything anybody says about people.
It's not always true.
I just think people want to believe things about people...
so they decide certain things are true and they don't even ask.
And it's not fair.
Because you have to live with it anyway.
"But if it's not true the person could always say that, couldn't they?"
I think if something is false...
people aren't going to keep on believing it.
Usually people latch on to things when there is a kernel of truth.
You father told you that I wrote the encryption in these documents.
"Now, the part that you can't decipher confirms the existence of a man who wanted to turn over the spies to the USSR."
There was one man responsible for having the Russians killed?
Yes.
One man behind the entire frame-up?
Who is he?
I have no idea.
Doesn't specify a name.
I'd tell you if I knew.
"(Dozer) Okay, these are the photographs that make up the collage."
But this is the one I'd say we should be interested in.
How come?
Because this is Chameleon.
(Angela) Chameleon?
The assassin?
"Yeah, I remembered what you'd said about Walker's death looking professional."
So I ran this picture through the database.
Watch.
It's a match.
She's called Chameleon because she can transform into anyone she wants.
(Angela) I've seen her.
She was at the gallery on opening night.
She must have gone there to threaten Gus into stealing his art back.
"And once she got her hands on that piece and the negatives, she killed him."
Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
"Well, she's pacing."
That can't be good.
Would Chameleon really kill Walker just for catching her on film?
You think there's something else?
There has to be.
Such as?
Wish I could say the same.
Not while you're pointing a gun at me or trying to.
"Well, no, you're an invisible guy with a sword."
I think you might have the advantage over me.
My point exactly.
"So what happened to you, James?"
What happened?
"I mean, I know we had our differences"
And I know Carol... happened.
"You always had your own ideas,"
Your own objections to warehouse policy.
"But, I mean, James, James--killing people."
When did you turn into that?
"I woke up, Arthur."
Ah.
Once I was out from under Mrs. Frederic's iron hand
"And your neuroses,"
I could see the world more clearly.
"Yeah, well, you know, that's a little pathetic,"
"Isn't it, James, blaming everybody else but yourself?"
I don't think you found clarity.
I don't think your ego could stand the light.
I'd love to discuss this with you at length.
You or one of your new agents.
"Lattimer and Bering, right?"
I've been observing them for some time.
"I see they have potential, but they're so raw,"
"So untrained, so corruptible."
"If you come anywhere near them, I promise you--"
"I promise you, James, that you're going to regret it."
You'll never get anywhere close to them as long as I'm alive!
"Arthur, you can still read my mind."
"and lockheed in Alexandria,"
Virginia on January 23rd.
There are surveillance reports on everyone who was at that meeting.
"Anything relevant they have from that date, I want."
"Tell them it's for Stan Beeman, and I have code-word clearance for the project."
I'll get right on it after I finish helping Agent Gaad pack.
"Thank you, Martha."
"Hey, what's going on?"
Getting ready to answer questions in front of the committee.
They told me to expect the call next week... after I testify.
"I feel responsible, sir."
"You are responsible, Agent Beeman."
So am I.
"How can they come here, kill my partner, whoever they want, and you wind up --"
"Well, it seems that when you and I kill someone, we leave evidence."
They don't.
They're better at it than we are.
Patterson... kidnapped by the KGB right here in our capital city.
We have his sworn testimony before he disappeared into thin air.
$600?
!
That was all you had!
Who told you to do it?
The pastor?
His wife?
- No one.
- Stop protecting them.
I'm not protecting anybody!
- Why do you think I can't make my own decisions?
- You know why?
"Because it's a stupid decision and you're not stupid, Paige."
You were saving that money to go to Europe.
"- No, no, no."
"Go ahead and take him, and I'll do my best to be there, okay?"
Just come back safely.
I will.
Bye.
"Everybody, meet agent Prentiss."
The other day.
I've been filling her in on protocol.
- Derek Morgan.
- Emily Prentiss.
We can make nice later.
What do we know?
"The DEA raided what they thought was a hardened meth lab right here, in Northern Virginia, but they found this instead."
That could be a dispersal device for a chemical weapon.
- Sophisticated.
- Homeland security's thinking Al Qaeda.
"They've developed devices that span the spectrum of sophistication, some as simple as soda bottles and paint cans."
They're called al ikhteraa.
"Literally ""the invention""."
They are.
Do we know what the biological or chemical agent is yet?
"No, not yet."
The cell members bailed out through a tunnel.
The DEA recovered a nextel 2-way and managed to intercept a message.
- That's not the transcript.
It's...
"- No, it's in arabic."
Our friends surprised us and eloped.
We can no longer wait for the wedding as planned.
We can deliver our gift at the next crescent.
I lived in several middle-eastern countries
- growing up.
"Well, at least let me give you one of these whole-grain muffins."
"Oh, come on."
Think of chewing as an aerobic exercise.
Ugh... just holding this muffin is making me feel bloated.
Huh?
(munching)
"One man's trash, baby."
"One, two, three, four, their prices are low, but their morals are lower!"
"Well, once again, you're overreacting."
Overreacting gets results!
I am simply exercising my right to free speech.
"Uh-huh, and the rotten fruit?"
Visual aids.
"Hilda, I've made an appointment for you with the president of the Everything Emporium to sit down and discuss the matter, if you'd like to try the mature approach."
Fine.
I just hope I can return that cow manure.
What are the odds that the cafeteria would have the bacon cheeseburgers and chocolate sundaes on the same day?
"I know, it's like winning the lottery."
Did you misplace your entree?
No.
"I'm trying to lose weight, so I can fit in my new dress."
The dress that's going to make us a lock for King and Queen.
Good.
So we're both doing our part.
"What's yours, eating like Henry VIII?"
Don't pretend like you haven't noticed my mustache.
"Oh, I see it."
"No, that's just a shadow."
(low gurgling)
Does anyone else hear that strange buzzing sound?
Yes.
Like the low hum of an incoming B-52.
"Mandrian came in, discovered whoever it was, and had to be silenced."
"The murderer then went out, taking the saw with him."
"Sonheim's story is true, he just happened to be the one to discover the body."
Then who did kill Mandrian?
The same person who killed Rafford and Dortmunn.
And I know who that is now.
You know?
Yes.
"I should have seen it right from the start, but my mind had conditioned itself to see the wrong thing."
As Cally has been saying all along.
You found the meaning?
Yes.
Just before he died Rafford managed to scrawl this out.
54124?
Precisely What's it mean?
Absolutely nothing.
"As a number it has no significance at all, but in the filter plant just now, I noticed one of the instruments."
"Liquid crystals show a number, then the confirmation circuit translates those numbers into the written word."
"From the start, we thought that those were numbers."
"They are not, they are letters."
Letters?
Rafford was dying.
It's difficult to be neat under those circumstances.
Let's start with the one and the two.
And the first letter.
So now you know.
"It doesn't matter, you'd have known soon enough anyway."
"Sara, why?"
I wanted the neutrotope
Or at least the money it would give me.
It's that simple.
Was Mandrian in it with you?
Marrying her is out of the question.
You don't even know a thing like that?
"According to Mendel's laws, there's a high probability... for the offspring of a consanguineous marriage to be recessive."
"In terms of eugenics, absolutely."
The eyes of the snake.
The eyes that Suzukichi drew.
See that?
Those eyes are...
"Grandma is there, too."
What are they doing?
They are chanting Buddhist sutras.
"Now and then, old ladies get together and hold a religious service... for the souls of the departed."
That's why there's no Buddhist altar at home.
It's already August.
The day of the atomic bomb is coming.
August 9.
Grandpa's death day.
I see there are other people who have the same kind of idea as Grandma.
There are quite a few old people like that around here.
Suzukichi was one of them.
Although the point where the atom bomb was dropped is quite far from here.
Snake eyes?
The eyes on Suzukichi's drawing... are not snake eyes.
They are the eyes of the flash.
That's right.
"Around here... on that day, when we heard the air raid siren..."
Suzukichi and me were looking... towards Nagasaki over that mountain.
Both of us standing right here.
"Suddenly, the sky split in half and glared at us."
A big eye... peeped through the crack.
The big eye... glared fiercely... at both of us.
We just looked at the sky like we were frozen.
I always wonder about women who chase men who so obviously don't wanna get caught.
You ever ask yourself that about Gillian?
You're not being fair to her.
"Well, we heard that you hacked a statue into pieces during a rehearsal."
I don't censor myself during my creative process.
Wasn't it because Gillian got a line wrong?
I want to know why you brought me down here if I can't speak to him.
"It's been happening more often, lately, had..."
"Wait, I want to hear what my husband's saying."
"I'm afraid not, Ms. Booth."
Detective Logan's already stretching the rules having you in here at all.
But this just cruel.
And it's Mrs. Reinhardt.
"What do you say, captain?"
There's no secrets between husbands and wives.
That's correct.
No secrets.
"Actually, this is the report from the emergency room doctor who examined her."
It confirms what the police officer observed.
What doctor is she talking about?
Is this about Laura?
"No, it's the doctor who examined you in Queens."
You have no right to show him that.
No secrets.
That's what you said.
I don't understand.
What's wrong with her?
"Well, she has the same disease that killed her father and uncle."
This is a summary of their autopsies.
It describes pretty clearly the course of the disease.
How can you...
Don't show him that.
"Well, whenever i was in a fix, jim, i'd just try to figure out what you'd do."
I want to know.
"Trying to flatter me, eh?"
"Well, i was looking and listening around."
"About a year ago, i found out these smart boston bankers was swapping golr money."
Ney.
"$400 in gold was fetching $1,000 in greenbacks."
Sure.
Those bankers were on the inside track.
"They knew that when the war was over, the government would stand back of that paper money."
"Well, i says to myself, i says, ""jim fisk wouldn't stand by"
"""and watch that gold rot in that bank, would he?"
"""Of course he wouldn't."
"Why, jim fisk's smarter than any back-bay banker that ever banked!"""
"Wait a minute, wait a minute- you changed our gold to greenbacks?"
Uh-huh.
Jehoshaphat!
"Did i do right, jim?"
Did you do right?
It's more than $2 million!
$2 million?
We'll buy the stonington railroad!
2 million cartwheels!
Wait a minute- that ain't all.
Huh?
What?
"Well... when i got all this money together, it looked like an awful lot of greenbacks, so i said, ""what would jim think about this?"
"""Shucks, to a big man like him it'd look like a wad of lettuce."
"""Why, jim would say it's a sacrilegious crime to let that lettuce lay there and go to seed,"""
"so... well, i bought bonds."
Bonds?
Bonds?
Congratulation ...
Sir.
Werner Heisenberg!
"Dont leave, wait for me please!"
Damn!
"370 wifes or mistresses, or anything else..."
They allways lead with that they dont lnow anything about physics.  but that it was interesting.
"""Culture and science, is Germanys great strenght"""
Then moving on to the weather and other unrelated stuff.
"For exmaple ""strategic withdraw"""
"We withdraw with success, and show ""victoriouse resistance""."
But i like you
I've allways liked you Wanted you to know that
You are not one of those that give up to easily
"Stay with me, I want to show you something."
Its not only you that have been busy!
Look at this.
Conventional grenades.
"Completely normal, without any ""hocus pocus"""
"Or what, It looks like this."
but we arent stopping there!
Extracted uranium.
What happens then?
look.
I had to do something easier than drop a bomb on them
Like for example put it in lube form.
A kind of cream
But it is very different.
"Effect and result, look."
For example number 47.
"Stopzsky, Shlomo Stopzsky."
"Exposion of radiation, for several minutes."
"Nothing, bro."
"Or should I say, bro-in-law!"
Congratulations!
You're marrying my sister!
"And you spared no expense, you big crazy!"
You know what?
"I love Barney, but this ring thing sucks."
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack and then apologized.
"And I think he really, really meant it."
"Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers, but nothing beats the rush you get when that one special person looks at you."
It's true.
"Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see, and I see her brighter and more clearly than anything else in this world."
You know what that is?
That's love.
And possibly alcohol mixed with some very powerful antibiotics.
And that's how Barney sees you.
And I know that's how you see Barney.
I'd like to start the service with a passage from Ted's dream journal.
"""Drowning."
"""Gasping for air."
"No escape."""
"Wait, is that about Vietnam?"
It's about Whole Foods.
Barney.
We are not getting married.
And those aisles are too narrow!
"But you two have to get married-- otherwise, it's just a cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stand."
"Wait, just to be clear, you're saying you're opposed to cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stands?"
Yes.
Barney... don't you see?
Your detox is done!
You're over one-night stands!
Are they affiliated with anybody up here?
They seem to have good relations with a Latino street gang that moved up here from L.A. about 3 years ago.
"That gang was originally from Guatemala, very tight, impossible to penetrate."
Half of them were in the army.
"These are the guys who are gonna take Reardon's place, much nastier."
Let's talk about what might happen if Reardon left the dope scene.
- You predict chaos.
- Mayhem.
You can already smell it.
"Now with the Americans in the picture, it could get even uglier."
They bring a lot of guns along.
It gets exponentially crazier.
We should be proactive on this and pursue your idea of trying to encourage an alliance.
That might avoid all that.
Can you speak to Dante about that?
See if you can plant that in his ear?
Thanks for listening to me.
"How are you, honey?"
You want some more juice?
- What are you doing today?
- I'm gonna take Sweet shopping and look for a crib.
"I thought after, I'd take them to see the house we're looking at."
That's a good idea.
"Let me know what you think, besides the fact they're asking ten-times too much."
Have fun.
Did Ronnie tell you two we wanted you
- to be godparents?
- I'd be so proud.
Thank you.
Really?
Thank you.
What an honour.
Get up!
Can you handle this?
Henry.
"Why are you hitting yourself, Henry?"
Hmm?
Baby?
"Baby, are you okay?"
I love how protective you are of me.
- You owe me an apology.
- For?
Doubting me.
- I did have certain apprehensions.
- Why'd you let me do it?
I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men.
Is everybody dead?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Do you know when I realized this was working?
When?
"When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out of the lab no matter what."
Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator?
"We'll have a hundred of you tomorrow, a thousand next week."
Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.
"Every single one of my soldiers will awake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn."
I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.
"You didn't make history, Henry."
You helped end it.
You... little... pussy.
That's what my old man called me.
It's like it was my name.
And I proved him right by killing all the wrong people.
"I love you, Henry, and I'll never call you anything but your name, but you gotta decide... are you gonna lay there, swallow that blood in your mouth?"
But I'm sure you've got it all.
"Then who did, sir?"
Who else touched the briefcase?
"Sandy, for gosh sakes, if you'd stop worrying about things that aren't important, you wouldn't overlook the things that are."
"Yes, sir."
"I didn't mean to make you angry, sir."
You've already wrecked my evening with that deposit money you forgot.
There was a message waiting for me when I got home.
You should have sent that money to the bank the minute it came in.
"You know our insurance doesn't cover leaving a wad like $45,000 around the office all night."
"But about that $45,000, sir--"
I know you're sorry.
"Well, skip it."
The bank's sending an armored truck to meet me downtown.
They'll take the money off our hands.
"Oh, what are you doing, sir?"
I'm on my way down to the office to turn the money over to them.
"Now goodbye, Sandover."
Go to Phoenix.
[door opens]
[panting]
[sighs]
[footsteps approach]
"Okay, boys, that's it."
Be right with you.
"Hello, I was given this number to reach Miss Krail tonight."
"Oh, Lita, is that you?"
"Lita, I tried to reach you before to tell you I got your message about double checking that cash that came in today."
"No no no, you don't need to do anything about it."
I'll handle it.
Just wanted to say thanks for calling it to my attention.
That's all.
Am I that easy to you?
Then...
I think I've really gone crazy.
It's good that things turned out this way.
Don't do celebrity documentaries.
"Just do what you like, investigative programs."
I'll find a job for you.
You're unemployed too.
Who's looking for whose job?
I'm going to get a job too!
"If you get a job, should I sign myself up to you too?"
I don't want to see this and that.
What?
You wouldn't starve me and Jik at least.
"Ahjussi, can't you hire me as you wife?"
What did you just say?
"Starting tomorrow instead of plate-of-water unni, another PD would come and film."
"When you threw the ad-lib today, asking her to date you?"
Everyone knows that you did that to chase her away.
"Our chairman is so furious, saying, 'The goby is jumping and the squid is jumping too!"
What kind of PD is she?
'
He said we can't trust our Sin Joon Young to a psycho PD like that.
I gave them the notice.
"Are you fully satisfied with this now, Joon Young?"
And so in that situation what would plate-of-water unni say?
"'Hey you, cockroach of a guy!"
Are you in your right mind or not!
'
While saying that did she have to just accept it then?
"If so, a mere PD would approach a star that would probably be a bigger mess."
Think about it.
"Whenever you've got anything to sell, whether it's a carriage, a steamboat, or an actress, you've got to spruce it up."
Give it sparkle.
I really believe that this is going to help make our corporation look successful.
I'll wear it.
"Wait a minute- gentlemen, please!"
"Now, mr."
Fisk is a busy man.
He'll see you when he gets time.
He sees everybody.
Now will you hoot owls sit down and stop hooting?
"A man gets rich, and it spreads like the itch."
"Now wait, first- all you inventors, please sit over on that side."
All the inventors.
"Sit down, neighbor, please."
"Hey, what are you?"
I'm just plain hungry.
Hungry?
"Well, everybody that's hungry, you sit on that side, please."
Sit down.
Wait a minute- are you an inventor or are you hungry?
Yes.
"Listen, you inventors, hungry or not, you got to sit over there in the patent office, that's on that side."
"Would you mind sitting down, neighbor, please?"
I trusted mr.
"Fisk, and he sat right there and told me an almighty lie."
"Oh, now, uncle daniel, do you think jim fisk would lie to you for $500,000?"
"Yes, i do."
"Yeah, well, so do i."
"What have you got, son?"
I've got an invention that will save you the bother of carrying around matches.
"It's good for pipes, cigars, almost anything."
And the flame is always lit.
We want to keep it a good school.
Do you know what I mean?
- Yes sir.
"- No, you don't, son."
"You see, I've got these officers here, the school board, the newspapers..."
"the television and a whole lot of nasty, angry parents."
They all want to know something about what happened.
And you're the person who knows that something.
Right now you are standing between...
"me and my ability to keep this good school and I don't like that, son."
I don't like it when people do things to my school.
You get my meaning?
"So, why don't you tell us what was the noise that caused you..."
to come out of the bathroom?
"- Hey, Brian."
How are you doing?
- You actually know my name.
Of course I know your name.
How are they treating you Bri?
Baseball bats?
Electrodes attached to various parts of your anatomy?
Excuse me. I have a class.
J ust remember what happens to snitches.
"- Hey, Brian."
Are you okay?
"- Yes, sure."
I'm really sorry you're the person that has to deal with this.
- lt's no problem.
- Because you know...
"if you saw something, like somebody had a gun, then you should tell them."
"If you don't, you would be part of it and people are really scared, Brian."
"So, you should tell them if you saw anything."
"I'm Helen, I'm a taxonomist from London."
Welcome back.
"You've both lost a game, won a game, and now it's your chance to get through to the semifinal."
"Marianne, what's with the hat?"
I've just got a massive collection of hats.
I just really like hats.
"I suppose when you're looking down at your hive, it'll look like you're looking up with your eyes, is that the idea?"
Yeah.
"And you've got an owl in your top, Helen - is this for wisdom?"
We hope so.
We hope so!
"Well, let's see, because you're playing for a place in the semifinals."
We want lots of wisdom.
Best of luck to you both.
Let's play Hive Minds.
All the answers are hidden in a hive which looks like this.
"And if the answer to my question was,"
"""What are the names of this week's teams?"", you'd be looking for..."
"And as you can see, answers use adjoining cells, can go in any direction."
And no cell is used more than once.
"In round one, as you are looking for answers, after two seconds, letters start to disappear, and as they do, the points go down."
"So the faster you answer, the more you score."
"Be careful - we've laid a few false trails, we've set a few traps."
"So, Lutrophiles, here's your first question."
Buzz in when you think you've found the answer.
Reveal the hive.
Grimsby.
Or...
Is Grimsby there?
"Ooh, I'm not sure it is."
No.
What else is there?
"From what I understand, the Left Cholla Navy has researched and developed various ways to fight the enemy at sea."
Then...
Silence!
"Sir, this is not something you should be angry about."
Yi Soon-shin is not our enemy.
We should learn from each other and work together to make the navy stronger.
"Silence, I said!"
Go back to your camps and build some decent galleys for now.
"Whether we fight on land or at sea, we do not need any help from Yi Soon-shin!"
I will fight my own way!
What's the most important thing for an oarsmen?
Teamwork!
You must work together to make the ship glide forward!
Is that clear!
Cadence and rhythm!
Do you hear me!
I... have a difficult request.
"I hate to do this, but..."
I'll do it.
I'll get on board with my men.
It's only right that I should row the new Turtle Ship.
Young-gap...!
"That's your request, isn't it?"
Don't worry.
I was going to volunteer if you didn't ask.
The other guys will refuse to do it no matter how safe you say it is.
And there's another reason why I have to do this.
Those poor boys that died out there...
I have to see them off to the peaceful place.
"Once they see the Turtle Ship zipping through the waves, they will finally feel peace."
I should be the on the see them off.
Tomorrow?
Is that how I seemed?
Yes.
"Kim Yang is a descendant of Kim Heon-chang, who led the uprising in Mujinju."
"Kim Heon-chang tried to overthrow the imperial household, and ascend to the throne."
But the punishment for treason is death of all family members.
My father saved Kim Yang.
He learned to survive even after going from being a Jingol noble to the descendant of a treasonous criminal.
He would do anything to survive.
I do not wish to keep him near me.
Did you find out?
"Yes, the man at the harbor was the new Mujinju governor."
What is the new governor doing in Chunghae?
He came to pay his respects to the regent.
Did you call for me?
I need to go to Mujinju.
It would be too dangerous.
Why would you want to go to Mujinju?
I must meet with Madam Jami and seek her help.
It will be useless.
She coldly turned the master down when he asked her for help.
I won't leave her alone if she refuses to help us.
Who's there?
It has been a long time.
What do you think you are doing?
How could you show up in Mujinju under the circumstances?
Do you plan to harm me?
This was the only way to see you.
Do not worry.
I don't mean to harm you.
It upset me very much when I heard that Master Yi was killed at the hands of Jang Bogo.
Why did you come to see me?
I need you to help me.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
If you're part of a crew nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you.
It doesn't happen that way.
There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.
People who cared for you all your life.
They always seem to come in the time when you're weakest and most in need of their help.
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.
"I got there 15 minutes early, and Jimmy was already there."
He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up to the restaurant.
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.
He was jumpy.
He hadn't touched a thing.
"On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine."
We were supposed to be discussing my case.
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.
"I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the fucking phone."
Now you understand?
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.
You know that kid from the city we were talking about?
You know?
The kid turned out to be a rat.
"As soon as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody."
I know where he is.
He's hiding now.
Know what I'm saying?
Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?
"No, not at all."
That way they got nothing.
"Matt, please listen to me."
No!
"No, I should've known you'd go behind my back."
"Okay, but I have a long list of people seriously considering adopting them."
- I ain't interested!
- Why not?
"Because, quite frankly, I can save time and money sending them to auction."
"Matt, please, I don't believe you!"
"Look, these horses, they could have great homes."
There are people willing to pay for them.
The end result is the same.
There's still money in your pocket.
"Okay, here's the deal."
I'm a reasonable man.
- Okay...
- Do whatever you want with them...
"But... tomorrow morning, they go to the highest bidder, be it the glue factory or someone who wants to adopt."
"So... go ahead and rally your troops, but I'll be the one making the final decision."
All right.
I understand your husband works in Vancouver.
"- Um, how often is he home?"
"- He travels for work, but that doesn't put a strain on the relationship."
A strain?
Why do you use that word?
"No, no."
I said there isn't... a strain.
Moving on.
"Um, let's discuss Georgie's recent injury."
Can you take me through how that actually happened?
Georgie takes trick riding lessons and she was practicing in our ring.
"You know, I'm surprised someone as young as Georgie's"
- doing such a dangerous sport.
"I don't know why the second, I was a bit taken aback."
He probably meant some comedy role.
"In the end, he made the film without me."
He's a laureate and I don't know what else.
I remembered him once when I was in a bad situation.
"Without money and without hope, and then I realised all the things I could have been, all I could have done."
"That time I noticed a newspaper on the ground, I just pushed it open with my foot and read:"
Krej¨¨¨ªk has become a laureate.
I thought:
"He got twenty thousand, and I'm just rushing around here."
"Mrs Gerta, tune that G!"
is that G alright by you?
Can you hear it?
"- l can't tune it, how am I...?"
- lt must be possible to tune it.
"Yes, but not straight away!"
You should do it before rehearsals.
"Get ready... slacken it... slacken it more, more... lt's okay now."
"That's enough, thank you!"
"If we'd had the kettledrums last time, it'd go better today."
But you have to come to rehearsals occasionally.
"I'm not cross, but I have to remind you."
Once again!
Slightly quicker tempo.
I'll set the tempo.
"One, two, three!"
"- Are you listening, Mi?"
ko?
- l'm listening.
When did you get to know Gerta?
"She used to play, that was long ago... I always had a feeling for music."
A girls' orchestra was playing in a coffee house in Prague.
"You know this assignment was non-fiction, right?"
"Yes, Mr. Wyatt."
"So you and your family killed a werewolf last summer, huh?"
"Why would you write something like this, Sam?"
It doesn't matter.
"As soon as my dad gets back, we're leaving, so."
You can flunk me if you want to.
I'm not flunking you.
"I'm giving you an ""A."""
"Now, aside from the werewolf, is that really how you'd describe your family?"
Yeah
"Well, your brother is quite a character."
"And your father -- he seems, uh, driven."
"Anyway, it's good, Sam."
It's really good.
Have you ever thought about pursuing writing?
I can't.
I have to go into the family business.
Family business?
"Yeah, my dad's a--"
My dad's a mechanic.
"So I have to be a mechanic, too."
"Do you want to go in the family business, Sam?"
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well?
More than anything now.
"Well,"
"I don't want to overstep my bounds here, but... you don't have to do anything you don't wanna do."
"Look, I mean, I know what it's like."
"I come from a family of surgeons, and that wasn't me."
"So, you know, I traded in the money and prestige of being a doctor for all the glamour you see around you."
"But the point is... there may be three or four big choices that shape someone's whole life, and you need to be the one that makes them."
I don't think I ever closed my mouth in this movie.
It's hard not to laugh when you're standing next to me with your mouth open like that.
It's such a good choice though.
"This is the first thing we shot on the movie, this performance."
- That's right.
- The second thing was this scene...
And then Rafi normally comes down and kisses a guy.
It just cuts away right when it happens.
And that guy was so excited.
He had to kiss that guy and it didn't make it in.
- They kissed a lot.
- That guy was so excited when...
We couldn't stop them from kissing after a certain point.
"Mike, I love your face when you do that."
Your were so pissed.
I like the Jerk Offs sign in the back.
That's Lite-Brites.
Those were some of my favorite things.
"Dave Doernberg, our production designer, dug out the Lite-Brite."
- I love Lite-Brite.
- He doesn't do that for every motion picture he works on.
This is the first thing of our friendship that we ever filmed.
Yeah.
"Watching this scene, like, this is where we all got to know each other."
This is where l...
I hadn't ever met Jonny or seen him in anything.
And he didn't say a word in this sequence.
"He's standing in the crowd staring at Rafi, but I learned so much about him just watching him from the stage."
"- But you met him at rehearsals, right?"
"Yeah, I mean..."
"But still, you know, it was kind of..."
We were just acquainted.
"What are you talking about, for Christ's sake?"
Did you see her or not?
She's acting like she's fucking out of her mind!
"Psychotic, like a split personality, or...."
"There haven't been more than 1 00 authentic cases of so-called ""split personality,"" Mrs. MacNeil."
"Now, I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first."
"So, what's next?"
"A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion."
It will involve another spinal.
"Oh, Christ!"
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriograms could conceivably turn up there.
At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative.
In other words: normal.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
"No, of course not."
Nothing like that.
Are you sure?
"Of course, I'm sure."
I'd tell you.
"Christ, I don't even smoke grass."
Are you planning to be home soon?
I mean to L.A.
"No, I...."
I'm building a new house.
My old one has been sold.
I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school.
Why do you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
"When I touch your forehead, open your eyes."
"Are you comfortable, Regan?"
Hello?
Rajinikanth took it?
Why would he take it?
How would I know sir?
May be he's starting a new party?
Oh God!
He has robbed me clean.
I earned that money by every mean I could in all these years of public life.
"I beg you, please tell me, where's my money?"
"I don't know anything sir, I'll fall at your feet sir."
Hey Officer!
"You took charge with a promise to catch him,"
"I lost crores of rupees, do something I say."
"No expression on face, do something I say."
"Thank God, he plucked few strands of hair only sir."
Wait my partner...wait...
I was expecting your call.
How are you?
Partner?
Who is your partner?
"You helped me in robbing, right?"
Actually I knew that Minister's money is with the peon.
"After I made you my partner in the plan and you caught him,"
"I came to know where's the money, it means I made you also my partner in the crime, right?"
"Want me to send your share of the booty, partner?"
I like you...
You're making a grave mistake by making me your partner.
You became my partner the day you shot a bullet into me.
If I had been your partner I would've shot the bullet into your heart.
Wantonly I shot 6.4 inches away from your heart.
"You're terrific, partner, but you don't know about me."
"Stealing isn't your profession, you're doing it for fun."
You like challenges.
Anyone will go bonkers or finished if he sees me...
"If I allow him to touch me, anyone would become my slave..."
"If I give little liberty on me, anyone will go mad..."
Anyone would die in the fire of my desire...
It's run into the wilderness...
It's fire of passion of fans...
This attack is fatal...
Nobody can stop this stealing of hearts...
"If you make a request, you'll enjoy the fun..."
"If you tease with romance, I'll take you to the bliss..."
It seems he's a latest thief.
"Without any discrimination, he's robbing every one."
The doors remain closed but the money inside vanishes.
That's the magic!
"Forget all this, I'm giving you full powers as the Home Minister."
Close down his file swiftly.
- First theft...
- July 5th.
It happened on 5th.
12 thefts in 10 months.
"According to you, it's Rs.75 crores."
Much more according to me.
He didn't spare anyone.
"Before robbing doctor, his name appeared on newspaper a day earlier."
Lawyer appeared on TV a day earlier before he was robbed.
He robbed Minister's home a day after he commented on the thief.
All his victims were news makers before getting robbed by him.
He's leaving clues to us and enjoying our inability.
He's not a regular thief.
Hey you!
Did you read the files already?
I read him well.
"You should see a doctor, Arthur."
Too much sand in the lungs.
That's the real curse of the pharaohs.
I'll be fine once we're away from Egypt.
I shall miss it dreadfully.
(Soldier shouting orders)
Monsieur Carter.
I am sorry that it has come to this.
I must ask you for the key to the tomb.
The refusal to work is in contravention of the terms of the concession.
My department will now take responsibility and overall control of the tomb and the excavation.
You mean you're kicking me out?
"I warned you, Monsieur Carter."
I've already spoken with the minister.
He's in full agreement with me.
"The key, if you please."
"The soldiers were hardly necessary, you know."
"Have I done the right thing, Arthur?"
You did what you believed to be right.
(Phone ringing)
Carter.
OPERATOR:
"Mr Carter, I have Monsieur Lacau for you from Cairo."
HOWARD:
The situation in Egypt has changed.
The nationalist campaign of violence has backfired.
The government are concerned.
The hotel trade is vital to them and they're worried about losing tourists.
Lacau is keen to reopen the tomb.
But he needs an international team to do it and he's asked me to go back.
"Under his proposal,"
I see that I remain responsible for the costs of the excavation.
Check the circuit breaker.
Nobody move!
Everyone here's a suspect.
Put on another pot of coffee.
It's gonna be a long night.
"Four turds, five suspects, so many, many nameless victims."
The first poop was obviously Frank.
"Old and weak, he had an accident, that's why he was so intent on destroying it."
"There were many turds before this one, weren't there, Frank?"
"This was just the first time you got caught, wasn't it?"
And then you went and did it again the next night?
Or did you?
Two poops in two nights?
Tall order for such a short man.
No.
The second poop belonged to Charles.
"He wanted to get back at Frank, but due to his poor diet, couldn't produce a turd."
"So he called Mac, who jumped at the chance to see"
Frank humiliated one more time.
But Charlie overlooked the fact that Dennis listens to Mac's phone calls and he heard every word.
Dennis was jealous that Charlie had chosen Mac to help instead of him.
He swore to have his revenge.
That's why encouraged Mac to sleep while he stayed up.
He was going to put the frame on Mac by pooping next to him.
But he didn't realize that a futon slept on by the weight of three men would be off its axis and slope to the center.
And like a small brown snail... it crept to the middle between Charlie and Frank.
Deandra!
You wanted in on this poop war from the start.
"No, I didn't."
The outcast?
The slut?
The bitch.
"That ain't the real Tom Horn, is it?"
He doesn't seem to be too scared of Corbett.
He's gonna get himself killed.
"Lord, the end is here."
- Is Tom Horn in there?
"- Yeah, he's here."
Last stall on the right.
But I wouldn't go in there with that horse if I were you.
That son of a bitch is harebrained.
He's got him trained to stand people off.
"Well, he's a hero of the frontier and he's lying here in Hagersville... with his face kicked in."
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
How bad you hurt?
Wasn't much of a party.
"Say, you another one of those newspaper guys?"
"No, I ain't, but I'd like to get you out from under that horse if I can."
Open up that gate and I'll walk him out.
Let me ask you something.
- Are you in fact Tom Horn?
"- Yes, I am."
"Goddamn, Tom."
"You know, here in Jerkville, where these yokels... is busy flicking dandruff off their mail-order suits... they forget awful quick that it was men like you that made it... safe and possible for them to lead out their dull little lives."
"Right now, I wish I had nothing to do with it."
- What's your name?
- John Coble.
"What can I do for you, John?"
"Well, first, I'd like to offer you my ranch till you get recovered."
And then I'd like to offer you work... that suits both your ability and your quality.
"I'm a fair hand, and I'll earn my keep."
"Yeah, I know you will, Tom."
We better stop and water our horses here at Brown's Hole.
You have a... gentleman friend?
"Vastra, what's happening?"
"The snow is highly localised, and on this occasion not naturally occurring."
It's coming out of that cab parked by the gates.
"Sir, one pulver grenade would blow these snowmen to smithereens."
"They're made of snow, Strax, they're already smithereens."
"See, Clara - our friends again."
Clara?
Who's Clara?
Your current governess is in reality a former barmaid called Clara.
That's the way to do it!
Meanwhile your previous governess is now a living ice sculpture impersonating Mr Punch.
"Jenny, what have you got?"
Should hold it.
"Sir, this room - one observational window on the line of attack and one defendable entrance."
"Right, everyone in there now, move it."
You - carry her.
Nice to see you off your cloud and engaging again.
"I'm not engaging again, I'm under attack."
"You missed this, didn't you?"
Argh!
Argh!
Shut up!
"Strax, how long have we got?"
They're not going to attack.
They made no attempt to conceal their arrival.
An attack force would never abandon surprise so easily - and they're clearly in a defence formation.
"Well done, Straxie, still got it!"
"Sir, please do not noogie me during combat prep."
So there's something here they want.
The Ice Woman.
Exactly.
"For a man pushing 100, you're amazingly well preserved."
How accommodating of the Society to provide members with rejuvenation drugs.
You should see the dental plan.
"(Malone) We've been aware of you for some time, Detective."
"Despite all the roadblocks we've thrown in your path, you've managed to persevere."
"- Yeah, I'm funny that way."
- You are impressive that way.
What if I told you the Society might be willing to offer you membership?
Provided you pass a loyalty test.
You want me to prove my good faith?
How will you prove yours?
With a bit of information.
Courtesy of David Xanatos - one of our lower-echelon members.
You've got my attention.
You OK?
Our shift's almost over and you haven't said three words all night.
Let... me... drive.
"- Hey, pal, it's my car."
- I insist.
All I could think about was what Elisa had told me.
"I was feeling hurt, betrayed and, most of all, angry."
Make sure you buckle up.
(tires squeal)
I saw Malone today.
The old man had a lot to say - not just about the Illuminati.
"Uh, that's great, but easy on the gas, OK?"
He told me I knew someone who could blow the lid off another conspiracy.
One a lot closer to home.
"Matt, slow down!"
This is nuts.
"This is the end, Elisa."
The end of all the lies and deception.
You can hitch a ride down at the air base in one of them B-29s on the way to Mitchell Field in New York.
Forget about it.
Those reunions are for the birds.
"-But Sarge, you got to go."
"-What, what, b-but Sarge, but what, what?"
"I'm a master sergeant, and I got to go like a master sergeant."
"That means a suite at the Waldorf, maybe pick up the tab for those meatballs."
Where am I going to get the money-- sell a tank?
"Hey, Bilko, I got another breakdown."
Another breakdown?
You can't move without me.
"Look, if you can't get me a truck that works, get me a mule."
I'll do better than that;
I'll put a harness on you.
Get out of here.
"He don't want to go to that reunion, does he?"
"Not much, he don't."
"Man, wouldn't he like to walk in on them guys flashing them six stripes of his, huh?"
"With that room at the Waldorf, huh?"
"Show he's still the top guy in the outfit, huh?"
What a night that would be.
"Listen, Hensh, I got an idea."
"There's money in this platoon, only it went underground."
We're going to dig it up.
Give me that picture.
"Look, you go tell the other top kicks in the outfit what we need."
-On the double.
-Yo.
"All right, boys, I want to talk to you right here, on the double, let's go, everyone..."
Look at that picture again.
Look at all that hair.
"And every hair that's gone is from worrying about you guys, this whole platoon."
"In other words, her aura spread into the atmosphere."
We are surrounded by a fog that is composed of a mixture of many different types of auras.
What your granfather says is always so interesting.
I feel like I am looking for the roots of my own soul.
It is really fun.
"How did you ever get interested in things like this, Saho-san?"
The first time I remember being interested was about four years ago.
Four years ago?
Yeah.
An old lady that was a friend of the family died.
"During the wake, in a room that was filled with smoke, everyone was talking about the person who passed away."
That is when it hit me...
Maybe there is a way to see something that we normally cannot see...
Like that old lady's will.
"I wondered how I could do that, and if I could, how much I could see."
That is why I am interested in things like this.
"But, the other world gets further and further away the more we try to learn about it."
I would really like to see it.
I would really love to see the air-flow in a way I have never seen before.
Something like this fog.
Do you really want to see the other world?
"Yes, I do."
If it is possible to see.
Saho-san is like no one else I have ever met before.
I'm home!
Ah!
Sis!
What are you doing with all of those books?
!
Ah!
Mizuki...
Welcome home.
"So I wrote ""Southern Nights."""
"When I was a little boy going on about six, my father would take us out to the country to visit our relatives out there."
"All of them spoke Creole, very little English."
I'd sit on the porch and I'd look up into the trees and everything was above me.
"As writers, we would like to be inspired all the time."
We would like the clouds to open up and receive us.
"""Southern Nights"" was a song that did that."
"It was a kind of spiritual feeling to be in that environment and to know where we came from, so we'd know where we're going."
"All these cities had so much to offer, musically and culturally."
And then sometimes there's obstacles.
"Sometimes it's weather, or in the case of New Orleans..."
We recorded in the middle of the French Quarter.
Kill the tape.
Let's call Dave Grohl in here.
He hit the bar.
"You know, if you put a guy like Dave in New Orleans..."
- Is Dave across the street at that bar right over there?
"- Yes, he is."
...sometimes you gotta go look for him.
We didn't have to look far.
Do you want to come check out this drum...
- What's that?
"- Hold on, I gotta pay..."
Came to haul Dave out of the bar.
How much?
- See y'all.
I'll be back.
- I'll be here.
"You pull me out of a bar, better have a good reason."
"It's like the Faces, dude."
Sounds good.
I had a blast doing the drum track.
The standing joke of the year...
- Whoo!
- Is this a wake?
No.
He needs to be in the ground for it to be a wake.
This is a celebration.
- Do you see Kevin Grey?
- No.
But I've seen enough.
- Whoo!
- Let's bring her in for questioning.
"Long time, Harry."
"Yes, it is, sir."
I hear you're about to question a suspect in the Freddie Lau murder.
You don't mind if I watch as you interview them?
"No, I don't suppose I will."
"I never expected to find you still here, Harry."
"Forgive me if I'm a little bit confused here but when we ran into you last night, you were having quite a party."
The Chinese attitude to grief is very... different.
Death is pan of the wheel of rebirth.
Away to enlightenment.
So singing '80s classics is your expression of grief?
LAWYER:
Can I remind you my client has come here of her own free will to help with your inquiry?
You're absolutely right and we're very grateful.
"So, Miss Lau, being so close to your father, you would know about his dispute with Kevin Grey."
"You do know Kevin Grey, don't you?"
Course I do.
He used to work for my father and now he works for me.
But I'm not aware of any dispute between them.
"In fact, it was my father who recommended Grey to me."
We were told they had fallen out over a stripper called Kayleigh Fenchurch.
No.
"And you think he'd be just a little bit grateful, show some appreciation for my personal growth."
He only listens to Kirsten and Sandy.
"Well, the woman I married wouldn't stand for that."
Nobody puts Julie Cooper in the corner.
I don't know how this is happening again.
- Maybe 'cause you keep marrying for money?
- I did not marry for money.
"- Well, I didn't marry you for money."
"- No, you married me because you were pregnant."
You married me because I was pregnant.
I married you because I loved you.
"- Bye, Dad."
"- Bye, sweetheart."
- Love you.
"- I love you, too."
Back to the gulag.
"Oh, KE equals one half MB squared."
"So if gravity is the constant, and we plug in these velocities..."
"- Ryan, what are you doing?"
- Trying to do the assignment.
- Except you've already finished it.
"- If you flunk out of Harvard, you can spend the rest of your life floating in your paren"
"- I need an academic scholarship, so..."
"- Okay, what makes you think my parents have an infinity pool?"
"I mean, they do, but they're not my parents."
I transferred in from Chino last year.
- I was just like you.
- Really?
You were assaulted by the Captain of the water polo team.
"Okay, first of all, I've never even seen a water polo game, match, whatever."
"Second of all, yeah, I was."
I feel like I'm 14 (shudders) ag-a-in.
That... was on me.
He wasn't gonna do anything.
- How much is his therapy costing again?
- (sighs)
We used to think that was snark.
- Now we know it's wit.
- Yeah.
"Uh, Mr. Peterson, we just want to be certain that this environment's the right fit for Lily."
We have a lot of experience dealing with accelerated students.
"But if Lily really is gifted, then maybe there's another path... private schools."
"Although, I do love the diversity of a public school."
"- On the other hand, I do wonder..."
"- Okay, you know what?"
We're just deciding if she's gonna skip a grade.
We're not charting out the next 20 years of her life.
"Well, no, choices have consequences."
"If we don't do this right, she could lose all interest in school and drop out, and the next thing you know, we're supporting her and her deadbeat boyfriend and our savings are drained, and then we have to sell the house!"
"Okay, why do all your meltdowns have to do"
- with us selling the house?
- I'm just saying...
- We're gonna give you guys a minute.
- Okay.
"Lily, do you want to see the computer lab?"
This feels like a good time to tell you I'm adopted.
Maybe Claire's right.
Maybe it's too much pressure for her to skip a grade.
"I did it, and I'm fine."
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.
Um...
"Hey, w-what does ""uh-huh"" mean?"
"It's all right to fight drew and vanderbilt, but you can't fight the public!"
They say you're swindling erie and everything else you can lay your hands on so you can get more money to squander on josie mansfield!
Keep josie out of this.
These fellas won't keep her out of it.
"Why don't you wake up, jim?"
Josie mansfield's making a fool out of you!
Hold your horses!
"I didn't think there was anything i couldn't take from you, but there is."
"Now, don't say it again!"
I wouldn't be your friend if i didn't.
Don't say it!
You can't get mad at me.
We've been through too much together.
"You don't know anything about her, so shut up!"
I'll shut up!
But you got to tell me what you're gonna do about josie mansfield!
I'll tell you what i'm going to do!
I'm going to marry her...
if she'll have me.
You don't like her.
That's all right.
But don't mention her name again.
You think she's in love with you?
I never figured i was much of a ladies' man.
"You've said that to me many times, nick."
But when a man feels about a woman like i do about josie... he begins to believe in miracles.
"You really feel that way about her, eh, jim?"
That ain't half what i feel about her.
I wish i could lay my hands on all the gold in the world just for the fun of making her happy.
"Maybe she don't love me yet, she likes me."
"That's something, ain't it?"
Sure.
- Yeah?
- [breathing heavily]
"Um, so..."
"Uh, I fucking do remember one."
"Uh, there one-- there once was an oyster whose story I tell that found that some sand had gotten into his shell."
"It was only a grain, but it gave him great glee for oysters have feelings--"
Just tell me it's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.
You're fine.
You're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
So you admit that you are a liar.
"I lied about Ryan Larson, but that does not make me a liar."
To lie is to be a liar be definition.
Anan:
If I may explain--
The question is not if you're a liar because you are.
"The question is, were you lying when you said he was suicidal or are you lying now?"
Or when you broke your oath to the Church not to reveal the secrets of the confessional.
I would like to explain.
You have already tried.
You can try again with the jury.
Let's just hope none of them are Catholics or people who care about the truth.
Clearly Mr. McBride has bigger legal problems than our case.
Why hasn't he been charged yet?
Do you really think he killed someone?
Come on.
"I mean, I know you hate the guy, but-- but murder?"
"He's killed others-- not directly, but by his actions as a defense lawyer releasing killers."
"This is a huge break for us, whether McBride gets charged or not."
It's real important that you let Burke guide you in court.
And you be as closed-mouthed as you can around that prosecuting attorney.
- Who is he?
- His name's Walter Stoll.
He is effective.
They say he's running for office again... and this trial will be kind of a showground for him.
"If he convicts you, he'll be a big hero."
He needs to hang you to get elected.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
You could have been riding right through this two-bit town.
- People been trying to kill me all my life.
- I've got to tell you something.
I knew the Association wanted to get rid of you... because they told me.
But I just didn't know what to do.
They...
"I didn't know nothing about... the Nolt boy... or how it happened, but..."
Who the hell could have done such a thing?
But I know one thing.
You never killed that kid.
I figure folks would have to do something about me sooner or later... the frontier closed and all.
I never knew anybody that knew anything but just killing and getting killed.
"After a while, it's all you know."
"Now listen, if it all goes wrong in there for me..."
"I know you're my friend, John... and I know that you care about me."
"Now sit down, and I'll whip your ass at checkers."
Good day.
"That's fine, Tom."
"Tom, you can step up to the counsel's table here."
"Earl, back over here."
You boys split up.
The Honorable Judge Scott.
This court is now in session.
"Mostly, I was thinking about racquetball later and hopefully giving Cam a nice spanking."
Fair warning... may be working out some anger issues on the racquetball court this morning.
- Don't ask.
- Sounds good.
"So, we're getting our new dryer delivered."
"It's supposed to be eggshell, but, oh, it's not eggshell..."
It's white.
"Anyway, I'm laying into the delivery driver, and Mitchell strolls in and says, ""oh, it's fine,"""
and then offers him a piece of his banana loaf.
I heard that.
"Uh, just once, I would like Mitchell to take my side."
I'm constantly strolling in and saving him like a little princess in the tower.
Sometimes I'd like to be the princess.
"- Six of one, right?"
- What?
Why are...
Why are we stopping?
I'm...
"I'm very confused, Phillip."
"Trust me, this house is gonna sell at Thorpe speed."
"Hey, guys."
"Oh, hey, Phil."
I guess you heard.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, no, it happens all the time."
I just stopped by to give you guys a little care package to show you there's no hard feelings.
"Class act, dung beetle."
Here's the malpractice attorney most of his clients have used after he's ripped them off.
"You will be losing some sleep, but these have always helped my wife."
"And this priest is retired, but I think he still does exorcisms, which you'll need after today."
"- Listen, Phil..."
- It's okay.
"All right, he shouldn't have gone up there."
He hasn't got it in him.
You take it from me.
I want him back.
I'm afraid you're going to have to wait.
"No, you don't understand."
I need him now.
"They're asking for boats-- fishing boats, ferries, clippers, you name it."
We're going across where the army's stuck with the Germans bombing them and tanks moving in and God knows what.
They've put together a whole fleet of boats.
"And we're going over there, and we're going to bring back our boys."
It's already begun.
"They say there were nearly 30,000 of them saved yesterday, and there's going to be 30,000 more today."
I can pick up 20 men in my boat.
"A drop in the ocean, you'd say?"
But there's hundreds of boats all along the coast doing the same-- hundreds and hundreds of them.
Only I can't do it without David.
Lady rose is too much for me to handle on my own.
So you have to let him go so we can leave together.
"You let my boy out, and I promise you--"
I swear on everything I hold sacred--
I'll bring him back to you.
I won't let him run away.
We'll do this journey.
"We'll go there, we'll come back, and then you can keep him for as long as you need, as long as it takes you to realize that he's innocent-- as innocent as you or me."
[Men shouting commands]
Dunkirk.
Do you think you'll ever see him again?
Foyle:
Yes.
He'll be back.
[Horn blows]
- Do you think so?
Willoughby...
"You see, I speak his name calmly."
Then there is something I must tell you.
- He came when you were very ill.
- To Cleveland?
He came from London like a madman.
"I promised him that when you were well, I would pass his words on to you."
"Each day since, I have feared to unsettle your mind too soon."
I can talk of it now.
"You were playing lovely, Miss Marianne."
Is it all right for me to polish the table?
Of course you may.
"Marianne, let us put on our coats and go for a walk."
He did love you.
"He implored me to tell you that he was penitent, that you would always be dear to him,"
and he begged you to forgive him.
Did you forgive him?
"For my part, yes."
"And I pitied him, but did not tell him so."
My illness has made me think.
I had enough leisure to reflect.
Only now do I see that my own want of feelings brought on my sufferings.
I always talked about feelings but they were all for myself.
I wronged you and I wronged Mother.
My weak character almost brought me to the grave.
- My love...
"- I brought my illness on myself, by play-acting, pining and starving myself romantically, and being foolish till I almost died of it."
And I knew I was doing wrong.
"As for Willoughby, I don't know if I can soon or ever forget him."
My own future conduct must be my proof.
"Yes, because I hope to earn forgiveness."
"About those pills, they're doubly strong."
I don't want you to use them on him unless you absolutely have to.
Is that clear?
Blake.
Hello.
"Hello, darling."
I'd like you to meet Dr. Travers.
- Doctor.
"- Pleasure, Mr. Carrington."
Doctor came very highly-recommended.
"Well, that's good to know."
I'm happy I had the chance to meet you.
Pleasure.
"Doctor, would you please tell my husband I'm fine?"
"Well, yes, to a certain degree, your wife has a low-grade infection."
"Certainly, nothing to be alarmed about."
But what she needs now is good old-fashioned rest.
I'll see to it she gets plenty of that.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to talk to Mrs. Gunnerson.
"Doctor, are you quite sure that she's all right?"
"I mean, shouldn't she be in bed, resting?"
"Oh, don't worry, sir, I've given her some antibiotics."
"She should take it easy, but bed rest isn't absolutely necessary."
"By the way, do you mind my asking, how are you feeling, sir?"
"- Why, I'm fine."
Why?
- Nothing.
"It's, you know, none of my personal business, but professionally, I know how you corporate types neglect regular check-ups."
Right or wrong?
"Well, unfortunately, you're right about that."
"Well, you certainly look in excellent shape, and I'm sure you are."
"Been a minute, man."
Yeah.
- We good in here?
"- Yeah, don't worry about it."
Everything's been rendered safe.
These guys weren't messing around.
"Hotch, these tubes surround what would be the explosive charge."
And this cylinder right here?
It's gotta be where they put whatever bio or chem agent they plan on dispersing.
- That's a happy thought.
- Yeah.
Tell me about it.
Looks like a 4 man cell.
They assimilated into the community.
Just like any other suburban gangster wannabes rolling at the mall.
Who do you think we're dealing with?
Most likely middle-eastern males in their early twenties.
"Judging by that device out there, they're looking at significant targets:"
"Military installations, government buildings."
You must be the BAU boys.
And gal.
Pardon me.
- I'm Jason Gideon.
"- Andy Bingaman, FBI."
"- Agent Prentiss, Dr. Reid."
- Hi.
I'm the intelligence supervisor here at Gitmo.
You guys having a hard time getting Jind Allah to talk?
"Not only can't they get him to budge, but 2 weeks ago, word got out that one of the other detainees was spilling secrets."
Jind Allah managed to have a 3 minute conversation with him in the shower line.
"That night, the other detainee committed suicide."
He's reciting the Qu'ran from memory.
"In another time, another place, could it have been me?"
"Perhaps, but you're talking about a world without Johnnie."
And that's not a world I'd care to live in.
"Have you ever looked at something and known you want it, want it more than anything you've ever wanted in your life before, and known that it can never be yours?"
"I have, and I tell you, it'll either finish you or put a fire in your belly that'll keep burning to the end of your days."
"I wasn't there at the beginning of the story, but you can bet your bottom dollar I'm not leaving before the end."
Because I know now that it has to be the right sort of ending.
The sort of ending that's worth fighting for.
Miss.
Oh.
Wanna stay and watch it again?
You'll find more in to make you laugh second time round.
I've seen it five times.
"It's our picture, isn't it?"
They're our girls.
"Thanks, but I'd better get back to work."
What's work?
Air-raid wardens.
- They want an outline.
- We haven't got a story yet.
"And they're asking about characters, apart from Hilliard as a cat burglar."
"Three girls, three different walks of life."
I need specifics.
"A nun, a showgirl, a lady wrestler."
"Seriously, you push us now, and that's what you'll get."
Men?
"Well, who else are the girls gonna fall in love with?"
- Each other?
- We've got titles.
Raiders Overhead.
Fires Overhead.
Fire in the Sky.
It's need-to-know.
Initiate the video conference Special Agent Gibbs requested.
Have you figured out why somebody would unbury a body?
That's need-to-know.
"You can't pull that one with me, Jethro."
I'm your boss.
"Iraq standing by, ma'am."
I got your e-mail concerning Lance Corporal Finn.
I assume you've been over his SRB.
"Yeah, we have, Skipper."
We'd like to know what's not on the record.
Finn wasn't one of my stronger Marines.
Wasn't surprised he went UA.
He have any enemies in the company?
He was well-liked.
Played poker.
What can you buy it for down there?
12 cents.
Thanks.
"Well, i'm sure glad to get out of that land of cotton."
"Come on, boys, let's go."
"No, wait a minute."
I'm thinking about that cotton.
We're suckers for running away from a fortune.
"All the cotton mills are up north, but they haven't got any cotton."
"Why, we could get all the cotton we want for 12 cents a pound and smuggle it through."
"In that way, we'd be helping the south by buying it and helping the north by selling it."
And helping ourselves to $1.88 for every pound we can lay our hands on.
Wait a minute-i ain't going back down south there for no $1.88.
"You're going up north, luke."
You're going to drive to boston as fast as you can get there and open up an office.
"Nick and me are going back to dixie, and we're gonna ship you all the cotton we can lay our hands on."
Will you join forces with me?
Then there will be nothing we can't achieve.
Do not beg for your life so pathetically with your vile tongue.
"Countless people, including myself, have suffered a life more miserable than death because of you."
"Even if I forget those days,"
I could never be rid of this grudge inside me.
Now...
I will put an end to your shameful life.
Kill me.
Boss.
"In your next life, please live your life for those poor souls whose lives you have taken."
"I have finally gotten the revenge I've dreamed of, but I don't understand why I feel so heavy-hearted."
Don't be confused.
"Yi Do-hyung's life was marred by many people's grudges, but you could live a life to benefit those who suffer."
And I believe you can do just that.
"Shouldn't we cut off Yi Do-hyung's head, and display it at the marketplace?"
That will appease the grudges of some of the people.
Leave his body here for Yum Moon to see.
"We will have the upper hand in a battle with Yum Moon, if he goes berserk after seeing Master Yi's corpse."
We will return to Chunghae and regroup for now.
All right.
We have secured enough food and weapons.
We must pull out before the reinforcements get here.
All right.
Head Chief.
It seems that Joong-dal and Chun-tae have run away.
I will send men after them.
We will pull out without them.
Master...
Master.
Master.
Master!
- Wholesale.
No girl ever had two better friends than you and Allison.
"When you see how hard Mother makes you work, you won't say that."
- Rodney's outside.
"- Good, let him wait."
You'll be arrested for wearing that.
"No, just picked up."
Mother says women should be mysterious.
- Do you think the dress is too old?
"- No, you're too young."
Won't people think you're a little fast?
"According to my philosophy, what other people think will not pay the rent."
"If you're accused of being fast, might as well run."
Get the good things first.
"Just remember, men can see much better than they can think."
"Believe me, a low-cut neckline does more for a girl's future than the entire Britannica encyclopedia."
"- Allison, could you help me a moment?"
- Sure.
- Be right back.
- Do you think Rod will like it?
When you have your 18th birthday party I don't want you to invite Betty Anderson.
I might as well not have a party.
"If I can't invite Betty, Rodney won't come."
I wouldn't mind that.
"If Rodney won't come, his friends won't."
Then nobody will accept.
I can't understand why you want to be friends with Betty.
I don't like the way she talks about men and sex.
It appears the only perfect individual is you.
We've had 17 dull birthday parties alone.
"Could you let me have one for myself, please?"
"Allison, what about Betty?"
- What about the Raiders?
Are they a lock?
- Nothing's a lock.
"Tim Brown said that he was gonna back channel for us, but we both know that words without actions, that doesn't amount to shit."
Is my hungover brain playing a trick on me or is the legendary maverick Spencer Strasmore second-guessing himself?
"It's called pragmatism, Joe."
"Oh, yeah, you pragmatic?"
"( chuckles ) Oh, that's a new one."
"Virginia, he just called himself pragmatic."
"I am, and let me tell you something, it's not a me thing;"
"it's a we thing, okay?"
"I need you to know you go in on this, shit could get pretty steep."
"Why are you such a masochist, man, huh?"
We got a great business going here.
I'll give you two billion reasons why.
No.
"No, no, no."
That's not you.
"That's the way I would do it, sure, but you've never been just about the bucks."
"Okay, how about paying back Ricky and Vernon?"
"Good, honorable."
I like that one.
"Usually, that would stick, but I don't believe you."
How about this one?
Fuck the powers that be.
"Huh, there he is."
Vintage Spencer Strasmore.
"I'm all about good over evil, Joe."
"Mm-hmm, but just so I know in this particular scenario,"
- are we the good or are we the evil?
- We're always the good.
"Against the evil empire, we are always the good."
That's dividends for the josie mansfield corporation.
If i had a thousand lives to live in revelry i'd live them
aah!
Once there was a man taught me how to love
parted
"that's jim fisk, everybody!"
He's the biggest thief in new york!
He robbed the erie to put on this show!
He built this place with our money!
"You bought this opera house with our money, fisk!"
We'll show you up!
You return that money!
Who pays for josie mansfield's diamonds?
The stockholders!
"How did you get the money for this show, jim fisk?"
Jim's just a thief!
You robbed the stockholders!
"Whenever you get your head above the clouds, somebody's jealous, somebody wants to throw stones."
Laugh at 'em like i do.
The trouble is we're not holding our heads high enough.
They can still reach us.
Do you suppose they would have dared make fun of old vanderbilt like they did you and me?
Not by a jugful!
We're going to climb higher- all of us!
We're going to climb so high that they'll have to break their necks looking at us!
There's only one way to do it-money.
I'm going to build a throne of gold and put you on it.
"Jim, what are you talking about?"
Gold!
I wear a couple of tinhorn sports chasing paper money.
Greenbacks are nothing but notes that uncle sam writes on to tell us he's got the gold.
I want what they stand for-all of it!
95th Rifles.
Only a lieutenant?
Perhaps they do not promote you because you fight with your men?
"That man is a mutineer, sir."
He'll be taken back to Lisbon and shot.
"Tongue, tie him up and take him to the barn."
"Spain and England, we are allies."
TERESA What are you doing here?
"Don't tell me a stupid lie about being lost 100 miles behind French lines, Lieutenant."
We're looking for the village of Casa Antigua.
That is all I can tell you.
"If you were French, I would take a knife and you would tell me all I wanted to know."
But we are allies.
Allies?
Do allies keep secrets from each other?
"Lovers keep secrets from each other, yet they still make love."
Er...
Perhaps... perhaps we can help each other
That is what allies are for.
Good.
"I'm on my way north to the town of Torrecastro, carrying important documents from my government to those who resist the French."
"The village of Casa Antigua is on our way north, so we can travel together... under my command."
I thought she was in command?
Teresa is seeing us safely through the mountains
Now'm the senior officer here
Do you agree to travel under my command?
Yeah.
OTHER MEN Yean
- I think your men agree.
You ask your men what to do?
Yes.
"I don't always do it, but I ask."
I don't know the answer.
We're a family through choice.
"I mean, if we care about each other, it's because we decide to, not because we happen to be related through some fluke of a father that happened to have these children."
Yeah.
"What were you thinking, Lou?"
I've been to most of your buildings now.
India and Bangladesh will be the last.
I like your Exeter Library.
It looks a lot like the factory buildings you walked by as a little boy back in Philadelphia.
But nobody expects what you did inside.
I always believed that in the end you'd chosen my mother and me.
That was the myth I lived on.
"But you didn't really choose any of us, did you?"
Did you think that Lou would marry you?
"Yes, and I didn't expect to get pregnant, and I was really surprised when I told Lou, and then his comment was, you know, ""Not again."""
So I certainly thought when I told him that he would... that he would in some way do something to help me.
"""Not again"" meaning what?"
"Well, that this had happened to him before with Alex."
- You know.
- With Anne?
"Yeah, with Anne."
"Well, didn't you know what you were getting into?"
"Oh, come on, Nathaniel."
"Well, I just..."
"I mean, you know."
You always protect him.
"That's hard, you know?"
"I mean, he was..."
- I did trust him.
I was pretty stupid.
"- You know mom, what he did to you and I"
"- was... was pretty bad, really."
"It had an ""H"" on it!"
"Somebody else's name might have started with the letter ""H"", mightn't it?"
"That was a risk you were ready to take because you're that kind of person, Iris."
"You're only two days out of prison for maiming a policeman, for heaven's sake!"
This is what they did to my Thomas.
"You lot, you forced a confession out of him!"
"Well, you'll not put any words in my mouth."
Just looking for a picture of your father.
There aren't any.
Oh.
Why?
I know Vernon was a libertarian.
I know he opposed your marriage to Henry.
"What's this about, Father?"
"I understand your father left you a quite substantial sum, to be withheld until such time as Henry Lee was no longer your lawful husband."
"My father's money has nothing whatsoever to do with Henry, or me, or you!"
Mrs McCarthy?
Good gracious!
Anyone would think you were spying on those two.
Why ever would I do that?
I have no idea.
I fear I may have found our culprit.
"Upon Henry Lee's death, it turns out that Edie is entitled to her father's not insubstantial inheritance."
Inheritance?
But that makes no sense.
"When Henry was about to drink that cup of tea,"
Edie was begging me to give her some business.
She was almost in tears.
"Now, Edie Lee is a proud, proud woman."
She'd never humiliate herself like that if what you say is true.
I see.
"Oh, dear."
From the start.
The size of the Core is approx 1/1000 of the atom itself..
The biggest part of the atom is empty space
"Before the collision, the positive electrones moves freely several centimeter"
-Millimeters
-Several Millimeters...
Even in an dense metall as uranium.
We calculated to much uranium for a bomb beeing possible
One uranium lump The size of a pee
Heres the positive electrons surface
- And just wanishes without colliding with new cores.
"With a bigger uranium lump, every possitive atom reaches a new core."
-And the chain reaction starts!
Thats correct.
Wrong.
"For a bomb, an 10kg uranium piece should suffice."
10 kilogram?
Then we have calculated wrong?
How could that happen?
Up..
And chin straight.
Come.
What did he say?
We will attend
The finest consert ever to be played here.
I'll pay the ferry on sunday
"Rolf and Knut will pick you up with a car tonight, just the three of you."
"Four gards on the piere There wont likely be any guards on the boat,-"
-But the ferry crew sleeps there sometimes.
The raft is ready 4000m from the dock
"It is no problem, getting there unseen."
"- But from the boat, its critical"
You never scolded me before.
Without me... you got no standing on the market.
"Everywhere, you will get a no"
And what's this?
Do I see anger?
Are you taking it out on the baby?
Change of philosophy?
Love isn't more powerful than money.
"Brothers... one left for America, one for Bangalore"
"You called me a loner, didn't you?"
And how long have I been telling you that brothers never stick together
Brothers together.
"Just verbiage, not in real life"
"Yes honey, coming"
Tanya and I are going to see the architect
We're building a five star hotel in place of your house
"Day after day, trying to piece my life together... resolving to start life anew... but what can I do?"
It all lies in ruins
"With my five-year old son, I wander the streets."
Aimlessly
I told you!
KK-Mix is dead!
Now get out
Have you come to pay me tributes?
"Where are the garlands, the bouquets?"
We'd like to know why you haven't scored an album in four years?
Four years ago...
I was a star.
"I was a thief, I stole songs"
At least I have the satisfaction of not being a thief anymore
That was KK-Mix superhit singer and music director
"No, you haven't come congratulating me... you've come to rub salt into my wounds"
Yeah.
I guess he does.
Thanks for being there for me.
"Your Grandad's waiting for you, love."
OK.
"Laters, George."
All the best for today.
You sure you don't want us to come?
"No, we'll keep it just family."
"I'll see you at the after-match though, eh?"
Absolutely.
You OK?
Yeah.
"Actually, I... ..I'm better than I've been in a long time."
"Life goes on, eh?"
Someone's busy.
Just finishing my editorial.
"OK, and what's it about?"
You'll have to wait and see.
"Ooh, fighting talk!"
"Hey, you better scoot or you're going to be late for that press conference."
What press conference?
"I've called you all here today to announce that our extensive investigation into the crash that caused the death of Trina Joy McNamara has concluded, and we have determined that Mrs McNamara died on September 12, 2008 after leaving the road in a storm on her way back to Weld."
Are there any questions?
"Yes, Mr Turner?"
Has foul play definitely been ruled out?
Absolutely.
The idea of anyone tampering with Trina's car so it fortuitously drove off a cliff in a storm is the stuff of films.
And it was definitely a stormy night when the accident happened?
"Ah, there are some suggestions that it was overcast but possibly verging on storming."
Next question?
And she was definitely returning to Weld?
really?
"You know, Jean-MicheI, we question these things too."
constantly.
"With a degree in psychosocioIogy, what are our options?"
"One is the System, with a capital S:"
"marketing or advertising and a fat paycheck, and lots of what you call manipulation."
Another is the system with a lowercase S:
"research, academia, and places like this, the Ministry of the Future."
What should we do?
"- Okay, I get it."
"Raise sheep in the boonies, or join the system to throw a monkey wrench in it?"
"What we,re really interested in, what I care about, is how perverse the social sciences can be."
"For exampIe, we both used to work in an asylum."
"We changed quite a few things, even on an everyday level."
"We don,t want to make problems."
"Check ,happy.,"
"I,II check whatever you Iike."
"I just don,t understand why you refused to cooperate."
"We didn,t."
It just felt like you expected a certain answer.
"That,s right!"
What answer?
"I don,t know."
"Why isn,t there a box for ,fairly happy,?"
"We have ,mostly happy, don,t we?"
"It,s not the same!"
"We can,t have dozens of options."
"If we say ,fairly happy, which box do you check?"
This is all quibbIing over words.
"It,s just a check box, not The Brothers Karamazov!"
"That option isn,t offered."
"It,s a pity, but that,s how it is."
I never met a mother who thought their child was guilty.
But do you think she could have taken her frustration out on you?
It's possible.
"Henry, while there is still time,"
I will do all that I can to find out who did this.
I give you my word.
Father.
George.
Please don't tell me he's dead.
The Lord in his infinite compassion has given Henry more time to say his goodbyes.
I've been praying for some kind of miracle.
"You get on well with Henry, don't you?"
"When we met in the Red Lion a year ago, I was a typical ex-copper."
"Drunk, broken marriage, fast heading for a hole in the ground."
"Henry had just given up the hanging job, so he wasn't feeling too great himself."
But he insisted he wanted to help me.
He put a spade in my hand and introduced me to the joys of nature.
"The Good Samaritan, eh?"
George.
Sorry about this but I'm going to have to bring you in.
Why?
My colleagues found hemlock in your house.
George is no murderer.
"Well, it's not looking good for him."
"No, it isn't."
"What do you think, Father?"
Hemlock.
Strange choice of poison.
"It paralyses the body slowly but leaves the mind untouched, which means it increases the chance the culprit will be identified."
George would have known that there are much more clinical toxins.
But if he was the only person to touch the teacup...
"Well, actually we're not sure that he was."
He's not about to fly anywhere.
"Agents David, DiNozzo, anything?"
Abby found drugs in Petty Officer Adams' system that probably impaired him before he died.
Abby and McGee are currently testing sailors to see if...
There they are.
Video conference.
"Ziva, put it up."
"Hi, Ziva, I..."
"Whoa, hi, everybody."
What's the latest?
"Out of 215 sailors on shore leave, three of them tested positive for some kind of sedative."
"It's too soon to know if it was the same drug, but if I was a betting' man..."
"Interview them there, find out if any of them were with Adams before he died."
"On it, boss."
Over and out.
I love to say that.
"All right, keep me in the loop."
"Like I could keep you out of it, Leon?"
"I was in this bar, you know, having fun but thinking about where to hit next."
"A bunch of guys were heading to this... you know, gentlemen's club across town."
Go on.
"Well, then we, we hear this guy bragging about how he just won a ton of cash playing blackjack."
"I've never been to Vegas, much less a casino, so I figured, what the hell?"
Let's make it rain.
"Bad idea, huh?"
I lost every dime of liberty pay inside an hour.
- Who was this guy?
- Who knows?
"Actually, I heard it from a friend who heard it from somebody else."
The night was a blur.
I swear that's the last time I ever gamble this messed up.
Where was this casino?
Still is.
"I mean, every guy who meets Maggie falls madly in love with her."
And that's the problem.
"Since I've known her, she's only been single for, like, three brief windows of opportunity."
TED:
"When she moved here and broke up with her college boyfriend,"
I waited a month.
"You know, so I wouldn't be the rebound guy."
"Well, the rebound guy lasted two years."
This is Dave.
TED:
"After they broke up, I only waited a week."
I was still too late.
She dated that guy for three years.
"The next time, I wasn't messing around."
I was at her door not one hour after they broke up.
"The only thing she did between becoming single and the moment I got there, was go downstairs and check her mail."
I was still too late.
And she dated that guy for four years.
"I wasn't going to let this happen again, so I begged her neighbor, Mrs. Douglas, to call me the second she and David broke up."
"And now, a very single and available Maggie Wilks is on her way to this very spot."
I sent a cab with a female driver so she'd have no other interaction with a man until she got to me.
Where she will still have no interaction with a man.
What up?
I feel good tonight.
Tonight's going to be good.
"Oh, hell, yeah!"
It's my overalls.
I wore these babies all throughout high school.
These were my jam.
"God, you really were a virgin before you met Lily, weren't you?"
(LILY CHUCKLING)
He's the one I told you about.
"Oh, the Dwayne Pride."
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Hannah Lee.
I'm with the U.S. attorney's office.
"I.E., don't piss her off."
We flew down here yesterday together from D.C.
Nice to meet you.
Helping out with the Javier Garcia investigation?
"Hoping to build a case against him, so I can petition the grand jury for an indictment."
Cut the snake off at the head and get the cartel out of NOLA once and for all.
They don't call it NOLA down here.
They prefer New Orleans.
"Oh, glad to see we made an impression on you, Gregorio."
"Oh, absolutely."
(Pride chuckles)
You come bearing gifts?
"Uh, actually, Garcia does."
"Bourbon, as a thank you, for helping us save his son's school last week."
This is expensive stuff.
I'd say that's more of a bribe.
"Yeah, why I brought it over."
Thought you'd want to log it as evidence.
How's Sebastian?
"I bet he's so excited to be a part of the team, huh?"
"Not part of it yet, still has to make it through FLETC training, which means, until he does, we're short-handed again."
I'm sorry to leave you high and dry.
Yeah.
"But look, if you need any help, just let me know, all right?"
Okay.
Except that I don't think that you can.
"Director Isler made it pretty clear to me that we are only down here to build the case against Garcia, and then (beeping) it's back to D.C. for good."
And alcohol.
"All right, thanks, dude."
"All right, so HPD checked all the locations that Holm was surveilling, no sign of Addison."
"Okay, so this guy, he abducts Addison for a specific reason, but it's not 'cause she's young and pretty."
No.
It's because she's got something that she's hiding and this guy wants to expose her.
"Exactly, that's what he does, he prowls the Internet looking for victims who have dark secrets and then he forces them to confess 'cause... what, he's a vigilante with a god complex."
"No, this guy's face is all over the news."
"Okay, and that is why he didn't take her to any of those spots, right?"
"I mean, he's smart, he knows we'd be on 'em."
"He's smart, he's also a psychopath."
I'm not looking forward to seeing what this guy does now that his back's against the wall.
Please.
I don't want to die.
I'm not the one who's a murderer.
KONO:
This link was just posted to Addison's profile page.
It's a Web stream.
It's about to go live.
Toast?
I'm on it.
My name is Addison Wells.
"As most of you know, I was kidnapped last night."
But what you don't know is the reason why.
"For years now, Toast, talk to me."
I've been keeping a secret.
He's got the feed on a five-second relay.
It's being bounced off proxy servers all over the world.
"run from it, put it behind me, Well, can you trace it?"
but I wrong.
I could if I had a few hours.
I moved to Hawaii...
Think it's good for him to watch that video.
"I mean, it's... worth more than a conviction, right?"
"Grady Burgess had the patients' videos, the files, the pento, the whole operation."
We have enough evidence to close off all three cases.
We seized $1.2 million in drugs from Burgess's place.
Thought the chief was gonna plant a big wet one on me.
"Yeah, hopefully got Des on the accessory charge, so that's good."
"Eh, if it all works out."
"You know, put his ass in jail for a while."
Although his lawyer did request our files.
"As for Mary, she'll be crazy to counsel anyone ever again."
Yeah.
"Yeah, she would be crazy."
"I don't know if anyone's ever gonna see this, but I, Ethan Grant, choose to take my life."
Can I say more?
Can I say why?
"I want my family to know, there's nothing that I would've done differently, so please, forget about the trials..."
and the treatments and...
And that one more year that I didn't get.
Just... just know that...
That I love you all.
I have no regrets.
Are you ever gonna talk to me again?
Talking to you right now.
"I didn't mean to start a fight with you, Jess."
I didn't mean for any of it.
"I just thought we were... experimenting, or whatever."
"I guess it started that way, but..."
I thought it was more than that.
"Well, it... wasn't..."
for me.
"And that maybe sounds bitchy or something, but I'm just being honest."
Because the grownups' chatter wasn't enjoyable.
Let's eat their souvenir.
Tateo... don't you find it strange?
Why do they hide everything about Grandpa?
"To put it nicely, they do that out of consideration for Suzujiro and clark."
"And to put it not nicely, it's sort of a diplomatic tactic and calculation."
"To put it straight, they don't want to ruin the relationship... with that rich family that they've suddenly got."

You mean that Grandma is just being used as an excuse?
That's terrible.
That's the reality of being a grownup.
"still, I hate it."
Can you take it?
Me?
Count me out.
I'm going to concentrate on this.
"At any rate, the pineapple farm is tremendously vast."
It has eight thousand and some hundred acres.
There are six huge chimneys soaring up from the canning factory.
There is this huge swimming pool in the patio of the house.
clark's wife got a swimsuit out for me to use.
"But you see, I can't swim."
"And clark took us on a tour of the factory, too."
Did you know the factory's agency is in Tokyo?
I know that.
They've got agencies in every big city in the world.
"tell me, what is clark's wife like?"
A very nice person.
So different from rich Japanese wives.
"She broke down all reserve in no time, and looked after us like her family."
And why not?
"After all, you are a blood relative."
"May they know his mercy, his comfort and his peace."
"May we uphold them with our prayers, encourage them with our letters honor them with our love."
"And may our lives, not less than theirs be dedicated to that same Lord who alone can give to life a perfect freedom and a final peace."
Let us pray.
"Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be thy name."
"Thy kingdom come thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
"Gives us this day, our daily bread and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever."
Amen.
Thank you.
Come again.
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Cross.
Selena.
"Miss Cross, you have a father in the Navy."
Lucas Augustus Cross?
My stepfather.
Have you seen him lately?
Not for a year and a half.
What's wrong?
He went on leave and didn't come back.
He's listed as a deserter.
"Miss Cross, you're sure you haven't seen him?"
I didn't even know that he was in the Navy.
- He hasn't called or written you?
- No.
"He disappeared from town a year and a half ago, deserting his family."
Looks like he's running true to form.
"If you do hear from him, get in touch with the First District Shore Patrol."
I will.
"Selena, don't get upset."
It's not your fault they can't find him.
What is it?
You use the studio whenever you want as long as you show whatever you finish.
"And in return I might, might unclench long enough to not freak out when you show my art to the world."
"You know that looking at him all the time isn't exactly going to discourage him, right?"
What?
And it's a deal about the studio.
And the Ike thing is all sorted.
Is it?
Yeah.
"So, what are you two women of the art world plotting over here?"
"Well, let's just say we're forming a support group and women artists of Weld unite."
Sounds excellent.
"Speaking of support, I might go see how Arlo's doing."
"So, how's Shay going with your gallery?"
I think we going to be just fine.
Great.

And I did.
And?
"I found the dolphin allegory somewhat surprising at first but ultimately quite moving, and entirely consistent with the theme of life going on even in the shadow of death."
I illustrated it with Tom's photo of the flowers by the roadside.
Bloodless.
"But in Scotland, there was blood aplenty."
Several northern nobles remained faithful to James.
"One of these Jacobites was john Graham of Claverhouse, now the Viscount Dundee."
"Claverhouse went north, formed an army, won a decisive victory at Killiecrankie, and died of his wounds on the battlefield."
"The first Jacobite rebellion died with him, but its body twitched for some time after."
It took several months to crush the Jacobite garrison in Edinburgh Castle.
But the garrison here held out longest of all.
So it was on the Bass Rock that the Stuart dynasty finally lost its grip on power.
"At last, there was a kind of peace."
The moderate remnants of the Presbyterians reached a compromise with King William.
"Bishops were abolished, and the Presbyterians resumed control of the Church of Scotland."
But they were deceiving themselves.
They were the Church of southern Scotland.
"Because in the north, loyalty to the older kind of God-anointed king remained in force."
"The split in the Kirk was a split in the country, an unheated wound, and the Stuarts, of course, were far from dead."

"There really is rather a lot to fill you in on, and we really do not have the time."
- What about...
"- Kendra, yes, we need your assistance in locating her and Savage."
Perhaps we can start with what Savage was doing in 1944.
"He said something about, um..."
Thanagarian technology.
- Thanagarian...
- The Thanagarians were race of extraterrestrials.
He also said that this technology was actually three meteors.
"Captain, I have surveillance footage which might be relevant."
"Thank you, Gideon."
I've seen that rock before.
Savage had one of those in 1958.
He took our blood.
"He said he would use it in a ritual to erase time, take the blood back to 1700 B.C."
- What are you doing?
"- Come on, man."
We got to try it again.
That thing that we did in World War II.

"OK, I will give them a collection that they will never forget."
Yes.
"I will, I will... wrap everything, cover it, and I will call it my burkha collection."
"Yes, and then I will rip everything to shreds as if a burkha was hit by a bomb."
"This is East/West, you see, in one."
"Brilliant, no?"
"But my backer, my business manager, my public relations people, they all will say no."
Why should I listen to their opinions?
"Because, Michelangelo, they control the finance."
"Therefore, they only think about what will sell."
What will sell a perfume.
"Second, they are afraid it might offend."
They don't want to upset people.
People like me.
Not because they care about our feelings but because they are afraid of us.
Do you understand?
"And, suddenly, my designs, they must attract people under 12!"
What are they thinking of?
"Suddenly, my designs must attract children?"
"I mean, children!"
"No offence to you, Michelangelo."
I mean no offence to you.
I am very fond of children.
"I was once a child, too, but not for long."
"You have to grow up fast where I came from, very fast."
"Yes, Michelangelo, a very successful meeting."
Sometimes you just have to be firm with designers.
Bet you no one's told you that.
"Yeah, yeah."
"Yep, don't let that worry you none too much."
"You know, are you lonely for a car?"
I get lonely when I don't have a car.
"But I'm not lonely anymore, 'cause at Diaz Motors I've got plenty of friends."
You don't got to knock.
I know what you're after.
Come on in.
Yeah?
You are scared shitless.
What did you know about that?
There's just the matter of this job you come to do.
"Six reported incidences of harassing motorists, two with brutality."
"Then there's you, crossing the line."
"No, that ain't it."
"It's been a long time coming, Leland, the way you've been running things."
"If you ain't scared of what needs to be done, then you ain't got no clue why you're here."
I got sent here to replace you.
"Maybe a day too late, but replace you nonetheless."
"You got sent here because it's your punishment, Wallace."
"Taking your statement, is all."
"You fetch me some water, would you?"
Hmm?
Hm.
You have no idea what that... that boy Clive was threatening to bring.
"These horrible people doing immoral things, and now they're creeping across the border, threatening to make the boogeyman a real thing."
It's enough to give you a good start.

"I wanted to be a nursery teacher, but I could barely study."
"I thought about hostess work, but I didn't want the town knowing."
So you chose porn?
I saw an online ad for a porn gig in Tokyo.
"I knew it'd be tough, but they pay for travel, so I applied."
They replied and said the director can meet me nearby.
He's known for doing POV videos with amateur girls on the road.
"They agreed to blur my face, and paid 150,000 yen."

That's why my family is with me and that's why you're a loner
You are with me.
"Because of Love, Not for money"
"Viking calling Yacht club, over."
"Yacht club, Yacht club answering, go ahead Viking."
"Miss, call the police Inspector, advise him that I am chasing the yacht, of the S.O.S. organisation, twelve miles high, by the Salty Estuary, twelve miles, over"
"Understood, Mr. Dinamo."
"Understood, out."
"One moment, we will finish him my way, fetch the girl!"
untie her.
"here, were he can see her."
"Mr. Dinamo, get closer if you dont't want something to happen to your partner."
"Hide your weapons, when he gets close,we will anihilate him."
"Fire, finish them!"
"Attention, amphibian fly to HQ,"
Go ahead fly.
"We are ready at the estuary to carry out plan two,"
"We are ready at the estuary to carry out plan two,"
"Plane one is in the air, over."
Deploy the amphibian and prepare rockets for action.
"Alert the coast guard, be alert."
lets go.
Carefull with that grenade!
"rudder full starboard, rudder full starboard!"
"ram the girl, ram the girl!"
"She must not escape, ram the girl!"
"Attention, this is amphibian fly, amphibian fly to HQ, over."
"Respond, what is happening?"
"Take care of that boat while we disenbark at the landing strip,"
Take care of that boat while we disenbark at the landing strip.
I got you!
Fire.
Fire!
You are crazy!
They would anihilate us all!
If you know what I'm saying?
"In fact, I've got something here you could use."
"I bought it for myself, but I think your need is greater."
-What is she going to bring out now?
"-No, I'm serious."
This'll be the perfect thing for you.
It's a candle.
"You light that for about 1 0 minutes, Just let it fill the room."
It's very sensual and very erotic.
ALICE:
"Well, that was a complete waste of time."
I've made myself feel totally sick now.
You should never try and achieve ecstasy on top of Horlicks.
The trouble is I get a sexual fantasy in my head and then I can't hold on to it.
My brain keeps wandering off.
"Like, I was just in the middle of this really exciting, intense, erotic act... and then I started worrying if it was illegal in certain states of America."
"And then for some reason or other, Ted Rogers appeared... doing that thing with his fingers."
Then after that it was just hopeless.
My dad always said I had a butterfly mind.
If only I could learn to concentrate.
1 2.:50.
I can't believe that dream I was just having.
It was so weird.
"God, when do I ever wake up physically aroused?"
Never.
"Maybe if I just empty out my mind and... completely relax, I can get back there again."
Gil.
Irene.
-How did you get in here?
-Through the front door.
"I've got all your keys, the alarm system."
"Look, I know this probably seems like a strange moment to call around for a chat, but...."
"No, it's just all the chaos and destruction in town makes me feel romantic."
"If we had walked over a power line,"
Andy might've gotten lucky right there and then.
Ooh!
[ Laughs ]
"Wow, sounds like the power's still out almost everywhere in town."
"A pipe burst and flooded the gym at the high school, and they were having their prom tonight."
"So I called the school and I said,"
"""Prom's on tonight, free of charge, right here at Gray's pub."""
- [ Laughs ]
- Yeah.
Laugh it up.
I have to close the bar early and fill it with streamers and balloons for a bunch of kids who aren't paying a dime.
- It's so funny.
- Sucks to be you right now.
It does.
[ Gasps ]
"Oh, Jules, is there a small detail you might've left out?"
I signed us all up as chaperones.
Oh.
They don't seem very excited.
I'm sure they'll be better when they realize they can just stand around and drink all night.
- Oh.
Well...
- Oh!
They can't!
Because the high school's making me take all the liquor out of my bar for the night!
- It'll be fun?
- I will kill you.
"This whole prom idea is so lame, right?"
"Well, it depends on who you were in high school-- a pasty young dork with more zits than friends, or a dashing babehound with dance moves so smooth they almost sent a teacher to jail."
Mrs. Pritchett loved my dancing so much that she asked me over to give her a dance lesson.
-A man named Spike Milligan.
"Oh, yeah, I think Dad's got a load of his books."
'Cause that's another thing.
No one I know ever reads.
I know.
It's one of the best things there is.
To lose yourself in a good book.
In fact... there's one I'm definitely going to lend you when I'm finished because...
I think you'd get a lot out of it.
Unspeakable.
Truly unspeakable.
It was just how I felt.
It makes one despair.
But... you cannot possibly know what I was reading.
"From your reaction, it can only have been that letter from some old colonel in Oxshott, or wherever it was, expressing support for America's adventures in the Philippines."
"Which any sane person knows is an act of the purest imperialism and he concludes with the comment,"
"""War is heck but they must not weaken in their resolve."""
"Can you imagine the warped morality of any man alive who would use the words ""war is heck""?"
I just thank heaven he is not my husband.
Just as everyday I thank heaven that you and I are together and that life is as perfect as it can be.
What is it?
What's wrong?
"No, no."
It's nothing at all.
"As you say, as perfect as it can be."
Some more tea?
GIL:
What am I doing here?
I'll probably find it was someone called Bill she wanted to see and she just didn't have her teeth in.
"But listen, it's an hour of my time and..."
maybe she just needs cheering up.
Er...
Don't!
No!
Let go of me!
Let go!
- Casey!
"- Mom, Mom, please."
"Please, this is for her own good."
Let me go!
You can't!
You'll kill her.
You can't take her.
You'll kill her.
"- Casey, Casey!"
"- Mom, Mom, please."
"Please, it's for her own good."
"Can we clear the hallway, please?"
"Mr. and Mrs. Rance, I know this is a very difficult moment for you."
Please know that everyone here is here for you.
"If there's anything we can do, you just let us know."
Your daughter's on the way to the hospital.
She's gonna receive the very best care available.
"But we're really gonna need to talk about what happened here tonight,"
Mr. and Mrs. Rance.
"724, this is dispatch, over."
"724, this is dispatch, come in."
"Breaking news now, the Andersonville family of a missing young woman is fearing the worst this evening after her disappearance two nights ago after a deadly ambulance crash."
Casey Rance was being transported to a local hospital when her ambulance suffered a bizarre and deadly crash.
"Authorities have declined to state the nature of Miss Rance's underlying illness, but they have issued every assurance that she will be found."
"As police superintendent and as a father with children of my own, I can guarantee no one here will rest until Casey is safely brought home to her family."
Ipse venit.
Himself... is coming.
He... is coming.
You weren't there.
"You don't know, but I know."
"She had H.D.H.D. because of what I did, and then these rages started."
She has them over nothing.
And someone told you that her behavior was related to your drug use?
"The school counselor said that it's adolescence, but I know what it is."
"I've read enough, and she's been tested and tested and... and there's nothing else."
It's me.
"Michelle... look, I know that you feel guilty and that you feel hurt and that you would do anything to change what happened, to change how you're feeling right now."
But sometimes... you just have to push forward.
Darren is the strong one.
I want to talk to him.
"We've been through all of this together, and without him, I can't do it."
I can't.
"He's in a coma, and then..."
Tammy's gonna be taken away.
I'm just losing everyone I love.
"We had a therapeutic fencing match, and I lost."
"She distracted me with the baby, who is quite winning and has my ears."
They're my ears.
What am I gonna do now?
Can I make an observation?
I don't know.
Can you?
"I know you're upset, so I'm just gonna ignore that."
"You told Violet you were going to leave, and you never did."
"You know, you talk, you send people over."
Violet's smart.
She knows she doesn't have twalk out that door because you are always gonna walk back in.
Definitely my ears.
Hey.
There's a juvie officer here that wants to take Tammy.
Father?
"Yes, it's me,"
Juan.
"""Juan had seen the future... and he couldn't live with it""."
Are you sure you don't want to work for us?
"I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer to return to my own time."
"If you have something to tell me, say it."
I'm letting you know that if you go back... nothing good awaits you.
"I'm going to die,right?"
It doesn't matter.
"I want to see my child grow even if it's just for one more day, that's worth anything that could happen to me."
Thank you for everything.
-Good luck.
"""I, like Juan, also wanted to know my future."""
At the store they told me that my house was abandoned and that they didn't know anything about my family.
So I was left with only one way to find out anything.
"I never should have done it""."
Yes?
"There's a man here with a court summons in my name, as the head of the Ministry."
That's not possible.
This ministry is secret from the state.
"-I have come to defend the interests of the direct decedents of rabbi Abraham Levi, author or ""The Book of Doors""."
It's you.
-Will you protect my family?
"-Five days, not one more."
"On the next day, this Ministry will no longer be a secret."
And what are we going to do?
You must travel to 1491 and save the rabbi from the stake.
What are we waiting for?
It's not that easy.
(ERNESTO) Door 148 is in a permanent time loop.
"You mean, like Groundhog Day, but in medieval times."
He got picked up on an old assault charge and released.
Are you gonna bring him in again?
Is he being extradited?
I don't think so.
I heard they called it off.
Why'd they call it off?
Our Attorney General thinks you don't have the evidence you need for us to hand him over.
That gives me more time.
"You've been inside the Chickadee, you know the club."
Where is Reardon staying when he stays overnight?
Is there an apartment there on top?
That's a good question.
I think so.
Don't remember exactly but I could find that out for you.
Yeah.
Do that.
You ever gonna tell me who you're working for?
- Probably not.
"- Well, you're not DEA..."
"You're not a bounty hunter, 'cause there's no bounty on him."
- I'm working for a private contractor.
- What's their interest?
That's all you wanna know.
You don't wanna dig deeper.
As long as someone pays me.
I'm gonna guess cash is okay with you.
I want the whole layout of the nightclub.
The Blackmire Group report you asked for.
It includes the FBI brief.
"And what are the FBI's concerns, exactly?"
"They're worried American economic interests are being jeopardised by Blackmire's partnering with companies in China, Russia and the Middle East."
"They've got their eye on intellectual property and patent theft, the illegal flight of capital to cheap labour markets..."
That being said...
-it is a horse.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?
The only other time you've become this emotional in here...
-it was those ducks.
-That was a whole different thing.
-They were ducks.
-Is it different?
You haven't grieved in this way for people.
"Your mother, your best friend."
Can't I just be sad for a horse without some touchy-feely...
Freudian shit component to it?
"When it was the ducks, it embodied feelings of dread... about your family, that something terrible was going to happen."
It's just the miserable way she died.
It just makes me wonder what kind of fucking toilet world we live in.
"A friend of the family, little boy... gets shot with an arrow, cuts off the flow of blood to his brain."
Thirteen years old.
"He's going to live, but he's never gonna be right."
-How awful for the parents.
-Yeah.
My nephew.
I love that kid like I love my son.
"But I think he's got a drug problem, heroin."
"It kills me just to say it, because I got so many hopes tied up in this kid."
This is Christopher?
"This 9/11 shit, I don't know."
The shit that's going on everywhere.
It's like some fucking asshole is stalking the human race.
"Anthony, do any of your associates think about any of this?"
"I don't know, we don't talk about it."
"I know it's fucking ridiculous, but I feel like the reverend Rodney King Jr., you know?"
"-""Why can't we all just get along?"""
"My name's Andy, I'm a data analyst from London."
"And my name's Dorian, I'm a private mathematics and English tutor from Bath."
"Well, welcome to both of you, these are pretty esoteric names for teams, I have to say."
"Lutrophiles, a love of...?"
Otters.
Why?
"Er, I was badgered into it."
THEY LAUGH
"Go on, why have you chosen otters?"
There has to be some reason.
"I quite like otters really, and I pushed for it a bit."
"They really like otters too, but they're just pretending they're indifferent."
I was told that it was a lover of Paris.
But I think that's a Lutetia-phile.
My goodness!
"And Pascallywags, why is that?"
"Well, because the two of us over here studied mathematics and we have a philosopher to my right and Pascal was a very famous and influential mathematician and philosopher."
Blaise Pascal?
"Yes, indeed."
"Rob, I have to ask you because a little bird told me that as a teenager you had lessons in lion taming."
I did.
So what did you learn?
I didn't learn an awful amount.
"Or an awful lot, to be honest."
But I had a couple of informal lessons.
And did you ever get into the ring with them?
"No, I'm afraid not."
I always stayed outside the cage.
And what's the most important thing a lion tamer needs to know?
More than the lion.
"More than the lion, I'll say."
"Well, we are in esteemed company, welcome to you both."
What is it you're after?
"Come on, now."
I just wanted to chat with you.
Stop playing with me!
But I'm serious.
"As you can see, my time is running out."
"So I had the Codarl go berserk through the city, to lure you and that white AS here."
And I scattered messages to you all over the city.
Majid was a tactician who once made a name for himself as a guerilla leader in Helmajistan.
"His nickname was ""Bdakshon's Tiger."""
And then there's the assassin he gave a name to:
Kashim.
"In other words, ""The son of Bdakshon's Tiger"" is you."
Hamidra is a former electrician and a comrade of yours.
"I knew that if I sent out a message to ""Meet Hamidra at Tsim Sha Tsui,"""
you'd track down a Helmajistani electrician.
It was a message that would get through to no one else in the world but you.
But I thought you would bring a bunch of your friends with you.
Why did you come by yourself?
Did something happen?
That's none of your business!
"So you've finally started to feel uncomfortable, huh?"
What?
"In Mithril, I mean."
Being in a military unit that has pretensions of being an ally of Justice is enough to frustrate anybody.
Especially a man like you.
Are you through with your speech?
Then tell me about the organization behind you.
I'm amazed.
Your work is still that important to you?
Fine then.
I'll tell you.
BETH:
Do you want anything else?
"Yeah, less of the cardboard crap and more regular people food."
"Well, that cardboard crap is what we call whole-wheat toast."
"Well, maybe you could just fry me up a couple of sausage links."
People who have just had a heart attack are generally not advised to have animal fat that's been stuffed into a synthetic casing.

STEVEN:
"Hey, Beth."
"Grab me a beer when you get to the kitchen, okay?"
"And a little plate of cold cuts, if there are any left."
"Hey, would you guys please just turn that down a bit?"
Dad's trying to sleep.
You think he wants to hang on to this vinyl?
My collection could use a lot of these.
Would you just turn it the fuck down?
"Well, we're totally out of toilet paper and all we have left to eat is some old jelly and some ramen noodles."
And our new brother would like to co-opt Dad's property before he's even dead.
"Laura, also your husband would really like another beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf network."
Are you okay?
[CRYING]
"Don't worry, honey, Dad's gonna be fine."
GIGI:
Do you know who it is?
- No.
Doesn't matter.
So are you gonna leave him?
"Gigi, he's my husband."
He's not some guy who didn't call me back.
He did admit it to me.
"He didn't wait to get caught, which takes courage, you know?"
There were no female doctors on Alcatraz.
Let's go.Both of you.
- Where?
- Sunset beach.
The location of the land mines are hidden in the lyrics of the song.
He painted the mines to blend in with the sand.
That's where we'Il find Hauser.

Yes.

"""Snow"" for the union square snow festival,""Beard"" for beard beach,"
"- and ""Grace..."""
- Was grace cathedral.Genius.
There's a fourth verse.
Which means there's a fourth bomb.
"""Twin tree."" What's that?"
"I don't know,but I'm sure the good men of the San Francisco police department will."
I've already made a call on your behalf.
Excellent.Lives will be saved.
Alcatraz proving itself to be once again the crown jewel of American penal sciences.
"Milton,don't skulk out there like a common ferret."
It wouldn't kill you to give a compliment to a colleague.
Genius.
Doctor.I've been meaning to have a word with you about one of your patients.
Tommy Madsen's medical records...
There's no history of illness recorded.
Illnesses come in many shapes and sizes.
You of all people should know that.
"Yes,but why would you have a perfectly healthy man spend so much time in the infirmary?"
And what do you want with his blood?
"A word of advice,my dear:"
Still trying to keep ourselves in trim.
"Right, so I see."
-Working up a good old sweat.
-Yeah.
How about you?
"After last night, obviously, we can't stop thinking about your brother."
Right.
"Sorry, my....?"
"I mean, how is he?"
Is there any more news on his condition?
"Sorry, Gil, would you excuse me?"
Mick.
"Yeah, I've been trying to get hold of you all morning."
Yeah.
I told him your brother had been very badly injured in an accident in America.
"That it was touch and go whether he'd pull through, and you were so upset about it all that I had to come around last night to see if everything was okay."
-And he believed that?
-Absolutely.
"What I said was he'd been taking part in a javelin contest, okay?"
"And as he was running along he'd stumbled and dropped the javelin, which had stuck in the ground, and he'd fallen face first, right on to the point which had completely pierced the roof of his mouth,"
and ended up about half an inch away from his brain.
-So....
"-God, that's horrible."
What on earth did you make up a story like that for?
"Well, I had to think quick."
It was the first thing that popped into my mind.
The first thing that popped into your mind?
"How about his car went off the road, or he fell down some stairs or...."
What am I talking about anyway?
I don't even have a brother.
"-Well, you have now."
His name is Hiram.
"Now then, Rhys, do they have Christmas in New Zealand?"
We do.
Yeah?
"We do, of course."
"Big Christmas, family?"
"Yes, of course."
It's like it is here.
It's...
It's very confusing in New Zealand on that side of the world because it's summer.
Yes.
"As you can imagine, it's the opposite of what's going on here."
"It's the opposite of winter, isn't it?"
Yes.
LAUGHTER
"And yet our culture is the same, so we get all the same Christmas songs and all the same sort of festive affair that you have here with the snow."
Which makes it even more confusing.
Exactly.
So we have people that spray fake snow on all the windows and it's a bit sad.
You have your own children now.
"Two, is that right?"
Do you put out a little carrot for the reindeer?
"Well, yes."
I do that as well.
"We had to move houses because our first house didn't have any chimney and so the younger son Finn who was four at the time said, ""Santa can't get here."""
So we had to shift.
"He's one of these kids that says, ""There's no logical way Santa could get in here"
"""and I'm going to miss out."""
"We said, ""He comes through the door of houses that don't have chimneys."" ""No, he doesn't."""
So we had to actually shift which was a shame because we had a great house.
"Now we've got a much smaller house, but it's got a massive chimney."
"He gets loads of presents, so he's happy."
"What people may not know about you, I was amazed to find out, is that you were in the New Zealand Army."

[Phone room chatter]
It was getting down to the wire for mayoral candidate Robert Stone.
"I need to know, are you with me on this, or are you not with me on this?"
"In a final push, he and his staff worked the phones."
"Melissa, his sexy campaign manager, wanted Stone."
"I mean, weeks ago we were way behind from Baumgartner, now we're gonna kick his bum."
Let's just do it again tomorrow.
Let's get it done.
"It was the end of a long day, but Melissa had one more campaign to mount."
"I need to get out of here, heading' home soon."
You can stay for one drink.
"Just one long, stiff drink."
"Melia was slipping Stone a rufie, the date rape drug."
"But she didn't want to do him, she was going to do him in."

- He's out like a light.
"Listen, I need everyone out front at 7:30."
"Melissa was actually a spy, working for Baumgartner,"
Stone's opposing candidate.
Sucker.
"Come on, time to get up, it's 7:30, let's go!"
Melissa had alerted the press.
That's just...
"I'm sorry, I can't hold hands with you."
I had no idea that you...
I thought you were like me.
I thought you'd missed the boat somehow.
Getting involved with a married man.
That's not who I thought you were.
"Stephenson, Sutcliffe, Taylor,"
"Ward, Williamson, Yardley."
"Right, have a look around at your tram group."
"If you don't see those faces at the tram stop tomorrow morning, you are on the wrong tram and you will not be making a record with the Halle Orchestra."
Oi!
"That was a waste of a halfpenny, wasn't it, Hewitt?"
These trams have been put on specially for you to get to the Free Trade Hall.
We don't want anybody coming on milk floats or getting lifts on a dust cart.
"Yes, Baker, I'm looking at you."
"You're not on the tram, you're not coming in."
"In fact, I am going to say that anyone not arriving on time will not only be prevented from taking part in the recording, but will be asked to leave the choir altogether."
Singing tomorrow is going to be the happiest moment of my life.
Very good.
You get off.
Big day tomorrow.
I can manage.
"So our record that we're making, Mr Kirkby, if they sell it in Woolworths, I'm going to buy it for Mam and play it her."
Play it her on what?
A mangle?
"No, I've got a gramophone."
"Yes, and I'm Rupert the Bear."
"No, I have got one."
"Come on, Mr Kirkby, come with!"
Very nice model.
"Not that we should be ""Laying up treasures on earth"

I'll try my best... to make him proud of me.
And only then will I go home
I'm sure you will succeed in your endeavours

No use.

I'd like to see Mr Pillai.
He is in an important meeting
This is regarding that meeting.
"- No sir, you can't see him"
Tell him I'll take no more than a hundred seconds
"Call him, he knows me."
Okay...

Why?
So how can you help me all in a hundred seconds?

"Secretly, I stole one look at you"
All right Mr. Zachary
I'll text you tomorrow.
Why are you leaving?
Because I have to work tomorrow.
And you're just going to leave me with your friend in there?
"Hey ZACH, where's your corkscrew?"
Ok...
Ok...
She just showed up hours later unannounced.
I guess something did happen between them the other night.
What did ZACH say?
Well I mean he said he wanted me to stay and you know but I think I was just playing dumb.
"I don't get you Dale, I really don't."
Why?
Why don't you just go for him?
Because Seven I'm done having meaningless relationships with these loser LA guys and on and on and on...
Whoa... is a loser LA guy?
"No he's... no he's not but anyhow I'm not his type, especially now that Hallie's all over him."
You are so wrong.
You are so wrong.
It doesn't matter because hey I'm going to go out on a date with Haden.
"Whoa whoa, whoa"
But just as friends.
You're going out with Haden?
The fake seeking personal trainer whose only using you to get ahead in this desperate city.
Oh shit Seven that's harsh.
He just wants to schmooze you so you'll listen to his stupid reality show concept.
He's only interested in seeing what you can do for him and his career because you have a career
The only reason Hallie is into Zach is because you gave her the Ok to pursue
I never said pursue.
She asked me if we had ever hooked up and I said no...
Look I never said this to you before but you are going to regret this...
"I'm glad she did because you're here, Nathaniel."
"I said, ""It's... it's none of our business."
"That's for Harriet to determine."""
"I said, ""I will not go along with that."""

- Yeah.
There is a certain romanticism in your mother that...

"""Did you ever really have any intention of coming,"
"""or did you just say you would to get my mother off the phone?"
"""Because we waited for you..."
"""and waited and waited and waited."""
"Well, howdy there."
"This is Classic Country, Dallas-Fort Worth, with a daily tidbit."
Construction is well underway on the Kimbell Art Museum in the heart of the cultural district.
"It looks a little bit like a cement cattle barn to me, but they say the inside is going to be gorgeous, lit entirely by our Texas sun."
"Well, good luck."
"Well, let's get back to music right now."
One of our favorite stars:
- What?
The uncommonly warm weather - will it continue?
- Russ?
- Russ?
"Uh, um, wh-what was that question?"
"Thanks, Russ."
"Well, it seems like we can keep those thermal socks in the closet... for the time being then."
"That's right, Dan."
Police are calling it... the crudest attempt to dispose of a body in recent memory.
Jerry Green of Linglestown... was apparently bludgeoned to death... and then dropped into the river with a brick taped to one wrist.
This was insufficient weight to keep the corpse submerged.
[ Sighs ]
What time did they pull this bookie out ofthe river?
Scotty told me around 6:00.
Ted told me 8:00.
It's like a fucking guessing game.
They pulled him at 6:00 and bagged him at 8:00.
Was he nude?
Somebody said he had a T-shirt on.
"Why don't you get off your ass and check the reports, man?"
I'm going with nude.
I'm so glad this thing is finally over.
What does that mean?
We don't have to look for this guy anymore.
"Gee, wouldn 't it be great if we found out who killed him?"
"I realize that entails more work, but I'm just thinkin' out loud."
"Has it ever occurred to you, Chambers, that he was drunk... and he just slipped off the bridge?"
Hmm?
A little thing called an accident.
Why is everybody around here so foul-play happy?
"The man was bludgeoned to death, Lakewood!"
"His skull was bashed in, he had a plastic bag over his head... and duct tape around his neck."
My daughter needs a doctor right now!
"Daddy, wa-wa."
"Oh, for corn sakes."
That boy has hypothermia.
"Yeah, he'll be fine."
Here's a blanket.
Ah!
My foot!
"Relax, you fucking Mary!"
Get my daughter a doctor!
"I will have you thrown out of here, mister, if you don't get your emotions under control."
My emotions?
You mean my love for my own child?
"Let me tell you something... ""Beatrice."""
"I don't know what country you're from, but I didn't die for five minutes on a Korean battlefield to come home and be disrespected by a woman like you."
"You think because I'm unemployed, you can just shove me and my family to the back of the line?"
"Well, not on my watch!"
"If you don't get her a doctor right now, before all these other low-life pieces of shit, then I will follow you to whatever home for dried-up old hags you live in, slap the cat food out of your mouth, grab you by your camel hump"
and put you through that fucking wall!
"Oh, boy."
- There's our hero.
- Wha...
- What happened?
- You passed out.
And then everybody in the waiting room started clapping.
"Well, the main thing is you're all right and Maureen's gonna be fine."
"Daddy, I'm a pirate!"
"Oh, for Christ sakes, Maureen, girls can't be pirates!"
You're back!
"Dad, it's so cool when you scream at other people."
My little girl's eye is more important than some crazy old man's foot.
- He's fine!
-Okay.
"Well, cheers then, Gil."
You take care.
"-Yeah, yes."
"See you around, Bob."
"Oh, Roberta, my sweet darling."
"God forgive me for what I'm about to do if it appears in anyway perverse or improper to you, but..."
I really fear I can't help myself.
"And at that moment, I swear he could've done anything."
"Such was the passion that coursed through my veins as he gazed upon my body for the first time, unclothed and unfettered by the trappings of society."
"I hope it will not shock you, Dora, when I say that he surrendered to his deepest most primal impulse... and wrote a poem, slowly at first... delicately selecting each precious word."
"But as the inspiration took flight and his imagination soared, oh, what imagery!"
"What rhythmic, pulsing metres."
"What gushing, bounteous couplets flowed from his pen."
"My dearest sister, I tell you now, he is the warmest, truest, most perfect gentleman I have ever met in all the world."
ALICE:
I suppose Cleo's right.
I'm going to have to go to this thing tomorrow.
"Brian's birthday bash, ""the big four""... and drag myself out of the comfort zone."
"God, I hate parties."
"-Hey, hello."
-Hi.
How are you?
Now one with just the three cousins.
"Darling, if you just wanna put yourself in the middle there."
And big smiles.
Lovely.
"So, anyway, how's life treating you these days, Janice?"
-You're looking well.
"-Yes, still muddling along."
Yeah.
And Malcolm?
- What's he want from you?
"- Layout of the club, front and back exits, where the apartment is."
- You know where he's staying?
- No idea.
- We always meet on the street.
"- Next time you take a meeting,"
- let me know up front.
- I don't think he wants to take you over the line and hand you over.
I get a different feeling.
- Like what?
"- Like he doesn't care how he does it, as long as he takes you out of the picture."
"Maybe you know something about this, a new crew trying to take over the Vanya Hotel."
That's true.
There's been a few fights.
"No-one dead yet, but that's only a matter of time."
Americans is what I heard.
We're hearing the same thing.
What the fuck is going on here?
"Something, that's for sure."
"Every time I call Julianna for a date, she says that she is busy and she can't make it."
She says she's working for the Government full time
- and to leave her alone.
- What's your problem?
"My problem is, I invested a lot of money in her."
"I paid to bring her here, I put her up in an apartment"
- and now I'm not getting paid.
- You might recall that's part of the deal you made with us in exchange for citizenship.
My deal was for my cooperation.
It was not to subsidise the Canadian spy service.
"If you are taking Julianna, or any of my girls out of service,"
I would like to be compensated for it.
I am not a charity.
- Beat it.
- Damn. [Groans]
"I'm gonna check on this address in the Bronx... and if they don't know you there, it's your ass."
[Cloudy] I thought I told you to stand there.
Get that hair done before Saturday.
We're going now.
Good-bye.
[Cloudy] Move ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
"All that is great, but you belong in Bedford-Stuyvesant, not out there in Ridgewood."
"Why don't you detach us then, for Christ's sakes?"
Give us a shot at it.
At least till we find out if there's anything here or not.
"Everybody wants Weinstock, right?"
"Well, maybe here's the lead we're looking for."
We deserve this.
You couldn't burn a three-time loser... with this garbage you're bringing in here.
The man has done absolutely nothing.
"The first thing you know, you'll wind up in an entrapment rap— the both of you."
"Brooklyn is loaded with guys... that own candy stores, two cars, and like to go to nightclubs."
"Yeah, but you put this little candy store hustler together... with Joel Weinstock, and maybe we got a big score."
"Big score, my ass."
At best he's selling nickel and dime bags.
"I wouldn't be infringing on your coffee break, Simonson... if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer."
"Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle."
Or have you forgotten about that already?
"Jesus Christ, Jimmy."
What's happened to you guys lately?
Every year you lead the Narcotics Bureau in arrests.
"What was it, over a hundred again last year?"
Terrific.
But who?
"""My enemy's is inside you, I will kill both of you together."""
"""Protect me, Lord and protect my son from our enemy."""
"""l have come at your feet, Lord."""
"""For which misfortune are you crying, son."
"Mine or yours"""
The one who should have been happy seeing you is no more
My misfortune was to become a widow and you became an orphan
Now Lord Shiv will only protect you.
I am leaving you at his feet.
Please save me
"""You saw, swami."
"You can't see but your soul can see."""
We have lost everything.
I had warned you not to leave Shiv's worship in the middle
But you did'nt accept.
Then how will Lord accept your prayers  has shown his effect
Enemy has taken away your life Now when you are not alive...
"""...what will I do by living."
"I will also die, swami."""
A new born child crying in Shiv's temple.
"""What is this Leela of yours, everyone comes to your..."""
...temple for relief.
But now a new born is crying for mercy.
"""Lord Shiv, I can't bear the cry of this new born baby."""
Accept Narad's salutations.
"""There is no joy but pain in your voice, Narad"""
"""l am pained from the heart, hence the voice also sounds so"""
"""What is the reason?"
"- What is not known to you, Lord Shiv"""
King Satyavrath is killed and his queen has also died.
The cry of their baby in Shiv temple is unbearable.
"""When you know all this, king broke his promise and its result.."""
Who is the one leading this legislation?
He took bribes from shabby third-class companies.
Isn't catching such corrupt people the work of a prosecutor?
I can't approve that.
"If you really want to arrest him, then show me the evidence."
"Due to that shabby construction work, the support pillar broke, leading to death of personnel."
Those families are homeless.
How can we just sit by...
Didn't I ask you to find the evidence?
These are very serious matters.
How can you be called a prosecutor?
=Seoul's Prosecutors did not find any evidence against Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan.=
=I must gather evidence to bring justice to everyone.=
Didn't that person used to...
First have a chat with me.
Do you know this person?
"No, I just saw him."
How did you know my name?
This ajussi!
Really...
So that's why he was after Mi Jin?
He has personality.
"Excuse me, you are..."
"Department of Seoul's District Public Prosecutor, I'm Prosecutor Kim Yeong Ju."
Prosecutor Kim Yeong Ju wants to wrap round one's finger.
That's why you came to my house.
I always envied Kim Jong Sik for having a son like you.
"You even rejected my calls, so I personally came to talk with you."
"Who permitted you to be so offensive, the law should take care of a person like you."
Don't you know?
"Threatening me, is a big mistake."
Me?
That's their business!
You must admit there's too much chauvinism in bullfighting.
But there are exceptions.
El Nino de Valencia was happy to share billing with you for several months.
That's over now!
Do you think it was all just a show to promote himself and when he'd done that he left you?
I told you earlier I wouldn't talk about that!
"But it's good to talk, honey."
And talking about problems is the first step in overcoming them.
- El Nino de Valencia...
- That's enough!
"Lydia, darling, don't be rude and let me finish the question."
I told you earlier I didn't want to talk about that.
You didn't tell me anything earlier.
"And I don't like you saying that, because people may think we plan the interviews, and I don't do that."
I only do live.
"I'm one of the few who dare to do that, just as you should dare to admit you were used, because El Nino de Valencia was using you!"
"A man who shared not just fame and the bullring with you but your bed as well, dumped you when it suited him."
"Hello, Juan Luis."
It's Marco.
How are you?
I wanted to ask you something.
I'd like to do an article on Lydia Gonzalez.
"Yeah, I'm watching it too."
I'd like to do something in depth.
For the Sunday issue?
Great!
She's gone nuts.
She's dedicating it to you.
She'd let the bull rip her apart just so that you could see it.
"We shouldn't have come, especially you."
I know what I'm doing.
What?
Do you wanna be partners in a bar or anything with that guy?
What?
All I'm saying is she wouldn't be a boring date.
"Oh, I'm gonna go home and sleep for three days."
Our regular shift starts at 6:00am.
"Oh, yeah."
But tomorrow is my scheduled day off.
"With this red ball over, I'm gonna get to spend the day with my kids."
"That's right, and I get to have lunch with your wife."
Somehow I think I'm getting the short end of this partnership.
Detective Pembleton are you waiting for someone?
This case it still troubles you?
Yes.
I caught a killer...
who murdered eight women.
She claims to have a disorder - that she's crazy.
"I think, isn't anyone crazy who kills someone else?"
Does that somehow mean that she's not responsible?
Does that mean that she doesn't have to suffer?
I'm angry.
I can't let it go.
I don't find it difficult believing in this multiple personality disorder.
"I look and I see nothing but souls shattered like mirrors, mine included... and yours."
- I keep mine in control.
- Thank God for that.
"Now you just have to learn to forgive yourself for all those different personalities and the Wilgis woman, too."
"I know that Katherine Goodrich would have, with her dying breath,"
- forgiven her murderer.
- Fine.
Now who speaks for the others?
What right do any of us have to forgive in their name?
He didn't understand the same threats made in Thebes and Athens would not work here.
This is the birthplace of the world's greatest warriors.
Men whose king would stand and fight and die for any one of them.
Xerxes' messenger did not understand this is no typical Greek city-state.
This is Sparta.
It was clear to the messenger there'd be no Spartan submission?
It was clear.
Even now Leonidas is in counsel with the Oracle over his battle plan.
The Festival of the Carneia is all that stands in our way.
Surely the Oracle will see we must fight.
"Well, then my timing is perfect."
I am commanding a fleet of ships that will represent a united Greece.
I need Sparta to join me.
"Give me your ships, Gorgo."
I'll make sure that Xerxes wishes he never crossed the Aegean.
You'll receive no Spartan ships.
We've no interest in a united Greece.
"That is your dream, Themistokles, not ours."
All I am concerned with is the preservatio of Sparta.
My guards will see you out.
It's funny that you mock freedom here in your selfish isolation.
"Yet freedom, in her wisdom has chosen you to defend her."
My queen.
Will Sparta join our fight?
Apparently the Persians have offered the Spartans something they cannot refuse.
- And what is that?
- A beautiful death.
They say you are the bravest of our captives.
They say you are a whore from the eastern seas.
You're not the smartest.
Your commander is a Greek.
Just like me.
- Why did you choose to come by ship?
"The next several weeks will be very difficult for me,... ..and the ocean is the only place where the telephone isn't ringing all the time."
Do you agree with the recent survey finding... ..that showed that Mayor Lindsay was the sexiest man in the world?
"Toutá fait, oui."
Here's the warrants and the court order for the wire tap.
Judge gave you 60 days.
Mulderig and Klein'll sit in for the feds.
They'll make all the buys.
Make sure you keep 'em informed of everything that goes down.
"You know Doyle there, don't you?"
"Yeah, I know Popeye."
His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
"Ifthis is the way you're comin' in on this, why not stay home and save us a lot of grief?"
- Because that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.
Whatever.
"Bill, do me a favour, give them a chance."
He came in with a little basic information.
"You worked with him, had some trouble, but don't get off on the wrong foot."
"- You have any problems, come to me."
"- Simonson, just keep off my back."
Just try and cool it with him.
"Ifyou have any problems, come to me."
I'll handle him.
- I'll be happy to work with him.
- He's a good cop.
- He's got good hunches once in a while.
- Fine.
Just keep him off my back.
Florida's MackelBrothers invite you tojoin the great escape.
"You can saygoodbye to airpollution, commuting, high prices, rising taxes... ..and cold, depressing winters."
"MackelBrothers willshowyou the way to Florida andfresh, clean air."
A play in 5 acts by William Shakespeare...
"O, that this too too solid flesh would melt"
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew.
"How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, Seem to me all the uses of this world!"
"'tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed... things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely...."
For 9 years now I dream about it  that this collection of costumes may once more grace the stage lights...
The only place in this despicable world where the feelings still are great and sublime.
A world full of memories...
"You are too young for that, my child."
One must first have lost something in life... to know how much you loved it.
What would you know about that?
"But I do know, Mr Hassenreuter."
You're the only one that can understand.
Please!
I would like to discuss something with you.
"For God's sake, don't say you want to go to the theater?"
I just have to talk to someone who has understanding.
Understanding?
Of what?
Hello!
Is Mr Hassenreuter here?
"Excuse me, my child."
A customer.
"Clear this away, please!"
- Are you arranging a masquerade ball here?
"- Yes, yes, yes..."
"I would like to discuss something with you, Sir..."
May I...
What does he say?
Are you afraid that he doesn't come?
Or that he already has?
"Well, read it already!"
"If you can hear me, sweetheart, please listen carefully."
There's something I need to tell you.
"I've been a bad mother, and I did a terrible thing to let this happen to you."
It's all my fault.
You deserve better than this.
You deserve so much more.
Even though I know you're brave...
"And you're not crying, you need to know I cried for you."
You're so much stronger than I am.
Stronger than I am.
"Honey, if you come home safely now, I promise"
I will love you and hold you and never let any more harm come to you.
"If you can hear me now, please call as soon as you can."
You know how to reach me.
I promise I will explain to you once and for all why I did what I did.
"Ok, it's over."
You did great.
You did great.
We'll keep bodies on ice for as long as 3 or 4 months.
"If nobody claims them by then, they get buried on the city's dime."
And Mrs. Sorenson's son never showed up?
"No, ma'am."
"We tried to track him down, but..."
This is it.
Pretty sad.
You live your life and you end up like unclaimed baggage.
"Hotch, we solved the mystery of the bone fragments in the hourglass."
"Patrick was going to have that reunion with his mother, one way or another."
"Patrick Sorenson has to be holed up nearby, but where?"
"Someplace secluded, that's for sure."
Hauling a corpse through the front door would tend to perk up the neighbors.
"Well, if there was an 11-hour clock on Josie Zumwalt, the bell just rang."
This is just about me.
(scoffs)
"Still, when you say you don't want to be in a relationship because you want to focus on your career..."
And that's the way
I felt at the time.
"Look, I love what we had together, you know that."
"But, you also know I was running when I got to D.C."
I didn't know who I was.
"Keep digging into Garcia, let me know if you find anything."
Hannah... (sighs)
(computer beeps)
Whoa.
(beeps)
"Pride, call me back."
I think I just got a big break on your case.
Had FBI's Robbery Task Force see if there were any other robberies that matched the MOs of the one in Mississippi:
"bank in Orlando, one in Mobile, armored car in Atlanta."
All involved three masked gunmen with assault weapons and a getaway driver.
That pretty much matches most bank robberies these days.
Right.
But what if I told you each one also happened to take place in the exact same city as a car race?
PRIDE:
Huh.
Suggesting that the heist crew is connected to the racing circuit.
Too much of a coincidence for it not to be.
"I mean, whoever hacked Jared's car obviously knew racecars inside and out."
"Yeah, except Jared's a marine, not part of the circuit, so why hack his car?"
"That, I don't know."
"Just curious, how'd you even know Jared's car was hacked?"
"Well, don't look at me."
I left her alone like you said.
I still have my NCIS computer access.
Isn't that true?
Admiral Yi does not discriminate between ranks.
He is unlike you men that treat your subordinates like animals!
Bastard!
This land that you're standing on is where I was born.
I know this area like the back of my hand.
I suggest you tell the truth if you want to live.
Kill me.
"I've failed to accomplish my mission, so I'm dead anyway!"
Yi Soon-shin will strike Wekyo on the 18th?
"It's a land-sea joint attack with Kwon Yul, General."
"For another thousand heads,"
Jin Lin will stay out of the battle along with Yu Jong.
I think we should take the deal.
We want to reduce the number of enemy as much as we can.
Send another message to Shimizu and Wakizaka.
"On November 18, we will stain the shores of Shinsung-po red with the enemy's blood."
"Yes, sir."
Konishi has taken the bait.
He has agreed to deliver the heads to Admiral Jin.
Enemy believes that we will strike Shinsung-po of Wekyo.
And Shimizu and Wakizaka will lead their fleet through Noryang without suspicion.
And we will be waiting in Noryang to sink them.
Lt. Na...
"We acquired cooperation from local merchants and fishermen as you ordered, sir."
The merchant ships have been fitted with weapons and archers and gunners have been placed in position.
Commander Yi...
"Yes, sir."
You are me from now on.
Konishi must be deceived completely.
"Yes, sir."
"I won't let you down, sir."
"I have no further questions, Your Honor."
"[murmuring] Tell me now, Merle."
I got to know Danny through Gina.
That's how we used to meet.
He couldn't have forgotten.
Who is Gina?
Gina Gilbert.
"She's sitting in the back row, next to Corbett."
I asked her to come and be moral support.
"[Judge] Mr. Mason, We await your pleasure."
"My apologies, Your Honor."
"What is your occupation, Mr. Pierce?"
I'm unemployed at the present.
And when you are working?
A salesman.
"Mr. Pierce, have you ever been convicted of a felony?"
- No.
- No?
"Isn't it true you that two years ago, in Fort Worth, Texas, you were arrested for robbery?"
But I was cleared.
"Your Honor, I object to that."
The police are quite properly investigating everyone who conceivably could have taken that necklace.
"But a mere arrest is not evidence of bad character which can impeach a witness, and counselor very well knows that."
"If it please the court, I'm not trying to impeach this witness."
I'm just attempting to cross-examine him on his claim that the objections of the deceased to his marrying my client were unreasonable.
"I think you've made your point, Mr. Mason."
Objection overruled.
"Now, Mr. Pierce, are you married?"
No.
Certainly not.
"Are you acquainted with a woman by the name of Jayne Simmons of Fort Worth, Texas?"
Yeah.
"'He counterbalanced his feelings of love and productivity 'with periods of extreme isolation, 'sometimes finding that days on end had passed 'since last leaving the house."
"'Shortly after the rush of severing ties 'with those he believed to be poisonous to his mental health,"
'Philip was too crippled with anxiety and dread 'to go outside for the better part of a week.
"'Philip had harboured increasingly romantic notions 'about what this period in his life would mean, 'until one day, a few months before the publication of his second novel, 'he abruptly became confidently disenfranchised 'to the point of despondency.'"
You know this should be your job.
- So sorry about the wait.
"- Ah, it's ridiculous."
"30 minutes I'm out here, 40 maybe."
I'm five away from leaving.
- I'm sorry.
What do you want me to say?
- Nothing.
I'd prefer you to say nothing.
"Riley, don't hold my calls."
"I've got some bad news, two items of good news."
Give 'em to me in that order.
Bad news is you're not looking at a good review in the Times.
What?
How do we know so soon?
Who's doing it?
Some new woman.
- She's new.
- So what's the problem?
She doesn't like your book.
"Fuck, I really needed that."
- I'll take the good news now.
"- (CLEARS THROAT) Well, two things."
"First, you're going to be in the ""35 Under 35"" issue of the New York Literary Review."
- Nobody reads that anymore.
- This is something.
It is not uncompetitive.
Don't be a baby.
My name is Dayna.
This is Tarrant.
We're Federation outlaws.
Yes.
"Yes, I remember those names."
There was a reward for your capture.
You and your friends have a ship called the Liberator.
- Am I right?
"- We had a ship called the Liberator, it was destroyed fairly recently."
Memory is one of the few faculties I have left that still functions perfectly.
"My name, by the way, is Forbus."
The inventor of Pylene-50.
"Forbus, you weren't really going to press that contact, were you?"
"The explosion would have killed you, too."
That would seem a waste at the present time.
"When I die, I should like Commissioner Sleer right beside me."
"But you work for Sleer, manufacturing Pylene-50."
I am compelled to work for Sleer.
That inhuman devil is the cause of it.
Sleer is responsible for what you see.
"And now, only Sleer keeps me alive."
"What happened, what do you mean?"
Pylene-50 used homoeopathically is simply a muscle relaxant.
"Sleer discovered that 100 times normal dosage totally subverts the will, tried to force me to part with the formula."
I refused.
I didn't understand Sleer's nature then.
"Totally callous, savage ambition."
There is a poison called Tincture of Pyrellic.
- Perhaps you've heard of it?
- No.
"It is the extract of Pamporanian fungi, it cripples and eventually kills."
Death is agonising and there is no cure.
"""Dear Harriet, I keep thinking"

"""Lou."""
"Well, we were soul mates,"
"I would say, and inspired each other so that it was an equal exchange in many ways."
And I was a critic.
I do think that I brought the sense of nature and another sight to Lou's work.
Where did you work in the office?
"I worked in a room, and sometimes it was locked."
Why?
"Well, because of his wife, who would come in, drop by sometimes."
Sounds fairly...
fairly nerve-wracking.
It was nerve-wracking.
It was humiliating in some ways.
"When the buildings were created and finished and... for example, the Kimbell Museum."
"Everyone went out to the opening, but I was not invited."
I was not allowed to come.
Is it partly because you were a woman or that you were involved with him?
"Yes, I think all of those things, yeah."
"Didn't you ever say to him,"
"""Well, why don't you respect me more?"
"""Why don't you include me in these things"
"""or make me a part of your""..."
Beautiful place.
And it gets to rockin;

- Yeah.
Those are about $ 120 apiece.
You need to be very careful with this decision.
"You know, if you come in and act right, you're going out ofhere... with two years of your college finished... a scholarship to a Division I university."
Exactly where you'd want to be- on track to graduate in four years.
Mineral Area doesn't have dorms... but it does have a basketball house.
All the ballplayers on scholarship live here.
"Get your ass up, nigga."
Of the seven blacks in the entire school... six live in this house.
"You come in and look at this little house, then after a while you get used to it."
"Try to make a little home, you know."
home away from home anyway.
We hang around each other most of the time.
"We know who to trust, who not to trust."
I just want to go somewhere where I'm gonna play.
I can get the grades.
I love basketball.
how many of your players that leave there and they end up going to a four-year college?
- Thirty-one sophomores in a row.
- Really?
Every last one of'em he coached.
- hi. how you doing?
- hey. how you doing?
- Arthur Sr.
- Bo and Sheila have been separated.
She asked him to return today over Arthur's objections.
I'll show you exactly what the scholarship entails.
Is this a full scholarship for the two years?
The reason I'm skeptical is because of the promises that was made in the past.
It seems like if you have four good fingers and a thumb you oughta be able to use all of em.
- lt's very good.
- Very good.
"Well, as I was saying, I was quite happy farming my bit of land when these United Nations fellows started worrying me."
Edward was a big noise in the Ministry of Food during the war.
"So we pulled ourselves up at the roots, and here we are, United Nations Relief."
Sounds like interesting work.
I'm preparing a report on soil erosion at the moment.
Parts of this country are not unlike your dustbowl formation.
"A thin layer of topsoil, and underneath, so -"
(Speaking French)
How do you like that?
First he promises to take us to dinner -
Yeah.
"Well, we just met him today, honey."
You can't expect him to change his whole life.
"Ben, what's the matter with you?"
Nothing.
What's the matter with you?
I just don't want to be insulted.
"0h, you're not being insulted."
You can't blame him for turning down an old married couple like us.
- We're not an old married couple!
- Alright.
"Alright, he's a heel."
"I don't understand him, but I'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night."
(Clears Throat) I must do some shopping in the market tomorrow.
I do hope it will be fine.
"Well, not too fine."
"I know our English weather is pretty awful, but sometimes, we don't realise when we're lucky."
"All this sunshine day after day, well, it doesn't seem natural somehow."
- l want to get up.
"Rather stay in the dark, getting kissed by Ted Carter."
I'm going to bed.
It's about time I started teaching you something.
Lucas!
"Let me go, Lucas!"
Never had nothing I ever wanted.
Never had a beautiful woman.
Let me up.
Let me offer to the class of 1941 this fond farewell.
The world outside waits for you.
It is a world full of love and rich in opportunity.
"There may be dangers, but if you hold firm to your purpose and your ideals you will storm the ramparts of success and capture them."
Tomorrow you grow up and your true happiness begins.
- Thank you.
- My best wishes to you.
Selena Cross.
Norman.
"At first a diploma seemed like a reward for the past but once in your hand, it became an obligation to the future."
Independence was a distant word that we suddenly owned and we exploded with it.
Some of us splashed away the summer or swooped and stretched with joyfulness and emptied our childish piggy banks of their play money.
"Yet others of us, eager to feel adult or out of necessity began our work early."
- Put the bottle up on top.
- Here?
"And gradually, as the happy confusion of summer faded one by one, we knew the Monday morning of responsibility was at hand."
"- Hi, Mr. Rossi."
"- Hello, Allison."
Did you read those stories I gave you?
"Yes, I read them."
Well?
- When did you write them?
- All summer.
- Ever since graduation.
(JIMMY PANTING)
Can't tell you the number of times I've dreamt that I was riding up in this lift.
It's a pity I can't...
"It's just the landing gear, laddie."
"Now, listen to me."
"When you kill Akan,"
"I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him is just as dead as they are, understood?"
"No, I'm afraid I shall not be coming with."
But you letting me get you this far has given an old sweat his grandest gift in all his years.
No.
It's lodged in hisjugular.
"If you uncork it, I won't be able to... (STUTTERS) The thingamajig in your pocket, quickly."
"Well, I have a confession to make."
"See, I've been surveilling Akan for years."
"So when you dropped down onto that roadway and went rogue so magnificently, well, all I saw was my shot at revenge."
"You proved me right with Dimitry, but then in the forest, well, I noticed an implant."
"A memory block, see?"
And I couldn't afford to have you remember a better life somewhere else.
So I left it in.
"Not my finest hour, I'm afraid."
"But then, back at my lab while I was trying to analyze what you could do for me, lreahzed"
who you are to me.
Henry.
"It's bloody nice having a friend, Henry."
You'd think all those deaths would've prepared me for this.
"If you haven't already, you'll start to remember bits from your past now, Henry."
"And those memories, they're real."
They're you.
Trust them.

(MEN SHOUTING)
"Can I get a Maker's, neat?"
It's not easy to trust a man who's ready to fuck over his own grandmother.
"The kind of money we're talking about,"
I'd fuck over somebody I like.
[chuckling]
"Yeah, I get it."
And I got to hand it to you.
It almost worked.
Your plan has two fatal flaws.
One is my client Chayton Dockery.
Audrey took his cash collateral.
"And when he comes for it tomorrow, let's just say, if she's lucky, she goes to prison and all of her assets will be seized and the sale of the house will be cancelled."
And if she isn't lucky?
"Well, then she's dead, and you'll be dealing with Dockery."
"Now, if I were to get the money and put it in the safe, everything will be fine when Audrey opens it up for Dockery tomorrow."
And why would you do that?
Out of the goodness of my heart and $5 million.
There's no fucking way we're giving you $5 million.
I'd reconsider that.
"If you work with me, you're still rich."
"If you go against me, you get nothing."
[sigh] I...
Fine.
Fine.
But the money goes in the safe tonight.
Which brings us to problem number 2.
"If we pay off Dockery, Audrey's got no reason to follow through with the sale of the house."
She sold it to him.
"Seeing as it's Sunday, what you signed was an intent to sell."
Tomorrow she could put a stop to all this and my guess is she will because that's what she does.
Audrey's been pawning collateral.
I have a list of the items she's sold.
This may sound kind of off-center to you... but I want to take my Indian charms and set them under my bunk tonight.
"So when you come in the morning to give me my breakfast, I'd appreciate it... if you didn't look at them."
"I'll probably be asleep... because I'll be up most of the night, thinking."
"Sure, Tom."
Two bourbons.
"What I'm trying to prove, Philip... is that criminals like Tom Horn are not immune to prosecution."
The newspapers and the legal profession... are going to set things straight in this country.
And our system of justice insures that... killers like Tom Horn get exactly what they deserve.
And I'm going to see that it happens.
Where are the rifles in here?
The sheriff said we can't keep them in here no longer.
- You got a gun?
- No.
You going to kill me?
"You and I are walking out of here, and you're going to smile."
Now smile!
Keep smiling.
Smile.
"Listen, I've got a.41 caliber in your back."
You damn fools.
"What are you trying to do, kill him?"
Shit.
You damn fools.
Has the jury arrived at a verdict?
"Yes, we have, Your Honor."
"The jury finds the defendant, Tom Horn, guilty."
The court finds you guilty of murder as charged.
"You are sentenced to be hanged by the neck until dead... between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a. m... on November 20, 1903."
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
"Someday, you're going to have to pay for your way of life, Tom."
You're a bad man and I know it.
"And if I let you talk me out of it, I'll be lost forever."
"I'll send his solicitors around to see you, shall I?"
"Here's the confession, the man in the confessional you wanted me to write it down."
"Right, thank you."
"Listening to James last night in the confessional,"
I know it wasn't his voice I heard.
So he didn't drop round to tell you what he was going to do.
"He's not as daft as we thought, is he?"
"Anyway Father, I'm off the case."
I'm under investigation for falsifying evidence.
One confession too many you might say.
"You don't have to uproot yourself, Sergeant, you'll be working in here."
"I've taken what I need, sir."
Then you can bring it back.
"It's an order, not a suggestion."
I'm sorry you've all been moved.
This is now Discipline and Complaints.
Off-limits to Denton CID.
Don't bother.
I've heard it all and I'm not impressed.
"If Inspector Frost's clean, then the quicker we get on, the sooner he'll be back."
And as far as the investigation into the murder of Jeanette Barr is concerned it may be relevant to what we're looking at.
So it's no longer a Denton job.
I'll be taking over.
Sergeant Toolan will be attached to D and C.
"Now hang on a minute, sir."
Order not suggestion.
Superintendent Bailey has cleared it with your chief.
There's no shortage of loose ends to tie up.
Starting with Sheridan.
Sort out whether he saw her ten days before her death at the Bedford Arms.
He still says he didn't.
"If there's a hole in his evidence,"
[indistinct haggling] does it matter that you're not in love with him?
"- you said it -- cash, tax."
"- okay, next."
- is that all you got to say?
- she is a grown woman.
she's not a child.
"timmy, on the other hand, is your child."
- but she is my sister.
- i know you don't unders-  oh!
i don't what?
i don't understand?
"i have siblings, too, but they're adults, and they can take care of themselves."
"- well, maybe you're right."
- she has to fail.
she has to learn to fail.
- i can't believe she's getting to him.
- but christmas will not be the same without them!
"- no, it won't. no, it won't."
we won't have to watch a picnic full of people eating roast beef and gravy with their fingers and then taking the bottom of their shirts and wiping their mouths.
"and then to top it all off, the burping and the farting that happens -- it makes the dog walk away, it's so disgusting!"
"- okay, okay."
last year was pretty bad -- i admit it.
"- yes, it was pretty bad."
it was a white trash christmas.
"i hate saying that, but it was a white trash christmas, and i am not having that again this year."
"- okay, so you're saying you're not gonna have them here?"
"- i am saying that, bob."
i am saying that.
look at this. huh?
- ugh.
- that is a symbol of status and achievement and class -- something your sister will never know anything about.
and if she was smart -- and we know she's not -- she would take that stupid hammered gold record and sell it and sign the beauty shop over to us.
"""there ain't no one that can get through to this woman."
"""and every day,"
"""with the train wreck of a life that you've led,"
"""somehow you'd get by... without a care for anyo but yourself."""
"i never thought i'd say this, but... i'm glad you're gone!"
"- all these years, he's been wishing for me to die?"
- you ruined my life!
"- oh, sir!"
"sir, i understand this is an emotional time, but i can't let you hurt these flowers."
- i was just leaving.
- [sighs]
- uncle bob.
- who's that?
- i'm glad you came.
"- oh, that must be skoal."
he always had a wild streak.
"- what happened with tim, that was my fault and not hers."
- wait -- what?
what happened with tim?
did -- did he come out or something?
- keep watching.
"- no, champ, it was hers... and mine, a little bit, for letting it happen, but not -- not you."
"you were a victim, son... just like tim."
"you know, harley, you were always special to me."
- harley?
"- i love you, uncle bob."
i'm sorry again.
[chain clinking]
- this is a mistake.
he would make me throw back pennies from the wishing well.
he would -- he would never steal from anybody.
"- the money was running out, the bills were piling up, wayne's paycheck from the dollar king just went into the negatives with all your spending, and that damn harley kept breaking down and needing to be fixed."
- Next crescent?
Muslims sometimes use a lunar calendar.
- I'd have to look it up...
- Next crescent moon is in two days.
"So whatever they're attacking, it's happening in less than 48 hours."
"That sounds like it, sir."
Payment for the nextel is linked to this man.
Jind Allah.
"Literally ""soldier of God""."
That's pretty poor operational security for a sophisticated plot.
"Two months ago, Jind Allah was captured leaving the U.S."
Using a forged pakistani passport via Richmond international airport.
He's been held as a ghost detainee in Guantanamo Bay ever since.
"So technically, he doesn't exist."
Soldier of God isn't a name.
"No, it's most likely a name taken on for the Jihad, meaning struggle."
Extremists claim it's a holy war.
"Yet the words ""holy"" and ""war"" never appear together in the Qu'ran."
- Do we know his real name?
- CIA interrogators
- have gotten nothing out of the guy.
- They need us to break him.
We do know from past intercepts that he's a recruiter.
"He came into this country to assemble the omega cell, a sleeper cell with an unknown mission."
We have 48 hours to do what the CIA hasn't been able to manage in two months.
We could be looking at the first attack on our soil since 9/11.
- Hey.
- Car here?
I told Reid 5 minutes.
I think you should take Prentiss with you to Guantanamo.
- Excuse me?
- She could be of help.
Where Preservation Hall is.
"When you become a member of the Preservation Hall band, you come up through the ranks."
"Our clarinet player, Charlie Gabriel, he's 82."
"So what we were thinking for an intro was to do a variation of that riff,"
- but swing it a little more.
"- Okay, do the riff."
He's a fourth-generation musician.
And then you play around it.
His great-great-grandfather was a musician in New Orleans in the 1840s.
"Our trumpet player, fourth-generation."
"And our drummer, you know, fourth-generation."
"Yeah, I think we should just go round everyone up and just start playing, and then we'll hit ""record."""
"- All right, that sounds like a winner."
- Sounds fun?
"You can't create that, you know."
And we wouldn't exist if that didn't exist.
It's just wonderful how it gets passed along and passed along here.
What's it like to play in that room?
It's great.
"No microphones, no nothing."
"Only about, I think, a hundred people can fit in there at the most... and they're right on you."
So whenever I play my trombone solo
I got to stand all the way in back.
I might hit somebody.
That's how close they are.
"This is, like, the last place."
It really is.
"I mean, now the name of the joint's becoming literal, you know, because it's..."
"It's, like, the last place."
New Orleans has been my biggest inspiration in music in my adult life.
"I mean, I really got into Dr. John and Professor Longhair."
Not that I can play like 'Fess or Dr. John.
So are deadbolts and a rottweiler.
Hopefully some of this blood's the unsub's and we can pull DNA.
Lyla Brewer's body was found in the hallway.
Her husband never made it out of bed.
He must have been killed first.
"Well, it makes sense."
Eliminate the primary threat before moving on to mother and child.
Mrs. Brewer spent some time stumbling around out here.
And in the child's bedroom and in the bathroom and in the study.
She covered a lot of ground before dying.
"There are, uh, fresh scratches on the floor here."
Too heavy for her to have moved.
What if the unsub did it to block the top of the stairs?
"Seal off the child's escape, maybe?"
Or prevent a blinded Mrs. Brewer from taking a fall?
Strange that he'd be concerned for her safety right before crushing her skull.
I don't get it.
"If the goal was the child and Jim Brewer's attack was quick and lethal, why did the unsub let Lyla stumble around for so long before finally killing her?"
"Good to see you again, Dr. Reid."
Nice to see you.
Again?
Yeah.
We had a case here 4 years ago.
The tornado guy.
That was one for the books.
So do we have a C.O.D. on the victims?
"Mr. Brewer's was massive blood loss from a severed trachea, most likely a thin-bladed serrated knife."
And Mrs. Brewer?
Her skull was fractured.
Some type of blunt-force trauma.
It's highly unusual for a killer to use different weapons on different victims.
"Speaking of unusual, take a look."
It's mocking us.
"It's a ten-foot-tall springboard that we got for free, and we can't think of a single thing that's good enough to do with it!"
I bet it belonged to some other family that went crazy because they couldn't come up with anything to do with it.
"They probably just sat around, staring at it for months, until they finally snapped and started eating each other."
"Damn it, we're better than this!"
I know we are!
Remember that squashed groundhog we found on the highway?
"We came up with a hundred things to do with that, from the horrible to the beautiful!"
I miss Flatty.
Maybe we're just going about this the wrong way.
We have to think outside the box.
"If you were a diving board, what would you want someone to do with you?"
Take me ice-skating.
Don't be an idiot.
"That place is freezing, and it's always so crowded."
"Yeah, but they have good hot dogs."
Those hot dogs suck compared to the ones at the train station.
Why would a diving board want to go to a train station?
How should I know?
Maybe he wants to visit a relative.
Okay!
Okay!
Back in the box.
Jamie doesn't have to eat his peas anymore.
He can eat whatever he wants because Mommy surrenders.
Mommy has a tiny pony for Jamie who wants to hug him and give him yummy candy corn...
"Mmm, I'm delicious!"
Is there a big boy who could eat me?
"Gotcha, you little..."
"Jamie tries to kill Mom, and we're the ones who have to clean it up."
You want to tell me how that's fair?
You gotta give that kid some credit.

It follows it perfectly.

This hatch lands kind of where David said...
- The hole is.
- Yeah.
What would cause it to sink in like this?
Something below.
Something gave way below.
"If this is a hatch, it would be a way in, a vertical shaft to enter something."
"That's very, very odd."
It'shardto explain what that is.
"It's clearly, I think, a hole that's been chiseled into the bedrock by humans."
"I don't see any other explanation for it, geologically."
"All right, Jack, if you don't mind, shovel off that gunk down there, and let's see what's underneath there."
See that rock directly ahead of you?
Does that look placed or is that just part of the bedrock?
This looks like bedrock for sure.
"This isn't laid rock; it's been, you know, chiseled away."
It sure looks like it's been chopped away.
"It was kind of an ""aha"" moment, you know?"
Here-here's an opening in the ground.
Isthisthebackdoor ?
That's pretty solid there.
It doesn't sound like rock though.
"No, it sounds sandy or something."
That almost sounded hollow.
Almost sounds like wood.
Holy smokes.

Maybe some Contra went nuts.
"Today was a shitty day, with my shitty kids and my shitty husband."
I love them.
"I do, but damn, they get on my nerves."
I wanted to --
Everyone knows what I want to do -- what I want to do every second of every day.
I don't even have to say it.
"But... then I remember the last drink that got me here 2 years, 1 month, 10 days ago."
"And I didn't, and..."
"I'm just grateful, I guess to have this place."
And that's all.
"Um, the surveillance reports that you requested --"
"Alexandria, Virginia, the week of January 23rd."
There's a list of every person at the meeting and the names of all of their security personnel.
"Thank you, Martha."
"I included the local police reports from that area, as well, as the DOD meeting was on the same day as that horrible murder."
"There was a ton of extra police around, so maybe someone saw something useful to you."
You mean that... couple and their -- and their daughter?
That scared the hell out of me.
"I thought it was a Charles Manson thing, but I think they've ruled that out."
You know what?
Get me all the files and physical evidence connected to those murders also.
Sure thing.
You think they're related?
I think I can't rule anything out.
"I thought we were through the hard times, you know?"
Mm-hmm.
"I'd been sick for about three months, uh, and he was just so amazing."
"He took such great care of me and the kids, and... this is gonna sound weird."
Please.
My life?
No judgment.
You will leave this house when you agree to return to New York to become the extraordinary pianist you're meant to be.
"Mom, I'm not seven years old anymore."
You think I don't get that this is a great opportunity for me?
Then why would you throw it away?
Because it's not right for me now.
It's not what I want.
You don't know what you want.
"Dude... the crispity, crunchity goodness in that bowl is long gone."
I'm not really hungry.
My essay sucks.
Speaking of sucks-
What?
I meant Shakespeare.
Extra credit.
Impressive.
Impressive would be figuring out what language this was written in.
"I thought Kyle might be able to translate, but..."
"Well, what part are you at?"
"The part that says it's about two families and it's set in ""fair Verona. """
That's the first two lines.
"She lives exactly 38 feet 9 inches away, and I can't even tell her I'm sorry."
You could if she wasn't locked in her own house.
Who else but Mrs. Bloom actually changes the alarm code to keep someone in?
I just hope Amanda doesn't feel as bad as I do.
Looks like we have our own resident pair of star-crossed lovers.
The balcony scene's her favorite part of the play.
"Of course, it didn't end well for them."
So Romeo and Juliet did everything in their power to be together.
You guys know how this ends?
Why didn't you say so?
This all began when Amanda said we needed to talk.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
Thank you.
"Happy New Year, Mr. Hilliard."
"Sammy liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
Oh.
"Um, now that Sam..."
"Now that my brother has gone,"
I must find something with which to occupy myself.
"I have responsibilities, dependents."
I have decided therefore to continue with the agency.
"I understand Sammy discussed with you Baker's Dunkirk film,"
- the role of the inebriated uncle.
- No.
"You know, after conversations like this with my brother, I would say,"
"""What have you got to lose by being honest, Sammy?"
"Explain to the man he is 63, not 36."
"And that his brief moment of fame as Inspector Charnfort..."""
Charnforth!
Inspector Charnforth!
"Please be calm, Mr. Hilliard."
I am perfectly calm.
What you are seeing is controlled anger tempered with icy detachment.
It's one of the many subtle emotions of which a good actor is capable.
"Three weeks on location in Devon, followed by three in a London studio."
There are currently only nine films in pre-production in British studios.
None of the others holds a role for you.
"I hope I share some of my brother's qualities, Mr. Ambrose."
"I do not, however, share his sentimental attachments."
I will not keep unprofitable clients on the books.
Is that why you came down here?
"No, I came to see what you were doing."
You mean you came to gloat.
"Oh, come on, Gibbs, don't make me do it for you."
"You thought Wickes was innocent the minute you left that first interview, and based on the lack of evidence we have against him and the indicators in the room with Jarvis, you were right."
We need to focus on Baylor.
"No, no, you need to say it."
We all thought he might be clean; none of us knew for sure.
I knew for sure.
That's why you need to say it.
Say what?
"That I was wrong, Gibbs, and I'm never wrong."
"And today of all days, I was wrong."
"Today, Doc, is as good a day as any."
(chuckles)
"No, it's not."
I keep telling myself
"Wickes looked at this picture for a reason, but he didn't."
Not once have I thought this man anything but guilty.
(scoffs) What kind of person does that make me?
Human.

"Hey, Doc, your black belt in badgering people pays off once again."
Ridgeway's AUTEC report sans redactions.
You find anything?
"In the late '70s,"
Ridgeway was paid to keep quiet about a classified technology he inadvertently saw while at AUTEC.
The report says the government paid dozens of people off.
Cash makes people forget.
"Yeah, well, for 500K, I'd keep quiet, too, even if I did see little green men on a destroyer."
"Anyway, Ridgeway knew the money came from a pool of government funds used for AUTEC payoffs."
It's a off-books account that hasn't been touched in decades.
"Tell Travis to set a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp."
"Right away, sir."

"A hundred and fifty years ago, the Gates Falls Mill stood here."
It employed 200 men and women.
"Good Yankees, all."
Sixteen-hour shifts during the Civil War... when the Gates Falls Mill made uniforms for the Union Army.
The job of the men wearing those uniforms... was to end the peculiar institution.
The peculiar institution being slavery.
When the mill burned in 1869... most of them got out.
The fire started in the first floor.
Most of the adult mill workers escaped.
Most of the children...
Most of the children did not.
This is the realm of darkness.
"Years later, a hospital was built here."
Kingdom Hospital.
The bleaching and dyeing vats have given way to doctors and researchers... and operating rooms filled with modern equipment.
"Here, life is charted with lasers... and EKGs and MRIs."
There is no place for superstition.
"Rational thought has replaced whispered myths... about the unquiet, hungry dead."
But there is such a thing as intellectual arrogance.
And arrogance is blind.
Perhaps the ground Kingdom Hospital stands on... is still uneasy... for the cold and damp have returned.
"Time for your enema, Mr. Stillmach."
"By tonight, that impacted colon will be a thing of the past."
Is someone there?
Little girl?
Girl-watching is thirsty work.
I brought you this.
You scared the hell out of me.
"Ronan Murphy was shot dead in the heat of the moment, but Linus, Danny had time with him, time to get information."
Let's see.
They never tested the envelope.
What?
- Bloody forensics.
- They're on a tight budget this financial year.
I don't care about their budget.
Get it tested now.
"Thanks, Maneet."
"So, what was all that about then?"
This is where Stephens-Lloyd's body was found.
"This is the original report, dated 21st November 1998."
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd was last seen a few weeks beforehand.
His body was found on the 14th by a fisherman.
- Statement's in the file.
- What's going on?
I've asked Murder Squad if they'll reopen the case.
- Right.
- Hiya.
- All right?
- You all right?
We just re-interviewed the fisherman who found the body.
He recalls that pretty much the first thing he was told at the scene was that it had to be a suicide.
It also appears no photos or videos were taken of the scene.
Was there a missing persons report or investigation at the time?
There was.
"The report's cursory, to say the least."
Doesn't look as if anyone was actively searching for Stephens-Lloyd.
The SIO at the time was a DI Marcus Thirwell.
He's no longer serving but we're doing our best to track him down.
"The pathologist's autopsy report at the time stated the body had superficial wounds and a broken arm, which he put down to the body being struck by a boat."
So my boss has agreed to reopen the case.
"Mr. Langley, tell me this."
Did the defendant resent your wife's wearing that necklace?
She cried.
"Yes, I'm afraid they fought about it several times."
"Did your niece receive an allowance, Mr. Langley?"
"Well, not in cash, but she did have charge accounts practically everywhere."
"Yes, I have a charge slip here, signed by the defendant, reserving two seats on a plane."
The destination is San Francisco.
The departure time is the night of the murder.
- Were you aware of this?
- My wife told me about it.
She cancelled the reservations.
Sid your wife also tell you who Merle had intended to occupy the other seat?
Yes.
A Mr. Pierce.
It was just a childish romantic whim on Merle's part.
I'm sure it was nothing serious.
But your late wife did object to their proposed elopement.
"Well, yes, but--"
Enough to hire a private detective to make sure to prevent it?
It was for Merle's own good.
"Isn't it true, Mr. Langley, that your wife's attitude toward Merle's young man only led to angrier tears and angrier fights between them?"
Yes.
I have no further questions.
"Mr. Langley, I believe the murder weapon has been identified as belonging to you."
Yes.
It was something I picked up in Italy on one of my trips.
It was of some historic interest.
"I kept it hanging in my study in plain sight for anyone, you understand."
Where were you at the approximate time of the murder?
I was in the garden.
Alone?
They caught up with him at last.
"Jack, they're in your office."
"Inspector Frost, we've met once before."
"All right, cut the introductions."
What's this all about?
I'm Detective Superintendent Bailey.
This is DI Moore.
We're investigating a number of matters relating to CID at the old Shepley Station during nineteen eighty-five and six.
One of the cases concerns the murder of Harriet Barr.
Strangely the files are on your desk.
I've just charged James Barr with the murder of his second wife.
"I'm in the middle of an investigation, so get out of my office."
This is my investigation.
"Precisely, the other way round."
"You are suspended from duty, effective immediately."
You will surrender your warrant card.
You will leave this office and this station.
You will talk to no one and take nothing with you.
You will make yourself available for interviews as and when required.
"Inspector, I talked to James Barr last night."
He came in for confession.
"Oh, well I hope he feels better."
Did he confess to the murders of both Mrs. Barr's or was is just the most recent one?
"Still, I don't supposed he mentioned the first one as he was absolved last time round."
I'm trying to help.
"I listened to him talk about his marriages, his job, his family."
All kinds of stuff.
He's not had it as easy as you'd think.
And he's not a man with murder in his heart.
He's a killer.
Maybe twice.
"Anyway if he needs a character reference,"
"According to his last words to his mother, sir, he was quite confident."
I think perhaps he did find her and paid the price for it.

When am I getting my property back?
"Settle down, Travis."
We need to ask you a few questions.
We now know that you found Fen somewhere a little closer
- than the Appalachian Mountains.
- (utensil clanking in pot)
- So what if I did?
- So where was it?
Would be 20 miles or so outside of Peterborough.
"Not a very glamorous locale, so I dressed it up a little."
Give the punters their money's worth.
- So the whole story's a lie?
- Not all of it.
I did almost shoot her thinking she was a bear.
"She was very young, no more than 8 I reckoned."
Badly injured and starving.
"I fed her, treated her wounds."
"She recovered, got back her strength... but never uttered more than the odd sound."
And never took to being civilized.
Happy in her own filth.
"And that's when you started thinking she could help pay her own way, and you created the myth of ""The Wild Child."""
"That's about the sum of it, yeah."
Until Mr. de Jaager discovered your campsite.
"He threatened to expose your show as a hoax, and you realized you were about to lose your meal ticket."
- What are you saying?
- What the detective is saying is you had clear motive for murder.
(Travis and Brackenreid laughing)
"I'm glad you find it funny because you're under arrest, Travis."
"Seems like I'm not the only one with a gift for the tall tale, huh?"
to play with them.
To go to the toilet with?
"No, no, no, no, I'm coming to the toilet bit."
"So, I was talking to one of the fellows in the orchestra, a violinist, and he said that Van arrived about ten minutes before the gig, gave them a list of 100 songs - they'd been there since"
"midday - he gave them a list of 100 songs and said,"
"""I'll be playing four of them""."
"And so later on, backstage, I was dying to go to the toilet, so I went into a toilet."
"The next thing, there's this knock on the door, going, ""Who's in my fucking toilet?"
"Who's in my toilet?"""
And it's Van and I'm delighted cos now I have a little Van moment to treasure forever.
"And I came out and he kind of recognised me or something - which was very flattering - but he started giving me a headbutt, was his was of greeting but it was a friendly headbutt,"
I don't know if that happens in Wales or...
"It's kind of like, arrrggghh."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, that one, yeah."
"I thought you meant, bang!"
I love you!
"No, no, no, it was very friendly."
Wow!
Yeah.
"As you were coming out of the lavatory, he did that?"
"Well, I hid in there for as long as possible but he wasn't going anywhere."
He stayed there.
I thought he wanted to go to the toilet.
He wanted to go and...
"Why didn't you come out straight away, what were you doing?"
"Well, I was a bit afraid."
I kind of thought he might go somewhere else.
We were talking about heckling earlier.
"I want to know what it's like to be heckled by Grandmaster Flash, the hip-hop legend."
Well...
Yeah.
Did he heckle you in a rhyme?
He did the teacher-school being with praise.
And what you say to him?
Again was blonde his hair.
This is the memory of an excursion here.
Brought his class away here on a Sunday of May of two years ago.
A cherry did not remain on the trees.
"This is Gyula with Erzsi.Before the went into war, was necessary hers engagement."
"Allegedly because they crawled under the piano and... and Erzsike's father was hear something...snuffle, crawled after them, but this for what reason onto the engagement?"
I...not understand.
This is the picture when they made it officer.
"Like that in the uniform, that my Lajos."
There is not a child like this yet.
My son.
My only good...
little son.
"Our beloved major lord, - and from this don't be alarmed, - does not like the clamour, and responds to single smells very sensitively."
"Which smell it may be, that he does not can to tolerate?"
This is...whereof our Gyula wrote nothing
"Don't be afraid Tót lord, nothing will be the smell for this loo until 5 years."
Lajos uncle!
Mariska old lady!
He day after tomorrow starts.
Very delicate onto the cleanness.
And...started the finish.
It would have been little if they would have had 100 hands for the Tót family
"And a lot of everything, it was necessary to think, which there was not at the house."
For example Chinese patterned bedspread was needed to ask for Kasztriner family.
Don't talk.
A major.
A major comes!
A major comes to a Tót family!
And how it gets to you?
What's she doing?
She's stripping in Asakusa.
She's strong!
She has confidence in the way she lives.
She's going straight ahead with what she wants to do.
Thats whatshesays.
I couldnt sayanythingtoher.
"Sensei, it's time to eat."
Where's Takao?
I'll get him.
"Here you are, dear."
It's been a while since all four of us sat down to eat dinner together.
"You know, the next time there's something to celebrate, I have a plan."
"I'll get myself some good medicine and I was thinking about getting Takao a charcoal grill for trips to the mountains, and Shinako a steel handrail."
What about me?
"Oh, yes."
Looks like I forgot about someone.
How about a mirror to go with Shinako's handrail?
"But maybe you need a handrail, too."
You probably don't need a mirror.
must have one.
Why do you say such things in front of the children?
"You say they're children, but it's been twenty years since Shinako was born."
We four have known each other for a long time.
I'd like to think that we'd all take care of each other.
"If you'd just take care of Mother, everyone would be taking care of each other."
"I thought you'd say that, Shinako, but there are some things you don't understand."
You probably think that Mother has sacrificed for me.
But it's not like that.
A couple who has been married for a long time usually doesn't make little sacrifices for each other here and there throughout their marriage.
Usually they both collapse.
Isn't there anything left after she collapses?
I thought this would brighten up your new place.

"Of course I know that, but you do kinda look like one, 'cause you're in a jail, and that's where criminals live."
I was set up!
Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war.
That's why he had me arrested.
"Ah, I see what you're doing."
You're going for the insanity defense.
Smart.
No!
I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems.
Where's Asami?
She'll listen to me.
"I asked her to come, but she said it was too hard for her."
You being in jail like this reminds her of her dad.
"Okay, gotta run, but I'll be back tomorrow."
And I am gonna get you the best attorney fame and fortune can buy.
"Bolin, wait."
"If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere."
Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled.
"Yeah, okay, big brother."
I promise.
Whew!
That insanity defense is definitely gonna work.
Should we wait another day?
Korra still might come with reinforcements.

Oh.

There was a letter for you by his side.
"Oh, God, not this."

Take a look in my personnel folder.
Not one civilian complaint.
Not one allegation of excessive force.
Nothing.
Now come on.
That's gotta account for something!
The only thing that counts for something is what happened inside this room.
"Look, Detective Flack did everything by the book."
The guy's a total professional.
"Unlike your relationship with him, which I understand is less than professional?"
"Not only is that none of your business, but it has nothing to do with Todd Fleming's death."
Say hello to the newest member of the rubber gun squad.
I've been officially removed from active duty.
"How do they know we're seeing each other, Don?"

But I thought we were trying to keep this thing quiet?
I didn't say anything to anyone.
That only leaves you.
People talk.
They make assumptions.
"Because of those assumptions now, my word doesn't mean squat with IA."
"- I mean, who could've told them?"
"- Look, Jess, I'm sorry."
But I got bigger things to worry about right now than squad room gossip.
Right.
Detective Angell's working this case until IA's finished with their inquiry.
Inquiry?

This car isn't bad
Do you want to test it?
Sit tight
Come inside and talk
This car will be yours for nine hundred dollars

I think it's a good thing.
Roundup is one of the safest
And most effective herbicides that have ever been developed.
And today there's now biotech crops
Grown in about 30 countries around the world.
Yeung:
"One country embracing this gmo model wholesale is paraguay,"
Where the percentage of farmland growing gm soybeans
Is larger than any other country in the world.
The scale of soy farms here stretches literally as far as you can see.
It's just soy in every single direction.
Yeung:
"Gmo soy is booming here,"
And business at the monsanto distributer has never been better.
We're just taking a tour around dekalpar.
"They mostly buy from monsanto,"
And they distribute to farmers all over paraguay.
♪  yeung:
Wow.
Does everyone in paraguay grow monsanto soy?
(speaks foreign language)
Yeung:
"Now because the seed genes belong to monsanto,"
A farmer is not allowed to replant any of the seeds from last years' crops.
"Instead, they have to buy new seeds every season."
Yeung:
"So farmers are buying a lot of monsanto seeds,"
And also a lot of roundup.
"Whoa, that's loads of roundup."
"This is all roundup, roundup, roundup."
How much roundup do you sell every year?

"Oh, so, suddenly you're an expert on how to run my business, Sinéad o'Handsome?"
He paid off some of my workers.

And if he were removed from the picture?
"If you guys get rid of Jabbar Hamady,"
"I'll give you guys new identities, passports, a free trip to wherever you want to go."
Okay.
Just give us what you got on the guy.
"One more thing, though -- when we get the new names, mine is Chuck Finley."
Okay?
That's non-negotiable.
"You got it, Chuck."
Taking a break?
"Yes, as a matter of fact."
"I figure if we're really gonna be on the run, this might be the last chance I have to get drunk in a jacuzzi, so..."
I'm living it up while I can.
What do you think?
"Well, in addition to wife-beating, the guy's hobbies seem to be torture and war crimes."
"Which means if we can find Jabbar, we can let the authorities take care of it."
"Well, don't forget that we're on the run, too, so, you know, not like we're gonna run around Miami asking people if they've seen a pissed-off Syrian."
"Schmidt said he had one remaining warehouse, right?"
Mm-hmm.
What are you thinking?
"If we could get Jabbar to send his men there,"
I might be able to get to him.
"Yeah, or you could just get shot."
What do you think?
- They should keep it that way.
- Keep it this way?
Not... not rebuild it.
Why?
"Because it's something in our past, in our history."
And we have to remember this.
Many soldiers died in this war.
- So better to leave it?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Actually, Lou agreed with the soldier."
The ruins should be left as a monument.
He wanted to build the new synagogue in the adjacent plaza instead.
So much has changed since then.
Would he have designed the same thing now?
Would they have thought Lou an idealistic dreamer for wanting to unite the Jews of the world with a single building?
Do you think Lou had a strong sense of being Jewish and what that meant?
"You know, I think it's been overplayed."
"Lou was a very spiritual person, but I don't think that was rooted necessarily in Judaism."
I think it was as much rooted in Christianity and in Buddhism and in all kinds of myth that he knew a lot about.
And he felt just at home doing a mosque in Dhaka as he was doing the Hurva.
But I think that when he came here something happened.
Mikveh Israel didn't get built.
He must have been bitter about that.
"You know, he must have been aware that as a Jewish architect he'd done no great Jewish buildings."
"Philadelphia had Frank Lloyd Wright's synagogue, or temple."
"And I think when he came here, he felt that the Jews entrusted him to do this."
And I think he wanted very much to have it realized.
"If you're a dude in here, and you think it's gross that I've used a Fleshlight, you need to look at the facts."

"Could you open it as though you're reading, then look at me again?"
I don't wanna do that.
- Why?
- It's a poor idea.
"Why would I be standing up with my jacket buttoned, reading?"
- It's just a prop.
- I can see that.
But I think it presents a very false depiction of me.
I'd much rather this picture at least seem honest.

The whole nation has been busily preparing for the funeral.
The people are barely coping!
"The people that were caught, are people who were recruited to plant the bomb."
"In fact, the North Korean military reconnaissance team belongs to Bureau agents."
Their task is to kill the President.
They are initiating a war.
How dare their country's leader do such a thing!
Myanmar is recommending a diplomatic approach.
To think such a thing can happen.
This is a shame for our country.
Both countries are now scrutinizing each other.
What do you plan to do?
I'm speechless.
"Well then, we'll attack too."
Do you all agree?
All right.
Let's fight.
Of course we must fight.
No need to look at his face.
Fine.
"Well, we'll just hit them then."
The terrorist attacks on Aung San must be punished in the name of our country.
Even the President is unaware of the plan.
"No, Chris."
Life is like a new baseball glove.
At first you think you're never going to get a ball in there.

"And when all that went away, my entire life turned upside down."
"I mean, I was reeling."
"So, when Brian had asked me for time off to go have a baby and you defended him..."
You took everything you were feeling out on me.
"Yeah, and I am ashamed of that."
Stephanie...
I will sign anything you want.
"I will say anything you need to make sure that the world knows that you are not a pushover, even if that includes admitting guilt."
"And if for some reason they still can't accept you here, you have your job back with us, standing offer."
♪♪
"I appreciate you opening up to me, Louis."
But this wasn't really about people thinking I'm a pushover.
It was about how you made me feel when you said those things to me.
Why would they make you feel anything?
"I mean, they were so clearly untrue."
- Were they?
- Come on.
I hear it's possible to leave a fraternity and survive.
Yeah. I know guys that have done it.
"Why are you doing this, Eric?"
Why are you helping me?
Because you helped me.
I wanna give you something before you go.
Your thesis film?
"If this were the third act of a movie, that's what this would be."
"-You'd watch it, it would be great- l'd give it to a professor who would give it to a student who now runs a studio."
And I'd see my name up on the big screen just a few months later.
I would have liked that.
Seeing my name on the screen just once.
You get to see your name in print a lot.
Yes. I sure do.
It's What's Up Tiger Lily?
-Woody Allen.
-His first.
Do you know it?
-No.
-He took this old Japanese movie and he just replaced the dialogue.
It's literally a remake of someone else's picture.
"Obviously, it's derivative and imitative and--"
Full of unexplored potential.
"But if you look at it closely, you can see a glimmer of Annie Hall a twinkle of Manhattan and the promise of Hannah."
Thank you.
"I'll call you when I'm done, and-- lt's a gift."
"We're both in very different places in our lives, Dawson."
Mine is much more predictable and defined than yours and I think we both know I'm probably not the person you need to be spending your precious time with right now.
I don't think your life is nearly as predictable and defined as you think it is.
Why is that?
Would you have predicted a night like this?
I would like to keep in touch with you.
What I need is... for Tom Horn to talk himself into a terrible tangle... and for you to get it down on paper.
It's no good for us just to write it down later.
You mean it has to be in his own words?
"Just like I said, Charles."
"Hello, Tom."
"Hello, Joe."
I got a letter yesterday from a fellow up in Montana.
What'd he want?
I'm not so sure this is the spot to be talking.
"Got a bottle of mescal in my office, and it's quiet."
Sure.
"You've spent some time in the hills, haven't you?"
"Most of my life, Tom."
- But the world is changing fast.
- I can see that.
And a man had better get with it.
I've been trying to work a few things out in my mind.
Staying in a hotel and being able to get a drink right away seems to help.
Think you'll ever get back in them hills again?
I don't know.
Scares me to death.
I see you're carrying a belly gun.
I've never known you to do that before.
"Well, carrying a rifle in town and all..."
I got this inquiry from Montana... for a man who could come up there and see to himself... and look to a few things that-a-way... in respect to the cattle stealing going on in the Big Moon up there in that district.
- What's required?
- Some ability with a rifle.
"You know, Joe, nobody ever offered to give me an office."
"- Make you feel kind of special, does it?"
- I don't know.
If I had your ability with a rifle... nobody would ever expect me to come in out of the field.
"As it is, I spend half my time on the railroad... handcuffed to some petty criminal, as just a delivery man."
You didn't see the telegram telling you that?
"No, I'm afraid the telegram was sent while we were on the way back."
I guess we didn't have to come back in such a hurry.
Thought it was impossible for mere children to move Grandma.
Grandma said she'd go right after holding a memorial service for Grandpa.
Did you write that in the telegram?
"Yes, he did."
August 9 is the day Grandpa died because of the atom bomb.
She'll go after the memorial service on that day.
That's not advisable.
"If Clark reads that telegram, it's going to be pretty awkward, isn't it?"
Why do you say that?
Why?
Because Clark is an American.
"And after he finds out that Grandpa was killed by the atom bomb... of course, it will make him feel pretty awkward."
We've got trouble.
"Father, you mean that you went there... and didn't tell Suzujiro and Clark and his family about Grandpa?"
Of course not.
It is something that is not necessary to mention.
It's Father!
Sam and Mother!
Thanks... for all your trouble.
"I'll bet it was some trip for you, too."
Machino told me that you were coming straight here.
"Since I haven't seen Grandma for some time, I decided to come and pay a visit."
Me too.
I've been having Grandma look after my kids all this time.
So I must see her and thank her.
"By the way, how was it in Hawaii?"
"I made a little inquiry and found out... that the pineapple farm is considerably large... and the canning factory that goes with it, too."
"And tell me, Suzujiro's house, I hear it's just like a castle."
Is it?
You cannot undermine me every time I try to discipline him!
I can't help it.
"He's so small, and helpless..."
I can't take any more of this!
It is tearing our marriage apart!
"For his own good, you have got to buckle down!"
"Do you understand me, Lois?"
You have to find some way to be this boy's mother!
"Hello, Dr. Sachs?"
It's Lois again.
"I know I just called, but... my husband yelled at me again about being stricter with Francis, and I wanted to know if you could write me a note that says yelling at him could damage his psyche?"
It's such a tender time for Francis.
"He's so fragile and unformed and I just want to make sure I get it right, but everything I do feels wrong."
"If this is all supposed to be so natural, why can't I get this?"
"I love him so much and I want to be a good mother and I know I have to be stronger, but I just don't think I can look in his eyes and not give him what he wants."
He has such a sweet little face and he's so innocent.
I'm going to have to call you back.
Fire... is... dangerous.
Fire can hurt you.
Fire can kill you.
I will not let that happen.
Let me make one thing clear.
"I love you, and I will do whatever I have to to take care of you, and keep you safe and happy and alive."
"I don't care if you grow up to hate me, but you will understand this:"
I will... do... anything.
That is how much I love you.
Yes.
That's right.
It's coming back to me;
"that sense of strength and power, and purpose..."
"I finally knew who I was, and what I was born to be."
"Honey, you're back!"
And it...
That chafed.
It was a stony beach.
ALAN GASPS
And it dragged me about 200 yards up the beach and...
Couldn't you let go?
Eventually I got the thing to lose it's power.
I pulled this thing that collapses the kite and I was just sort of lying there.
"My trunks are about 200 yards down the beach and I was there with a badly grazed penis on the beach, and a kite that had disappeared across the South Downs somewhere."
"Um, and..."
Was this three days after you had some crystal meth in a club?
LAUGHTER
But I've always seen things like that and wanted to get involved.
"It never occurs to me that there's a whole bit in between, where you've got to learn how to do that, and it'll take years to get any good at it."
"My new thing, now, is I give up easily."
I just give up.
Surely you can sue someone for that.
"I think I should be able to sue, for not being given the proper information - that, you know, I was unlikely to be any good at it."
LAUGHTER
What about your daughter?
Cos I can just imagine she was professional.
Helpless with laughter.
And fetched my trunks for me and brought them over to me like...
Did you have a go at your penis with TCP?
It was...
There's the voice of experience.
LAUGHTER Yeah.
"I'm just glad I had witnesses, cos it's quite difficult to explain to your other half why you've got a grazed penis, otherwise, you know."
"Yes, we've all been there."
Argh!
I kill you!
How hairy was it when you had to leave Iran for your dad?
"judging from her eyes, or movement, she could express how a sad wife feels"

"Mrs. Fat, congratulation ..."
Thank you
"First of all , I have to thank my parents"
Since they`ve been supporting me
And I have to thank my husband
He gave me chance to act
We had rehearsed many many times
"So, this award is yours too"
"Hubby, thank you"
"Alright, let`s present the final award of this night I believe that, you can guess it"
The best actor is Ah Fat...
Ah Fat`s father-in-law
Wonderful !
This award should go to me I did see him visiting the prostitute house!
Wait I am sorry I am the leading man !
You can tell I have done a great job
Why do you present the award to him?
"Your acting is quite good , but not mature"
"Say, when your wife heard your heart beat, your expression was a bit exaggerated"
That`s the point of view of ordinary audiences!
You won`t be that ignorant?
"No, when I heard your heart beat, I couldn`t feel any response from you I felt that, you couldn`t concentrate in acting"
You didn`t act well indeed
You ...
Be fair
Just one word
"Agatheus, Agamemnon, Apostolos and Algerius, right?"
"We'd go round the house and celebrate it there, but I haven' heard from them since September, so I don't know what's happening this year."
I think they'll call me.
"I have been round to their house and it's all boarded up, so I don't know what's going on."
But they'll ring me in due course to let me know the festivity arrangements.
I look forward to it as well.
Did...
Hold on a second.
A question from Sarah.
You can come to mine if you want.
Hmm?
Come to mine if you want.
This is exactly what I'm talking about!
Will you leave it alone?
I'm only being polite.
We had that one night in the Holiday Inn.
Yes.
And we both agreed you was rubbish.
"You didn't know what you were doing, fumbling around, so from now on, it's just a ""no""!"
"You've got to be brutal because she'll only, backstage, flash me her bits and I don't want to see it."
It's Christmas.
Everybody's in the party spirit.
Are you a party man yourself?
"Yeah, big time, big time, because people want me to come to their parties all the time."
"They look at me and they go, ""Yeah, I like the look of him."""
"Oh, yes, yes."
But what's going on upstairs?
That's what they want to know and there's a lot going on up there.
I like to talk about things like music and other stuff and politics and all that sort of stuff.
"You'd be in the kitchen in the party, not cutting a rug like Rhys?"
"No, I'd just be in the kitchen having a chat and all that sort of carry-on and holding court."
That's what I'd be doing.
"Then when you respond with ""I guess"" using its patented sigh-activated technology, the app automatically will set up a time and place for you guys to walk past each other on the street."

"Gosh, but ugh, what if even being close to a guy on the street makes me want to open my arms the right way?"
"For just another 49.99 a month, you can stand on a street corner and a guy will pass you in a double decker bus and wave."
What's up?

"If you want the premium package, for $75 a month, a guy in his 50s who doesn't want kids will buzz your door and say..."

Wow.

Mark is very familiar.
- Yeah.

Who have you said no to?
"Like, what was the situation where you said no to sex with a woman?"
"Well, you had sex and it was bad, then I said no to the second one."
- How did you say no?
- I didn't answer the phone.
That's a clear no.
"I gotta tell you this, no story."
"I told this woman no, I couldn't have sex with her because she started telling me about her son,"

Was that just off the top of your head or did you know he was going in the bank?
"I could see he was in pain and desperately trying to cash his cheque, so I spoilt it for him."
Anyway.
"But from that, you've become a hero, hailed by the fire brigade."
"Well, you know, this was a situation that I found myself in."
"You always think, ""Would I behave courageously and appropriately?"", if you were put in a situation."
"I was with my family and we were crossing a bridge near where we live, which is a railway bridge, so it's one of those bridges that's got two big iron sides to it - do you know what I mean?"
"And as we cross it, a van stopped and with smoke coming out of the bonnet."
"And the driver got out and legged it, and I could see all this smoke, and then flames were starting to come out."
"And I thought, ""That car's going to explode."""
"So I told Jane, my wife,"
"""Get the kids out, get them away, and I'm going to stop the traffic."""
"So, I stepped out into the road and just stopped all the traffic."
"And there were people being irate - ""What you doing?"""
"And I said, ""There's a car there that's about to explode, right."""
And um...
Ramped it up.
..they all stopped.

"They all stopped and the fire brigade came and they get out, they put the fire out."
His errands were never explained.
The dinner table was our battlefield.
"I do think, Charles, you might talk to me."
I've had a very exhausting day.
I was looking forward to a little conversation.
"Of course, father."
What shall we talk about?
Cheer me up.
Take me out of myself.
Tell me about the new plays.
But I haven't been to any.
"You should, you know, you really should."
It isn't natural in a young man to spend all his evenings at home.
"Well, father, as I told you, I haven't much money to spare for theatregoing."
"My dear boy, you must not allow money to become your master in this way."
"Why, at your age, your cousin Melchior was part-owner of a musical piece."
It was one of his few successful ventures.
You should go to the play as part of your education.
I received one letter from Sebastian.
"It was written on, and enveloped in heavy Victorian mourning paper, black-coroneted and black bordered."
"""Dearest Charles."
I found a box of this paper... at the back of a bureau so I must write to you as I am mourning... for my lost innocence.
It never looked like living.

"- No, what questions?"
Everything is clear.
No questions.
"Comrade lieutenant, are you going to take this paperwith you"
Can we keep it forfurther study?
"OK, But I'll cut the editorial column out."
I have to make more presentations in other units.
"-Yes, we believe you.Why not?"
"- Folks, I'm not a smoker."
"-Pay some respect to us, comrade political officer."
"- Ok, I'll take one."

"Ivan Semenovich, where are Party membership application forms?"
-You'll have them later.

Have you seen my application?
There are references attached to it.
"Your application has been discussed, but the Party Committee members decided to wait."
We'll return to it afterthe offensive is over.
Where will I look forthese Party committee members afterthis offensive?
-Exactly.
"- Listen, stop croaking, man."
"-l'm listening to you, comrade Bessonov."
- l've already given an explanation.
Please sit down so we can decide this.
"Excuse me, it's news from my department."
I'm not entirely up to date.
The police have salvaged what they thought was the body of Emilie Zeuthen.
He apparently shot a duffel bag rather than Emilie.
"Clearly, we're only talking about material damage."
This is indeed a joyful message.
"So, if no one has any objections, we'll have to conclude that events have overtaken our discussion here."
It's even clearer in this one.
"The perpetrator escaped, and there are no signs that Emilie was in Jutland."
"- The good news is, she may be alive."
- Has Zeuthen been informed?
"Yes, he's at police HQ."
What happened?
We need to speak with Special Branch.
The witness must be taken seriously.
I want to know Ussing's involvement.
He's with Special Branch but there's trouble.
How so?
The police accused Special Branch of keeping information from them in the old case.
Special Branch said they didn't know about it.
I don't know what it's about.
"But regarding the Treasurer, you have every reason to be angry."
I'd just like you to let it slide.
No more trouble now.
Call the head of Special Branch in to explain.
The current took the bag out into the fiord where we found it 12 metres down.
"The umbrella anchor made it sink, in spite of the buoyancy of the other materials."
"The bullets went through bag and contents, and match the calibre used by the perp."
I wish I could answer the questions that this raises but...
She's alive.
"He was traced to Jutland, but there are no signs Emilie was with him."
I still love her.
But does she still love you?
- Of course she bloody does.
- OK.
"Look, I'm just saying."

And why my predecessor's enjoying early retirement.
"Now, I'm sure I come with a... ..with a certain reputation."
But I like to think I'm fighting on the side of the angels.

"This is Kayleigh Fenchurch, a former dancer at the Pleasure Palace."
"Yeah, I know who she is but why is she next to my victim, Freddie Lau?"
"Because she was strangled, too."
"However, unlike Freddie Lau,"
Fenchurch has been buried in Thames silt for at least a week now.
It's impossible to recover any of the killer's DNA.
Lau's casino is less than a mile from the Pleasure Palace.
You think we're looking for the same killer?
I'm just pointing out the similarities in their deaths.
Strangling is not a common MO
- Such a clumsy way to kill someone.
- What?
You have to look them right in the eye for a good three minutes.
You really have to hate them.
Or love them.

"- No, and I don't really--"
It was written for an Austrian concert pianist named Paul Wittgenstein.
He lost his right arm during the First World War.
He embarked on a long search to commission piano works... for the left hand alone.
"Composer after composer turned him down, but he refused to give up."
"Finally, he found Ravel... who, like him, was willing to accept this great challenge."

You keep talking about this damn gift.
"I had a gift, and I exchanged it for some mortar fragments, remember?"
Wrong.
Because the gift does not lie in your hands.
"I have hands, David."
Hands that can make a scalpel sing.
More than anything in my life...
I wanted to play... but I do not have the gift.
I can play the notes... but I cannot make the music.
You've performed Liszt...
"Rachmaninoff, Chopin."
"Even if you never do so again, you've already known a joy... that I will never know as long as I live."
Because the true gift... is in your head... and in your heart and in your soul.
"Now,you can shut it off forever... or you can find new ways to share your gift with the world-- through the baton, the classroom, the pen."
"Well, what do you know?"
Not enough.
"It sounds like science fiction, but you make planes invisible."
Project Harvey.
- Which is?
- Stealth.
We can bring our planes and submarines right into Soviet territory... without any detection.
The K.G.B. Kidnapped this man...
Anton Baklanov... and took him back to the Soviet Union.
Was he the key to Stealth?
- We don't know that man.
- But he wasn't the key to it.
No one person has the key to anything.
Information is spread out through multiple departments and highly compartmented.
Classic definition of the left hand not knowing the right.
Soviets would have to kidnap a hell of a lot of people to put it all together.
And get through a hell of a lot of security.
The last meeting where all of the different groups actually met... each of us had two of our security guys watching our every move.
What meeting was that?
What meeting was that?
He is probably being tortured right now.
And once they realize he doesn't have everything they need... they will find out who does.
You said that they would need to kidnap a hell of a lot of people to get to Stealth?
"Well, that's exactly what they'll do."
They got to him.
Circumvented dozens of F.B. I. Agents looking for him... and sent him out of the country.
You think two D.O.D. Security guards can protect you... or anybody else?
Think again.
"Alexandria, Virginia, two months ago."
Who was there?
"Uh, reps from Lockheed and Northrop."
They're competing against each other for the D.O.D. Contract.
I wonder if you've ever killed anyone.
Have you?
"No, you never have."
"Besides, I'm going to tell you something."
"It isn't in your best interest to kill me,"
Amelia Folch.
You know me?
(LAUGHS) Yes.
What do you know about me?
Everything.
"Your father was called Enric, your mother, Carma, and you are an only child because your mother almost died birthing you."
That's enough for today.
I have business to attend.
"After what you've done, do you think I'm just going to let you go?"
I haven't done anything.
They betrayed me.
"I've saved lives, people who would have ended up in front of a firing squad if I didn't get them out of here and who can't escape now."
"When Napoleon's men wanted to kill El Empecinado, did you help them for the good of humanity?"
"I helped them with the hope that the war would end sooner, so that Spain would change for the better."
"(SIGH) When I found out they were going to kill him,"
"I wanted to warn him, but it was too late."
"The Ministry has you fooled, Amelia."
Preserving the past?
But it's History.
"Mmhm, and sometimes it's a shitty history."
Can you imagine the amount of mistakes that could be fixed?
Of course Spain defeated Napoleon.
But for what?
So that Fernando VII would annul a constitution that had cost so many lives?
while he was on vacation in Bayonne;
"so that he would return and kill so many heroes, like El Empecinado;"
"so that our best men, Goya, Jovellanos... would have to live in exile."
A seat belt that smells like Old Spice and bourbon.
- Easy now.
"[Michael Narrating]Assassination's one percent shooting, 99% preparation."
"Anticipating moves, devising approaches... recruiting sources... finding the perfect opportunity so the bullet's almost an afterthought."
Usually that's when a target's on the move... when there are too many variables to control them all.
-We should get out of here.
"-Michael, whatever happens, I just wanted to say thankyou."
You can thank me by keeping your head down...
"- and staying away from windows, okay?"
- Got it.
[ Michael Narrating] There are ways to lessen the risk.
An armed escort... taking an unpredictable route toyour destination... having backup in a trail car.
"But ultimately, as long as the assassin... knows where you're going... they have the upper hand."
The poi nt is the thi ng works.
I t's one of the few things in my life that's never let me down.
[ Michael Narrating] It's impossible to stop a good assassin... from finding an opening and taking a shot.
The bestyou can do is control where the best opening is.
And sometimes that's enough.
[ Michael ] Drop it.
You set me up.
- Bravo.
"- Put it down, Evelyn."
Hey.
I could still do this.
Did I tell you how much this job pays?
You could buy someplace decent to live-- even at Miami prices.
Put the rifle down.
How'd you know I'd be here?
I figured you had a source in the U.S. Attorney's office.
You knew Doug was thinking about testifying.
"Now, I count six different vantage points with a betterview ofthat entrance."
- How'd you know I'd be at this one?
"Hold that thought, Jerry."
Patrick here was about to tell us how I stole his idea.
"First of all, very uncool using my real name, and second, you did steal my idea."
Here we go.
"Okay, remember?"
"We were blasting a J in the Zippie's parking lot and a bird dropped a deuce right on my shoulder, and then we started talking about how that would make a cool video game."
"Yeah, but in your version the player was just an average dude who was trying to avoid getting pooped on."
"It was my idea to make the player the pooper, not the poopee."
"Plus, when I brought it up to you a couple days later, you said, quote,"
"""That's the dumbest idea ever,"" enquote."
"In my defense,"
I was sober when I said that.
"Okay, look, Null Legend, or Patrick, whatever your name is..."
It's Patrick.
Patrick.
"...the customer you're protecting, the guy in this picture, he kidnapped a girl."
"Dude, your sister was kidnapped?"
No that was just a clever ruse.
I'm actually with Five-O.
"And all I got to do is say the word, and the cavalry will storm this place, seize every computer in here, and arrest your entire crew."
How many customers are gonna want to do business with you then?
I can't believe you narc'd me out.
I can't believe you're still running Linux on a 32-bit Samurai stack.
"Get out of the dark ages, dude."
"Also, get us that name."
(softly):
Yeah.
(Steve grunts)
"Let's get HPD and CSU down here, tear this place apart."
"(siren chirps, indistinct radio chatter)"
(siren wailing in the distance)
DANNY:
You want a sandwich?
"Oh, I'd love a salami and cheese."
"Too bad, he loved peppers and meatballs."
Incoming!
That'll work!
"Can't talk now, Carl, this is a two-hand job."
Anything look familiar?
"The stop signs do, but I think they use the same ones all over town."
"All right, where is the last place you remember parking it?"
I had a dentist appointment on Wednesday.
"I've driven it since then, but that's the last place I remember parking it."
"Okay, any idea what clubs you went to last night... goth, gay?"
Elks?
There's a couple of stamps on my hand.
"You don't have a black light, do you?"
"No, I don't."
"For crying out loud, Victoria, think."
"Hey, if you're going to bark at me, you can take me home and I will get Mike to help me look."
My fiancé is not your personal lo jack.
"Besides, mom probably has him planting corn by now."
"All I know is, he's a lot more patient and understanding than you."
That's because he hasn't played car-and-seek every Sunday since you got your learner's permit.
Can we at least assume it's still in Illinois?
"You know, when I told Mike about misplacing my car, he was not mean or judgmental."
"Mm-mm, no, he was firm but fair, just like daddy."
"Victoria, focus."
"Anything around here ring a bell... bars, restaurants, maybe one of your shoes laying in the road?"
"Both shoes are accounted for, but keep your eyes peeled for a hair scrunchie and a black laced bra."
"All right, I'm done."
"Okay, we'll just wait for your car to get booted and towed like last time."
"No, last time we drove around,"
I eventually remembered I parked it in the garage.
I...
I think we do need to recognize a new era has begun for mankind.
- I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet.
"And the UFO phenomenon is real, although it's been covered up by governments for quite a long time."
The United States government knew a whole lot more about UFOs than it was telling the American public.
There's an intelligence involved that there was a highly evolved technology that to a degree we were carrying a dialogue with this intelligence.
"- 'Cause I read NATO military material that indicated that the UFOs were not only real, they represented something far beyond anything I had ever imagined before."
"-Could I get...$60 on pump four, please?"
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I understand over the years... some peculiar things have been happening around these parts.
"Cattle mutilations, strange lights in the sky, things of that sort."
"-No, I don't know anything about that."
-Really?
Okay.
Set to go?
"- Yes, sir."
-Son of a bitch.
Yes..
-May I ask why you chose me?
"I've known who you are for some time now, you seem like an honest man."
-I'm all about the truth.
"And if what you're about to tell me is the truth, am I to understand we're all in a very grave danger?"
-Yes.
"In five days, human existence as you know it, will forever change."
-Why don't we start with your name?
-Jaelen.
-Jaelen?
"So, Jaelen, who are you?"
You're speaking of the Phoenix Lights incident?
Are you trying to tell me you were aboard that craft?
-Yes.
Read that part right there.
"It says here Patrick told authorities he got through the assault by focusing on sand."""
His attacker made him stare at an hourglass while the abuse went on.
"He was told that if he didn't cry until all the sand emptied out, he wouldn't be killed."
So the trauma of the assault was fused with the image of an hourglass.
"And launched an obsession with time, so much so that he went on to build devices that measure it with extraordinary mathematical precision."
And the police report says he was abducted on a Thursday night at 10:00 and was found released in a park the next morning at 9:00.
11 hours later.
That's what he meant with Ellie Zumwalt.
He was telling her the amount of time that he himself had been held in captivity.
And that may be Josie Zumwalt's timeline.
"So the clock is on Ellie, not Josie."
She's got 11 hours to give this unsub what he didn't get from his own mother.
"Josie was taken at 4:30 this morning, which means we have until 3:30 this afternoon."
"JJ, are you still at the hospital?"
Good.
Here's what I need you to do.
An apology?
We can do it from here.
"This room, one cameraman, no reporters."
I don't understand.
The man who took your daughter left you alive intentionally.
But...
But why?
Because he needs to hear you express how sorry you are for what happened.
But it wasn't my fault.
Josie knows that I didn't--
I know.
You're not apologizing to Josie.
"In fact, don't ever mention her name."
Just refer to her as your child.
Don't even say daughter.
"Brutus, what shall be done?"
"If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back..."
- for I will slay myself.
"- Cassius, be constant."
"Popillius Laena speaks not of our purposes, for look... he smiles, and Caesar doth not change."
"Trebonius knows his time, look you, Brutus..."
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
Where is Metellus Cimber?
Let him go.
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
He is addressed.
"Press near, and second him."
Are we all ready?
What is now amiss that Caesar and his Senate must redress?
"Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar..."
Metellus Cimber casts before thy seat... an humble heart.
"I must prevent thee, Cimber."
Be not fond to think that Caesar bears such rebel blood... that will thawed from the true quality with that which melteth fools:
I mean sweet words.
Low-crooked curtsies... and base spaniel fawning.
Thy brother by decree was banished.
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him...
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Know Caesar both not wrong but with just cause.
Nor without cause will he be satisfied.
Is there no voice more worthy than my own... to sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear... for repealing of my banished brother?
"I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar... desiring thee that Publius Cimber may have immediate freedom of repeal..."
- What?
Brutus...
"- Pardon, Caesar;"
"Caesar, pardon."
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall... to beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
"You see, my goal is to examine the crime activities in the city of Zagreb."
"In fact, to find out the way of getting rid of it more easily."
I've told you I'm a sentimental man.
I'm doing all this 'cause I love this city.
I can't say I wasn't impressed by Fabian's theory.
"That night when he told me all about it, I wasn't able to sleep but I was rather listening against my will to the paper rustling that was coming out of his room."
There was something silly about it like with every other hobby.
I find hobbyists strange as usual.
"On the other hand, there was this Fabian's noble desire for common good, such denial and creative fervor that left a strong impression on me."
"During these days, however, I had to think about other things as well."
Because Zdenka has shown up.
Ivica!
It's you?
Hi.
- Hi!
When have you come?
How are you?
"- I'm fine, thank you."
The day before yesterday.
Mom had a heart attack.
She's feeling better now.
The doctor had come.
It was Zdenka.
A woman I've never recovered from to this day.
We were living in the same street and I was in loved with her ever since my childhood.
"At one point, we were even a couple in the high school days."
"We used to hold hands, walk around Paromlinska street and everybody knew about us."
"Her father was already working in Switzerland, and one day he called her to come there even before her graduation."
It was known that she opened a beauty salon in Zurich.
"We were sending letters for a while,"
I remember I was writing pretty fearfully and then I just stopped at all.
How are your kids?
Inky pinky parlay voo good night.
"Sorry, sir."
If you had sticking up hair on Vimy Ridge you'd know about it.
"If your hair stuck up there, do you know what would happen?"
"No, sir."
Get your head blown off.
Did you not wear helmets?
Occasionally.
"Now, the audience is all seated, so we shall be going on to the stage very shortly."
"And we won't be nervous, because we will not think about ourselves, we will think about the music and the pleasure it brings."
Let's have our happy hum.
"# Brother, come and dance with me"
# Both my hands I offer thee
"# Right foot first, left foot then"
# Round about and back again... #
Get off!
"Come on, don't you want a bit of fun."
I'm only wanting what others have had.
You know what they say - you don't miss a slice off a cut loaf.
Shall I tell your wife you said that?
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to take the opportunity to thank Miss Gertrude Riall for the wonderful work she is doing training these Manchester schoolchildren, who have sung with such tunefulness and energy this evening."
"They are a credit to you, Miss Riall."
Thank you.
"And such is my faith in this lady,"
"I am going to propose to the Columbia record company that they make a recording of the Manchester Children's Choir led, of course, by Miss Riall accompanied by the Halle Orchestra, in order that we may prove,"
"if proof were needed, that what Manchester plays today, the world listens to tomorrow!"
"Mr Kirkby, I'll walk home with you."
Do you not have a coat?
No.
I don't need one.
I'm a really warm person.
Feel!
Thanks a lot
Thanking us!
Look here How arrogant you are?
Were you sitting in the car and asking us to push?
Will your legs sprain if you alight from car?
Ask these two to push the vehicle and start it
Atleast let their flab come down
Do they have any sense?
Those two sit like water melon
-Hello sir
-Who is that?
I am lame
So I sat in the car while you were pushing it
"If I am at fault, forgive us"
I have done a mistake
I didn't know your leg has a deformity
It is alright
"I am a ruffian, Short tempered some times talk like this"
You were with me You could have informed
-You may go
-Yes sir
"Don't mistake me, careful"
Come here
Careful
Poor girl
Many thanks to you
Careful
Poor girl
"Sister, why did you deceive them that you are lame?"
"Wanted to avenge them, for they scolded us"
I think he lives in this area You will be trapped
People normally brush their teeth
Has he talked to you quite a lot about that?
"Oh, no, not really, but he didn't have to, because back then it was really normal, in the '80s, to pick up the phone and someone go, ""I'm going to kill you,"
"""I'm going to cut your throat."" And I went, ""Dad, it's for you."""
Cos the revolution was what - in '79?
The revolution was '79.
We were already in Britain on a bit of a sabbatical.
My dad was a journalist.
"So, we were living in Britain for a bit."
"And then, the revolution happened and my dad went back to Iran and we planned to move back."
"So, you were a little girl now?"
Six or seven or something?
I was six.
"You see, they wanted my dad."
He was on - like many artists - on the list of people to kill.
And then there was an assassination plot that was foiled by Scotland Yard in 1984.
"What it's meant, though, with MY stand-up..."
"Like, I'll get trolled on Twitter and I'll get really upset, and my dad will go, ""How many people wrote you nasty messages?"""
"And I'll say, ""Oh, about 20, and one of them said I've got fat legs."""
"And my dad will go, ""Oh, that's so sad - 20."
"""That means your career isn't going very well."
"""When 5,000 people hate you, then I think you're a success."""
"Then he starts, like, showing off, lauding it over me."
"And he was going, ""You know, in Iran, after the revolution,"
"""tens of thousands of people spilled into the street"
"""chanting for my execution."
"I was so famous."""
"He looks at me like I'm a piece of shit on his shoe and he goes, ""Look at you - nobody even wants to kill you."
LAUGHTER
"""It's embarrassing."
"""My friends, they say to me, 'Is Shappi dead yet?"
'
"""I say, 'No, she's not very ambitious.'"""
May be for publicity I have even never killed a mosquito
Then may be you are the 1st person of this world
There was a jug on the desk l stopped fire with it
Why you burn his will?
I dont know anything about his will.
I did not see it.
He wanted to buy mr
Thats why he killed himself
Since 3 years he was planning for this day
He was saying after killing these 3 them he will get peace
I never thought he mean that
What did he say?
Where is that proof?
Did anyone steal it?
May be he did not have any proof
Now what?
We dont anything except Mr Malhotra's words
First time I'm feeling good by leaving any place I dont understand.
What about that evidence?
There was not any evidence
Kabir Malhotra was a mad person
He tried to trap us and when he was unsuccesful than he committed suicide
We will follow everyone
lnvestigate everything on tape
Start suveillance of everyone.
I need report of their every movement
Its bleeding
I will not let you die
Only Maya
A good girl like you what is doing in my club?
There're many things about me which you dont know..!
Whatever I know is sufficient for me.
- Thank you.
Your witness.
"Miss Morrow, did it ever occur to you that Somers might have lied about giving Reed that certified check for delivery?"
Yes.
But he was very positive.
So positive that he flew into a rage and threatened you with his cane?
"No, no."
It was nothing like that.
He seemed to be very sure of getting me to do what he wanted.
Does that explain the tickets to Copenhagen reserved in your name at a Los Angeles airlines office?
Or did you reserve those tickets yourself--
How did he find out about that?
"...intending to leave town as soon as you or Latham Reed had $50,000 in hand?"
"No, no, the tickets were Mr. Somers' idea, and it was just an idea, that's all."
It was...a gift he planned.
What sort of gift?
What were the tickets for?
He said he wanted to get Axel out of his hair.
He suggested I persuade him to go away on a long trip with me.
A honeymoon.
What was your answer?
"Well, how on earth could I promise to marry a man who's never said one word but ""furniture"" to me?"
Who never in any way has told me that--
that he feels as I do?
"Is this court to understand, Mr. Hadley, that you had a meeting with Mr. Somers the day of his death?"
Yes.
"It was at his factory, that same evening, about 6:30, before he left Long Beach."
How did this meeting come about?
"Well, I had heard a rumor that he was going to close down the cabinet shop, so I went right over to see him."
I figured that the least he owed me was a chance at Axel's real estate.
I also wanted to know if he was going to fire all those fine craftsmen.
- I wanted to hire some of them.
I heard things
Did you know that İbrahim Paşa has icons set in his palace?
"How can I not know that, my Valide?"
That's what I don't get
How can you allow it?
It is a scandal
Nilüfer
Look into my eyes
I said look
Can I rely on you?
"Of course, my Sultana"
When the time comes you'll do something for me
But it is a little dangerous
"My Sultana, I will do anything for you"
First the table than the paintings
I said nothing not to hurt you.
But this is too much my lion
They won't be welcomed
It will have more harm than benefits
İbrahim Paşa doesn't live alone in that palace
There's Hatice.
They'll soon have a baby
They may be harmed
It urgently needs to be destroyed and removed.
Those things are icons!
As long as I live those sculptures will live on the yard of that palace
Whoever tries to do harm to İbrahim Paşa or to her family will face me
It will be known as such
Your decision my lion.
It is my duty to warn you
I'm telling you the last time as your mother
You are making a mistake
"He'd also become deeply involved with the woman working in the office, a young architect named Anne Tyng."
"She's the mother of my half sister, Alex."
Lou was not a domestic person.
Let's face it.
He never was.
And...
"He lived, really, in the office, you know?"
"He had his bench where he would take catnaps, and he even sent his laundry out from the office."
"I mean, he was really... and, of course, I know that he crossed his home address off on his... on his passport."
That's why they had a hard time locating his... in letting people know that they found him dead in 30th Street Station.
"- Penn Station, New York."
- Penn Station.
My mother always said that Lou had crossed off the address because he planned to leave Esther and come marry her.
I don't think he was capable of doing that.
"I mean, I'm sorry but"
I really can't see him doing something like that.
I realized he was not about to do that.
"He always said that work was the most important thing, that you cannot depend on human relations, that, really, work is the only thing you can count on."
Did you fall in love with him right away?
Lou?
"- Sure, yeah."
- Why?
"Well, he had tremendous charm."
"I mean, he was charismatic, and he was very accessible and very endearing to people."
"And when you got pregnant, were you surprised?"
"Oh, yeah, it was a physical shock."
But that didn't seem to change his idea of what he was going to do.
"And he just would say,"
"""Well, you have to be philosophical about it."""
"So, I mean, I could spend the rest of my life being philosophical, but there was not much point in that."
"You know,"
I had to do something.
Can't you tell him to give money?
He is also your brother What harm has he done to you?
Please take it Why do you..?
"It is alright, please take it Have it"
On condition the accused Arul Kumaran must report to the..
"..concerned police station signregisters,Ireleasehimonbail"
- Uncle
- Yeah
Our advocate has fired the plaintiff's advocate like anything
- Dr.Viswanathan only helped us..
- Get an auto
Why an auto?
Our vehicle is there
"Your job is over I will take care of the rest, you go"
Why do you send home now?
Are you concerned about my family?
Please listen to me
I know you can counter 1 0 opponents simultaneously
But whom have you beaten this time?
-Brother of the one who holds the reign of this state
-You are right
"The proverb 'with uncle's help you can climb hill' is right, come on"
Come dear
How did you stay for 4 days inside the police station?
I am not worried about 4 days confinement
No one came to see me at least for one day
That makes me sad what wrong I have done?
"If I haven't hit him, he would have killed me"
- Then would you all been happy?
- Don't talk like that son
Dad did not give money to bail me out
"Mom, I have given my salary 4500 every month to you"
"- Yes, sir"
"Thank you very much, God willing, I'll live up to your expectations"
- Who shall I say it is?
"- Rabab, he's expecting me"
Welcome
How beautiful!
"Come in, whoever comes in here becomes a member of the house"
- Is this a house?
- A house... or an office...
"It's a safe place, comfortable and cozy"
I was afraid you wouldn't come
I always keep my promises
- And who is this?
"- My father, rest his soul"
- He looks like a real Pasha
"- Of course, what did you think?"
That I was a fake Pasha?
This picture is of my dad in the hall of the regal palace... after taking the oath in front of the king...
Ice?
It was the first time he heads the Ministry of Public Works
"That's why I agreed to come, to have something I can be proud of"
I can say I knew a real Pasha
"Instead of the misery I'm in, you see the people at the bar"
You're so cute
"But I've no luck, Pasha"
Where's the toilette?
"Oh, when you go out, it'll be on your right"
Excuse me
"Everything is set, I'll go out for a couple of hours"
"I'll meet my brother Malak, there's something we're taking care of"
Take your time

"I am Jocelyn Bennett, and we are at the Skirt Magazine headquarters... i.e., where fashion trends are invented."
How about how you got here.
"Well, I think I took my school model a little bit too serious."
When I was taught not to be served but to serve...
I think they had God's delivery in mind... and not fashion magazines.
"I could be in the staff of ""Glamour""... but I'd rather be an intern at Skirt."
I like to think of myself as a missionary to salvage the tacky.
"This is our Associate Greeter, a.k. A, receptionist."
"Hey, Deborah."
I'd like to have him back.
You're very welcome to him.
Just a minute.
I haven't finished yet.
"Are you any closer to finding out who killed Margaret Ellis, or, for that matter, who tried to kill her husband--Arthur?"
"I want you to know that I shall be making an official complaint-- arresting fleming, keeping me detained for 3 full days."
"I think you've acted well beyond your authority, Mr. foyle."
"Sorry, sir."
It was normal procedure.
"Normal or not, it was unnecessary and inconvenient."
"Have you finished now, Mr. Spencer?"
"I'm a politician, Mr. foyle."
"And the way you've treated me,"
"I think you have forgotten that I am the leader of a legitimate organization with legitimate views, even if you don't agree with them."
But I'd like you to know that I am just as much a patriot as you are.
I love our country.
But it is possible to believe that this war with Hitler is misguided.
"Poles and Czechs, they're Jewish interests, not British."
I know what you believe.
I don't think you do.
"I doubt that you know, for example, that the first 2 British pilots shot down over Germany were black shirts."
The kiel raid at the end of last year-- they were both mosley's men.
"And sir Ernest bannerman, mp--"
I suppose you would call him a crank and a traitor.
"Well, he served in the first war."
He was a member of the north Russian relief force in 1919.
"Right now, he has a son serving in northern France."
You have a son serving with the raf.
"Are you prepared to lose him, to see him slaughtered simply because Hitler invaded Poland?"
I'll take you to Mr. fleming.
"Thank you, milner."
"You see, we're not so different, you and I."
-Oh god...
-He has brought water
Don't eat the food Some one has poisoned the food
Some party fellow might have done it Don't eat
Why do you torment me like this?
"To kill you, they would have killed 500 people?"
Who asked you to come here?
I don't know what sin I have committed?
All sins have come in your form
My honour and prestige has gone
All because of him
What are you talking?
Any other dad would have been proud
If his son saves 500 lives
But you are admonishing him put the entire blame on him
"He has beaten the MLA, because he has hit you"
I have seen dad's who feel for..
..their ward even if he is a thief
But I am seeing a dad here who hates his son who is like by all
Stop you young girl
His siblings are quiet
You talk loudly as if you have shared his bed
Dad
Don't cry
"Kanmani, don't cry"
Not sharing bed But going to share life with me
"To kill our family, he has targeted the whole village"
Will he keep quiet?
Before he strikes us We must strike him
Then only he will have a fear over us
Don't worry I can bring the entire Tiruppur to coimbatore
Break the boards first
- feel it.
This can't be happening to me.
"Better put the kettle on, Pam."
And bring in one of Margaret's home-made Swiss logs.
Joyce needs a sugar infusion.
"Have a sip of tea, Joyce."
- Is camilla here?
- That bitch?
"That's enough, Pam."
"I can imagine some of the things you're thinking, Joyce."
"To an outsider, all this must seem pretty strange."
"But before you judge us, there are some things you should know."
"Once upon a time, there was a woman who was kind and courteous to everyone."
But there was one person of whom she was especially fond.
Me.
"Between them, the two friends saw the good in everyone until one day, when something very, very bad happened."
It was a horrific experience.
"But bizarrely, the two friends discovered that what doesn't kill you sometimes makes you stronger."
So they made a pact that they would do their best to ensure the streets of Little Stempington would never again be the target of lowlife lawbreaking scum.
"And once they started, they realised they actually quite enjoyed it."
So they did it again and again.
But then it all went wrong.
Camilla got greedy and she wasn't the only one.
"She crossed over to the dark side, taking Hilary and Lillian with her."
"And ever since then, it's been our mission to stop her."
"Good can't live in the same town as evil, Joyce."
"- well, why don't you go to the police?"
- CamiIIa got there first.
Jeremy said he died in a car crash.
"When he suddenly developed a conscience,"
camilla arranged a little road accident.
- Once she's got you she's got Jeremy.
"You needed someone's expertise, you know, for the clay formulation and the mold making."
But he left Acme before the chip design was finalized.
Yeah.
Okay.
"So, the counterfeiters, they walk in the minute we open, right- 12:01."
They buy a legitimate $100 chip.
They walk out.
They start making their own by 12:02.
"Now if they're any good, they start cranking out them phonies before noon."
"Except, Ed, the machine that produces the high quality chips... is extremely rare and extremely expensive."
"And I talked to the manufacturer, and he said there's only six in existence... and the only one anywhere near here is at Acme."
"All the others, there's no way they could have produced the fakes... and gotten 'em back here in the same day."
Did you talk to the other five places that have these machines to see if they still have 'em?
- I will get on that.
- Good.
"Oh, listen."
"I need you to check surveillance video... for anyone that came in, uh, between 12:00 and 3:00 yesterday... and went directly to the cage or to a table and cashed in a $100 chip."
"Mr. D., that's like thousands of people."
- We might need more time-
- We don't need any time.
You-You need time because I expect this done by tonight.
So does Jake care that you're helping me with all this stuff?
He's working late.
Seems like he does that a lot.
Remember this?
"Yeah, I remember that."
I remember how pissed you were when I solved it before you.
I'm still pissed.
"I wonder what I could get for this thing- If you ask me one more time... how much you could get for that on eBay, I swear, I will deck you."
I'm not gonna say anything.
Uh-huh.
Probably couldn't get more than a couple of bucks.
"Well, he passed away"
"Brother, with teacher passing away... you must be glad, is it?"
Of course not
You've found me
At least you've got a place to settle down
Stay here first
You may have riches and glory coming to you
"Brother, when teacher was dying... he had a few words for you"
What did he say?
Teacher said that he mistook you as his student
He never guessed that you'd later take to crime
That's why he asked me... to watch over you after he died
And not allow you to consort with gangsters... going around stealing things
Teacher must be confused
When I was here just now you were talking with your friend
How come he hid himself... as soon as he knew that someone was here?
He must be a bad guy
Let me have a look and stop him from coming again
Nonsense
"Little Bat, I suppose your kungfu is as good as mine"
Even better
We are like brothers.
Does it matter... whose kungfu is better?
Of course it does
If yours is better than mine... how can I manage you?
You haven't changed since you were small
Who's he?
"Oh, him"
This is the one who will bring us... riches and glory as I said before
"Master Yian, someone wants to see you"
"He's sneaky, can't be a good guy"
"Go away, you are not welcome in here"
"Yeah, Addison wasn't the only person that Holm was spying on."
"Looks like he put spyware onto over 1,000 machines."
He was targeting other victims.
"Exactly, and it looks like he may have selected one."
"He's got a folder with this guy's name on it, Jason Putnam."
"Whoa, that's a lot of data."
Over a terabyte.
"E-mails, financials, recorded phone calls, he even has video and screen caps from a bunch of hijacked camera feeds."
Who is Jason Putnam?
"My name is Jason Putnam, and I have something to confess."
"Over the past year, while working as a private financial advisor,"
"I embezzled over $800,000."
Mostly from elderly clients whom I believed were less likely to detect the fraud.
JERRY:
Jason Putnam posted this video to his profile three days ago and it immediately went viral.
"Uh-huh, so this guy's robbing old folks for their live savings."
I imagine the Internet was not too kind.
It was brutal.
He was publically eviscerated.
"But since then, no one has seen or heard from him."
His family contacted HPD 'cause they were concerned about his mental state.
"He's currently classified as an ""Endangered Missing Adult."""
"Okay, but clearly Putnam didn't go missing on his own."
"I mean, Holm kidnapped him and forced this confession."
TOAST:
"Guys, check this out."
Found these on Holm's server.
They're camera feeds and they're live.
"All right, can we trace where they're coming from?"
"Yeah, sure, but there's 17 of them, and they're coming from all over the island."
"From what I can tell, it's mostly abandoned buildings and vacant homes."
"Well, obviously he was staking these places out."
"I thought maybe if I can double it, maybe triple it..."
Behind a pizza place.
"Well, small outfit like that, man,"
I couldn't believe I lost it all.
"I couldn't ask you for more, so they made me a deal."
"Bring some fresh meat to the table, and I can get you your money back."
Why?
"Michael, why?"
You were doing so good.
"I tried to make it right, Leon."
On my own two feet.
But watching that poor kid lose his last dime...
I couldn't take it.
I got out of there.
And he came after you.
"Yeah, he blamed me for, uh, bringing him into the game."
"the muck of machinery, but, no."
"Basically, the personality of the TARDIS got transferred into a kind of hot, scruffy,"
Helena-Bonham-Carter- type woman.
I'm alive.
"I was very happy when the TARDIS turned out to have such an elegant, demure voice and personality, you know, how the TARDIS, you know, sounded like a London taxi driver --"
"""I'm not going to metebelis, no, and I'm not going there at that time."""
He really realized how alive the TARDIS is.
"Because he always goes like ""she's alive,"""
"but when you see a person be alive, it's easier to understand, than, like, a telephone booth with infinite rooms."
You never read the instructions.
I always read the instructions!
There's a sign on my front door.
You have been walking past it for 700 years -- what does it say?
That's not instructions!
"The relationship between the Doctor and Idris, who was the TARDIS, is kind of interesting because it is a love story, but it goes past anything sort of physical, it's a love story that is like just"
they're bonded throughout time.
aren't you married?
then why do you...with him?
does your husband realize...?
you're a good girl but I wanna hurt you
I'm not giving him away yet.
I'm not gonna give you Ogiwara

"Imaoka-san, you don't like her?"
"it's a lie that girls are weak beings that get eaten by wolves when a woman passes 20, they set up traps to be eaten traps?"
when should we do it next time?
it'll be hard to do it till morning like last time so let's do it on weekends come here come here
I...actually that night don't remember anything of course...you were drunk drunk?
drunk and you sang and danced to dango 3 brothers at a karaoke place oh really?
I was singing dango good that's not good what about me?
make it clear what?
Are you getting the guns out of school?
That's the only question that's important here.
"We're going to open this up for your comments in just one moment, please--"
My daughter has been in tears for thirty-six hours.
We are not going to live with this kind of terror in our schools.
Friends.
One moment please.
We're going to get nowhere fast if each and every one of us speaks out of turn.
"Now, as I was saying to your point Madam, Ms. Krzy zanowski here..."
is going to provide special counseling...
for any student who has a problem coping with the incident.
That is good.
Put the kids in therapy so they can adjust to being shot.
We can hear what everybody has to say if we could just...
- say it one at a time.
"- Excuse me, M r."
"Principle, could l-- lt would help if you would say your name and the name of your child."
My name is Amber Vallone and I have a daughter Rayanne Graff who I leave...
"in your capable hands everyday, and what I'd like to know is..."
"while you're bringing in counselors, and being all upset..."
should I just send my daughter to school in a bullet prove vest...
every day or are you actually going to do something...
about the guns in our school.
It's not the lack of economic opportunity or the poor home life...
or the lack of values.
But the guns.
You know the things that shoot.
Are you going to get that gun out of our school?
"Yes, I would like to see it happen."
"Hey, you know, I really liked what you said in there."
- Oh God.
- l wish I could do that.
They'll show us the way that the artist have had traveled.
MATERNITY

FATE
HEAD WITH THE ARM
"Artist's imagination, full of faces, seeks the release."
"Series of portraits is being made: ""Wawel's heads""."
It's a tribute to great traditions of Polish renaissance.
Tribute from a modern artist.
Years passed by bringing new works of art.
"""Four Evangelists"" Writing down events and thoughts patiently and laboriously like folk chroniclers."
Artist's imagination is inexhaustible.
Dunikowski keeps searching for new ideas.
Some of them are surprising.
"""I walk in the sun"" - it's the name of the self-portrait of the one whose hands arouse human life and feelings from the stones."
PREGNANT WOMEN
CARTHAGINIAN WOMEN
There aren't many sculptors who are as skilled in making monuments as Dunikowski.
After the war the artist made monumental works like:
"""A monument of gratitude for Red Army"" in Olsztyn"
"""A monument of uprising action"" at the St. Anna's Mountain."
"Raw shapes, full of peace and dignity, embrace eternal glory of the heroes."
"We greatly appreciate your works of art, our tireless artist!"
Many stones are still waiting for you to bring to life beauty hidden inside them.
...always cheerful...
...to the cheerfulness..
Happy New Year!
"Well, what gives, little lady?"
"Always cheerful, always cheerful..."
To the cheerfulness...
Happy New Year.

Inspector Frost feels he's being treated properly.
I expect your investigation to be conducted by the book.
"And you can rest assured,"
I know that book very well indeed.
"In the middle of a current murder investigation,."
you spent four hours yesterday
looking for files on Harriet Barr and Michael King.
A case that was wound up ten years ago.
"Yes, well, when I've got something on my mind,"
I deal with it.
Harriet Barr's death was on my mind.
"So having found the files, you then went to see ex-Chief Superintendent Fairclough."
"Yes, because I found a statement that contradicted evidence from a main witnesses against Michael King."
Do you know why this piece of evidence didn't reach the courtroom?
No.
"Well, you say it wasn't in the file that went to the DPP, but in another file, where it had apparently sat, quite undisturbed, for nearly ten years."
Yes.
"But, when I entered your office"
Steven Mitchell's statement was on your desk.
"As I told you, I found it in an envelope that was hidden in the back of the file."
I spoke to Mitchell this morning.
"Yes, I'd have done the same thing myself."
At Chief Superintendent Fairclough's suggestion?
What?
Mr. Mitchell remembers all this very well.
He remembers coming forward to make his statement.
He also remembers being told he wouldn't be required to give evidence.
"When he queried this, he was told to forget he saw Michael King on the night of Harriet Barr's murder."
Unless he wanted to go down for a couple of years too.
And who told him that?
Inspector Pearson.
"Oh Come on, there's a bandwagon rolling here, isn't there."
"We're going to pray at the shrine You should come, Soza san"
"No, Shinnosuke"
He's a busy man
Mother
Good day
Good day
What did you pray for?
That I may find my enemy soon
Mother?
That you may stay a sweet-natured boy
And you?
That Father will return safely
How can one god answer so many prayers?
"Come here, come here and buy"
"Take a look at these toys, very popular!"
I've got every kind
"We go this-a-way, we go that-a-way"
My husband died of a lung disease when our boy was only two
Today is his monthly anniversary
I see...
Time keeps passing by and I haven't yet told him the truth
What does that say?
No tabs
What's a tab?
A tab?
A tab means...
You want to eat now but pay later
Sada san's always asking for that
"Actually, he never, ever pays his tabs, so we call someone like him ""a deadbeat"""
"How do you write ""run out on debts?"""
"""Deadbeat?"""
The way you write it...
Derrick Phelps is taking a break.
It caught a lot of people's attention because it was the national championship game.
"But, in fact, that would've been a departure from what we had done all year long."
Kicked out to montross.
That was lynch.
They got the break.
Carolina can take the lead.
"Smith's calculated risk worked, and his well-rested team took a 2-point lead with 20 seconds to play."
Took a 2-point lead with 20 seconds to play.
The referee missed it.
Webber brings it into the front court.
There are no time outs remaining.
Too many time outs.
That's a technical foul.
"He called a timeout, and Michigan doesn't have any."
...north Carolina is the 1993 national champion.
"On the same superdome court where Smith won his first and only title 11 years earlier, where Smith won his first and only title 11 years earlier, once again, it was an opponent's mistake that defined the final play."
But luck really had little to do with it.
"Every situation that happened to us that year, he prepared us for."
There was not one thing that we didn't cover.
"Donald Williams called a timeout in practice, and he put us on the end line and made us run for Donald Williams calling a timeout."
...on defense that you might learn something from.
...on defense that you might learn something from.
Get him!
Get him!
"No one, not even the coaching staff --"
"Bill guthridge, Phil Ford --"
Would stand up on that bench and call a timeout without coach Smith giving them the go-ahead.
"So, for our season to end like it did with Michigan, you know, we can look back and say,"
"""I remember that day in November Donald called a timeout."""
It's an unusual friendship.
"I know people would not think that we became really good friends, but we did."
I just want to say   that next week I turn 32.
And so... ?
I can't go on like this.
- I'll be graduating.
- It's about time.
Then I'll get a job.
"Actually, I wanted to tell you,   that next week   I'm getting married."
What can I say?
Buy me a nice gift.
Benito's getting married?
To whom?
I don't know.
"Beloved,   you come to the house of the Lord   so that your love can be sanctified by God,   by the Minister of the Church and the Community."
"Christ blesses this love and commands you to be faithful to each other,   bearing together the responsibilities of marriage,   you are enriched with the Sacrament,   having been consecrated through baptism."
I now ask your intentions before the members of the Church.
"Italia and Benito,   have you come here to join in marriage without coercion,   but freely and conscously aware of the step you are about to take?"
Are you willing to love and honor your...
Why do I have to attend this absurd ceremony?
"Because he's your student, ..."
- ... and she's the former nurse of your boss.
- He's a jerk and she's useless!
The last time I saw Ciotti he suggested I take   a trivial position with the public health service.
"If it is your solemn intention to enter the sacred bond of marriage,   join hands and express such to God and the Church..."
- Yes?
- You have some shitty friends.
"They didn't want to be witnesses, and they haven't even deigned to come to your wedding."
... to each other for life in Sacred Marriage?
Ah... yes!
"- Have you come here, or not?"
- What?
"To join in marriage without coercion,   but freely and conscously aware of the step you are about to take?"
Are you willing to love and honor each other for the rest of your lives in Holy Matrimony?
Of course.
There needs to be doctors who appear on TV.
I'll get going first.
The entire area of medicube is under FPCON (Force Protection Condition) BRAVO.
FPCON (Force Protection Condition)
What's going on?
Is there a war going on somewhere?
"If so, I'm going to treat the enemy forces, too, since I took the Hippocratic Oath."
The entire medical team is commanded to gather.
Is the area of interest Medi Cube's field hospital?
A VIP patient is being transferred to Medi Cube.
How much time do we have?
"It's President Mubarat of the Arab league, who was returning from his unofficial visit to North Urk to establish agreement on a Middle Eastern peace treaty."
"As a royalty of Abu Dhabi who is third in line for succession, he has been involved in solving disputes and reaching peaceful agreements between political groups and border control."
He is known to be a key player in these matters.
"He's a strong candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the Middle Eastern peace treaty, but to his opposition, he's their number one target for assassination."
Get the car ready.
I'm headed to the Blue House.
These are the medical records sent by the VIP patient's doctor.
Okay.
What is this?
"If everything is censored, what exactly do they want us to read in order to diagnose?"
"In VIP patients' charts, there are more lies than truth anyway."
"You mean, they record false information on their patients' charts?"
What kind of crazy doctors would do that?
Doctors like me.
"Similar to how poor patients need doctors like Schweitzer,"
"VIPs need special doctors, too."
"To VIPs, their medical history can be their weakness."
That's why a president's health status is a national secret.
- What's the situation?
- Nothing special.
"No, I can't recall anything."
"Now, Mr. Maigret, what time was it when you told Axel Norstaad that you had just seen Miss Edie Morrow outside a motel called the Windmill Inn?"
"Axel stormed up to my house about 9:00, I'd say."
Maybe a few minutes later.
"And when he left your house, did he go in the direction of the motel?"
"Yes, sir."
"He-- well, he left my place running."
Running?
"Tell me this, how far is your place from the Windmill Inn?"
"It's about three blocks, that's all."
"Well, Axel came roaring into my barroom at the motel."
"When he got his breath back, he says he's looking for this Edie Morrow."
Says he's going to find her if he has to tear the place apart.
"Well, I finally got it across to him that she'd walked out some time before with a man named Somers."
What did the defendant say then?
He demanded to know where they'd gone.
All I could tell him was that Somers was staying at the motel.
So Axel rushed off again.
"Now, we've heard the testimony of the autopsy surgeon to the effect that Martin Somers met his death sometime between 9 and 9:30."
What time was it that the defendant rushed out of your barroom?
"Mm, 9:10, 9:15 maybe."
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
No questions.
"Miss Pedersen, you were employed by the defendant as his confidential secretary?"

"Now, referring you to the morning after the homicidal death of Mr. Somers."
"On that morning, when you arrived at the Norstaad office, the defendant already there, and you saw him lighting something in the stove, is that correct?"
The stove?
The old-fashioned pot-bellied stove in which wood scraps were burned to keep the office warm in the winter.

You're really talking to the man who took her.
"Well, how do we know he'll be watching?"
My team's coordinating with local media to get the word out.
He'll be watching.
"And if I do this, then he'll let Josie go?"
"There's a chance, yes."
"Word just in from a local hospital that Ellie Zumwalt, recovering from injuries suffered in the latest attack on local families, is going to speak to the public within an hour."
"We don't know what this unexpected statement will be, but concern is rising for the hours passed with no word on her abducted daughter."
"Come on, Penelope, think."
Patrick Sorenson didn't just vanish into thin air.
There's gotta be some way that he...
"Oh, yes, there might be some Thomas Alva Edison in me yet."
"What do you got, Garcia?"
"What I have got is Betty Cordray of Wichita, Kansas, which I know makes no sense, but actually, Betty Cordray is not Betty Cordray, she's Betty Sorenson of long-lost fame."
The mother who abandoned Patrick.
None other.
Is she still in the area?
No.
"She died 6 weeks ago of kidney failure, and then when the paperwork started, you know, the paperwork that happens when you die, her real identity was revealed and Patrick was called as her next of kin."
That must have been the trigger.
That's when he dropped off the map in New York.
"Yeah, and if he was holding out hope for answers from that mother one day, that hope was suddenly gone."
"Garcia, did Betty Sorenson own any property in the Wichita area?"
"Nope, she lived in a studio apartment."
"Then after she died, was she buried or cremated?"
Uh...
Neither.
"She was held in the morgue, Patrick was called to identify her body, but he never showed up."
I guess she's still there?
"All right, I'll check it out."
We're recording.
This is a message for my child.
"Good boy, good night."

Let me see.
Is not the leaf turned down where I left reading?
"Here it is, I think."
How ill this taper burns!
Ha!
Who comes here?
I think it is the weakness in my eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me.
Art thou any thing?
"Art thou some god, some angel... or some devil, that mak'st my blood cold and my hair to stare?"
- Speak to me what thou art.
"- Thy evil spirit, Brutus."
- Why com'st thou?
- Thou shalt see me at Philippi.
Well; then I shall see thee again?
"Ay, at Philippi."
"Why, I will see thee at Philippi then."
"Now I have made my heart strong, thou vanishest..."
"I'll spirit, I would hold more words with thee."
Julius Caesar is a play about Roman history... just as the English history plays are about the history of England.
"But of course, the play ends as some of the English history plays do... in multiple deaths."
To that extent it is a tragic play.
"It isn't a single tragedy... it isn't a one man tragedy as one might say Macbeth is, or King Lear is... or Hamlet, but nevertheless... if one had to choose a single figure of the play as a tragic hero... it certainly wouldn't be Caesar."
Caesar is... the center of the play up until the end of Act III... but the figure whose story runs through the play... and whose death is the real emotional climax of the play is Brutus.
"So if this is a tragedy, it is not tragedy of Julius Caesar... it is of Marcus Brutus."
O conspiracy... seeks thou to hide thy dangers brow by night when the evils are most free.

"For The Belle of New York, the studio decided to reshoot this scene because Fred's costume didn't suit his famous dapper style."
So by putting the original and the reshot versions together it gives us a rare opportunity to see just how perfectly rehearsed Fred really was.

This is the music that I like!
Over the Danube Russians repelled by the Turks.
It even smells of man - the essence of burnt clutch.
Splash it on all over before going out for a curry and a fight.
The Mitsubishi is much more technical.
It's got an Active Centre Differential which moves the power to the front or the back wheels depending on which has more grip.
"I just have to tell it whether I'm on Tarmac, gravel or snow."
Then it's got a Super Active Yaw Control which moves the power from side to side.
"Sometimes then, in a big corner, when you're really hammering, this car is one-wheel drive."
So I can sum them up like this.
The Mitsubishi is like an F16 fighter -
light and highly manoeuvrable.
The Subaru is more like an F15.
A fighter bomber.
"As far as power is concerned, both of them get close to 150mph and both do 0-60 in under five seconds."
You can't split them on looks either.
Inside both have wilfully flimsy interiors that are lifted only by the big seats and the buttons for spraying cold water on the intercoolers.
On the outside the Subaru tries to lighten up with its jewellery but both cars really are shamelessly aggressive.
Look at the scoop on this bonnet.
And the Evo's got so many steroids it's growing out of its own body.
These cars should be called the Mitsubishi Did You Spill My Pint?
"and the Subaru You, Outside Now!"
Trying to decide which is best is hard.
"They're both spoon-bendingly, hallucinogenically, law-breakingly mad and absurd."
On a wide open road like this the nimbler Mitsubishi wins.
"But when things get narrow and bumpy, the Evo turns into a jet."
On a difficult road like this the Impreza feels more planted.
"So, which would I buy?"
"Ooh, I can't give you an answer now."
I'm having far too much fun.
So what did you discover after your overly long trip to Scotland?
Nothing.
It's impossible to choose.
There's no tangible reason why you'd take one car over the other.

"In America, that figure is closer to 90."
"Mr.Churchill is persuaded that film, in particular your film, presents us with a unique opportunity to put our case to the American people."
They fear that we are already beaten.
You show that we fight on.
They believe this country to be dominated by an upper class elite.
You present a vision of Britain...
in which ordinary working people are the heroes.
"But most crucially of all, your film, concerns itself directly with the feminine experience."
To show your American sisters that this is a war their sons and husbands and others should be fighting.
"Of course we want America to listen, give them someone to listen to."

You want us to put an American in it!

Exactly so!

"Chief, is it so bad to be ruled by the Japanese?"
At least we're leading a civilized life
We have schools and post offices and we don't have to survive by hunting savagely anymore
Is it so bad to be ruled by the Japanese?
Is it so good to be ruled by them?
Our men are forced to bend over to carry logs on our backs and our women have to kneel down to serve and pour wine
And all the money ends up in the pockets of the Japanese policemen
I'm a chief but all I can do is get drunk and pretend I see nothing and hear nothing
What else can I do?

"And he drew a picture of our planet on a chalkboard, and then he drew the atmosphere around it, and he said, this is the most important issue of our time."
I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about.

"And he does that for the most part, but sometimes he forgets."
And I have wood floors and a big rug in the living room.
"And we were about to leave the house, and he goes, ""Babe, I have my shoes on, but don't worry;"
"I'm standing on the rug."""
"And I was like, what logic are we working with?"
"When he saw the wood floors, did he see lava?"
"And I explained to him, like, ""No, babe."
"""I don't want people to bring their shoes into my home"
"""because I don't want them to track dirt in."
"That gives me more to clean up."""
And he looked at me like I was explaining new math.
Just never occurred to him.
"And I also can't tell if I'm fixing him for me or for his next girlfriend, because if we break up and he starts dating somebody else, he's gonna take his shoes off at the door."
"And she's gonna be like, ""He's so clean."
"He's so conscientious."""
"No, bitch, that was me."
I did that.
"If you feel like you're currently dating Mr. Perfect and he does everything right, you should thank all the exes who came before you for all the hard work they put in."
"Anything that you see a man do that's considerate, he's doing it because, at one point in time, he made a mistake, and then some woman yelled at him."
"And if you're not laughing, it's because you're currently being yelled at."

So my mom's request for a person got broader and broader as the years went by.

"And she goes, ""I want you to bring home a man."""
"And then years went by, and she goes,"

"And at that point, two of my colleagues and myself realized that only architecture would be my life."

"Here at the University of Pennsylvania, one of the world's great architects,"
"Professor Louis Kahn, teaches and creates."
"This is his Richards Medical Research Building, called by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City probably the single most consequential building constructed in the United States since World War II."
"It is principled, vigorous, fundamental, and exhilarating."
This building is Kahn's greatest achievement.
"People come by all the time with their cameras taking pictures of this awesome architectural wonder, and we just sit upstairs in the window and laugh at them, because it's not a good place to work."
"I don't feel comfortable in my room, in my lab."

"It needs face, something different..."
Maybe paint the pillars a different color than the building or something.

"It's called ""About a Boy"", but I suppose there are probably two boys, really."
The original idea was I thought of this guy who  invents a child so that he can meet single mothers.
"He invents a child, and goes to a single-parent group."
That was the initial germ of the idea.
I have a 2-year-old.
Ned.
He's a very good little boy.
Very brave.

"The source of the film is a book called About a Boy by Nick Hornby, which came out in England about seven years ago."
"It was a huge hit there, and did very well here."
"Nick Hornby also wrote ""High Fidelity"" and, most recently, ""How to be Good""."
"He kind of addresses man's fate  especially a 30-something man's fate, in the modern world."
I've always loved Nick Hornby.
"He gets London life so right  and is so funny about it, particularly male, bachelor, single London life  which I know extremely well."
"So, I thought, ""This is right up my alley."" On top of that it's actually quite moving, and I've never done moving before."
"Alone, bad."
"Friend, good."
I suppose the kind of comedy that I'm drawn to  I don't want it to be purely farcical.
"I want it rooted in something, and I think after ""High Fidelity"" I wanted to try and push that a little bit harder."
The idea that you could write a comedy  about or which includes people who are having a hard time.
"When we first read the book, a lot of the themes felt like  they were from a classic comedy."
A lot of stuff we kept in.
"The last third of the movie is an invention of ours  that we worked out, and then worked on with Hugh Grant  our real partner in terms of someone to bounce our writing off and to get ideas for writing from."

"Yeah, he's very special."
"Very, very special."
Sometimes I think he's the one taking care of me.
The biggest loser in the reshuffle is real-life Countess Griaznov.
her title has secured her the grandest room in the house.
"Well, I think maybe we should keep our own chamber pot."
"I'll carry that then, shall I?"
"I mean, I'm not happy, because my room is beautiful, and it's one of the big joys of being here is waking up in it every morning."
Just... it is gorgeous.
"Um, but, yeah..."
"The new guest is a potential rival for the heart of Mr. Gorell Barnes, a gentleman whom the countess rightly regards as her natural partner."
I get on very well with Mr. Gorell Barnes.
"Feel like we're head girl and head boy in a strange sort of way, and Mrs. Rogers is headmistress."
"And to cap it all, Miss Samuel's lovebirds have no respect for the countess's rank."
"And my new room is just above the new, evil, screechy birds."
I wasn't feeling particularly well disposed to her
My philosophy on the birds is it's cruel to keep them caged;
we should just eat them instead...
on toast.
"Of all the chaperones,"
Mrs. Enright has the most cause to feel threatened by the new girl.
"Her charge, Miss Conick, is at the bottom of the pile."
Now her prospects of marriage seem remoter than ever.
She was a bit upset when she heard that there's another girl arriving.
"I said, ""Why are you upset?"""
"""Well,"" she said, ""I don't quite know why."""
"""Why is that?"" ""I don't know, dear."
"I'm honestly just upset for you."""
"And I went, ""I'm not upset."""
"Intelligent, beautiful, and wealthy... right up my street."
The master comes to inspect the room the chaperones have arranged for Miss Samuel.
He is not impressed.
"I think it's pretty horrible, and I think it would be unfair if she was put in here, so my suggestion is to change... which I'm going to obviously run by with Mrs. Rogers, but it's to change Mrs. Rogers' boudoir into her bedroom,"
"and then I think, the countess will go back to her room,"
"Miss Hopkins will have her room again, and Miss Francesca will be back here."
'There's a lot of interest in Bobby's execution 'all over the state.'

"It's kind of crazy that the Supreme Court hasn't ruled yet, though."
You could say that it means they're actually looking at it.
"But for all we know, they're just, you know, dragging out time and then it will just be harder for him and his family."
Did somebody walk across the street?
We'll know what's going to happen when we see the people walk from this building into that building.
They go up the stairs there.
"All right, bye."

That's my mom!
"Oh, my God."
It's from Ray.
"""As I post this, Robert Garza is being executed."""
"I'm here outside the Walls Unit in downtown Huntsville, where at 8.41pm tonight, Robert Garza was pronounced dead after having received a lethal injection."
"Approximately ten minutes goes by in stunned silence inside that room while I and the other members of the media are just feet away from the members of Garza's family, who are racked with emotion and anguish as they watch him slip away."
"Again, at 8.41pm tonight,"
Robert Garza was pronounced dead by lethal injection.
"In Huntsville, Kirk Chaisson, Channel 5 News at 10."
All right?
"You would think that with time, it would get easier to deal with it, or at least you'd learn to deal with it, but it actually gets worse."
I think it does get worse.
"Joy, relief, a little bit of apprehension about what comes next."
"Be proud of your hard work, your sacrifices."
Be proud of the decision you made to go to law school.
"It made him seem, at last, like a possible leader, not just of an army, but of the country itself."
"The very next day, the Kirk Session and the town council fled from Edinburgh."
The Rule of the Saints was over.
"The young King Charles fled to France, and the English Parliament declared the birth of a new country."
"The Great Britain of the Stuarts, the Union of the Crowns, was gone, replaced by the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland."
"Behind the pleasant title was a brutal union of conquest, secured by pillage, massacre, and the presence in Scotland of an English army of occupation, 10,000 strong."
"In 1653, Cromwell became something called Lord Protector."
"Not a king, but still addressed as ""Your Highness"" by those who served him."
"Behind his back, people called him a tyrant and usurper."
"For four years, Warriston held himself aloof from the new regime."
"But in the end, his ambition required him to collaborate."
He just couldn't bear being unimportant.
"In 1657, Cromwell made him the Lord Clerk Register, chief record keeper of the Scottish Government, and gave him a position on the English Council of State."
It was a dream of power.
And a nightmare of betrayal.
"just what was Warriston loyal to now, apart from himself?"
It was hard to say.
"The Covenant hung over his head as much as anybody's, but there was no king."
There was someone who looked and behaved increasingly like one.
But that was Cromwell.
"He began to look like a king reflected in a wicked mirror - ugly, ill-favoured, a tyrant with a bloodstained chin."
"Warriston kept on with his daily regime of prayer, manufacturing certainty as best he could."
Then Cromwell died.
His unreal regime died with him.
Now the Commonwealth was headless.
But there was a head available.
It belonged to Charles II.
"On May 8th 1660, the English Parliament proclaimed Charles II King of England."
The Scottish Parliament did likewise one week later.
"There were scenes of wild celebration in Edinburgh - toasts drunk, glasses shattered, cannons fired."
The joy was hysterical.
11 years of guilt unleashed.
So James was left as a captive with plenty of time to brood on his redundancy.
"For a time,"
James had been shunted from one miserable prison to another.
But then his royal privileges were restored and he was given free run of Henry V's court.
You can imagine how grateful James was for this outbreak of benevolence.
But Henry's motives weren't exactly pure.
"He had a war to finish in France and he needed a new ally to fight an old enemy, because across the Channel it wasn't just the French that Henry was up against, it was the Scots."
(BAGPIPES PLAY)
The role the Scots played in the Hundred Years' War was something the French would never forget.
In this summer pageant in the middle of France the crowds are celebrating the arrival of Scottish troops at a life or death moment in the history of their country.
Henry V had just defeated the French at Agincourt.
"Final, decisive victory was within his grasp."
And then the Scots waded in on behalf of their old ally.
Now the Scots and French forces were united against the English king.
To defeat them he had first to divide them and Henry thought he had the perfect weapon
-James.
Now Henry's plans for him became clear.
"James was King of the Scots, so James could tell the Scots to pack up and go home."
Melun was the acid test.
"In 1420, Henry lay siege to the strategic town just upriver from Paris."
The walls were defended by Scottish troops.
James knew what was expected of him.
He ordered the Scots to surrender.
English and French kings expected unquestioning obedience from their subjects.
But these soldiers were Scots.
"And in Scotland, king and kingdom didn't mean the same thing at all."
Scotland was more than one individual.
"It was a community, a loose but resilient network of loyalties."
"""Lay down your arms,"" James commanded his subjects."
"And as one, the Scots kept on fighting."
"700 defenders held out against a 20,000-strong besieging force."
"These days, the underground vaults beneath the town are used to store wine."
And when I got to Niger
"I found a job doing a survey of a park which paid me $8,000."
So I've been able to find jobs for the plane on the way.
"Besides working the plane as he goes,"
Claytor's writing a book about his experience in the far corners of the world.
"So far, he's logged 46,000miles three continents and 28 countries."
"On December 2, 1990 he left Pennsylvania heading north through"
Canada to Greenland and then Iceland.
"In the summer of '91, he arrived in Europe."
And early in '92 he began travelling through Africa.
The longest leg of Claytor's journey so far has been on the Africa continent.
His video journal is testimony to a rare and spontaneous adventure.
We're now in market which is the largest market in West Africa
We're now in... and Mr. has with him scorpions
And now he's going to show me that he can use his so that the scorpions don't bite you
we just did this once before
I hope it's successful again.
Okay...
It's starting to rain now.
Now in southwest Africa
Claytor has spent the last few weeks exploring the country of Namibia.
"Today, he plans to visit an area rich in African history a group of abandoned towns near the Namibian coast."
There's a town southwest of the Namib Desert called Kolmanskop and this town was founded because a railway worker working on the rail line found a very pretty stone.
And this lead to a diamond rush which caused this town to spring out of the desert
and then as quickly as it started it disappeared.
Kolmanskop was followed by other boomtowns a sudden cluster of Diamond settlements that sprang up in the lifeless desert.
"At the turn of the century,"
"Diamonds were so plentiful here, they say you could collect a jarful a night by just picking up whatever glistened in the moonlight."
In the saloons you could buy your whiskey and your woman with raw diamonds.
May 10th.
"It's a ghost town, almost like the American west."
Casinos.
"Don't worry, Lutie, i'ii keep on writing to you."
i know you've turned to me only because Doc Reid is gone and that you want nothing from me but news of your children.
"in this letter, i am sending you a likeness of Sarah Beth and Brock."
i obtained it by devious methods from the local photographer.
"You asked about Brewton, Lutie."
i know very little about him.
He seldom comes to town except to do some buying for the ranch now and then.
it would break your heart to ride through this country.
it's all drying up and blowing away.
"Brewton was right about one thing, this land was not ready for plow."
it needed help from us.
"During those first years, when the rains came we should've been at work planning against the time when nature would fall us."
"We should've built dams, brought our own rain and irrigation ditches and culverts and diverted streams."
"Someday, we will do these things and the land will come back."
The hope of seeing that keeps me here.
And something else holds me too.
"Brock is growing up, Lutie, and the way it's happening worries me."
"When Sarah Beth was home, she used to look out for him."
But now that she's away at school Brewton makes no move to curb Brock in anything.
it's almost as though he were trying to make up to him for someone else.
"You, Lutie."
"Whatever it is, it's bad for Brock and i don't like it."
"And i'm forced to stand by, helpless to do anything and watch the wildness in the boy grow stronger."
Everyone likes him.
Maybe that's the trouble.
He's right at home every place.
"Whether he's joshing the girls at Ciancy's Dance Haii or playing ""The Blue Danube"" on Myra Netherwood's new grand piano he's a prime favorite."
And he's a walking contradiction too.
"One day he'ii be dealing whist and euchre from the best horsehair furniture the next, he'ii be prancing up and down the street in his new buggy with a homesteader girl beside him."
BRlCE:
You may see him buying out a showcase of jawbreakers at the Kingman Mercantiie Company for a bunch of runny-nosed kids gentle as a woman.
Or keeping a tomato can rolling at 50 feet with a six-shooter.
"The next day, we explored the landscapes that surround the airport."
[Airplane engines roaring]
NARRATOR:
"By nightfall, we'd reached Cranford on the Great West Road."
We spent the evening in a large tandoori restaurant... writing up our notes... and stayed the night in a hotel just across the road.
[Airplane engines roaring]
The next day was hot and we spent it in the atrium of the air-conditioned Hilton.
"In the late afternoon, we came out and walked along... the road next to the runway... until we came to Hatton Cross where we took the Underground home."
[Airplane engines roaring]
NARRATOR:
"The next day, we came back again."
[Birds chirping]
NARRATOR:
"It was November 4, the night of the first Maastricht vote... and the government faced possible defeat for the second time in two weeks... but they held on again with a majority of three."
We watched the interviews:
First with an obscure MP from Norfolk who changed his mind at the last minute... and then with one from Staffordshire who hadn't.
But we could make no sense of either of them.
Robinson began to talk as he often did of leaving the country... but as always he had no idea where to go.
Life is a hospital where every patient... is obsessed by the desire of changing beds.
One would like to supper opposite the stove... another is sure he'd get well beside the window.
It always seems to me that I should be happy anywhere but where I am.
And this question of moving... is one that I'm eternally discussing with my soul.
It was Guy Fawkes Night.
And we went to the bonfire in Kennington Park.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music continues]
NARRATOR:
"On November 11, we boarded a Number 11 bus... and travelled east towards the City."
Robinson told me that his work was nearly over.
He argued that the failure of London was rooted in the English fear of cities.
A Protestant fear of potpourri and socialism.
The fear of Europe... that had disenfranchised Londoners and undermined their society.
I've been here nearly three weeks:
We'd better get you aboard the Searcher:
We can't do anything for you down here:
Let's take him to my starfighter:
"I'll take him upstairs, and that way, you two can finish the survey:"
Okay:
Thank you very much:
It's very kind of you:
I'd about given up hope:
"All you all right, Mr:"
Reardon?
"Fine, thanks:"
"Let's take a look at those ruins while we still got some light left, all right?"
[Hawk] The ship:
[Buck] It's gone:
Vanished:
Perhaps we have mistakenly come to another clearing:
"No, this is the right clearing, all right:"
There's no doubt about that:
"Everything is gone... the ship, the shelter, the campfire, everything:"
Vanished:
"[Man Narrating] In the year 1987,"
NASA launched the last of America's deep space probes:
"Aboard this compact starship, a lone astronaut, Captain William ""Buck'""Rogers, was to experience cosmic forces beyond all comprehension:"
"In a freak mishap, his life-support systems were frozen: : :"
By temperatures beyond imagination:
Ranger 3 was blown out of its planned trajectory: : :
"Into an orbit 1,000 times more vast, an orbit which was to return Buck Rogers to Earth: : :"
500 years later:
What could possibly have caused Reardon's shuttle to disappear?
I don't know:
Maybe we'll find out further on:
"""We, Anne, you and I, are going to show them the way."
"""All my love, Lou."""
Do you think this building was very important for Lou?
"Well, he says so himself, you know, that the world discovered him when he built the Richards building, but he had discovered himself when he built that little concrete-block bathhouse in Trenton."
"So that... that says it, I think, right there how significant he felt it was."
Do you think about him a lot now?
"Well, he's kind of there, you know?"
Don't need to think about him.
- Part of you?
"- Well, he's there."
"He's there in you, he's in Alex, you know..."
He's in his buildings.
And...
"And I think the ideas that you work on together connect you always somehow, you know?"
Lou split up with Anne when Alex was about three and then got involved with my mother a few years later in 1959.
"In spite of everything,"
"Anne has always felt that we're all connected and that we are, in some strange way, a family."
I wonder if Lou thought of it that way.
Or was each relationship an entirely new beginning?
"The question is often asked, ""Why isn't Lou Kahn"
"""working directly in the work which the government is doing in the actual rebuilding of Philadelphia at this moment?"""
"I see it still as being the most useful plan, yes, and the most expressive."
It's the most expressive and the most useful.
"Uh, yes."
Expressive.
"I repeatedly made the effort to involve Lou directly in our work in Philadelphia, but it's turned out that the special quality of his genius could not be brought together with the reality of the problem."
I'd always heard that Ed Bacon was Lou's nemesis in Philadelphia.
"Bacon was in charge of rebuilding the entire downtown area in the '50s and '60s, and he hired Lou to come up with plans for how the job should be done."
But something had gone very wrong.
"We started work, and I wanted to communicate to the stupid public in the most acerbic fashion I possibly could the essence of the idea."
"And Lou would say,"
"""Wouldn't it be nice to put a curving stairway here?"
'He was also linked...'
Execution days are kind of rough.
"The atmosphere in the clinic gets really tense, because everyone's kind of waiting to see what will happen and just not really sure how the day's going to play out."
"Hoping for the best, expecting the worst and just bracing themselves for that."
Everyone kind of retreats into themselves to handle whatever needs to be handled appropriately.
"'In one hour, Texas prison officials will have the green light' to execute one of Texas' most notorious gang members."
The execution of Robert Garza is scheduled for some time after six tonight in Huntsville.
Kirk Chaisson joins us with the latest on the story.
Garza has filed a barrage of last-minute appeals over the last couple of days.
"They've all been rejected at the state level, but each appeal automatically gets kicked up to the US Supreme Court."
"If the Supreme Court decides they want to stay out of it,"
Garza's execution today moves forward.
Members of the Garza family join campaigners outside the death house as they wait for the Supreme Court's final ruling.
Prison officials tell us the death warrant for Robert Garza becomes valid at 6pm.
'His execution could come any time after that.'
"As the deadline approaches,"
Kelly gets a call from Robert Garza's wife.
"Hey, what news do you have?"
I can go and find Jeff.
INAUDIBLE REPLY
You want me to put you on the phone with him?
"OK, so tell me."
What's going on?
"'Hold on, I'll call you right back, OK?"
'
"OK, bye."
It's Jennifer.
She says they have really good news for Garza.
I don't know what's going on.
"It's a totally frustrating feeling, knowing that time is passing, knowing that the execution is impending, and to get a phone call from Bobby's wife, who doesn't want to talk to me and is trying to talk to other people"
"and won't tell me what's going on or why it's going on,"
"I just want to know what's happening because I want to help, and I can't help."
"Like the 5th Symphony, it presents itself with a feeling that you know it if you've heard it once."
And you look for it.
"Though you know it, you must hear it again."
"Though you know it, you must see it again."
"Truly, a work of art is one that tells us that nature cannot make what man can make."
Don't put him up on some gigantic pedestal up there.
He was in the trenches.
"The stories would come out of his office... it would be guys would have their wives in final moments of labor, and he wouldn't let them go home or take them to the hospital 'cause they were working on a project, you know?"
And he didn't know day from night.
"You know, and he had no kind of..."
"I mean, I think that most architects who are intensely involved in their practice have this problem, but I think he had a really big problem."
And I think he was very unhappy about not being selected
- for the John F. Kennedy library.
- Sure.
"I mean, you can just see Jackie going into I. M. Pei's office on Madison Avenue, or wherever it was in New York, and there would be flowers lining the corridor."
"And, you know, you'd go to Lou's office, and there'd be an old pastrami sandwich sitting on somebody's desk."
"I mean, don't think that he was always trying to be a prince."
He was very much trying to be a player.
He wanted work.
He wanted recognition.
He wanted...
Doesn't every architect want?
"I can't speak for every architect, no."
I don't know.
I think most architects who are... he was success oriented.
"At the time of his death,"
Lou was $1/2 million in debt.
Here he is chatting with some prospective clients as if he has all the time in the world.
"And in the meantime, he must know he's going bankrupt."
"The office lost money on every project, except the Salk Institute."
"And the list of jobs that fell through, and didn't get built, kept getting longer and longer:"
"the Dominican Sisters Convent, the U.S. Consulate in Luanda, Angola, the City Tower project, the Pocono Arts Center with seating for 9,000, the Fleischer House, the Morris House, the house for cheerful living,"
That would mean a change of mood
Didn't go with Mr. Monotony
Sometimes he would change the key
But the same dull melody
Would emerge from Mr. Monotony
Folks for miles would run away
Only one preferred to stay
She would come around and say
"""Have you got any monotony today?"""
"""Haven't got any monotony"
Today
Can't play
Today
Haven't got any monotony
"Today"""
It only happens when I dance with you
Another legend at Metro was my good friend Fred Astaire who always romanced a glamorous partner in his motion pictures.
"In Easter Parade, it was the one and only Ann Miller."
Seem quite so near
"Why does it happen, dear"
Only with you?
Two cheeks together can be so divine
But only when those cheeks
Are yours and mine
I've danced with dozens of others
The whole night through
But the thrill that comes with Spring
When anything could happen
That only happens with you
It was at a rehearsal hall like this that I spent my first days at MGM preparing for the production numbers in Easter Parade.
"Oh, and I was just scared stiff because I was going to dance with the master."
But Fred Astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on and he put me at ease right away.
"The road to Scotland's independence seemed very long, and it was blocked."
"Progress now depended on Edward II, who had no reason to make any concessions of any kind at all."
"For four long years, the Scots raided English territories in the north of England, Ireland too."
"Robert lost his last remaining brother, Edward Bruce, all in vain."
Edward took no notice.
He didn't need to.
"He couldn't beat the Bruce on a battlefield, so he'd changed the game."
He'd started playing by the rules that Scotland's bishops used.
He had gone to the Pope.
And the new Pope was desperate to restore papal prestige by sending all the major crowns of Europe on crusade.
Kings who caused petty national squabbles would not be tolerated.
"In 1 31 8, the Scots discovered that the English had convinced the Pope that the war between England and Scotland was Scotland's fault."
"Robert, his lieutenants and his bishops were all excommunicated."
"In addition, the Pope ordered that in every English church, three times a day, a ceremony was to be held at which the name of Bruce was cursed."
The news will have been bitter.
"As the curses rose from every English church, the Bruce came to St Andrew's Cathedral for its day of consecration."
"Almost 700 years ago, the Bruce stood here, along with his old mentor, William Lamberton, but without Wishart, who had died two years before."
He watched as these marks were made.
A generous annuity for the new cathedral was announced.
"He was pious, desperately so."
"The Bruce's spending on things like this - churches, chantries, monasteries and chapels - was increasing."
"Generous grants were made to institutions dedicated to St Andrew, St Fillan, St Thomas, St Ninian."
His people called him Good King Robert.
But Good King Robert wasn't so sure.
He wanted the saints to intercede on his behalf.
"Those English curses didn't seem quite empty, not at least to the man they were intended for."
The fate of the Scottish crown was back in the hands of the papacy.
"And the Scottish clergy, once again, was the Bruce's only hope."
"In April 1 320, a Scottish knight set off for the papal court."
He was a postman of sorts.
He carried with him three letters.
"All were written here, in Arbroath Abbey."
"it's far taxis, you should be running come on country side shut up oh hello sorry when you are busy"
Imaoka-san?

I understand it more now.
I was a little disappointed then.
I was a little disappointed then.
Even though I knew he knew it was me.
He felt like I didn't deserve to be on there because I hadn't played the game yet.
Coach?
"Well, that's something that he felt very passionate about is that you earn your right."
Jordan was missing from the cover of s.I.'S college basketball preview.
"But he was in the starting lineup, and with him, north Carolina won its first 13 games, rising to the ♪1 ranking in the country."
Rising to the ♪1 ranking in the country.
"My teammates gave me, you know, open shots and picking for me and giving me good passes."
"The heels finished the season at 27-2, won the acc tournament, and eventually found themselves in another final four, where James worthy put on a remarkable show against Houston in the national semifinal."
Coach Smith always gave you the green light --
Coach Smith always gave you the green light --
"If you saw it, take it."
"And I saw a Lane, and I took it."
It was a monster dunk that kind of set the tone.
I threw it down pretty good.
"I elevated, kept elevating, and twisted in the air."
"Even for me, that was pretty damn awesome."
The final against Georgetown and Smith's old friend John Thompson produced an epic battle.
"Three times before, Dean had been on the brink three times before, Dean had been on the brink of an ncaa title, and this time, despite a 28-point performance from worthy, he was still in danger of losing his fourth championship game."
32 seconds to go.
A 1-point lead for Georgetown.
"Coach says ""okay, we're exactly where we want to be."
"We're in great shape."""
"And, to be honest with you, I sort of."
"Coughed a little bit so I could turn my head 'cause I wanted to check the score, 'cause I wanted to check the score, to make sure I hadn't made a mistake."
But he said it two or three times --
"""we're going to decide who wins this game."""
"I looked at our guys, and everybody's got a little taller, and everybody's got a different look on their face, and as we're going out of the huddle, he patted Michael on the rear end and said,"
"""if you get a shot, Michael, knock it down."""
I can proudly say that some of my very best friends are ItaIian-Americans.
"However, Mr. Chairman, unfortunately I have to leave these proceedings in order to preside over a very important meeting of my own committee."
"Before I leave, I do want to say this, that these hearings on the Mafia are in no way whatsoever a slur upon the great italian people."
"I can state from my own knowledge and experience that ItaIian-Americans are among the most loyal, most Iaw-abiding, patriotic, hard-working American citizens in this land."
"It would be a shame, Mr. Chairman, if we allowed a few rotten apples to give a bad name to the whole barrel."
"Because from the time of Christopher columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi to the present day,"
ItaIian-Americans have been pioneers in building and defending our nation.
"They are the salt of the earth, and one of the backbones of this country."
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.
"Mr. CorIeone, you have been advised as to your legal rights."
"We have testimony from a previous witness, one willl Cicci."
He stated that you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in the country.
-Are you?
"-No, I'm not."
He testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York police captain in 1947 and with him a man named VirgiI SoIIozzo.
-Do you deny this?
"-Yes, I do."
"Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of ""the Five families"" in New York to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?"
-It's a complete falsehood.
-Mr.
Questadt.
Is it true you have a controlling interest in three major hotels in Las Vegas?
"No, it's not true."
"I own some stock in some of the hotels there, but very little."
I also have stock in IBM and ITT.
Do you have any control over gambling and narcotics in New York State?
"No, I do not."
"Senator, my client would Iike to read a statement."
"Mr. Chairman, I think this statement is totally out of order at this time."
"Sir, my client has answered this committee's questions with sincerity."
"He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment, so this statement should be heard!"
"No, I'll allow Mr. Corleone to read his statement."
"Oh, rigid boxes, you know."
He...
He was his own artist.
He was free compared to me.
The first time I'd gotten a real sense of Lou's legacy was when I was a student up the road at Yale University.
"My father was only 5'6"""
but he cast a long shadow in New Haven.
He built his first and last major buildings here:
the Yale Art Gallery in 1953;
"and right across the street, the British Art Center, finished after his death."
I used to wander around in those buildings on weekends.
"They were silent and mysterious, and I half expected Lou to just appear from around the next corner."
There were rows of books about his work in the library.
"He hadn't built very many buildings, but apparently they had changed the course of architecture:"
"the Salk Institute, the Kimbell Art Museum, the Exeter Library, the Capital of Bangladesh."
"My art history professor, Vincent Scully, had been a friend of Lou's, but he always talked about him like some long-dead ancient hero."
It was unsettling.
"From the very beginning he was after symmetry, order, geometric clarity, primitive power, enormous weight... as much as he could get, like this great monster that stands in the middle of this space."
"You know as I said too, I think, before:"
enduring monuments.
"He wants his materials to kind of last, which is a permanent work in the world."
That's what he's after.
"You know, it was such a wonderful thing to be close to somebody who really was changing everything."
You said at one point that he wanted to make everything right.
- He wanted to make it perfect.
- Perfect.
"You know, in Jewish mysticism, which I know almost nothing about, but..."
"God can only be known through His works, right?"
"And since the messiah hasn't come yet, hmm, the works of any Jewish architect might be the works of God."
"And you take those pictures of Louie when he's looking into the light and when he's enjoying silence like this, it's... it makes the hair stand up, because it really is like that, as if"
"he's in some way communicating with this fundamental thing, that"
God is in the work.
"No, Captain, I can't say I'm surprised at any of it:"
And what you're telling me about my ship disappearing: : :
Is nothing compared to some of the strange things I saw on that blasted planet:
What sort of things?
"- Well, ghosts for one thing:"
- Ghosts?
That's the only thing I can think of to call them:
"Unless you want to say ""visions:"""
"But that seems like splitting hairs, if you ask me:"
Things would...
Things would appear and disappear:
Even the sun seemed to come up from a different direction each morning:
I tell you:
The planet is cursed:
"And if you ask me, that's what's causing the strange behavior you've been seeing here in your ship:"
Are you suggesting that that planet exerts a supernatural force: : :
That causes people to see things and to behave strangely?
"Colonel, I don't know if you'd call it supernatural or not:"
"But a force, there is:"
That much I'll swear to:
I think we better go talk to Dr:
Goodfellow:
It all seems to be working all right:
That we know is off:
Let's have a look here:
Dr:
Goodfellow:
Yeah?
"Oh, it's you, Buck:"
"Yes, nice to see you and Colonel Deering:"
"You're looking awfully busy, Doctor:"
I'm conducting tests in an effort to account for some of the extraordinary behavior: : :
It was a Renaissance-style Royal residence.
"It made its point through wealth, not strength."
James had an agenda.
He wanted to elevate the very idea of kingship.
"Linlithgow Palace declared, in 100-foot-high capital letters,"
James's ambitions as a European monarch.
"Before James I, the magnates like the Lords of the Isles had regarded their king as first amongst equals, and occasionally as something less than that."
But James considered himself to have no equals.
James I was educated and accomplished.
He was Scotland's first Renaissance king.
"Amongst many other talents, he had a real gift for poetry."
"In one poem entitled The King's Quair, he described the moment when he first fell in love."
"James was a captive in England when he wrote these lines,"
But you wouldn't have heard this language at the court of Henry V.
"This was James's mother tongue and imagine how he must have missed it, the rich Scots language of his Lowland birthplace."
Scotland in the 15th century was a blur of different languages and dialects.
"In the Lowlands, Scots - a distinctive vernacular with Anglo-Saxon roots - predominated."
Most of the rest of the kingdom - at least half of Scotland 's population - spoke Gaelic.
"And within Gaelic Scotland there was no more influential, no more determined figure than Alexander, Lord of the Isles."
"While James Stewart was palace building,"
Alexander MacDonald was empire building.
"Alexander's birlinns gave him control of an island archipelago, but his real ambitions lay on the mainland."
Ross stretched from the rocky shores of the Atlantic to the rich farmland of the North Sea coast.
"By acquiring Ross, Alexander became one of the most powerful landowners in the kingdom."
Ross was the jewel in Alexander's crown.
But soon James himself began to cast envious eyes on the northern prize.
The king was running short of cash.
All this palace building came at a price.
He'd already tried cooking the books.
"Money that should have been going south to pay his ransom was being spent on gold leaf and fine carving, but even that wasn't enough to plug the hole in his finances."
"He needed money, and badly."
Alexander's territory in Ross began to look seriously tempting.
"With World War II raging in Europe, the Mickey-Judy musicals provided an uplifting diversion for audiences of the day."
Qherever freedom's banners Are unfurled sing a song from our hearts

"As Andy Hardy, Mickey Rooney was always falling in love."
Esther Williams played his love interest in her first film.
A fashion model and champion swimmer Esther was working in an aquacade when she caught the attention of an MGM talent scout.
In the 22 films she made at Metro she was seldom out of the water.
This is MGM's famous saucer tank.
I did many of my underwater scenes here.
"It's a huge, all-steel swimming pool with porthole windows just below the water line so that you can see anything that's going on inside."
"This tank was originally built as a place for Tarzan, Johnny Weissmuller to fight his rubber crocodiles."
But I really had it pretty much to myself once my swimming musicals became popular.
Every time they start off Wit' a water ballet
There's the customary swimming' pool To swim in
But we don't wanna do it In the customary way
So we start off Just with bathing' suits and women
It had been five years since my Andy Hardy movie.
"By this time, I had starred in several films."
And MGM was committed to finding new ways to get me out of my clothes and into the pool as in This Time for Keeps with the great Jimmy Durante.
Take ten percent off for your agent

I now wanted to be in politics.
Little did I know how similar they are.
I became a zealot.
I had a Goldwater sticker on my bicycle.
I wore Goldwater buttons.
I wore a Goldwater button two weeks after the election was over.
That's how defiant I was.
I met Roger in college.
"He was really a total prodigy, in terms of his political ability."
"He was talking grown men back home into running for office, electing them."
And then we would sit in our dorm room and they would call Roger for political advice as to how they should vote on key issues.
"His mother once said, ""You're not a Catholic."
"Your religion is the Republican Party and your god is Richard Nixon."""
"Bart Porter asked him, you know, if he'd be interested in coming to the Nixon campaign, so Roger took time off of school to go join the campaign."
This is central headquarters for the Re-Elect Nixon Campaign.
The White House.
"But for the sake of appearances, the Re-Elect Nixon headquarters, in name, is one block up Pennsylvania Avenue."
The Committee to Re-Elect the President was unlike any campaign that I'd been in.
It didn't look like your typical political headquarters.
"It had a very hushed, corporate quality to it."
"Porter called me into his office and said,"
"""We want you to go to New Hampshire, and we want you to give this contribution to Pete McCloskey, who's running for the Republican nomination, challenging Nixon from the left, in the name of the Young Socialist Alliance."""
"I got an enormous mason jar, filled it with pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters."
I brought it to the McCloskey headquarters.
"I said, ""Hi, I'm from the Young Socialist Alliance."
"I wanna donate this, and I need a receipt."""
"They were so dumb, they gave me one."
"The idea was to give the receipt to the Manchester Union Leader, the largest newspaper in New Hampshire, as a way of discrediting McCloskey."
"A perfect example of a dirty trick that had no purpose and no effect, but the Nixon people thought it was great."
I never heard another word about it... until an investigator from the Senate Watergate Committee knocked on my door.
We have a mystery story out of Washington.
Five people have been arrested and charged with breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the middle of the night.
"For Peden and the hardcore of the Protesters, this was wickedly similar to Catholic Christianity, where the head of the Church was human, and had power over individual souls."
"The King, they were now certain, was Popish."
Even paranoids are right occasionally.
"In 1670, Charles concluded a secret treaty with the most powerful Catholic king in Europe,"
Louis XIV of France.
Louis agreed to provide Charles with a generous annual pension.
"This was to assist Charles in the restoration of his kingdoms to the arms, the very open arms, of the Catholic Church, at which point Charles would announce his own Catholicism."
"And Charles promised that once the national conversion was complete, he would assist the French in their war against the Protestant Dutch."
This was a secret that Charles must keep.
Anyone who accused the King of Popery must be silenced.
The most outspoken Protesters were confined on the Bass Rock.
Peden was one of them.
He was imprisoned there for four long years.
"Their leaders were captives, the King 's power seemed limitless."
Everything that the Protesters had once achieved was being undone.
The idea grew amongst them that a spectacular act of rebellion would recall their countrymen to the one true path.
Bishops were at the heart of the wicked changes that the King had made.
"And the Archbishop of St Andrews had once been, like themselves, a decent Presbyterian."
"On 3rd May 1679, Archbishop Sharp was returning to St Andrews with his daughter."
But nine Protesting Covenanters had lain in wait.
They gave chase.
Sharp's coach was just two or three miles from safety when it was brought to a standstill.
"It was an assassination, a terrorist act."
"The Government sent a taskforce to the Protesting heartland to stamp on the rats, led by a newly appointed captain, john Graham of Claverhouse."
"Claverhouse knew that the crowds at field preachings could sometimes number as much as 10,000."
"But he was unaware that they were half religious service, half army, like the one he blundered into at Drumclog."
The terrain was boggy and treacherous.
"Claverhouse's men were trained, but outnumbered."
Manoeuvres were simply impossible.
They were defeated.
Claverhouse was almost killed.
"Soon afterwards, Glasgow fell to the Protesters."

I was called America's mermaid because it appeared that I could stay underwater indefinitely.
In Jupiter's Darling I swam into a sunken Roman amphitheater where my presence had the magical effect of bringing statues to life.
In Dangerous When Wet I swam into a cartoon sequence where I met Tom and Jerry.
"You know, they were more animated than some of my leading men."
"In Texas Carnival, I became Howard Keel's underwater dream right there in his own living room."
"For 12 years, I was the center of an amazing series of vivid sights and water pageantry."
And I loved every minute of it.
I'd be like Cleopatterer If I could have my way
Each man she met she went and kissed
And she'd dozens on her waiting list
I wish that I had lived there Beside the pyramid
For a girl today don't get the scope That Cleopatterer did
If one performer could exemplify the lighthearted spirit of the MGM musical then June Allyson would surely be it.
"Here, from Till the Clouds Roll By she romanticizes the virtues of that ancient Egyptian princess Cleopatterer."
Gaping in a line And watch her agitate her spine
It simply use to knock them flat
When she went like this And then like that
At dancing Cleopatterer Was always on the spot
She gave these poor Egyptian ginks
Something else to watch Besides the sphinx
Marc Antony admitted That what first made him skid
"Was the wibbly, wobbly, wiggly dance That Cleopatterer did"
This was the original main gate at MGM.
"In the early days, when a star came to work they'd drive in here and then the studio car would whisk them off to their destination on the lot."
It was all so glamorous.
MGM liked to boast that it had more stars than there are in the heavens.
I just felt lucky to be counted among them when I was still just a kid.
I never wanna hear Johann Sebastian Bach
That's me on the right.
Something as benign as a chorister is an evil that has to be extirpated?
"Oh, yes, of course."
This expanded Covenant closed a simple deal.
"In return for their military assistance, the Scots required the establishment in both England and Ireland of a Presbyterian Kirk, modelled after Scotland's very own."
Plus expenses.
The royal prerogative of King Jesus would extend through all three kingdoms.
Now the Scots had something serious to fight for.
"They happily sent an army of 20,000 men south, complete with ministers and a battle cry -"
"""King Jesus. """
"In July, at the battle of Marston Moor in Yorkshire, they won the first of many victories over Charles 's army."
The Scots had turned the tide.
Charles would never have the upper hand again.
"Two years later, Charles sent his sons Charles and James to France, for safety, and surrendered to the Scots."
He was taken to Newcastle.
"Alexander Henderson and Warriston, the Covenant's co-authors, were sent to persuade him to sign the Covenant."
There were two paths open to Charles.
"On the one side, a long life as a Covenanted king, limited by laws, but the country's leader still."
"On the other, more war, more loss of life."
The faint hope of victory for absolute monarchy.
"They got down on their knees and begged Charles to sign the Covenant, accept a kingship limited by laws, to agree to establish in all three kingdoms a Presbyterian Church of which he was in no sense the head."
"They were asking for peace, of course, but they were also asking Charles to reject his God, to reject his entire understanding of himself, his duties, his place on Earth."
The King couldn't say yes.
It was a syllable too far.
He did not sign the Covenant.
The Scots handed the King over to the English Parliament.
"But in his own mind, he was still king by God 's grace."
It would be sinful simply to accept his fate.
"Secretly, he made contact with the nobles of the country that his dynasty had been born in."
"Scotland's nobles had signed the Covenant, but it was Charles's hope that their loyalty to his family would prove stronger."
And he was proved right.
"The nobles agreed to fight for him again, provided that if they won, he would adopt the Covenant and the Presbyterian Kirk for a three-year trial period in all his kingdoms."
The nobles took their secret deal to the rest of the Covenanters.

I remember my father's hands.
Sometimes that's all I could see when he would sit on my bed and tell me stories about his childhood late at night.
He said he was born on an island with a castle on it off the coast of Estonia in 1901 or 1902.
He wasn't sure which.
He came on a steamboat to Philadelphia with his family in 1906.
"They were very poor, but Lou was good at art and music."
"His drawings won prizes, and he made money playing piano in the silent movie houses."
He told me Philadelphia was a city where a small boy could find what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.
I went back to the neighborhood in north Philadelphia to find the places he always talked about.
The whole family lived on the top floor of a tenement.
"And when a wealthy lady gave Lou a piano, there was no room left for his bed."
So he slept on the piano.
"They couldn't afford pencils for him to draw with, but that was okay, because you could make charcoal by burning sticks in the backyard."
"The kids teased him and called him 'Scarface', so he waited until the last bell to go to school."
"There was a girl he loved named Ada, but she loved someone else."
"The next part of the story he didn't talk about much, so I have to rely on the architecture books."
He won a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1924.
"In 1930, he married Esther Israeli, and their daughter, Sue Ann, was born ten years later."
Esther worked in a medical lab and supported the family throughout the '30s and '40s as Lou struggled to get commissions and to find a style he could call his own.
It was the era of the new modern architecture:
sleek steel skyscrapers and houses defined by walls of glass.
"Lou tried to design that way, but it never felt right."
"In 1947, with Esther's help, he started his own office with several men and one woman."
He was almost 50 years old and still hadn't found himself.
I wanted to show you some sketches I made when I was... when I was in Rome.
"Then in 1951, he was invited to be architect in residence at the American Academy in Rome and to travel throughout the ancient world."
What he saw changed his life.
"These are the sketches I made a long time ago in Egypt, you see."
"Timelessness, monumentality."
That's what mattered.
"When Lou got back, he finally knew what he wanted to do:"
build modern buildings that had the feel and presence of ancient ruins.
I eavesdropped Naughty guy

"can't you tell, if you look at records isn't this situation bad"
"But in James's lifetime, it was no more than a reminder of what might have been, of an idea whose time hadn't yet come."
"The people of the islands, both Scots and English alike, weren't ready to be British."
And so Project Britain ground to a halt.
"For centuries, English kings had used the prophecy of King Arthur's return to try and justify their attempts to subdue Scotland."
"But in one of the great ironies of British history, it was Scotland's own Little Arthur, James, who fulfilled that prophecy."
"What james had seen as a great victory for Scotland, other Scots felt as a loss."
"For the first time, Scots now found themselves ruled from distant London, and a new reality dawned."
"By 1603, the Scottish people had a powerful sense of their identity as an ancient and free nation, unconquered by successive waves of invaders, who had fought time and again to secure their freedom and forged a place in Europe."
They had also created a unique and distinctive court.
But the events of 1603 weren't just a further step along that road.
They were the decisive turning point in Scotland's story.
The peace and co-operation that 1603 seemed to promise would be short-lived.
"In the century to come,"
Scotland and England would experience a terrible escalation of violence in a furious civil war to resolve just what Britain actually meant and what sort of country the new Scotland would become.
"For almost 20 years in the 17th century, this island was the most secure prison in the entire British Isles."
"Welcome to the Bass Rock, in the Firth of Forth."
Welcome to Scotland's Alcatraz.
There was no escape from the Bass.
"Its cells were home to the country's most dangerous men, men whose religious beliefs threatened the stability of Britain itself."
Their radical vision was declared in a document called the National Covenant.
"The National Covenant would unseat kings, license revolution, cost tens of thousands of Scots their lives."
It started the Civil War that would cost King Charles I his head.
"He struggled to erase the Covenant from history, but to tell the truth, there was never any chance that he would succeed."
"After all, he was only a king."
And the National Covenant was a contract between Scotland and God.
"In 1633, King Charles I came here, to Edinburgh, for his coronation."
It was a visit he would really rather not have made.
"He had been king for eight years now, and if the Scots had given in to his frequent demands that the Scottish Crown jewels be sent to London, then the trip wouldn't have been necessary."
But the Scots had said no.
Several times.
So here he was.
It was his first visit to Scotland in 30 years.
"At the end of the morning, we went to Brent Cross to have lunch."
"""If I were a poet"" said Robinson, ""this is the place I would come to, to write."
"""I feel instantly at home here."""
We caught sight of a small intense man sitting near the fountain... reading from a book by Walter Benjamin.
Robinson embraced this man and they talked for a long time.
But when he tried to call him later... he found that the number was a public telephone in a street in Cricklewood... and we never saw the man again.
[Crows cawing]
NARRATOR:
At the other entrance to the park... the gateposts had stopped talking since the election.
"Robinson is a materialist, his vision of the universe, that of Lucretius."
"He brooded for weeks over the election result, unable to reconcile... the re-election of the government with his understanding of nature."
[Birds chirping]
NARRATOR:
One day at the beginning of May... we found ourselves in Leicester Square.
Leicester Square is a place of particular importance to Robinson.
He has imaginatively reconstructed it as a monument to Laurence Sterne... who visited London in 1760... following the first success of Tristram Shandy... and was introduced to many leading figures of the day.
Robinson credits Sterne with the discovery of the cinema... in his description of duration as the succession of ideas... which follow and succeed each other in our minds... like the images on the inside of a lanthorn... turned round by the heat of a candle.
He was introduced to Joshua Reynolds... who lived in the square at Number 47 and Reynolds painted his portrait.
"Hogarth, who lived at Number 30 gave him illustrations... for the frontispiece of his second edition... and for his next two volumes which were published the following year."
In his enthusiasm for crowds and public places...
Robinson is a modernist.
Since our meeting with the writer at Brent Cross... whenever he's occupied with his literary researches... he takes the bus to Brixton market... where he works in a cafe in one of the arcades.
He's trying to establish a connection... between the Russian formalists of the revolutionary period... with their interests in Sterne and Tristram Shandy... and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire who visited Brixton in 1901.
He loves the modernity of Brixton.
"Electric Avenue, the Bon Marche... the railways crossing over Atlantic Road."
He'd tell me about the passengers of the SS Empire Windrush.
The first post-war immigrants recruited from Jamaica... who were housed in the deep shelters under Clapham Common when they first arrived.
I was beginning to understand Robinson's method... which seemed to be based on a belief that English culture... had been irretrievably diverted by the English reaction to the French Revolution.
His interest in Sterne and other English writers of the 18th century... and in the French poets who followed Baudelaire... was an attempt to rebuild the city in which he found himself... as if the 19th century had never happened.
Of course he's bound to fail.
"In 1800, London's population was 850,000."
"By 1900, it had grown to six-and-a-half million... the largest city ever known."

They shake their bodies so To and fro
With every shake A lucky break
- Provin' that there's a way
- A way
- To chase your cares away
- Away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away
Shake those blues away
Gotta chase those cares away
Just to prove that there's a way
"A way to shake, shake your blues"

planes inside nine-dimensional space that we have to work with eventually.
"For now, let's stay with a nice case where the matrices work,"
we can get every right-hand side b and here we see how to
do it with columns.
Okay.
There was one step which I
realized I was saying in words that I now want to write in letters.
"Because I'm coming back to the matrix form of the equation,"
so let me write it here.
"The matrix form of my equation,"
of my system is some matrix A times some vector x equals some right-hand
side b.
Okay.
So this is a multiplication.
A times x.
"Matrix times vector, and I just want to say how do you"
multiply a matrix by a vector?
"Okay, so I'm just going to create a"
matrix -- let me take two five one three --
"and let me take a vector x to be, say, 1and 2."
How do I multiply a
matrix by a vector?
But just think a little bit about
matrix notation and how to do that in multiplication.
So let me say how I multiply a matrix by a vector.
"Actually, there are two ways to do it."
Let me tell you my favorite way.
It's columns again.
It's a column at a time.
"For me, this matrix multiplication says I take one of that column and"
two of that column and add.
So this is the way I would think of
And twist the third red bubble.
Lock the free end of the third pinnk and red bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the third gray bubble.
And twist the third yellow bubble.
Lock the free ends of the third gray and yellow bubble in one lock twist.
Alright.
Let's take a look on our sculpture.
"Basically, we are making the same fabric as we did in previously published instructions"
"""Fabric 2"", ""Fabric 3""."
The big difference here is we connect both ends of each row in this sculpture.
Twist the fourth yellow and the fourth red bubble.
Lock the free ends of the fourth yellow and fourth red bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the fourth gray and twist the fourth pink bubble.
Lock the free end of the fourth gray and fourth pink bubble in one lock twist.
Keep working in the same fashion.
We can make as many rows as we want.
In this example we use only four balloons to build the tower.
We can use any even number of balloons to build larger in diameter tower.
There is also no limit how high you can make it.
Just add balloons as you need it.
Here is time saving way to make this sculpture.
Hold and twist balloons together to make the bubbles and
lock the ends in one lock twist in one move.
Twisting different size bubbles will definitely distort the tower.
Fix it right away.
I have mentioned before that we can make the tower as tall as we want.
"Let's limit our self here, for this instruction."
So far we have twisted six rows.
Or six bubbles of each color.
Now we have to build a cabin on the top of the crane tower.
We can make different size bubbles to make the cabin in different ways.
Let's do it in the simplest way.
- Yeah.
"On the very rare occasions when you expect it and it won't hurt and you're dealing with it some other way, then, yeah, just comment it."
But don't leave an empty block like that.
"The problem is, though, if you don't have that in there then you have to say,"
"""OK, this method throws parse exception."""
Then all the methods that call that have to throw parse exception.
You end up making changes all over your code.
It's a real irritation of Java checked exceptions.
"The best practice for this, instead of swallowing the exception, convert it to unchecked and re throw it."
- Or throw it.
Or throw the original.
"- Yeah, but if it's checked then you have to declare it all the time."
- Yes.
- As opposed to... nobody likes to do that.
Nobody is going to do that.
Nobody is going to make that many changes in their code.
This forward exception has a little bit of a private API call that you can use there if you want to stick with that.
"Pierre is shaking his head going no, and I agree with Pierre because I don't do that."
- I hate that feature of Web Object.
"It's forward exception is something that... objective C polluting Java, it's..."
"- I get this from Wonder, and I blame Wonder for making me do that."
I did it the nice way and Anyo got cranky at me.
There's actually a class called Exception Converter.
"In the notes to the slide there's a URL for it, and it's a much nicer thing to do."
"- Well, you run that exception?"
"- Yes, but the problem of throwing in a run time exception is you lose the original stack trace."
"- You chain it, you chain it."
- Not if you put parentheses E.
- Yes.
Actually parentheses E plus exclusion as to what in this level why it's being thrown.
"- Chain, chain, chain always chain."
- No.
"They have free weights, they have machines."
The exercise machines are awesome.
I'm involved in the U.R.I. marching band.
I definitely love being at the football games and really channeling the school spirit.
You have the football team here.
The games are so much fun to go to.
Alot of students get into it.
We have a real close team.
The basketball is great.
My favorite sport is college basketball.
Lots of great rivalries.
You kind of just really get into it because everyones energy is high.
It really gives me that sense of school spirit.
I really feel like I've
learned alot and gotten alot of life lessons from all of the activities outside of my classes sometimes.
You're gonna gain a really great education.
"I think it's a really great option, especially financially."
They really focus on making sure that you get the bang for your buck.
I feel like I'm getting a good deal.
Get the most out of your college career because it goes by quick.
The education I'm getting here is great.
They prepare us well for the real world.
"Wow, I really have gotten alot out of the University."
I love U.R.I.
"For this question, we do a little recap of our packet protocol."
If we look at this wave form here you have the clock at the top.
"We have the valid signals that says, we are transmitting data."
"And then, the valid signal goes low the"
last cycle of the packet we are sending out a parity.
"In the second packet here, packet 2, you can see that while we're transmitting a packet, we can suspend that packet by asserting the suspensd signal."
"And therefore, the data transmissions will be delayed and the packet will not transmit until the suspensd signal goes again low."
This is a waveform.
He's probably not going to be real happy with you.
"So, you know, just, keep, keep that kind of thing in mind."
"You're dealing with, with people's emotions."
"Another thing another aspect of, for consideration, with respect to risk acceptance is benchmarking."
"So, there's got to be, a, an explicit acknowledgement by top management with respect to what, what level of risk the organization is willing to accept."
"Now, you guys all work for organizations with, with a, with a few exceptions for which this sort of thing should be happening."
How many of you are aware of what management has specified as being the risk tolerance of your organization?
Not even one?
[LAUGH]
Okay.
"So, I mean, that's, that's kind of scary."
That's kind of scary.
"Cuz if you don't know what the risk tolerance is, how can you put a framework in place, that's going to achieve managements expectations?"
"You're shooting in the dark, right?"
"And you know, you're not going to fix it over night, but just something to, to be aware of."
[INAUDlBLE]
They have no tolerance.
"They, they were all went through it out."
"A fool proof, a fool proof system."
Towards somewhere else.
Sorry.
[INAUDlBLE]
"Somewhere, somewhere else, I'm serious."
They work somewhere else.
What has been mandated Yeah.
"Because that's what where, that."
Before you cannot possibly accomplish.
"No, but they announced it publicly."
You can't fail.
"How much did they announced that can't fail, control?"
"Yeah. , I mean, you know, realistically, you're probably, you know, it's easy for me to say, you know, go work somewhere else."
"But, if you think about the fact that everything about your job, both the tangible and intangible rewards can ultimately be tied to how well you achieve management's objectives."
"So almost, but not quite, everything I need to do."
Someone want to point out to me what it is I have failed to consider in this situation.
[Inaudible].
It's the what?
[Inaudible].
Yeah. ? trying to make null point to something [inaudible].
Exactly.
So if my queue is totally empty.
So in these cases like
"- one thing you can often think about whenever you see yourself with this error, and you're dereferencing something, you have to considered, well, is there a possibility that that value is null."
And if so I'd better do something to protect against it.
"So in the case of the new cell here, I'm setting aside and not clearing that cell."
"We know it's valid, [inaudible], we've got good memory."
"That part's good but the access to the tail, and that's assuming there is a tail, that there is at least one cell already in the queue that the tail is pointing to."
"When that's not true, this is going to blow up."
It's going to try to dereference it.
So what we can do here is we can just check for that.
We can say if the queue is empty then what we want to do is say that head equals tail equals new cell.
"Otherwise, we've got some existing tail and we just need to attach to it."
"Now, this is what I meant about that often there are little bit of special cases for certain different inputs."
"In particular, the most common ones are an empty list or a single link list being distinguished from a list that has two or more elements."
So sometimes it's all about - a single link list has problems and so does the empty list.
"In this case, it's exactly the empty list."
"Like a single cell is actually fine, you know, one, ten, 6,000 all work equally well."
It's that empty case that we have to work on setting our head and tail to that.
So with this plan we go back to my use of this.
"And stop talking about my stack and change into my queue, end queuing instead of pushing."
[Inaudible].
"Oh, 591 errors."
"Well, that's really - 591, what is that?"
[Inaudible].
"Oh, yeah, this is the year I was going to talk about but I failed to do."
"Yes, if you're trying to do like a full blown formatter, then you actually do need to worry about the position."
"- The point of the Wonder Helpers, by the way, is that formatters you can only...well, from the binding, from binding, you can only use them on components that expose a formatter finding."
Wonder Helpers you can use on any binding.
- That's nice.
- I don't think I've used those.
- You should because you steal them.
- I will.
"- Right, right."
You can have multiple...
- They can be extended into something else.
- I usually just chain the formatter instances.
- No instances.
- We won't go there.
"OK, so, moving on to our final topic, I think we're, are we out of time Pascal, or Keep going.?"
"Deployment, trying to get through here quickly."
There's really not much to say about deployment that hasn't been said in other places.
"Manage dependencies, plan for change."
It's going to happen.
"Web Object extensions directory sounded like a great idea when it first came out, jammed all kinds of jars in there."
It was wonderful.
Then I needed to update one app in the server and I couldn't update the other apps and it was terrible.
"For deployment, my advice is just delete everything in that directory."
It's just a dependency nightmare waiting to happen.
"Instead, if you need it, if you need jar files, put them in a framework, use the framework in your application."
Framework goes into your subversion repository wherever your repository is.
Manage the dependencies like that.
"In fact, I'll go one further and say,"
"""You should embed all frameworks."""
"All frameworks, I include the Web Objects ones as well because that way you can deploy applications using different versions of Web Objects, different versions of the jars on the same server."
You don't have to worry about conflicts.
"And Yeah, people are going to say,"
"""Oh, it's going to be bigger."
- How are we on our medical experts?
- Not good.
The psychiatrist you wanted is tied up in another trial.
And the neurologist is sailing to Costa Rica.
"This book I'm reading, it's by an anthropologist."
"It's about contemporary cases of possession, mostly in the Third World."
People there are still primitive and superstitious.
Maybe.
Maybe they see possession for what it really is.
Maybe we've taught ourselves not to see it.
- You saying you believe in this stuff?
- No.
Maybe we shouldn't just try to invalidate the prosecution's case... ...by punching holes in the medical approach.
Maybe we should also try to validate the alternative.
- Validate possession in a court of law?
- Yes.
Okay.
I guess we could bring in some priests to talk about exorcisms...
"No, the archdiocese won't let us do that."
They wanna limit the Church's exposure to Father Moore.
I've got three articles by the anthropologist who wrote this book.
She approaches the subject of possession... ...from a scientific perspective and doesn't try to debunk it.
- You want me to track her down?
- Yeah.
Keep looking for a medical expert to refute Dr. Briggs.
But send the case file to this Dr. Sadira Adani.
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...as you know by now, my name is Erin Bruner... ...and I represent the defendant, Richard Moore."
"Mr. Thomas has contended that Emily Rose suffered... ...from a serious medical condition... ...that required medical treatment, nothing more."
"He has asserted that any attempt by my client... ...to help Emily by anything other than medical means... ...was not only inappropriate, but criminally negligent."
I'm now gonna ask that you keep an open mind... ...to what our evidence and testimony will show.
Medical treatment was not the answer for Emily... ...because she simply did not suffer from a medical condition.
She was neither epileptic nor psychotic.
"little thing that says, I would say, dude that is totally singular."
Just so you know.
Don't like be messing around doing back slash with that matrix.
Okay.
All right.
That's it for today.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;Maile Ohye:
Hi.
I'm Maile Ohye.
I'm a member of Google's webmaster support team.
And I'd
like to help you better understand how to use the URL parameters feature in webmaster tools.
URL parameters is a fairly advanced feature.
So some of this information might be more complex than one would expect.
"Before you further watch this video, please check out the URL parameters page to see if you have a message from Google explaining that we already believe we have high crawl-coverage of your site."
And therefore no adjustments to this feature are necessary.
"The message would say ""Currently Googlebot isn't experiencing problems with coverage of your site."
So you don't need to configure URL parameters.
Incorrectly configuring parameters can result in pages from your site being dropped from our index.
"So we don't recommend you use this tool unless necessary."""
"For those of you who have that message, you're good to go."
And no further viewing is even necessary.
But for those of you who don't have that message please keep watching.
And one of the main takeaways is that improper actions on the URL parameters feature can result in pages no longer appearing in search.
"Again, it's an advanced feature."
The settings in the URL parameters are used by Google as a helpful hint in our crawling process.
"For stronger directives, you want to use things like a robots.txt disallow."
Or a meta noindex.
But using the URL parameters hint is still very helpful.
"In 2010, the Google store only sold about 160 products."
And that seems fine and fairly easy to crawl.
"But the thing is, that of these 160-ish products, it actually created 380,000"
"He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing."
He's looking for those genes as well.
"And I said, ""Well, if you can find those,"
"I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."""
And so he agreed.
And so that's what we're looking into.
"If you look at dinosaur hands, a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it."
"Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand."
"But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing."
"But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand."
"It has the three fingers, the three digits."
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.
And so what we're looking for is that gene.
"We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,"
like the archaeopteryx.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
"And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail."
"But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it."
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
"So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus."
(Laughter)
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
But it's just the very basics.
So that really is what we're doing.
"And people always say, ""Why do that?"
Why make this thing?
"What good is it?"""
"Well, that's a good question."
"Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things."
"And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece."
"They, I'm sure you know, their paper has improved as a result of this."
"Right, right."
"So you know, that, that does not hurt."
"It's everybody's instinct, I think to at first be a little defensive when you get your review back."
Yeah.
Because you have to go back and.
Yeah.
Tweak the language a little bit.
"Right, right."
"To make sure your, you know polite."
"That's a good tip, yeah."
And can you give us some words of encouragement for young scientists who might have submitted their first paper and actually got an outright rejection?
"Can you, what are some words of encouragement?"
"Well, I would just say, fix it and if it's totally rejected by that journal, their not asking for resubmission, fix it."
"Try to respond to the reviewers comments that you feel are justified, and submit it elsewhere, and persist."
"I've had my, as an author, I've had to submit papers to as many as four journals til the, finally got accepted."
So I think persistence is important.
Don't take the rejection personally.
"It's hard not to, and I sometimes do, but you realize that some reviewers may not be very competent, may not really understand what you're doing."
This will often happen if you've submit[ted].
Epidemiologic paper and it gets reviewed by a clinician who does not really understand.
Um-hm.
Principles of epidemiology.
"They'll feel that if you write a paper about stroke if, if every case was not reviewed by a neurologist then it's not a valid paper."
Right.
"So or, or maybe they're competent but just had a bad day and, and didn't really pay close attention to what you wrote and miss some passages that really would have answered their questions."
"So just realize that reviewers are human, just like you just like authors and, And."
That's just the way the system works.
"Yeah, yeah."
It's not perfect.
And then talking about the system a little bit.
"You know, what changes do you anticipate are gonna occur in the publication process?"
"I can go only one way, there's 2 exits, there's one in the lower left corner and there's one in the upper right."
"And as you saw, the maze itself will turn according to where the ball is positioned, so you have a better view of where you are and where you're going to."
You will also notice there are green cubes and there are red cubes.
"The red cubes are those that can't be accessed, and the green cubes can be accessed."
"What I didn't put into this maze but is possible, are one-way cubes: you can go into them one way, but you can't come out of them the same way (you can't go back)."
What I didn't put into them are prison cubes: you can go into them but you can't get out.
"And what I didn't put into the maze are rewards, where I need to hunt through the entire maze, to collect rewards before I am allowed to leave."
That's all possible in the proof of concept.
"And of course, I can go back to the original position of the ball."
"In the mean time, there's a position counter here that says where I am, that shows in which bar and cube I am."
"I'm now in bar 18 cube 1, when I go up I'm in bar 19, still cube 1."
I go back:
I wind up in cube 0.
"I go up: and I wind up in 0.0, which is exactly where I need to be."
That's it.
I hope you enjoyed this.
You can look our stuff op on the OmegaJunior.Net.
We begin to pursuit the way to each other
Looking for live together with each other
Each of us always having question and looking for the answer
When we will meet each other?
No matter how long distance from here
Or passing through endless time
The remaining time of my life
I knew and believed that we will be together
Where are you?
And who you are?
Where are you?
I'm waiting for you... you really exist in my faith
We are born this way.... to be each other's soul mate
This is the instruction from above
Bestowed to us and across in someday this life
And we did find a lot of stuff.
"We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex."
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
"It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex."
"And I and my colleagues cut into it, and we were able to determine, by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it, that B-rex had died at the age of 16."
"We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived, because we haven't found the oldest one yet."
But this one died at the age of 16.
"We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer, and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone."
"Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant."
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs.
But Mary went further.
"She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid."
"Now we all know that bones are fossilized, and so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left."
But there was something left.
There were blood vessels left.
"There were flexible, clear blood vessels."
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.
It was extraordinary.
"But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones."
"And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins."
"But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground."
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
"And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer, and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples."
And we did.
We got better material.
The cells looked better.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
"I mean, it was wonderful stuff."
But it's not dinosaur DNA.
"So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA, just breaks down too fast."
"We're just not going to be able to do what they did in ""Jurassic Park."""
It comes and goes.
"Like this many thing else, comes and goes."
"Like I was saying, just recently, you see the thoughts , they're random."
They're not sequential.
They're not really.. they're random.
"Like I was saying you were thinking, somehow meditating on just being self and then suddenly there is sort of like pizza or something come then after this sort of like 'aha, you know, go shopping in this place' and then 'ha, e-mail to somebody', you know, it's like just coming up like this."
But this kind of thought for you is more seasonal.
"It comes about, because there is something that is grown around this thought, that seems"
like it is intensely got some kind of nectar promise in it.
"But now, you're aware this now."
Because the fruit of this attachment or activity is that you're not happy about it.
You're not happy with it.
You're not happy with it.
Nobody is happy with it.
"Because you've the power to dream , but you don't have the power to make your dream come true."
Whatever we might think.
"If you've the power to decide what should appear in your life, Ok?"
"You're the architect and designer, everything that happens to you."
"Then, you , with that, all of you will be clear about who you're or something, if this is what you want."
Or you wouldn't include anything that is uncomfortable as an experience.
You will go all for chocolates flavored moments.
"So, something is, life takes that away from you."
You don't have this power.
"You may dream, but the purpose of life, is not to fulfill or to satisfy your projections."
"So, that is a wisdom in this and a maturity to learn to let go of that."
That these dreams they're depleting of your energy.
And brings in the state of confusion.
"So, what I'm pointing you to, is only the space of the awareness within which the story of , this kind of romance, and what this kind of images come and then another image come also, and it passes."
Something else comes.
Momentary attention passes.
"Innumerable thoughts , waves of , tsumani of thoughts come and they don't stick because you've no interest."
"But, some come and they stick."
"They had a server tag which resembled their script tag, which caused stuff to run on the server, and they had a write function which would cause the insertion of whatever text you were writing into the HTML output stream."
So it had all of the vulnerabilities that PHP has.
"It had all the disadvantages of the other template system plus, at the time, a pretty slow JavaScript engine."
That product was eventually withdrawn and replaced with J2EE.
"What if we did it right, instead, this time?"
We have one of those opportunities in history where we can try it again and this time get it right.
What if we had server side JavaScript with an event loop?
Not a template system but an event loop.
"Well, it turns out we've got it."
We already have it.
"It's node.js, which runs on top of V8."
"It implements a web server in a JavaScript event loop, and it is brilliant."
It is a very high performance event pump.
"It can take events and move them really fast through its event queue, in and out and across the world."
"Not only that, it got READ right."
"Here's the final system read from node.js, and it has a callback function."
"The callback function receives the data that you ask to read, and that's right."
"I mean, we finally have a correctly implemented, correctly designed read function."
"Everything in the node.js API is non-blocking, or should have been."
There are a couple of exceptions.
"One is, it has some synchronous functions which do block."
That's really unfortunate.
I wish they weren't there.
"There are non-blocking versions for most of them, but there shouldn't be any."
It's just too big a hazard.
"The other is, there's a require function that blocks, which is used for loading script."
"That's really unfortunate, I'd like to see that fixed too."
"But otherwise, node.js is just really good stuff."
There are a lot of advantages that come from it.
One is that you can run the same stuff on both sides of the network.
We can take YUI -- the same YUI that you're running in the browser -- and run it in the server.
That means your applications can run on either side.
So we would be having the linear combinations of nine vectors in
"nine-dimensional space, and we would be trying to find the"
combination that hit the correct right-hand side b.
And we might also ask the question can we always do it?
Can we get every right-hand side b?
And certainly it will depend on
those nine columns.
Sometimes the answer will be yes --
"if I picked a random matrix, it would be yes, actually."
"If I used MatLab and just used the random command,"
"picked out a nine by nine matrix, I guarantee it would be good."
It
"would be non-singular, it would be invertible,"
all beautiful.
But if I choose those columns so
"that they're not independent, so that the ninth column is the same"
"as the eighth column, then it contributes nothing new and"
there would be right-hand sides b that I couldn't get.
Can you sort of think about nine vectors in nine-dimensional space an
take their combinations?
That's really the central thought --
that you get kind of used to in linear algebra.
"Even though you can't really visualize it, you sort of think you"
can after a while.
Those nine columns and all their
combinations may very well fill out the whole nine-dimensional space.
But if the ninth column happened to be the same as the eighth column and
"gave nothing new, then probably what it would fill out"
would be -- I hesitate even to say this --
it would be a sort of a plane -- an eight dimensional plane inside
nine-dimensional space.
And it's those eight dimensional
"I'm saying that when you ask teachers, ""What do you mean when you tell your students to 'pay attention,' 'focus,' 'concentrate.'"""
"You know, just like a camera, hold that image still."
I go to the students.
"So when your teacher tells you, ""Pay attention, focus, concentrate."""
What is she telling you?
Hold that image still as if you were taking a picture?
"I ask people at work, old people, young -- everybody says the same thing."
"Well, in fact, the only way you can really pay attention, most of the time, is to vary the image."
"So, whey don't you sort of look at your finger."
Do -- look at your finger.
"Now, if you want to stay attentive to your finger, you have to notice new things."
You can't just see it as the same way it was yesterday.
"I say, my goodness, this finger is different from an hour ago."
I notice a little piece of dirt here; there's a wrinkle I wasn't aware of...
That noticing these things is what keeps you attentive.
Right.
"So, in fact, we have all these people who are trying to pay attention..."
So we assume it's just a finger.
"Well, when you assume it's just a finger; (it can't change) that there's nothing new that by not looking for newness (right), it fades from view."
It's a very hard thing to do.
"When you're noticing new things about it, which is the essence of mindfulness and mindful learning, is that it becomes interesting to you."
Even something that might seem so uninteresting as (a finger!) the tip of your finger.
"Now, but this has tremendous implications for things like"
Hey!
"For today's illustration, I'm going to be using some pieces of paper."
"Now, if I take these pieces of paper and try to juggle them..."
...it doesn't work very well!
I can't do it!
"But if I take the paper and mold it into the shape of a juggling ball, it becomes something I can work with and use."
We need to be kind of like these pieces of paper -- we need to allow God to shape us and mold us into what He wants us to be.
"See, God wants to do all kinds of awesome things through us, but if we don't allow Him to shape us and mold us into what He wants us to be, then how are we supposed to be of use?"
Isaiah 64:8 talks about God as our potter and us as the clay.
"Back 1 in x, we go down 3."
Just like that.
"So if we connect the dots here, it'll look something like this."
I'll do my best to draw a straight line.
"So the second graph, 2y plus 4 equals 6, we put it into slope-intercept form and we graphed it."
"Now, the whole point of this question was to identify the number of solutions that it has, the system."
A solution to a system of equations is an x and y value that satisfy both of these equations.
"Now, if there were such an x and y value that satisfied both of these equations, then that x and y value would have to lie on both of these graphs."
Because this blue line is all of the pairs of x and y's that satisfy the first equation.
The red line is all of the pairs of x's and y's that satisfy the second equation.
"So if something's going to satisfy both, it's got to be on both lines."
"When you look here, are there any points that are on both lines?"
"Well, no."
These two lines never intersect.
A point of intersection is a point that is common to both of these lines.
"No, they don't intersect."
No intersection.
So there is not a solution to this system of equations.
There is no solution.
We know that because these two lines don't intersect.
And you didn't even have to graph it.
The kind of giveaway was that these are two different lines.
"They have different y-intercepts, but their slopes are identical."
"So if you have two different y-intercepts and your slopes are identical, then you have two different lines that will never intersect."
"And if they represent a system, or if they're the graphs of a system of equations, that system has no solution."
We tried talking to him about the hot topic right now.
The legal battle for a home made video that Ohanie
Noa
Jennifer Lopez's ex husband is intending to publish but please observe Mark's reaction (the reporter says) But right now this is the question of the moment (he makes hand signals to proceed with the other question)
Next question
I want to know..
Next question at least tell what you think
But I'm going to look at the hook scene now because it's a fabulous example of how sound and image can create a monster where there's no monster there.
"Innocently enough, with a little hook, actually a big hook, swinging on a chain and the sailor noticing it."
Just a little sound.
"Right, and so our hero mimics exactly what his officer told him."
[inaudible]
Now we cut to the sinister scene on the bridge and this lighting is just mad.
"We got this low lighting that comes right on their faces, the sound of the bells which is a motif across the film and quiet talk."
"So, we're going in to a dark, dark world here and that setting up the attack of the monster watch."
"Still in gentle sling, but now it's a massive beast that's intruding into the frame, and in the first attack of the hook."
"Watch by Stone using passes, and in-communicative and stern, and also simply wrong."
[crosstalk]
"Now, the it's going to, to become the monster at night, attacking the night watchmen."
"We hear the crashing, off screen sound."
"We don't see it and he's going to use his flashlight to track it, there it goes."
It explodes across the foreground.
We can see its distance of the swing by how he moves the flashlight.
We don't actually see how much it's swinging.
And now the crashing becomes more complex.
We hear it swing and then crash into something.
"And then swing again, but we don't see it."
So sound is mapping the movement before we see it.
"Then we discover it, right?"
"We discover all the parts, too."
"We see it swing past the man out over the deck, and then come back to hit this ladder."
And any ladders that sound to crash[SOUND].
The climax that this is the boat and it illustrates the power of this things.
"Finally, we get it done to control that just variable."
"Disaster is averted, there really is too much potential energy to tie down this hook."
Which mean this is not really about the hook at all.
There's something on this ship that must explode.
"There is something troubling that will break through the surface, and harm men no matter how hard they try."
"And by using sound, I think what Lewton and Robson do is make it more than a hook."
"""You're doing so great!"
"Keep going!"" ... and a bad self on the other side saying, ""Aw, come on ... just one won't hurt."""
And sometimes ... in a moment of weakness ... the bad self wins.
Having a slip-up can make you feel guilty and disappointed in yourself ... but that's not helpful.
"In fact, those bad feelings could set you up for another lapse."
"The truth is, slip-ups happen ... and they happen to almost everyone who quits smoking."
So forget the guilt and disappointment.
What's important now is to
learn from your mistake so a lapse doesn't turn into a relapse.
"Chances are, you slipped because of one of three things: your environment ... your cravings ... or your social support system."
So let's take a good look at each one.
First ... your environment.
Think about the slip-up.
When did it happen?
What were you doing?
Who were you with?
Maybe you're used to smoking when you drink coffee or alcohol ... when you go to certain places ... or when you're around people who stress you out.
Keep track of the things that trigger you to smoke.
"It can help you see patterns, which can help you plan how to deal with your triggers ... or avoid them ... so you can stay strong."
"Next, if your cravings got you to light up again, think about nicotine replacement."
Using medicine can more than double your chances of quitting.
Never tried it?
"Consider an over-the-counter product like the patch, inhaler,"
"lozenges, or gum."
"If you're already using nicotine replacement, keep using it ... even if you slipped up ... and ask your doctor if there are other medicines that might help you."
"Finally, how's your support system?"
It's harder to quit if you're around people who aren't ready to quit with you.
"So when you're with people who aren't ready to quit, ask them not to smoke around you ... and spend more time with people who want you to succeed."
"If you could use more people on your side, join a support group ... find an online quit program ... or call a quitline."
"If you have a smart phone, quit-smoking applications are another way to get encouragement."
Some let you record video messages from loved ones that you can watch when you're tempted to smoke.
Other apps can connect you with friends on social networking sites so they can cheer you on.
"So I'm, I'm limited to what I can show."
So there's certain kinds of regulation over what kinds of information can be shared.
"So, resource dependence varies from a variety of factors."
"There are different types of resources and they can vary in value to their importance and availability, and then certain actors and institutions can control discussion over those resources."
"Now clearly, important rare resources are of greater value."
"More over, actors and institutions that have the greatest disccretion over these resources and the least amount of dependence, will be the most autonomous and capable for forging certain relations with other firms in the environment."
Once we went on vacation
Where the sun always shines and the snow is unheard of
Once we went on vacation
Where there's always a lot of sky and salt water.
"In the morning we went to a wine degustation,"
And the next day we went down with a headache.
Then we drank a lot of stale water
And the next day we went down with stomach ache.
"Go, go, have a rest!"
"Tourists, for you, tourists,"
Everything is pleasant and useful.
"Tourists, adventurers."
"Sea islands, buenavista."
"We went to a travel agency,"
For an excursion to bars and bistros
We went mountain climbing to the clouds and eagles
The Ministry of Emergency Situations rescued us from there two days later.
"Then gipsies foretold us good fortunes,"
It was so expensive that it nearly made us cry
"Then we picked up with two girls in a bar,"
And the next day we were down with clonidine intoxication.
"Go, go, have a rest!"
"Tourists, for you, tourists,"
Everything is pleasant and useful.
"Tourists, adventurers"
"Sea islands, buenavista."
"Let's say what this actually means, divide and conquer."
Divide and conquer says basically do the following: split the problem into several sub-problems of the same type.
"I'll come back in a second to help binary searches matches in that, but that's what we're going to do."
"For each of those sub-problems we're going to solve them independently, and then we're going to combine those solutions."
And it's called divide and conquer for the obvious reason.
I'm going to divide it up into sub-problems with the hope that those sub-problems get easier.
"It's going to be easier to conquer if you like, and then"
I'm going to merge them back.
"Now, in the binary search case, in some sense, this is a little bit trivial."
What was the divide?
The divide was breaking a big search up into half a search.
"We actually threw half of the list away and we kept dividing it down, until ultimately we got something of size one to search."
That's really easy.
"The combination was also sort of trivial in this case because the solution to the sub-problem was, in fact, the solution to the larger problem."
But there's the idea of divide and conquer.
I'm going to use exactly that same ideas to tackle sort.
"Again, I've got an unordered list of n elements."
I want to sort it into a obviously a sorted list.
And that particular algorithm is actually a really nice algorithm called merge sort.
And it's actually a fairly old algorithm.
It was invented in 1945 by John von Neumann one of the pioneers of computer science.
"And here's the idea behind merge sort, actually I'm going to back into it in a funny way."
Let's assume that I could somehow get to the stage where
I've got two sorted lists.
How much work do I have to do to actually merge them together?
So let me give you an example.
"Suppose I want to merge two lists, and they're sorted."
"Just to give you an example, here's one list, 3121724"
"Here's another list, 12430."
"I haven't said how I'm going to get those sorted lists, but imagine I had two sorted lists like that."
How hard is it to merge them?
"Well it's pretty easy, right?"
But it's done over that theme of blow the man down which is about violence and the threat of squalls and storms at sea.
"And the fact that, that carries from the deck onto the drawing of the line on the map."
Where that X is placed.
"Is a, is a very strong sense of, of foreboding."
"Something will go wrong, and then it brings us to the ship at night."
Now this scene is a straightforward exhibition scene.
It's interesting because the guy serving coffee seems to be really angry at the world.
But watch what happens after it's done.
Back to the ship at night.
"Now interesting, we don't need any voice over, all we need is the face of Finn, the sound of the wind, and the mysterium theme to come back to give us this feeling that something is a mess that all is not happy and easy on the surface, and that there are very, very deep and wrong things going on."
"And this is the, the secret of alludent film, that the atmosphere is always there undercutting even the easy placid moments."
You can never get rid of the monsters.
The monster or the monsteress.
"Now the sinister texture of sound all pays off in the climax of the film, which is quite troubling and disturbing, but beautifully, beautifully done."
"Now, the climax begins with something that we might expect, an orchestral score showing Stone's madness."
[music]
"And his voice over, we're finally getting subjective access to his character's psychology and now we all know this man is completely cracked."
"It's going to climax when he's going to go back to that sign that we saw in the very first scene where he met his junior officer and no longer can face this, we see the madness in the strictness of his authority here."
[music]
"Right, now that's the climax of the score for the moment."
It's going to drift down now.
And as he pulls that sabre off of his wall.
We've been wondering what would happen to that.
We cut away a little bit of exposition as the good guys.
We guess they're good guys.
They don't anything in the end.
They're wondering about the telegram and get this.
[music]
"Billy Radd, again starting his calypso."
[music]
"And it was quite a jaunty, happy number as we see."
[music]
But all three that you can tell are leveling off.
"We in Computer Sceience, about seven years ago, hit a ledge and it was a problem."
"We couldn "" t make the computers any faster."
"We couldn't make the frequency faster, we couldn't use more power, we couldn't make the computers as we thought we could."
They couldn't follow this exponential curve anymore.
"What happen was we were making too much heat, way too much heat."
And we'll get to that.
"But, we solved this problem by making multiple cores."
"If we have multiple cores, they could do multiple things at the same time and that's increase of speed the same way."
"And as you can see the Parallell, the"
Parallel Thread Performance has increased and while the Single Thread stays the same
Awesome.
"So, heat, computers have this 0's and 1's transistors,, and every time you change it, it wastes heat, and capacitors, we'll get to that later."
"But it wastes heat and you can see this graph that over time we had some hot ones, and cold ones and so far we've been able to cool them with heat sinks and fans."
Nothing too special.
"Around 2000, we started making really hot computers and back in 1995 [INAUDlBLE] was as hot as a hot plate."
"Loves this example, that if it's as hot as a hot plate, and you had an egg that size, you could fry the egg on your computer because it's that hot."
Wow.
Come on.
"So, computers have only gotten hotter."
They've actually gotten to the heat of a nuclear reactor.
"Of course it's not gigantic, it's just the size of a quarter."
But it makes as much heat as a nuclear reactor.
And soon we're actually even close to rocket nozzles and the sun's surface.
They're just going to get so hot.
"And we've made all kinds of cool cooling systems with hydration and water and air and just really crazy cooling systems, and we've found that we just can't keep this up."
There's no way about it.
"So it ws like a game of chicken, who's going to give up first, and around 2004, 2005, we gave up and we got to the heat of a nuclear reactor and after that we just gave up."
"We can't cool it anymore, So we just moved to multiple cores."
Cool.
So let's see why this actually helps.
Well having multiple cores actually makes it more power efficient.
The fact that scientists quantitative is a huge theme in the course.
We'll be focusing on operational definitions in the next couple of weeks.
You'll get to practice that later on in the course.
And organize skepticism is another big thing.
This'll really be a focus in week three.
But we'll start thinking about it now.
Welcome back.
We were in the midst of figuring out the Laplace transform of sine of at when I was running out of time.
This was the definition of the Laplace transform of sine of at.
I said that also equals y.
"This is going to be useful for us, since we're going to be doing integration by parts twice."
"So I did integration by parts once, then I did integration by parts twice."
"I said, you know, don't worry about the boundaries of the integral right now."
Let's just worry about the indefinite integral.
And then after we solve for y-- let's just say y is the indefinite version of this-- then we can evaluate the boundaries.
"And we got to this point, and we made the realization, after doing two integration by parts and being very careful not to hopefully make any careless mistakes, we realized, wow, this is our original y."
"If I put the boundaries here, that's the same thing as the"
"Laplace transform of sine of at, right?"
That's our original y.
"So now-- and I'll switch colors just avoid monotony-- this is equal to, actually, let me just-- this is y."
Right?
That was our original definition.
So let's add a squared over sine squared y to both sides of this.
"So this is equal to y plus-- I'm just adding this whole term to both sides of this equation-- plus a squared over s squared y is equal to-- so this term is now gone, so it's equal to this stuff."
And let's see if we can simplify this.
So let's factor out an e to the minus st.
"Actually, let's factor out a negative e to the minus st."
"So it's minus e to the minus st, times sine of-- well, let me just write 1 over s, sine of at, minus 1 over s squared, cosine of at."
I really hope I haven't made any careless mistakes.
"And so this, we can add the coefficient."
"So we get 1 plus a squared, over s squared, times y."
"[INAUDlBLE] just take the cost of the machine and estimate the amount of time we want, and then divide it?"
JON GRUBER:
Sure.
"No, and I'll cover that later."
"You could think of the rental-- if I bought the machine today and sold it tomorrow, that'd be like I rented it."
And this would be the cost difference between what I paid for it and what I'd sell it for.
"But it's just easier to think of it as the rental, because the flow measure-- like the wage-- is a flow measure."
"Now, in the short-run, capital is fixed."
"So in the short-run, our fixed costs are rk bar."
"That's our fixed cost, the rental rate times the fixed amount of capital in the short-run."
"And our variable costs are w times I, which is a function of q."
"That is, the more you produce the more labor you use in the short-run."
"So total costs in the short-run, short-run total costs, are rk bar plus wL of q. k is not a function of q because k's fixed in the short-run, but the amount of labor used is a function of how much you produce."
"This implies that the marginal cost, the key concept we want to work with, marginal cost, which is the derivative of total costs with respect to quantity."
"So dc dq is going to be equal to w-- or, let's do it in deltas, because we're not doing calculus here."
Delta c delta q is going to be w times delta I over delta q.
That's going to be the marginal cost.
The marginal cost-- so I'm just differentiating the total cost function-- is going to be the wage times delta I delta q.
"So the marginal cost of producing the next unit is going to be how much labor I have to produce to produce the next unit, times the wage I pay per unit of labor."
"Now, does anyone remember what we call this?"
"I know this wasn't on the exam last night, so you may not-- cast your mind back to the lecture on Monday."
Do you remember what we call delta I over delta q?
Anyone?
Bueller?
No?
It's the marginal product of labor.
Remember from Monday?
So this is the wage times the marginal product of labor.
So what we say is that the marginal cost is equal to the wage times the marginal--
I'm sorry the wage over.
"I'm sorry, it's one over."
That delta q does-- I was the marginal product.
"Now, of course, over time we worked harder and had more machines, so overall output in US economy grew much faster than 2.4% a year."
It grew more like 7-10% a year over that period.
"Yet, the point is that a lot of that we can get for free, essentially, without any harder work or any more capital."
"However, starting in 1973 until the early 1990s, productivity growth fell dramatically to 1% per year."
That is literally we lost 1 1/2% per year of stuff we were getting before.
"We were getting 2 1/2% a year up to '73, all of a sudden it's down to 1%."
That's 1 1/2% a year less stuff we can get unless we work harder to make up for it.
Why did this happen?
"Well, we don't exactly know, but there's two good candidates."
"We know the two candidates, we just don't know the right proportions."
One is that we have less capital in our society because savings fell.
The amount of savings US households do fell dramatically.
And the US has a very low savings rate.
The US savings rate over this period averaged about 3%.
"That is, every dollar we earned we saved about 3% as a society."
"Compared to countries like Japan, where it's more like 20%."
Every dollar they earn they save about 20%.
Now why does that matter?
"Well, we'll talk about this later in the course, but essentially the amount we save determines the amount of capital we have in society."
"Because essentially, where do firms get the money to build machines?"
They get it by borrowing from households who save.
And the
"less we save, the less money there is that firms could invest in building machines."
And we'll talk about that at length later in the semester.
"But the bottom line is, the more we save as a country, the more money we have available, the more firms can take that money and build machines that improve our standard of living."
"And that saving fell a lot, and that's one reason."
And the other reason is that productivity fell for reasons we don't quite understand.
"We know that productivity slowed down, but we don't quite understand why that is."
"But then in the 1990s, productivity shot up again."
"So productivity went back up towards our historic levels, from 1% back up to over 2% a year."
Why is that?
"Well, it's unclear, but we think it's basically the IT revolution."
So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.
And here you can see the body actor.
"And then this is what we called the ""dead head,"" no reference to Jerry Garcia."
And then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance.
"And then, again, the final shot."
It was a long process.
(Applause)
"The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this, because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides."
We had to create a lighting system.
"So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that we could put Ben's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world."
We also had to create an eye system.
"We found the old adage, you know,"
"""The eyes are the window to the soul,"" absolutely true."
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.
"And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity, and feel his intent coming through the eyes, then we would succeed."
So we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years.
We also had to create a mouth system.
We worked from dental molds of Brad.
We had to age the teeth over time.
We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.
There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.
We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.
He was very popular.
Skin displacement: another big deal.
The skin had to be absolutely accurate.
"He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home around other old people, so he had to look exactly the same as the others."
"So, lots of work on skin deformation, you can see in some of these cases it works, in some cases it looks bad."
"This is a very, very, very early test in our process."
"So, effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face."
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance.
"There was something that we encountered, though, that we ended up calling ""the digital Botox effect."""
"So, as things went through this process,"
Double recombinents are always the rarest class.
In this case the rarest class will be these right here.
"Now, when we look at this, which two of these genes are in the same phase and what's the third one that is in different phase."
Relative to the parents.
Here are the parentals.
And we can confirm that is actually the parental phase because that is most common.
"When we look over here, the rarest two have c been coming from the other chromosome, where's the capitals are together, just as they should be so, the little m, little b, big m, big c is necessarily the double recombinant, so it must have had something like this to come to double recombination event."
So the order must be B.
"A, C, B. So C is in fact in the middle."
"Now, what we can do, from those numbers you saw."
And you can do this for practice if you want.
You can go back and actually and calculate the recombination fractions.
The recombination between A and C is only 0.8 centimorgans.
"Or if you calculated it, directly it's 0.008."
Between C and B is 15.1% recombination or 15.1 centimorgans.
So we can infer from this since A was at 11P fifteen.
"Six, B is at 11P 12.3, C is probably at or near 11P 15.5."
"In fact, this gene is actually well known to be at 11P 15.5."
It actually has already been mapped and identified.
Now lemme conclude this video by just recapping one very important point.
Goal of genetic mapping is to localize alleles and genes that cause disease.
"What you're trying to do is you're trying to find, where is that unique allele,"
"like, which gene has it."
"Cuz again, genes don't come labeled."
"Even when you have the full human genome sequence, the genes do not come labeled."
Some markers will be associated with disease.
"And those ones that show that strong association where alleles at those markers, the gene attacked at that was the markers will, will be associated with whether or not you have disease, or will predict whether or not you have disease."
Those are ones that will be near the disease-causing gene.
Okay?
Some markers will not be associated.
It will be very weakly associated with it.
And those are the ones are that are likely far away from the disease causing.
"To find the median, or middle, begin by crossing out the least and the greatest  numbers in the set until you reach the middle."
The median of this data set is three.
Now let's review finding the mean.
Here's the same graph again.
"To find the mean, we need to add each of the values together and divide by how many numbers are in the set."
"The numbers total seventy, and we divide by fifteen because there are fifteen data points."
"So, the mean is approximately four and seven-tenths."
That squiggly equal sign means approximately.
"A common mistake that students make  is confusing the mean, median, and mode because they all begin with the letter ""M"" and they do sound a lot alike."
"One way to remember is that the median is the middle,  like the median of a highway."
"The mode is the most,  they sound alike."
"And mean, or average, is the meanest because it requires the most calculation."
Let's look at this graph again.
"We decided earlier that the mode was two, so let's put a line here."
We decided the median was three; we'll put a line here.
And the mean was approximately four and seven-tenths.
These three lines show where the three measures lie within the data.
Which of these looks like the best way to describe the data?
"In this case we have an outlier, or a number that is much less or much greater  than most of the other responses."
"One student read twenty one books, and that's great, but it makes our mean much higher than it would be otherwise."
"The mean is probably not the best measure here because only four students read more books than the mean of four and seven-tenths, while eleven students read fewer."
"On the other hand, the mode of two was the most common answer but does it reflect the data set as a whole?"
Probably the median would be the best measure here.
Let's look at another data set.
Students were asked their favorite number from one to ten.
There were four different answers that all got two votes.
"So, the mode is one, four, five, and nine."
"In any data set there can be a single mode,  many modes (like there are here), or even no mode."
This is why the mode is not used very often to describe data sets.
"When we find and measure a center, we want to use a single number to describe the data."
"So, the mode here is not good."
Let's find the median by crossing out the least  and the greatest until we find the middle.
URLs.
These URLs were created by things like different types of navigation.
"So Googlebot, in terms of crawling your site, doesn't just look at, say, 200 unique URLs."
"But actually has to determine which URLs to crawl of the 380,000 that were created."
You can see how
Googlebot might want to be more efficient in crawling by looking at these two URLs.
"Now, the first one says, ""category equals YouTube."" Let's say that URL to 20 unique items on the page."
"But on the second URL, it's ""category equals YouTube and size equals medium."" So it's the exact same items."
"But now just say, filtered down to five."
"Because of the ""size equals medium"" parameter."
So in this way Google would rather just crawl the first URL and reach all 20 of the items.
Rather than crawling both URLs and seeing a redundant five items.
"Essentially, with your input in URL parameters, it helps us to understand your site better."
So we can crawl more efficiently.
"By crawling more efficiently, we don't crawl as many duplicates."
And that will save you bandwidth.
And helps us to focus on your unique content.
Rather than crawling the duplicate of information repeatedly.
"But if you want URLs removed, you can go to URL Removals in Webmaster Tools."
"Again, the URL parameters feature is to crawl more efficiently."
It's not about removals or explicit robots.txt disallowing.
Another background piece of information that I'd like to mention is that page-level markup is still taken into consideration in tandem with URL parameters.
So if you have page-level markup.
"Like rel, ""canonical"", or rel, ""next"" ""prev"", or rel, ""hreflang"", that's fine and can still be used by Google."
Even if you are using URL parameters.
Just make sure that we can still crawl your page.
Meaning that it's not robots.txt disallowed.
Or you haven't set it to not be crawled in URL parameters.
"As long as we can crawl your page, we can still use the page-level markup."
"Since we've covered the background information, let's now talk about the types of URLs that are eligible for this feature."
Here's one from the Google store.
"It says, ""category equals office."" Other URLs would be things like ""category equals wearables"" or ""category equals wearables and size equals medium."""
Strong force.
All right.
"The weak and the strong forces here, these are intranuclear forces within the nucleus."
That's what keeps the protons and neutrons and the quarks together.
"For the most part, the weak and the strong force don't have an effect in chemistry, with the exception for beta decay, for some radioactive elements."
"That's where you need to think about, in particular, the weak force."
"Gravity also -- Well, gravity actually has no known consequence for chemistry."
"It doesn't mean that there isn't one, but it has no known consequence for chemistry."
"All of chemistry is tied up in this force, the electromagnetic force."
"Now, what I am going to do is I am going to simplify it just a little bit and just call this the Coulomb force."
And why I am going to do that is going to be a little more obvious when you get to 8.02.
But I am going to call it the Coulomb interaction.
And we know what the Coulomb force law looks like.
The Coulomb force law is the following.
"Say I have a positive charge, which is my nucleus."
I am going to call that force plus e.
"And at some distance R, R is the distance now, between that nucleus and the negatively charged particle, which is my electron."
I can describe the force of attraction between this electron in the nucleus by the following expression.
"That force, which is a function of the distance between the two charges, is just the magnitude of the charge on the negatively charged particle times the magnitude on the positively charged particle over 4 pi epsilon nought r squared."
"Now, I am going to treat this force, just for simplicity purposes right now, as a scalar."
"I am not going to talk about the direction, but because this is a force between a positive and negative charge, this is an attractive force."
This epsilon down here is the permittivity of the vacuum.
It is in there for doing our unit conversion correctly.
That is all I will say about it.
Maybe you will talk a little bit more about it in 8.02.
"And then, finally, here is the r squared."
That is the important part.
That is the distance between the electron and the nucleus.
And what I want you to notice here-- I don't need the screen down yet.
Hello.
She just switched it?
"Oh, all right."
People fixed this with something called Time Division Multiplexing and there are
"lots of different algorithms for how to do this but the idea is that the computer is so fast it can jump, it can spend some time on one thread, jump to the second, jump to the third, and then come back to the fourth and as the user we don't see the difference."
"That said, eh, yeah."
And this multithreading has been around for decades too because we can do this.
"Okay, so there are some issues with using parallel programing."
In parallel programing when you write parallel programing you run into a lot more troubles than just writing serial code.
What kinds of troubles?
"Well first thing, you have to think how to divide the problem up so that you can run it in parallel because some, some problems aren't as easy."
"It's called embarrassingly parallelized, like I said the list of 100 that you just send 50 this way and send 50 the other way."
Some problems just aren't that easy to parallelize.
Some problems can't be parallelized.
"And then you have to, there's time to hand out work to different workers."
"Eh, what does this mean?"
"We want, need to send the data around between the different cores."
"All the workers, each computer doesn't always work as fast."
Especially when you work in cluster and cloud computing.
"Each computer, some computers die, some computers are slower, some computers fail."
It happens.
You have to deal with it.
"Eh, there may be contention for shared resources."
"If you try to use the list you can't be changing it all the time because you might get problems, and we'll talk about that in five minutes."
Workers could be overwriting each others answers.
That's the idea.
"You have to wait for the last, slowest worker to come back."
And this is the weakest link.
And there's time to put the data together after you've done all the parallel parts.
"Specifically, in lab this week we're going to have a compitition."
"Ooo, fun."
We're going to see how fast you guys can sort a shuffled deck of cards.
We'll have a classwide compitition and you'll actually tackle all these problems.
"So let's say, time to hand out small work"" units"" to workers, you have to maybe pass out cards between each other."
Some of you sort slower than others and we'll see how it works.
"And he has realized that, as a doctor, he has no business being around a mother when she is giving birth."
So he gave up.
Eating fish is not a medical issue.
"However, when a fish bone gets stuck in my throat, then it can become a medical issue."
"By the same token, it's very important that we don't consider a mother who is giving birth to be ill."
The same way I'm not ill when I'm eating a fish.
Psychiatry and obstetrics are two of the most insane fields within the world of medicine.
"All of us and all doctors were once born, so doctors have their traumas."
"And somewhere it's about 'why should children enter life easier, happier and more loved, than I did when I was born?'"
In a way it's about jealousy too.
"'If it was hard for me, why should I make it easier for these children?'"
"It may sound strange, but I'm absolutely certain that it is part of the deal too."
Semmelweis had scientific results.
He didn't have a microscope.
"He didn't see bacteria, he couldn't prove his case, but the patients of those doctors who had washed their hands didn't die."
He saw things very clearly.
"When he felt doctors were the cause of childbed fever, that they became murderers unknowingly with their own unwashed hands as they assisted with births right after performing autopsies He saw it, he knew it."
"But when he mentioned it, he got expelled."
Doctors couldn't dare to imagine and acknowledge that for long years they had been hurting and killing women.
Semmelweis wrote a letter that breaks one's heart when reading it
"He wrote a letter, in which he was begging doctors to stop the old process immediately and he was asking them not to push this opportunity aside just so they wouldn't have to feel guilty."
"This regime, this mentality causes fear."
"Love is a virus when it spreads, but fear is also a virus."
It is a terrible virus.
"I would recommend obstetricians that they stand up immediately, today and say something."
I don't understand what they are waiting for.
What are they risking?
Is it that they would all be expelled with their licenses revoked?
"Agi's colleagues, obstetricians, experts"
Why are they silent?
What are they waiting for?
"Are they waiting for Agi and a few other brave obstetricians to be punished, and then ten years from now they will find their voices?"
"Still, I think it's important to go to the hospital and get the diagnosis, for a record."
"Ah, for a record."
Right.
"Even if you think the diagnosis is off the mark, the fact that it's off the mark may later serve as an evidence of some kind."
The diagnosis can prove that a symptom similar to it did happen to you.
So I think you should go to the hospital.
I see.
But I hear many mothers have had bad experiences with doctors.
That's true.
"I know doctors have said various things to mothers, such as ""overreacting,"" ""too nervous,"" or ""that may be pollen allergy."""
But this is something Japanese doctors should learn as well from now on.
"We, too, often had bad experiences with doctors in Chernobyl."
"When they hear the words ""radiation exposure,"" they only think of cancers or leukemia."
"However, the health problems of children living in the contaminated areas are relatively minor and cannot be diagnosed."
"They have a whole range of such symptoms, which is called ""a bouquet of symptoms."""
The Japanese doctors who went to Chernobyl as part of the relief effort didn't examine such children.
They only treated children with more serious diseases.
"But you know, the children who got cancer is just the tip of an iceberg."
"Under the tip, there are innumerable children who have such minor symptoms as, say, fatigue."
Fatigue is a typical symptom of thyroid disorder.
Or eye swelling.
I frequently heard from mothers their children suffered from eye swelling after they fell in the contaminated places.
I hear there's a similar case recently.
Yes.
I often hear the story of how children fell in a sandpit with high radiation and their eyes get swollen the next day.
Sometimes swollen in purple.
"Also, quite a few people claim that bruises have appeared, or that moles have appeared or disappeared, which seem to have nothing to do with stress or physical conditions."
Some women claim the menstrual period has stopped or the menstrual cycle is irregular.
Others are saying their allergy has gotten worse.
Or their diseases have recurred.
These are the symptoms I noticed when looking at the emails.
"Another problem right now is people are eating contaminated food, because the Japanese radiation safety limit for food was raised."
"So given that this is theta and this is 90 - theta, what is our angle going to be?"
"Well they all, collectively, add up to 180 degrees."
So you have theta + (90-theta) + our mystery angle is going to be equal to 180 degrees.
"The thetas cancel out (theta - theta), and you have 90 + our mystery angle is a 180 degrees,"
We subtract 90 from both sides.) - and you are left with your mystery angle equalling 90 degrees.
So that all worked out well.
So let me make that clear.
That's going to be useful for us.
So now we can say definitively that this is 90 degrees.
This is a right angle.
"Now what we are going to do, is we are going to construct a trapezoid."
"This side 'a' is parallel to side 'b' down here the way its been constructed and this is just one side right over here, this goes straight up and now let's just connect these two sides right over there."
So there's a couple of ways to think about the area of this trapezoid.
"One is we can just think of it as a trapezoid and come up with its area,"
And then we could think about it as the sum of the areas of its components.
So let's just first think of it as trapezoid.
"So, what do we know about the area of the trapezoid?"
"The area of a trapezoid,is gonna be the height of the trapezoid, which is (a+b) times, the way I think of it, the mean or average of the top and the bottom."
"So, ar(trapezoid) = (a+b) x 1/2(a+b)"
"In the intuition there you are taking the height times the average of the bottom and the top, gives you the area of the trapezoid."
"Now, how can we also figure out the area with its component parts?"
"So as far as we do the correct things, we should come up with the same result. so how else can we come up with this area?"
"Well, we could say it's the area of the two right triangles."
The area of each of them is one half of a times b.
"But there's two of them, Let me do that say in blue colour,"
"But there's two of these right triangles, so let's multiply them by two."
"So 2 times half ab, that takes into consideration this bottom right triangle, and this top one. and what's the area of this large one, that I'll colour in green"
"Well that's pretty straightforward, it's just one half c times c."
"So, plus one half c times c, which is one half c square."
"Now , let's simplify this thing and see what we come up with and you might guess where all of this is going."
"So, we can rearrange this."
"So this one half times (a+b) squared is going to be equal to two times one half, well that's just going to be one, so its gonna be equal to a times b plus one half c squared."
"If they're not equal, then you have too much of one and not enough of the other."
"So basically, what we can do is we can solve in this example-- in this example, we could say the marginal product of labor is 1/2 k over the square root of k times l."
The marginal product of capital from this production function is-- once again I'm using this production function q equals square root of k times l.
Marginal project of capital is 1/2 I over square root of k times l.
So the ratio of the marginal products is simply k over l.
"The marginal rate of technical substitution, given this production function, is k over l."
That's the marginal rate of technical substitution.
"So this says that given this production function and these prices, at the optimum you should set k over I equal to w over r, which equals 1/2."
"So what this says is given this production function, these price ratios, the optimal thing to do is to use half as much capital as labor."
"Half as much capital as labor is the optimal thing to do, and that's what we see in figure 9-2, is the optimal thing to do is use half as much capital as labor."
"Now, in other words, let's say, to now develop the intuition."
"Imagine you told me no, I should use as much capital as"
I should use labor.
As much capital as I should use labor.
Imagine I told you that.
"Imagine I said no, in fact, the efficient thing to use is why not have one machine for every worker?"
How would you tell me intuitively why that's wrong?
Why would I be wrong to say use one machine for every worker?
"Why would that be wrong, given the prices prevailing in the market?"
Someone can tell me this.
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
"Well, renting machines is a lot more expensive than paying more workers."
JON GRUBER:
Twice as expensive to rent a machine as get a worker.
AUDlENCE:
So it would be more cost-effective to have the workers share machines rather than get a whole new machine.
JON GRUBER:
"The key point is the machine costs twice as much, but the machine doesn't do twice as much."
The machine and the worker do the same thing.
The marginal rate of technical substitution is one.
"You're indifferent between one more machine and one more worker, but the machine cost twice as much as the worker."
"Well, it turns out that a lot of us forgot somewhere along the line that are actually all of knowledge is connected."
"When you hear someone remarkable, whoever they are, share something of their passion or what they do, not only you're inspired by them personally, but you start to see connections that you didn't see before between what you do and what they do, or someone else does."
"So, we spend our lives digging these trenches."
"That's we get really good at one thing, and that's where we live, that's where we're focused."
"TED is the moment when you come out of your trench, and you ascend up a slope, and you see how what you do connects with whatever else does."
It can be really eye-opening and thrilling.
It can fill you with a new sense of possibility.
"So in, let's see, 11 years ago, I was certainly digging my own trench."
"I was trying to build this technology publishing company, magazines, websites."
I was in it deep.
"This was the year, I first went to TED."
I was smitten.
"You know, I'd always thought of myself  as this slightly ""Odd Man Out."""
"Like I always struggled to make conversations about house and God and family gossip, movies, celebrity, and all the things I think normal people talk about, do they?"
(Laughter) (Audience) We don't know.
CA :
(Laughing) 'We don't know'.
That was a great comment!
"At TED, I found myself surrounded by this motley crew of geeks, sort of passionate entrepreneurs, inventors, creators."
"Really, they didn't have a whole lot in common except that they were all very curious, they were all absolutely eager or willing to talk out-of-the-box ideas and to engage in conversations that depending on your view point, rather a little bit crazy or might turn out to be really important."
"I loved it, I thought I'd come home."
"And, the media entrepreneur in me noticed something as well."
"So, media were obsessed with this."
Attention is a currency.
"We measure it in lots of different ways: we measure eye balls, how many are there, ratings, circulation, and so forth."
"We also look at demographics, who owns those eye balls."
Bill Gates is worth more than Billy Blogs.
"And, there is a third measure of attention that is much harder to measure."
"So, we don't often talk about it."
We should because it is the most important of the three.
It's the measure of thequality of attention.
Is it focused or casual?
Congratulations.
You've finally gotten through the discussion about the different parameters and the desired Googlebot behavior.
And now you can go back to your site and repeat this process for the different parameters that you have.
You don't have to do this for every single parameter.
"But just including a few, and specifying the right Googlebot behavior can really help with your crawl efficiency."
We're almost done.
But you might be asking one last question.
"Which is, ""What about multiple parameters in one URL?"" For example, ""sku equals 234 page equals three and sort by equals price"" etcetera."
How does URL parameters work when there are multiple parameter settings?
The answer is to remember that URL parameters is about crawling your site more efficiently.
So you can imagine that all URLs that we know about for your site.
"So if you're the Google store, all 380,000 URLS begin as eligible for crawling."
And then we work as a process of elimination.
Not inclusion.
So we take our knowledge of your site.
Combined by each of your settings in URL parameters to slowly weed away the URLs that shouldn't be crawled.
"Until at the very end, we have a smaller subset of good URLs."
To recap.
"If you're now more comfortable with the URL Parameters, please utilize this feature for more efficient crawling of your site."
You can start with specifying the parameters that do not change page content.
Those should be easier to do.
"And then after you have done that step, the next step is to specify parameters that change the page content."
"And remember, if you can't determine, don't guess."
"Please ""let Googlebot decide."""
"One more time, the sorts parameter."
"If the sorts parameter for your site never exists in a URL by default, then ""Crawl No URLs."""
"Or if site-wide, the same sort value is always used, then ""Crawl URLs with value x."" For ""Narrows"" if your ""narrows"" parameter causes non-useful filtering for searchers, like size or price, then you might select ""Crawl No"
"URLs."" Just be sure to double-check that none of your important pages will be affected."
"For ""specifies"" it's usually ""Crawl Every URL."" And the same applies to ""Translates"" and ""Paginates."""
Yay!
I think we've covered a lot of information about URL parameters.
Here are links to more resources if you want further help.
"There's some science behind it, but it's within a range of what we have historically done."
"We have looked at other properties that have a lot of page views, and much of the social networking things, for example."
And they don't monetize that well.
And they don't monetize nearly as well as text search.
"So we're unlikely to do major changes there, although we're trying a few things."
"The next--another way of asking your question is, where is the next source of revenue?"
"And the next source of revenue is the current business functioning better with better conversion, more traffic, more advertisers, which is our core business."
"The next, and adjacent, business, is a set of display businesses and an exchange that are being built as a consequence of the Double Click acquisition."
The display business is as large as the text search business.
It's relatively balkanized??
(30:39).
It's not a uniform in any particular way.
"The systems are complicated, the way the display ads are managed, is done, in many cases, by hand or by poor quality spreadsheets."
"So we see an opportunity to apply the Google magic, you know, the measurement and the scaling, in that business."
And that's probably the next big one. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Any other questions?
"Yep, right here."
We'll move beyond the first three rows at some point. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
Thank you.
I wanted to get your thoughts on Twitter.
"There's been a lot of discussion there that potentially it evolves as a real time search engine, and in an un-Google-like way, you haven't really responded with any sort of application or product there, outside of, maybe, Blogger."
How do you foresee that product in the next few years?
And is that a potential or a threat for Google? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
We're in favor of all of these new communications mechanisms.
Google just put up a Google Twitter site.
Google can tweet to you.
It's called At Google.
And so you can go ahead and listen to our ruminations as to where we are and what we're doing in 160 characters or
less.
"Speaking as a computer scientist, I view all of these as, sort of, poor man's email systems."
"In other words, they have aspects of an email system, but they don't have a full offering."
"So, to me the question about companies like Twitter is, do they fundamentally involve as sort of â€˜note' phenomena?"
What about a?
"Well, this one is big A, little A, and almost all healthy."
"This one's also a, big A, little A, and almost all healthy."
"This one's a, a and all diseased."
"This one's a, a and almost all diseased."
"So clearly in this case, A, the genotype at the A marker, is more predictive of whether you have the disease, than, than the genotype at the B marker."
"So we can assume that A is probably closer to this, disease causing [inaudible]."
And we haven't said whether it's between A and B or not.
"It could be in that little area above A, as I said before."
All we can do if and this is assumption if this is a simple genetic trait that is fully explained by a single gene having a very large effect.
"What we can do is we can split this section up, this whole section over here and just infer what's going on at the disease causing mutation."
So we are saying these ones are healthy and this one is diseased.
"Or if you only get the disease when you have the mutation then this one must necessarily be little C and little C. And this one over here, must necessary be big C, little c, right?"
"Because these ones are carriers, they're healthy, these ones are diseased."
"So, let's break that up."
"Again, we have another gene causing disease, so we're just splitting this row up."
"So we're taking this original problem that we were looking at two markers and basically now looking at three, the third being what we're inferring to be happening at the disease-causing gene."
"I split this up relative to disease status, and that was it."
"So what we can do is we can split up all these other ones, like this one right here."
"These ones, necessarily are there aren't any."
These ones would be and we can continue the same process that I just did.
So I just broke up everything here.
From the previous slide into this set of individuals.
"And again, we're assuming all big C little C are healthy."
"They're carriers of the disease but they do not exhibit, actually exhibit the disease."
"And little C little C in this case are, are, are all healthy.'Kay?"
"So, without doing any math."
"Without doing any math at all, I want you to tell me the order of the genes here."
"Is the c of disease causing mutation between a and b, is it off past b, or is it off past a?"
It's very simple.
What you do in this case is you just try to figure out which one is the double recombinant.
And from that and since you know the phase you can figure out which one is in the middle.
But the rest of them I just make on the fly because they usually don't have any data in them.
- Also Wonder Helper functions.
- Wonder Helper functions?
- Nice.
Just a couple of quick examples on how to write very simple formatters.
This one here just takes an NSArray and puts it with a bunch of page breaks between it.
"You can easily deal with a little WORepetition and a string, but then you've got another component with a WORepetition and String or you've got part of your component that is less reusable than it could be because it's inside of it."
"That ""return buffer.append"" in the format command is the entire implementation of the formatter, and it's not particularly difficult."
We're not going to bother parsing this so I just throw an exception.
"But, those are the only two methods you actually have to implement to make a formatter."
"If you're doing output only, it can be as simple as one line long."
A little bit more complex example.
This one here converts between separators in a string.
"I'm working on a system now as a bunch of legacy stuff, and some things are comma separated and some things are tab separated."
I use a formatter to move things back and forth.
"You can also do the same thing if you've got a string of text that somebody's typed in a text box and you want to format it out in HTML to keep the page breaks, it'll do that."
"If you've got a bunch of HTML like from an XML file or something and you want to convert it back into a paragraph, it'll do that."
"Again, there's really only two lines in it that do anything."
"The format one just does, just calls a replace along the string from the internal to the external."
The parsing just changes it backwards.
That's all you need to do.
"The only thing special, if you notice the first line in the parsed object, it was position set indexed string length."
You just have to set it to something.
"If you leave it at zero, Java will throw an exception for you."
"Just set it at something, keep Java happy."
There you go.
"Formats and parses, there's only really two lines of code."
"If you start using them, you'll find all kinds of places you can use them."
I like them a lot.
No comments?
- Position set index can be or even important if you're chaining format is to give one inside the other because you don't know where you're starting and ending in the paths for the next one.
"- Yes, but usually I try to keep them fairly simple."
"Now here, you can use their attention to see your ad and take some action."
"Of course you need the human resources, the people, the talent to do that."
- It mostly depends on brains.
You don't need to build or to invest heavily in factories.
"- It could be an area where Portugal could invest in, and make a large return, without needing a very big investment in machines."
"- From the early stages, we decided to divide the company in business teams, without departments."
"There is no department of design, or department of development, ... all that stuff."
"All the teams are businessteams that have business people and technical people together, working for the same purpose and for the same team."
"So all you see around our office, is businessteams of 12-15 people maximum, working together in a circle shape."
So everyone works together.
- We got a digital label to work with us and we'll be on a compilation that has different bands from all over the world that play garage rock.
And we were selected to represent Portugal.
- My day job is in school.
I teach Portuguese to foreign learners.
- I'm a designer ... ... of machines.
- I'm an architect.
"- Wel, when I'm not playing in a band, I like to be a photographer."
- Portuguese are people with a high degree of imagination and a high degree of flexibility.
"Both of these aspects have helped us in building a good IT system, adapting it to the needs of our customers."
"- Centre of innovation, of technology."
"It's the centre of tradition, of history, of modernity, of wonderful people. of good food, of good weather."
Everything!
"Oh, Lisbon, it's one of the favourite cities for having international congresses."
So we are at the top.
"- So we're in a group, and there are several other companies there as well, tourism-connected or communication, and event-makers."
So it's all a big synergy of competences.
"It's easy, when you know what you're doing."
"And if you have time enough in advance to prepare all the details, because it's a business built on details."
"And to be prepared for all kinds of ""unexpected""."
So if you are already prepared for what you know is going to happen then you also have time and availabiity to take care of those things that you don't know.
"It's fingerspitzengefuhl, yes, that's for sure."
"This specific congress, as is the case for most of them, is marketed primarily through the website."
I pay nothing.
If there was some initial membership charge then maybe we would add that membership charge and you would pay the monthly fee after that.
"But here this looks about right, that the dollars paid is equal to 40 times the time in months."
The time in months is the independent variable.
"It drives the dependent variable, the number of dollars you pay."
"So these are turkeys, and this is electrified also."
This is space age stuff.
There's a little stainless steel filament.
See it running through the horizontals?
"These, the verticals, are dead."
The horizontals carry the spark.
This is really a major breakthrough in pastured farming.
"This poultry net material, we get ours from"
"Premier in Iowa, it's only been around for about 20 years and it took computer chips to be able to shorten the spark length down to 4 thousands of a second, to get the resistance"
load low enough so it wouldn't melt the polyethylene.
"So this is why I say, I am not a [indistinguishable] by any stretch, we embrace technology."
"But it's cool that this netting comes in a 150 foot roll, weighs 12 pounds, one person can take it up and put it down in 10 minutes, and it keeps out bears, coyotes, wolves, possums, skunks, racoons, and keeps the turkeys and chickens in, and all those predators out."
Who would have guessed that you could have that eighty years ago.
I noticed that there's no covering
like we see with the chickens.
"Is it because at this stage, at their size, the aerial predators don't become an issue."
"Exactly, at this point the aerial predators are not an issue."
"The group over there is three weeks younger, than this group here, this group is eleven weeks old, that group over there is eight weeks old."
Are they getting ready to harvest?
"No, they'll go to sixteen weeks."
"Again, what keeps us awake at night is trying to figure out how to scale these things, and all that."
"So this is a ""gobbledy go"", this is the latest ideology of a portable turkey structure."
"This thing is 32 feet long, 12 feet wide, these are roosts here."
"But the thing to notice is, they're just lodged boards."
So these purlins up here are just lodged.
"The point is that in five minutes you can pop all these off, pop the purlins off, fold up the shade cloth, now you're down to just eight feet, hook up to a pick up truck, and you drive down the road at 55 miles an hour."
And why do you have these in here for?
"And it's not like a rule book as much as guidelines so you can understand, this is why this will make your application better as you follow these various guidelines."
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
It's some kind of another instance of
line stuff up.
Don't reinvent a new way to do a list unless there's a really good reason to.
"Unless it really changes the character of your thing and there's a purpose, there's no reason to invent a new kind of scroll bar."
AUDlENCE:
"For the Android design style guideline, I was wondering what you guys foresee in terms of how its evolution is going to be over time, especially with phone devices, mobile devices."
"The screen size is getting larger, and a lot of times"
"I've heard that you want to keep things closer to your thumb, but with things like the Action Bar Menu and the"
"Overflow Menu, it's so far away on a large device that you no longer have the ability to easily do single hand actions."
ALEX FAABORG:
Yeah.
"Well, on large devices you have the radius of thumbs on the edges."
You want to definitely think about that.
"And the style guide, it's evolving as fast as the ecosystem and the devices are."
"We're constantly pushing out updates, considering new patterns, things like that."
So it's not like this sort of fixed thing that everyone has to adhere to as much as a kind of organic living document as we all collectively learn more.
AUDlENCE:
Thank you for the phone number slide.
I really like that.
It reminded me of one of the horrible failures of iTunes that I've just been annoyed by.
"If you have a date, and you format it with four numbers, a dash, two numbers, a dash, and two numbers more, that should be in ISO format for year, month, day, and no other order."
If you're having sort of the other random orders that some
"locales like, then use the slashes or whatever is sort of standardized for that."
And it helps users so much.
ALEX FAABORG:
"Yeah and especially thinking about your users, because you're going to have your own date format that you're familiar with, but knowing who you're designing for is really important."
AUDlENCE:
I do have a question this time.
Can you talk about tools a little bit?
"I mean, Photoshop is the obvious one, but what other tools can you talk about?"
"Alternatively if you only have one copy, we, if you're heterozygous we refer to you as a carrier."
"That means that you probably had a parent that had the disease for example, not necessarily but you probably did."
"Now let's imagine you're, you're serving a"
"lot of families and you have multiple cases of carriers, these individuals that we know are heterozygous for the disease, having kids with affected individuals."
When I say affected individuals I mean ones who actually have the disease.
"So you're crossing somebody heterozygous for the disease, the carrier, with somebody homozygous for the disease."
So this is again just like the test cross we did before.
Well lets say you have the gene attached for the parents and for the offspring.
But you don't know what the gene is causing the disease.
This is a very important point.
You do not know what or where the gene is causing the disease.
When I say you have the gene attached to the parents and offspring I mean you have their genes attached for a bunch of genetic markers.
You don't know where among those markers the disease-causing gene is.
"So let's, let's focus on two genetic markers on chromosome eleven."
"Let's say that you've already, from something else you already have some idea that, that this disease is caused by mutation on chromosome eleven."
Which actually is true by the way for sickle cell anemia.
Let's say you have two markers.
Let's say the A marker is at this point.
There's a picture of chromosome 11's chromosome Let's say the A marker is that this location.
I just made this location up.
Don't worry about that.
Let's say big A big A might be an individual's homozygous for the letter C for the nucleotides C in that position.
Big A little A has T at one copy and C at one copy.
Little A little A has T at both copies.
"This is, this is irrelevant."
I just wanted to give you some idea what I mean when I'm saying these snip markers and big A and little A. So this something just to make it more real in the context of a DNA sequence.
The important thing is that A is over here on a chromosome and B in contrast a little bit lower down on the chromosome.
So what are we trying to do?
We're trying to see is the gene causing
Sickle Cell Anemia between A and B?
Is it down below B or is it at that little area above A?
That's what we're trying to figure out.
"So everybody is being slowly poisoning, with artificial coloring, artificial tastes, artificial flavoring."
Nothing will be artificial.
Everything in the future will be organically grown.
"The Venus Project calls for building cities in the sea, which would include research and learning centers dedicated to bettering the ecological conditions in our oceans."
We do have cities in the sea of many different designs.
The purpose of the city in the sea is an university at sea.
"It's to train marine scientists, marine biologists, and what they do is they restore the reefs, restore the damage."
The cities in the sea have units out away from the city.
It's called a wedge.
"It's made of concrete, and it's got cells in it."
And the concrete is towed out and mounted about a mile in front of an island.
"So, if a tsunami occurs, the waves are parted a mile out in heavy seas, you understand?"
That is how we deal with tsunamis.
Earthquakes are generally based upon pressures in the Earth that build up over time.
We will have sensors.
We can dig holes six miles deep today with mining equipment.
We could put sensors deep in the Earth that can let us know well in advance when the pressure build-up is occuring.
How much will it cost?
We don't have that problem in the future.
Do we have the resources to do it?
"Yes we do, and that is all that counts."
"The Venus Project's headquarters is located in a pristine area of south central Florida, USA, on a 9 hectare parcel of land."
The site features a research center and a number of other buildings designed by Mr. Fresco and Ms. Meadows.
"Within the structures are housed many models, illustrations, blueprints, and exhibits related to The Venus Project."
"The center runs informational workshops for the public, where participants are able to discuss Jacque Fresco's ideas face-to-face with him."
There will be many different types of buildings in the future.
Different people with different interests will want to select different types of buildings.
"But in most instances, most of the buildings are curvilinear."
They have curves or bent lines.
And that makes the building much stronger and uses far less material.
"So there would be lots of deck space on buildings so that people can relax, as you notice all the deck space on these buildings."
But people will pick a building that suits their profession and their interests.
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.
We basically put something together to get through the meeting.
I'll roll that for you now.
This was the first test for Benjamin Button.
"And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head -- pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor."
And it worked.
And it gave the studio great relief.
"After many years of starts and stops on this project, and making that tough decision, they finally decided to greenlight the movie."
"And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us, to say the movie was a go,"
I actually threw up.
(Laughter)
"You know, this is some tough stuff."
"So we started to have early team meetings, and we got everybody together, and it was really more like therapy in the beginning, convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this."
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.
"And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem."
(Laughter)
So we had a big problem: we didn't know how we were going to do this.
But we did know one thing.
"Being from the visual effects industry, we, with David, believed that we now had enough time, enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money."
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.
"So, when you're faced with something like that, of course you've got to break it down."
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that.
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.
We needed to make Brad look a lot older -- needed to age him 45 years or so.
"And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies, his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen."
"And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under, really, all conditions."
"He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight, at nighttime, under candlelight, he had to hold an extreme close-up, he had to deliver dialogue, he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat, he had to be able to take a bath, to cry, he even had to throw up."
"Not all at the same time -- but he had to, you know, do all of those things."
And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.
We did about 325 shots.

[ Sneezes ]
GlRL:
You know how frustrating it is trying to help your kids when they're sick.
I don't feel so good.
GlRL:
A visit to the doctor's office can be a challenge.
[ Blows nose ]
"No, I don't want you to take my temperature."
No!
I wish it would feel better -- my ear.
GlRL:
"Snort, sniffle, sneeze -- no antibiotics, please!"
"As a parent, you want to help make your child feel better as fast as possible."
It's tempting to think that antibiotics are the answer when your child is sick.
But that may not always be the case.
You don't look so good.
"A lot of illnesses can be caused by viruses, and antibiotics don't work on viruses."
"In fact, antibiotics are strong medicines that can have serious side effects."
DR. WHlTNEY:
"I'm a doctor, but also the mother of two kids."
So I have order n operations at each level in the tree.
And then how many levels deep am I?
"Well, that's the divide, right?"
So how many levels do I have?
"Log n, because at each stage I'm cutting the problem in half."
So I start off with n then it's n over two n over four n over eight.
"So I have n operations log n times, there we go, n log n."
"Took us a long time to get there, but it's a nice algorithm to have."
Let me generalize this slightly.
"When we get a problem, a standard tool to try and attack it with is to say, is there some way to break this problem down into simpler, I shouldn't say simpler, smaller versions of the same problem."
"If I can do that, it's a good candidate for divide and conquer."
And then the things I have to ask is how much of a division do I want to do?
"The obvious one is to divide it in half, but there may be cases where there are different divisions you want to have take place."
The second question I want to ask is what's the base case?
When do I get down to a problem that's small enough that it's basically trivial to solve?
Here it was lists of size one.
I could have stopped at lists of size two right.
That's an easy comparison.
"Do one comparison and return one of two possible orders on it, but I need to decide that."
And the third thing I need to decide is how do I combine?
"You know, point out to you in the binary search case, combination was trivial."
The answer to the final search was just the answer all the way up.
"Here, a little more work, and that's why I'll come back to that idea."
"If I'm basically just squeezing jello, that is, I'm trying to make the problem simpler, but the combination turns out to be really complex, I've not gained anything."
"So things that are good candidates for divide and conquer are problems where it's easy to figure out how to divide down, and the combination is of"
little complexity.
"It would be nice if it was less than linear, but linear is nice because then I'm going to get that n log in kind of behavior."
"And if you ask the TAs in recitation tomorrow, they'll tell you that you see a lot of n log n algorithms in computer science."
"It's a very common class of algorithms, and it's very useful one to have."
"Now, one of the questions we could still ask is, right, we've got binary search, which has got this nice log behavior."
"If we can sort things, you know, we get this n log n behavior, and we got a n log n behavior overall."
But can we actually do better in terms of searching.
They need nutrients.
Where are they going to get it?
Student:
Weathering or--
Prof:
They could get it from weathering or they could get it from upwelling.
Where does upwelling occur?
Student:
On a costal reef.
Prof:
"Yeah, continental margins."
"Get out in the middle of the ocean and there's actually a tremendous amount of fertilizer there but it's five miles down, three to five miles down, and you just can't get it up."
"It's sealed off, because the top of the ocean is warm and the bottom of the ocean is cold, and there's no way that cold water can come up through warm water, unless you have Coriolis force or wind or something like that driving it."
So that's why the open oceans are deserts.
You'll notice that tropical rainforests are highly productive per square meter.
In general forests are pretty productive.
Swamps and streams are very productive.
"Algal beds and reefs are quite productive, and so are estuaries."
"So if you want to go someplace where you're-- you know, you're a naturalist, you like creepy-crawlies, you want frogs in your pocket, you want to see something new for Christmas, you go to these places; that's where you'll see a lot of stuff."
Okay?
"So right there you already know where the prospecting is good, if you like to see lots of biodiversity."
"Now if you look at percent contribution to global primary production, the open oceans again crop up, and that is because there's just so darn much of them."
"If you're out there in space, looking at the world, you realize that you can fit all of the continents into the"
Pacific Ocean; it's bigger than all the continents put together.
And most of it is open ocean; most of it is low primary productivity open ocean.
But there's just so darn much of it that on the planetary scale it's making a pretty good contribution.
"And the tropical rainforests are big enough so that even though they're only 3 and a half or 4% of the globe, they have such high primary productivity that they're kicking in quite a bit."
"And the others, even though they are productive, occupy such a small portion of the globe that they're not contributing that much."
"Okay, so this is an overall view of energy flow on the planet, at least for the photosynthetically driven part of the planet."
The sun is sending in the energy.
"And by the way, any idea of roughly how much of the sunlight that comes into the planet is actually captured by"
life?
"And at the same time, in other parallel universes... the same cat can be alive and kicking."
But how?
How can you have a dead cat and a live cat simultaneously?
Because the universe splits in half.
"In one universe, we have a dead cat."
"In the other universe, we have a live cat."
Get used to it.
What is even more shocking... is that in some of these many worlds... a tiny quantum difference in thought can change the whole world.
It's like the butterfly that flaps its wing and makes the hurricane.
Tiny microscopic events would change the course of history.
"So every historical event actually happened... in every possible way in some branch... of this ever-splitting, many-worlds universe."
"In one, the Nazis won World War Il."
"In which case, I'm now speaking German... and there's a swastika behind me."
In another world... none of the horror ever happened.
"In one universe, there's no World War Il... and 50 or so million people didn't have to die."
"Like the endless rolls of the dice, all possible numbers... and all possible kinds of universes and outcomes... will eventually turn up and occur in one of these many worlds."
"In fact, all our wishes, too, can come true... in a parallel universe."
If the many worlds idea is right... then there's a branch of the universe... in which the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year.
"You can imagine that the USA was still a colony... of the British, for example."
Even the impossible is probable in some parallel universe.
There could even be creatures coming into our world... from these mysterious extra dimensions.
"As mind-boggling as it sounds... when it comes to the amazing world of parallel universes... anything that can happen has happened or will happen... in some other universe... in some other dimension, space, and time."
Quantum differences can rewrite history... creating multiple universes... each with wildly different outcomes... where anything and everything is possible.
Some wars never happened.
Others we never imagined did.
A slight change means a comet missed... and even dinosaurs still roam some Earth somewhere.
"All and every one of these fantastic parallel universes... occupy the same space... but are in a different dimension, and so invisible to us."
Even as you peacefully watch TV... whole other invisible worlds could be raging all around you.
These parallel universes are in your living room.
"This means that in your living room, there are dinosaurs."
You can't hear them.
You can't see the dinosaurs... that are rampaging throughout your living room... but they're there.
Ole:
"That which we started about a decade ago, has begun at all business schools connecting art and economy and it is becoming more and more common, which is logical because where the hell would you draw the resources to be innovative from when you need to be innivativ all the time?"
"With violence and power there is almost only art left .. and as you begun with .. philosophy, right?"
Martin:
Both have done badly for some years
Ole:
They have but begins to turn back strongly
Martin:
"Well, you have some power now ... if I could pull some strings so you had A LOT of power in all parts of the world.. what would you do structurally, to face some of these crises?"
Ole:
I would make a society which is based on a lot smaller units
The Danish society I would base on a community with semi large municipalities
"That would run their own training concept, that would run their hospitals and would take responsibility for their young and old and completely developed their own alternative form of production"
Martin:
So the opposite of what we do today?
Ole:
Exactly the opposite of what we are doing today!
And then I would try in some way to stop tourism because it is the most CO2 consuming and time-wasting in the world but we can't do that because that would be totalitarianism and who should have the right to travel and what would a valid ticket be?
I myself am a delicate pensioner..
"No, I won't dwell on traveling"
But then I would...
"And I don't know how the hell I should solve it... but I would try to make the developing countries, such as Africa, proud of their culture so they with violence and force wouldn't try to take over our countries"
"like China and India are trying to... it creates an immense amount of problems on this globe in terms of resources and economic structuring and so on, right?"
Why the hell don't they hold on to their own way of life?
Ole:
"But if I had real power,,,,"
Martin:
"You will have, if you want..."
Ole:
Then would I influence them through their upbringing and their education to believe that what they stand for is really something that is worth a lot and that they should not take over our way of life
Martin:
But perhaps it has also something to do with food ...
"And so we're at a stage now, where we're running more than 20 projects, where we have humans and robots  collaborating together."
"We have the robotics systems that take the data,"
"like poor Kepler up in space, and then we have the humans down here on Earth, who are able to analyze the data."
So humans and robots are able to work together in harmony.
Except that it never works like that.
We've all seen the Sci-Fi movies.
"We all know that the robots  always go wrong in the end, and this is the vision of my nightmare."
"This is the future that we're heading towards, expect it doesn't quite look like this, it looks more like this."
"Because this particular machine that's going to run roughshod over our classifiers, is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope."
This is a telescope being built right now.
It's going to be on a mountaintop in Chile.
It's as big as the biggest telescopes in the world right now.
But it's a survey telescope.
It's going to scan the whole sky once every 3 nights.
"And it's no exaggeration to say, it's going provide a movie of the universe."
We're going to see all the asteroids whizzing around the solar system.
We're going to see all stars flickering as they have star spots.
"We're going to see the planets, we'll catch those transits."
"And we're going to see the centers of galaxies flicker, as material falls down into the black holes that lurk within their centers."
But to cope with LSST is going to be a challenge.
It's going to produce roughly 30 terabytes of reduced data each and every night.
If all we care about is things that change in the universe --
"let's simplify the problem: a conservative estimate is that we're going to have half a million alerts, every single night."
"Even if all of you, even if everyone watching, even if we all commit to doing Galaxy Zoo and its friends, we're not going to cope with this."
So we need new solutions to combine the machine with the human.
"But luckily, there are things we can do."
The first thing we can do is we can just be smarter about using people's attention.
We could pay attention to what it is that machines can do.
Maybe they can classify the routine events.
We can let them do that and we can give only those things that really need human attention to the humans.
The other thing we could do is that we can educate our volunteers.
"We can use the power of the Zooniverse, the power of citizen science to train up a generation of volunteers, so that they're able to take on the task of dealing with the truly unusual things that LSST is able to provide us."
And we know from the other property of linear transformations that the transformation of a vector multiplied by the scalar is the same thing as the scalar multiplied by the transformation of the vector.
That's just from our definition of linear transformations.
Plus x2 two times the transformation of e2 plus all the way to xn times the transformation of en.
"Now, what is this?"
"I could rewrite this, so everything I've done so far, so the transformation of x is equal to that, which just using our properties of linear transformations, all linear transformations, this has to be true for them."
I get to this and this is equivalent.
"This is equal to-- if we view each of these as a column vector, this is equal to what?"
"This is equal to the matrix where this is the first column, T e1."
And then the second column is T e2.
"And then we go all the way to T en times-- let me put it this way-- x1, x2, all the way to xn."
"We've seen this multiple, multiple times."
"Now what's really, really, really neat about this is I just started with an arbitrary transformation."
"And I just showed that an arbitrary linear transformation of x can be rewritten as a product of a matrix where I'm taking that same linear transformation of each of our standard basis vectors, and I can construct that matrix, and multiplying that matrix times my x vector is the same thing as this transformation."
So this is essentially showing you that all transformations--
let me be careful.
All linear transformations can be a matrix vector product.
"Not only did I show you that you can do it, but it's actually a fairly straightforward thing to do."
This is actually a pretty simple operation to do.
Let me show you an example.
"I don't know, I think this is super neat."
Let's say that I just-- I'm just going to make up some transformation.
Let's say I have a transformation and it's a mapping between-- let's make it extra interesting-- between R2 and R3.
"And let's say my transformation, let's say that"
"T of x1 x2 is equal to-- let's say the first entry is x1 plus 3x2, the second entry is 5x2 minus x1, and let's say the third entry is 4x1 plus x2."
This is a mapping.
I could have written it like this.
"I could write T of any vector in R2, x1, x2, is equal to-- and maybe this is just redundant, but I think you get the idea."
"I like this notation better. x1 plus 3x2, 5x2 minus x1, and then 4x1 plus x2."
This statement and this statement I just wrote are equivalent.
And I like to visualize this a little bit more.
"Now, I just told you that I can represent this transformation as a matrix vector product."
How do I do it?
"That is this treachery, the hipocracy, we are to avoid."
Imitation side.
Which is not proper and is going in the name of proper.
"That is dangerous, we must, we are to avoid that."
We are to come in connection with the truth.
With the reality.
Unto [dim??] also ready.
"Not any [passinarly??], imitationary."
"Our dealing will be sincere, true, and we must come in touch with the truth."
The thruthful result we may expect.
Truth is independent.
It is not subservient to anything else.
We shall have to come in connection with truth anyhow.

UK Youth Parliament Make Your Mark 2012
Want to have a voice?
Want to have a say?
Want to Make Your Mark?
The UK Youth Parliament is coming together to fight your corner and tackle the biggest issues facing young people today.
But we need your help
Run by young people for young people the UK youth parliament gives opportunities to 11 - 18 year olds to use their voice to have an influence on the decisions which affect them members are elected up and down the country by you to represent you its not about party politics its about campaigning on the issues which matter to you this November members of youth parliament are going to take over the house of commons who chooses the issues to be debated?
Simple.
You
Last year the UK youth parliament carried out a nationwide pole of over 65 thousand young people and you told us what your top 5 issues were across the country.
Too often it seems to me that we are happily accepted as adults
When it comes to parting with our pounds but treated like kids when it comes to having our say in matters that affect us
The cost of public transport is forever rising and it's unreliable
It costs me £16 a week to get to work and twice this week i've been late because of public transport and that is catching two buses that are earlier than i need
If we're expected to use public transport and lower emissions then we should be able to afford it
lowering costs of transport would also make it more accessible to people who are poor
Members of the UK youth parliament have been debating voting on which of these top 5 issues will become a priority campaign for the coming year
Make public transport cheaper better and accessible for all was a national campaign for the previous year
They get a date with a guy that we have a crush on.
And the flipside is that we are always doing things that make other people upset.
Even if we don't realize doing it.
It's very easy to make someone else mad.
Helping some people can hurt others.
I was trying to be very helpful in the Zande village by sowing dresses for friends.
Who got mad at me?
The local Taylor.
I was taking away his business.
"When I took pictures for ID cards for students in [inaudible] for free, who got mad at me?"
The local photographer.
I was taking away his clients.
My Zande students would never answer questions in class.
They hated any kind of praise.
They didn't want anyone to know what grades they are getting.
They were terribly afraid that they'd make other people mad at them: jealous of them and then that would arouse their jealousy and their witchcraft.
"So with possible witch is all around you, no Zande wants to stand out, be richer, smarter, more beautiful, more successful."
"That causes jealousy and envy, and that can heat up witchcraft and cause bad things to happen."
Neither do Zande want to be poor or unsuccessful or miserable for they then will be accused of being witches and of causing misfortune and others.
Because they'd be the obvious one who would be jealous.
"People who are lucky who have opportunities such as scholarships to study abroad as this young man did, he actually got his PhD at the University of Paris right after I did."
They set themselves up for witchcraft.
"They return home as college professors, businessmen, bureaucrats, they earn good wages, and the next thing you know, they get sick and die."
"Unfortunately, as this young man did."
"People who get good jobs are inundated with requests for help from dozens if not hundreds of family members and help they must or they'll be seen as stingy and selfish, and they'll-- yeah."
And then soon their children will fall ill.
It's a very good system for wealth distribution.
"And it causes many Zande to question the wisdom of getting ahead, for they'll have to share their good fortune so widely that in the end, they won't really be ahead at all."
"In Africa today, the disparity between rich and poor is growing."
Development puts money in the hands of some but leaves others behind.
"So even though education and scientific knowledge is growing, witchcraft accusations are also growing."
"Moreover, whereas traditionally, only mentally competent adults were accused of witchcraft, nowadays, young children and even senile elders are accused and sometimes they're tortured into confessing."
"We were desperate, so we rushed out to the Blaskets as soon as we heard there were sharks there, and managed to find some sharks."
So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -- you see a shark running under the boat here -- we managed to collect slime.
And here it is.
Look at that lovely black shark slime.
"And in about half an hour, we got five samples."
Five individual sharks were sampled using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.
(Laughter) (Applause)
"I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now, and they're a bit more dramatic."
You probably saw the humpback whale footage we got a month or two ago off County Wexford.
"And you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind, and I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins."
But hey -- sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come.
So this is possibly going to be my legacy --
Simon's Shark Slime.
We got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples.
"One thing that is very useful is that we use a pole camera -- this is my colleague, Joanne, with a pole camera -- where you can look underneath the shark."
"What you're trying to look at is, the males have claspers, which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark."
So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark.
"If we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it, we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female."
"Because in the moment, they have no way, genetically, of telling the difference between a male and a female, which I find staggering, because they don't know what primers to look for."
"Being able to tell the gender of a shark is very important for things like policing the trade in basking shark and other species through the sightings, because it is illegal to trade in these sharks."
And they are caught and are on the market.
"So as a field biologist, you just want to get encounters with these animals, and learn as much as you can."
"They're often quite brief, they're often very seasonally constrained."
You just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can.
"But isn't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines, such as the geneticists, who can gain so much more from that."
"So as I said, these things are sent to you in strange ways."
Grab them while you can.
I'll take that as my scientific legacy.
"Hopefully, I might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before I die."
"But for the time being, thank you for that."
And keep an eye out for sharks.
"If you're more interested, we have a basking shark website now set up."
"You can't really see, but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels."
"The black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel, rather than a whaling vessel."
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language.
"I don't pretend to [know many Irish words], but in Kerry they were often known as ""ainmhide Na seolta,"""
"""the monster with the sails."""
"Another title would be ""liop an dá lapa,"""
"""the unwieldy beast with two fins."""
"""Liabhán mór,"" suggesting a big animal."
"Or my favorite, ""liabhán chor gréine,"" ""the great fish of the sun."""
"That's a lovely, evocative name."
"On Tory Island -- a strange place anyway -- they were known as ""muldoons."""
(Laughter)
No one seems to know why.
Hope there's no one from Tory here.
Lovely place.
"But more commonly all around the island, they were known as the sunfish."
And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out.
There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world.
"Some say it's not population decline, it might be a change in the distribution of plankton."
"It's been suggested that these sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change, as they're basically continuous plankton recorders, swimming around with their mouth open."
They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN.
There's movements in Europe to try and stop catching them.
"There's now a ban on catching and even landing them, even landing ones caught accidentally."
"They're not protected in Ireland; in fact, they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever, despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside."
We know very little about them.
And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface -- we try and guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface.
"I only found out last year, at a conference on the Isle of Man, just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly, frequently and predictably come to the surface to ""bask."""
It's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist to see and experience basking sharks.
They are awesome creatures.
"It gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them, to get access to them."
"What we've been doing for a couple years -- last year was a big year -- is we started tagging sharks, so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movement and things like that."
So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active.
Afterwards you get to your computer at 4 or 5 in the morning and you try to be minimally creative and provide a bit of context and tell things that weren't being told in the rest of the media.
"Not regarding the focus, but rather looking for details which you think define what was happening."
"And try to write features that give people an idea of what's happening, way beyond whatever controversial incident may have happened that day."
"And then you sleep 3 hours, and then off you go again."
ST:
"Yesterday Virginia, from 20minutos, was here."
One thing that called my attention was they were always there.
It was the first media corporation that I began to recognise.
"I met Mirem, I met Marta, I saw them there..."
And it was a question of taking it easy.
Taking your time.
"It was hard to interpret, but you had to take your time."
Many media corporations didn't do that.
JL:
"It's a luxury, isn't it."
We allowed ourselves the luxury of spending hours in a square informing about that was happening.
It's hard for that to happen in a media corporation.
Very complicated.
We were born to do that.
We were born out of this journalistic crisis and we decided to slow down and inform with a bit of good sense.
"And we did that, and we created Periodismo Humano."
"But there's a lot of merit in other manstream media corporations which we are very critical of, but we have to acknowledge that there are some media corporations, especially some journalists who in their free time, went to the square because they decided they didn't need permission from their boss, their corporation or their structure, they went there because they wanted to be journalists for this kind of thing."
"The rest of the year they're bored, and when something interesting like this happens, and things are going on, they want to be there in the square."
If I hadn't been working in Periodismo Humano I would have spent my free time there.
And I'd have done the same job through my personal blog.
"I'm sure of that. fortunately there was a structure and co-workers who as a group made everything so much more valid, more visible, and richer."
But I'm sure that any of the journalists there would have done exactly the same thing.
"Because you become a journalist for things like this, and if they happen and you don't experience them, why bother?"
ST:
"To finish with the topic of journalism, I'd like you to tell me what the relationship with the people who gave you your information was like."
"Because the beginning was complicated, that first week."
But I get the impression that the management of that information was very efficient.
"For example, if I pick rock and you paper then you win."
I picked rock and you scissors then I win.
And so on.
"Again, the payoffs in both cases sum to zero."
"This parenthetically, this very simple children game actually has an annual competition that carries a nontrivial prize of $10,000 and it's actually a sobering thought that when we look at this trivial game then, perhaps, chuckle a little bit, if we actually participated in this competition we'd actually think hard about how to play it."
"Here's the other extreme, of games of pure coordination or pure cooperation."
"In this case, all agents have exactly the same interest."
"In other words, the payoffs for every action vector that they take is the same."
And so the utility for player 'i' is always the same as the utility for player 'j' for every action vector that they choose.
"And so again we here, too, will need to write each cell of matrix only one number because it's common to all the players."
"It's drives home that perhaps the unfortunate term ""noncooperate"" game theory that describes this dominant strand of game theory that we are discussing for now"
"It's, the name was suggested these are games for, that descibe situations that are inherently conflictual but as we see they apply also to games in which the interests of the players coincide."
So here's a game that describes the purely cooperative situation.
You and I walk towards each other on the sidewalk.
We can each decide whether to go to our respective left or respective right.
And if we pick the same side then all is good.
We avoid a collision.
"If we don't, then we do collide and that's equally bad for both of us."
"Of course in general, games will be neither purelly cooperative nor purely conflictual and here's a game that exemplifies that."
"This is a game that's called ""Battle of the Sexes."""
So imagine a husband and a wife who want to go out to a movie.
There are two movies that they can choose from.
"Let's say ""Battle of Armageddon"" and ""Flower Child."""
"The one, a violent war movie, and the other is a romantic comedy."
Above all they want to go together to the movie.
If they go to different movies then they are equally unhappy.
So they want to go to the same movie but they have conflicting preferences.
"The wife clearly would prefer to go to ""Battle of Armageddon"" and the husband, as romantic as he is, would like to go to ""Flower Child."""
"So, both cooperation and competition in this game."
"İyi ki doğdun, Fatmagül."
"[Glad that you were born, Fatmagül.]"
"Happy birthday, halacığım."
let that fade away.
"You have to think about, OK, just the interface."
Is the interface conveying the right things?
"And then beyond the interface, the mental model."
How is the user simulating this in their head?
What information are they getting out of it?
"So back to the diagram, letting that implementation fade away."
So that's self-describing.
"At least, that's talking about if something should be self-describing, but how do you pull that off?"
"It's one thing to say it's important, it's another thing to tell you literally how to do it."
So there's at least five ways.
"The first one is consistency, and this is cheating, basically."
"It works great, but it's also a kind of a tautology to say, hey, if I design something that's things that the user already knows, they're going to know how to use it."
That is true.
"You do not have to rely on this entirely, though."
"In fact, Google products are often very different from what's already in the marketplace, and they still are able to bootstrap knowledge from users and have them figure it out."
"I mean, in the case of Gmail, it was sort of a radical reimagination of how email interfaces worked, but it still worked."
"And also, if everyone did consistency all the time, we wouldn't see dramatic innovation in interfaces."
So we're not going to focus on this one too much.
"Basically, it's really useful, and you can guarantee that users are going to understand your application if you focus on consistency, but it's not the only way."
So the second one is affordances.
"Let's go back to the test chamber, and let's say one day, they encounter this, and they've never seen it before, and they're thinking, whoa, that's really interesting."
This might actually be a way out of the test chamber.
And how are they going to figure that out?
Everything about this design is designed to convey what it does.
"The way that the door is recessed from the frame, the curvature of the handle, the way that you can just imagine the handle rocking in."
"You might not know on which side of the door it's going to open, and you might not know what the words mean, but the picture sure looks like yourself and it seems to be going through it."
But that's sort of cheating.
"Just the physical design of this has been very carefully crafted so that when you look at it, you understand what it's going to do."
You understand that you need to push on it.
"And this is a type of thing that we do just throughout the day, constantly, where you encounter stuff and you have to look down and say, I'm going to push on that."
"It's just this kind of thing that cognitively, you're just constantly doing without really even thinking about it."
I guess we haven't done enough generally to allow different ways for people to be able to participate.
Natalie:
"And right now the roles in the community, theres not that many, theres some different ones but its a small subset so we're trying to think how can there be more roles or people can opt in to taking on more of a role."
Because we do see that in these after school programs and also in the online community.
That can be really motivating and helping people develop and want to actually have an authentic role.
Avi:
"I think part of that and it relates to questions that people asked, so how do you work to promote motivation in really constrained environments where for example teachers have to teach for the standardized test or with a very closed curriculum."
And I think that the idea again is 1.
There are no recipes but the principles are the same.
So what you do is you analyze and its all working with tensions.
And the idea is you analyze the tensions in your particular environment with your particular people.
Who are the people around here?
What are their complex motivations?
"The more you know about your context and your constraints, the better you will be able to say how can I apply the principles of motivation in this particular context and then you apply it and then you study it again."
And you see what the effect you had and you read redesign and its an iterative process in a complex environment with a complex process that is unpredicatable really.
"But you can actually, using the principles you can anticipate they will move a particular direction."
Natalie:
"Yes, that great."
Fred Bartels has an example.
Some other people have talked about how they've done some compromises between these two things based on their environment and like you said iterate it.
So its great to look back at that.
Mitch:
"So I think we need to wrap up now, at least for me , the hour flew past."
There were lots of really interesting topics and ideas that came up so maybe just I'll say a few words now about
looking ahead.
"But first of all, I really want to thank Avi for joining us and participating."
It was great to hear your points of view on these ideas and I think it will stir up lots of continuing conversations about these ideas.
Avi:
My pleasure.
Mitch:
"Looking ahead, actually we aren't going to be meeting for the next two weeks because there are various events here at MlT."
"Actually theres a Massachusetts holiday next week, Patriot's Day when the Boston Marathon is run so we won't be holding class next Monday."
Already in the early grades?
Ole:
"Yes, and then let the individual find out for themselves how to formulate the problem and how to answer it"
Martin:
So a careful introduction to existentialism?
"Ole: and identity politics,yes that wouldn't be so bad and then as the next exercise ""Who are you""? that one's not that easy, is it? we live a life with each other based on qualified guesses, right? which in a sense is tragic, right?.. but on the other hand it's very good that we can't look into each other's consciousness"
Martin:
"So the ""Who are you"" project, might start a dialogue and that wouldn't be so bad?"
"No, and dialogue has also been found in Norwegian experiments at different grade levels that dialogue Capacity and the development of it, it promotes a huge amount of skills in other subjects"
"It's like music .. music is a dialogue, right?"
Ole: it's just on another level.
Martin:
Music is the best..
Martin:
"I have an old plan to combine singing, dancing and fighting because it is the oldest culture all expressions and there must be a formation of dealing with that in some abstract synthesis"
"But we can not really get around culture, can we?"
Foundation of culture if we are to be humans.
Ole:
We can not!
Martin:
"And if you look at how the media is today as the cultural subjekts is starved, right?"
To some extend.
Ole:
Yes it is..
Martin:
If you look away from it completely popped
Ole:
"Yes yes and the unified but culture is the participation so that requires the interaction it is not a spectator role that's why I enjoy amateur music and dance so much and in fact also the fight, right because it is integration, integration you have to take part, you should not be excluded, you shouldn't just sit and stare"
You must have all the senses involved and all the bodily
"I also made another word in my doctoral thesis which I called ""Synkinestesi"""
"See, in neurobiologists the senses deputize each other, not."
"""I can taste how you look"" or ""I can hear how the tree is"" but forKinesis you get movement with in and movement embraces everything in psychology it is called proprioception which is the sense of your own body and it is the feeling that, as in a probe moves you through the world and then it's the movement that brings together all your senses and the movement expressed in dance, in battle and in the music, right"
Now these assumptions are captured in a table I have on my document camera.
"What I have here are five firms, just calling them A,B,C,D, and, and E. Each of these five firms is emitting five units of pollution."
And each has a different call structure in the eliminating or the abating of the units of pollution.
"For example firm A, incurs a cost of $100 dollars. incurs a marginal cost of $100 to eliminate the first unit of pollution."
"Then it incurs $200 for the second, $400 for the third, $800 and $1600 for the fifth."
B. Has a higher cost structure.
"B, incurs $200 in cost to abate the first unit."
"It's $600, $1800, $5400, and, and so on."
I hope you get.
"Now, let's suppose the government comes in and regulates this environment, this geographical location and it tells produces that they can not emit more than two units of pollution."
"Well, that means that each fund is basically given."
"Two rights, two pollute there is a standard equal to the to the stash a line firms must incur the cause of the clean up for all units of pollution prior to this a dash line.Now this means,that firm A must clean up three units which is one hundred plus two hundred plus four hundred which is $700."
"Firm B must incur these three costs or 200+600, that's 800 and $2600."
Firm C incurs these costs which add up to $1200.
"And firm D, that's 2000, $3000."
And firm
"E, well that's $6000 there."
"Firm E is a very high cost pollution abater, cost firm"
E a great deal.
"In this table what I have done is taken, transfered the costs at each firm is going to have to Per, to abate the, the required three units of pollution."
"And the total cost is $13,500."
In contrast to requiring each firm to clean up three units of pollution.
"What the government might do is simply, say that there are ten pollution rights."
"And, firms can bid for these pollution rights."
"In order to emit a unit of pollution, they must bid for these, these rights. say, made, made out in, in tickets or licenses."
"And if they do, we know that, they're going to bid based on their cost structure."
"We go back to our, our table."
"Well lets suppose that the cost of a ticket is only $50, that is the initial price at the auction is only $50."
Well how many units of these pollution rights is A going to want?
"Well A would prefer to pay $50 for a pollution right, then to incur even the, The cost, the low cost of even abating the first unit of pollution, so A is gonna want five tickets, and of course if A wants five tickets at fifty buck, B is gonna want to buy five tickets."
It's cheaper to buy the pollution rates than to incur all of these costs.
"Well, you can imagine that as you go through this table that all five firms are gonna want five tickets."
let's see how that evolves.
"If they can keep an inclusive tone, or if the impulse they've achieved can't be contained and it all splits up."
But it's clear that the motor has been cranked into action.
That's very important.
ST:
And to finish.
What's the future of the 15M?
JL:
"I think the 15M is a state of mind, it's a diagnosis, and it's an inspiration."
"I think nostalgia is a bad travelling companion for the people who have participated in the 15M, because the Puerta del Sol, the Sol camp, is not going to come back."
"The commission of infrastructures is not coming back... at least not in the same terms,"
I don't know if I'm wrong.
But I think it's very hard for all the perfect conditions to come together again for it to happen like before.
"Sometimes you talk to someone who participated very intensely in it and they say that a better world is possible because when they were there, they were hungry and a lady gave them a dish of maccarroni, and then they helped a commission to put up a stand, then they went to see other people camping on the other side of the city to convince them of whatever..."
"And they tell you all these brutal experiences to justify, or as if it could be reproduced permanently all over the world."
"Some people agree with that and have an ideological justification for it, but I'm not going to go into that kind of thing."
But there are people who are attached to that nostalgia.
And we'll have to wait and see how they manage that nostalgia.
And there I see a danger for the 15M.
Or for what the 15M stands for.
"But I insist, it's a diagnosis."
The 15M is a diagnosis.
It's a state of mind and an inspiration and we're still not conscious of the number of projects that it kick-started in May 2011.
"Neurons have been activated amongst groups of friends, amongst of strangers who suddenly met, things like this documentary have been created."
"There are many projects, audiovisual and not, many projects of many different kinds which were created thanks to the inspiration or the motor of the 15M."
And I think those projects are going to lead the way towards the future of the 15M.
"More than just assemblies, more than demonstrations in the street."
It doesn't matter how many are called.
"But I think the projects that arose, inspired by the 15M will be the 15M of the future."
Even if they're not the 15M.
But the spirit will be there in a mystic kind of way. the 15M will experience those projects because they were born there.
"Contact with international media corporations, international perception of the 15M."
"Part of this process is to help people understand that this is possible, and create a demand for it."
"And if there's a demand, then people will take this information and start producing the product, which doesn't exist for the large part for many people."
"Believe me, people ask me, how fast could a transition be made?"
You know what?
In two years this could become the dominant agricultural paradigm.
"All it takes is for Americans to say, this is what I want."
"Because, believe me, there are thousands of small farmers around this country poised, able and ready to scale up."
"But they're not good marketers, they're whatever."
"We're going to talk about that later, some of the really exciting developments that you've encountered, within your local community, is the adoption of internet technology and social networking to allow that transition to occur, to easily sell the product."
"Yes, that's what we're needing to have, is aggregators, that crucial aggregator marketer."
"As I see it, the technology is here, the land is here, the knowledge is here, we just need people that are willing to say, you know what?"
I don't need that Caribbean cruise this year.
I'll take that thousand dollars and I'll buy better food.
And maybe I'll feel better.
"That's what we need, we need people to make that life adjustment, and as that happens it's going to be a good thing."
This is the only herd that we have right now that isn't being mob stocked.
"Because here we just made hay, and we've got all this poultry, so we're trying to just clean a little bit ahead of these, so they're in a pretty big paddock."
The paddock goes from the turkeys over here.
"We're just trying to clean up around the fringes, where the mower couldn't get."
But you get a sense of it.
Some of the grass finished beef here.
"This is what we call ""salad bar beef""."
"Everyday they get a new paddock, yesterday they were over there, today they're here, this afternoon they'll move into that next paddock right there."
"What we're doing here is we're just kind of cleaning up after we made hay, to kind of clean the fringes of the field where the mower couldn't get, and that sort of thing."
"These are grass finished beef, as opposed to grain, and grass-fed, that used to mean the same thing, and now it's become a distinction."
"Kind of like the term ""natural""."
It's been perverted and bastardized.
"Exactly, exactly."
"Grass-fed, the fact is that all cows in the US are grass-fed at some point in their lives."
And then they go into a feedlot for four months.
And it only takes 14 days of grain feeding to chase most of the conjugated linoleic acid out of the body of a ruminant.
"Two weeks and they're at it for four months, in the typical factory farm."
"So this is what we called earlier R1 and we called this earlier R2, it is the distance to that point very far away."
If I want to know what R2
- R1 is that's very easy now.
I draw a line from here perpendicular to this line and you see immediately that this distance here is R2 - R1.
"But that distance is also -- you realize that this angle is theta -- it's the same one as that one, so that distance here is also D sine theta."
"And so now I'm in business, I can predict in what directions we will see constructive interference."
"Because all we are demanding now, requesting, that R2 - R1 is N times lambda."
"And so we need that D sine theta and I'll give it a subindex N, as in Nancy, equals N times lambda."
In others words that the sine of theta N is simply N lambda divided by D.
"And that uniquely defines all those directions, the whole zoo of directions N equals 0, that is the center"
"line, N equals 1, N equals 2,"
"N equals 3, and so on."
And then I have the whole family of destructive interference.
Which would require that lambda
R2 - R1 which is D sine theta must now be 2N +1 times lambda/2.
Just as we had it on the blackboard there.
We discussed that earlier.
And so that requires then that the sine of theta N for the destructive interference is going to be 2N+1 times lambda / 2D.
So this indicates the directions where we expect maxima and where we expect minima as seen from the center between the two sources.
But now I would like to know what the linear distance is if I project this onto a screen which is very far away.
"And so let us have a screen at a distance capital L which has to be very far away, so here are now the two sources."
It's a different scale.
And here is a screen.
And the distance b- from the two sources to the screen is capital L. And here is one of those direction theta.
And you see immediately that if
"I call this the direction X, X being 0 here, that the tangent of theta is X/L."
"If but only if I deal with small angles, the tangent of theta is the same as the sine of theta."
"And therefore I can now tell you where the maxima will lie on that screen, away from the center line, which I call 0, that is now when X of N is L times the sine of theta, in small angle approximation."
"So this is approximately L times N lambda divided by D, and for the same reason you will get here c- destructive interference when X of N is going to be L times 2N+ 1 times lambda / 2D."
That is simple geometry.
So now we have all the ingredients here on the blackboard and I'm going to
leave it there for the rest of the lecture.
"I know the artistic directions we could take; I ensure media quality, and I have some control of the production process."
"But it's important to involve one more person in this process, and that person is the"
Instructional Design Consultant.
"You should have one assigned to you when you begin teaching, if you haven't been teaching already, and they are aware of course objectives, I don't really know course objectives when you come in, I only know that you need a video done."
"So, it's important to involve the Instructional Designer in that aspect."
They also know the best teaching methods that can be used.
It's important to have this three-way meeting between these people before we move on and actually start creating the video.
"Next, you need to know your format."
There are a few formats that we can use.
"There is: interview, teleprompt, teleprompted PowerPoint, and extemporaneous."
"The interview format is the most natural because it's conversational, it doesn't really require that much preparation because it's whatever happens, you need to have the person next to you to prepare."
"You should be familiar with questions and follow up questions, which means you need to pay close attention to what your guest is speaking about in order to follow up correctly."
Next is the teleprompter.
A teleprompter is...
I'm actually using one right now...
It is a script from a word processing document.
"It's very rigid due to it's word for word nature, and I would suggest not using it."
"Now, I'm not actually using a scripted teleprompter,"
I'm using a PowerPoint teleprompter controlled by an iTouch device.
"I call this teleprompted PowerPoint, or just PowerPoint."
"It's a good alternative to teleprompting because it is not word for word, you don't lose your spot, and it's like using note-cards, but you're not looking down."
"When you look down, away from the screen, it looks awkward and people can tell."
"You can control, again, with an iTouch, and it can't be seen by the camera."
"So, what would you do if you're going to use this format?"
You would e-mail me the PowerPoint.
I'll provide my e-mail at the end of this presentation.
"Do watch out for small text, no less than 24 pt."
"The best way, finally, to approach a format, is to use extemporaneous style."
"That is, without (maybe without) notes, but don't read word for word... it feels very rigid."
"That leads me to my last point, know your presentation."
"All of these techniques, excluding maybe the interview, require a good amount of practice before coming in to film."
"Mistakes can be edited out, but it looks more professional with the less cuts I have to make."
I'm not able to trace that reference.
Alright.
"So I said, well, well good."
"They gave two references, so I have hope here."
So I went to reference fourteen.
"Pulled up, the paper."
It was a paper.
"Scanned through the paper, did a search on the paper."
"It did not contain the words the ambient sunlight, the word mountain, or the word"
"UVC and I didn't do UVC lighting, I just did UVC."
So there was no mention of any of those things in that paper.
"So, it was a reference to nowhere, because what the authors were giving me as their backup for that statement, it just didn't exist at least not in those references."
"So I wasn't able to ever get that information, cuz it wasn't at least where the authors told me it was."
"So that's an example of references nowhere and again, I think this happens a lot."
"So, you know, if you can avoid it in your own writing, hopefully, by doing a good prewriting step, by carefully organizing your information before you start, and keeping your, you know, that information with the references early on you won't make these kinds of mistakes where you just have references that don't actually back up what you're saying."
"And then finally, the citation propagation concept like telephone I was, I was saying before."
This was one of my pet peeves and so I just want to point out an example of this and caution you to avoid citing secondary sources.
"So, when I was a graduate student, I worked on, something called female athlete triad."
"And one of the components of that triad was something we called disordered eating, which itself is kind of poorly defined, but in any case, a part of the triad is disordered eating."
"So people would always want to say, well, how common is disordered eating in female athletes?"
"And at the time that I was a graduate student and writing out papers on this,"
"In the late 90's or early 2000's, there was Hallmark statistic that everybody cited."
"It's, the statistic was that fifteen to 62% have disordered eating."
And that was just in every paper on female athletes triad eating disorders in athletes.
That's just the one that everybody gave.
"However, it wasn't like they all cited the same source."
"If you, I was trying to trace back at one point where that statistic came from and I found about 50 different attributions for where that statistic came from."
"So one paper would cite Smith et al., another paper would cite Jones et al and they all cited different things."
Well obviously that statistic came from somewhere.
"So, everybody's citing secondary sources."
"So, I want to give you some examples."
"So, this was from a paper in the Journal of General Internal Medicine."
"But if you use a design that other people have tried and you can just get some recommendations, it tends to work better and have less problems."
"So now, we have the don'ts."
"The first don't is, they're very common error, don't store Greywater."
"If you store it, it has nutrients in it, it has, you know, little pieces of gunk and stuff, it will start to break down and it'll basically start to smell very bad."
So you don't ever want to have it in a container and store it for later.
"You also use--make Greywater everyday, so there's no reason, practical reason to store it."
"You don't want to have a filter that you have to actually manually clean because that's just a point of failure, people forget to clean things if you need to have regular maintenance, so that's a not a good idea."
You don't want to use it if you're near a creek or a river.
It has nutrients in it and those nutrients can actually pollute.
It's like a fertilizer.
"So if that gets into the water, it will cause algae to grow and rob the creek or river of oxygen."
So some sites are just not appropriate for Greywater.
And you also don't want to use it if you don't have very good drainage on your site because you never want to have pooling of Greywater or running off.
You need to make sure it can soak properly into the ground to irrigate plants.
And so the next thing: mulch basin.
Who's heard of a mulch basin?
Got one person?
"Yeah, this is kind of a common-ish landscaping technique to be water-conserving."
"It's making, putting mulch around trees."
It lets--so what you do with the mulch basin is you go to the drip line of the tree and you remove some soil kind of like a doughnut ring of soil removed and you fill it up with woodchips instead.
"And this allows--with Greywater when you are going to irrigate with Greywater, it goes into that mulch basin."
It can spread out through all those woodchips.
It gets actually kind of filtered in the woodchips naturally and it soaks down into the ground and you never see it into some pool or run off.
It's just going underground and irrigating.
So it's probably the most important piece of a Greywater
System.
"And it's not often spoken of because it's, you know, out in the landscape."
It's not a pipe; it's not a plumbing part; it's something you do to your landscape.
But it's really important to have a well-functioning Greywater System.
"And so, as that Greywater goes into the landscape, the other really critical thing is something that you don't really see."
It's the billions of microscopic soil bacteria that are in the soil.
"They're consuming nutrients; they're taking any kind of gunky, dirty whatever is in your Greywater and turning it into plant nutrients."
Faraday
T. Townsend Brown and others
Have had technologies that would liberate the world from the slavery of our current
Macroeconomic system.
We were impressed when we came upon Dr. Greer and his brilliant team.
They'd been working on groundbreaking ideas over the past decade and pushing a truth that not many people either know about or are scared to discuss.
So we thought to ourselves
This is a right topic to  document and expose in a film.
After contacting Dr. Greer we found out he had bigger and better plans.
This is a film that is the culmination of 22 years of research and discovery and journey in Space and time and consciousness  and it's going to be the most significant release of information on the UFO subject and new Energy that has ever occured.
The documentary film is just the tip of the iceberg but it's a crucial step toward moving forward in finding new technology and lifting the veil of secrecy blinding the masses.
There's a lot of talk about 2012
Well this is the year for this to happen.
But it isn't about the end of the world
It's about the end of an old and corrupt order in the world
And the beginning of an entirely new civilization on Earth and that civilization on earth will be one that has free energy abundance social justice and Interplanetary capabilities.
We need all of your support
The main corporate media will not cover this story
"Not even place it at NPR, PBS or BBC."
This is why we the people are going to make this film
The internet is our home.
"Each person is going to co-produce this with us, it'll be funded by all of us together"
It'll be distributed by all of us together.
"We want to have a thousand screenings, events and premiers"
But this is an undertaking that requires a large group of people.
So please spread the word
I hope you will help us
I hope you will join us
I hope you will network this information of this campaign to raise the funds for this film to everyone on your email list every organization you know
Because the time frankly is short.
Everyone on earth knows that we cannot live with  7 billion people burning oil and gas and coal.
Most of the public know that we are not alone and that the UFOs are real more than half the public know this.
"Literally within the browser, we can have more things going on to benefit you because it's a more powerful platform than any other browser; and I could assess that technically, but the important thing is it really is a much more powerful platform for this new augmented humanity model."
"At the same time, I've not talked about monetization and ads and so forth because I wanted to talk about end-users first."
It's also important that the people in these ecosystems make money.
So an example would be that people have thing--information that they want to sell.
They have advertising they want to show.
"There are many, many examples of this, and we take this very seriously, so obviously our revenue is among other things."
YouTube is a very interesting example of this.
YouTube--and everybody here is using YouTube--YouTube is this amazing global phenomenon now.
It has more than two billion of views per day.
Think about that.
Two billion views of YouTube everyday.
"I mean, think about the amount of time being spent doing this."
"A hundred and sixty million mobile views per day, 24 hours of video uploaded every minute, right?"
You can imagine the quality.
I'll leave that up to you.
"The business is doing very, very well with more than two billion monetized views per week and the number of advertisers, the number of monetized views is up 50% in the"
last year.
"Partners are doing well, our display business, another component of this."
We have more than 300 million visitors per day.
"We have more than--we--the DoubleClick platform, which we acquired awhile ago, serves over 45 billion ads per day, and 94 of the top 100 Ad Age advertisers advertise on the Google display network."
"So, what I wanted to do in a, in a sort of to start was to lay a framework, a model for you of what things are like now."
And what I felt would be fun would be to have some demos of products that are just about to get released and I hope will work in our demo.
The person in-charge of our mobile effort is Hugo Barra.
You want to come on up?
Why don't you get started?
And let's see--let's see what Hugo has for us. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"Thanks very much, Eric."
Hello everyone.
My name is Hugo Barra and I'm part of the mobile product team at Google.
"Well, Eric was talking to you about the super computer in your pocket which, of course, is your mobile phone and what I wanted to do is actually show you a few specific examples of what exactly we mean by mobile super computing."
One of the most exciting and challenging technologies that we've been working at Google for many years is speech recognition.
"Two years ago, we launched the first version of our voice search application which I bet many of you here in the room use everyday to search the web."
Present value for an annuity.
"And remember, annuities, the amount of the annuity when you write could be called C. But when you go to a calculator or a spreadsheet we will call it PMT because that's what it, they call it, right?"
Makes sense.
Okay.
"I would like you to stare at this problem and I know you have the ability to pause and so on, but I'd like to pause with you and what I'm going to do, for every example, and if"
"I don't, you should do this, is I'm going to read out the problem for you and we'll talk about it a little bit."
"And then I would really encourage you to try to do the problem, I'll do it with you but I would encourage you to kind of think actively and be participating in it because I can't, you know, I can't see whether you're doing it or not but I hope you do."
"Okay, so what will be the value of your portfolio?"
What is the portfolio?
"Portfolio and, that's a lingo in Finance."
"Portfolio means whatever your investment is, wherever you have put your money."
"So, the word portfolio is used generically because you'll, you'll, you'll see later, it's a hangover from the fact that life has risk."
"And if life has risk and you do not like risk, which most people don't, you tend to not put all your eggs in one basket."
"So, the fact that you hold a basket of different things is called a portfolio."
"Okay, I'm."
"I try to emphasize words which are I take for granted because, you know, I mean, if you're new to Finance, which most of you probably are, you need to understand why certain language is used in, in very commonly."
"At retirement, if you deposit $10,000 every year in a pension fund."
"Now, if you are really young, say, you are fifteen and taking this class which I hope some of you are, don't worry too much about retirement, you know, have some fun."
"You're in high school, you haven't even be gun earning hopefully, just having fun."
"So, but this is something that you will do at some point, most people do."
"So, what I would recommend is just think of it as an intellectual problem but actually it's a very rare problem."
"So, what will be the value pf your portfolio over time and you deposit $10,000 every year in a pension fund?"
What is a pension fund?
"Pension fund is a place or an account which hopefully has multiple assets, if you're risk averse."
"Multiple kinds of investments, a bond, a stock, and we'll talk about those."
"You put $10,000 every year, why 10,000 fixed amount?"
"Well, nothing is forcing you to put 10,000 every year."
"It can be 11,000 one year, 9,000 the other."
"But oddly enough, to make life simple perhaps, many people tend to put away a certain amount of money every year for things they need in the future."
"So, the notion of a pension fund is at some point I'm going to retire and I need some money."
"So, you put away 10,000 every year."
"You plan to retire in about 40 years, and expect to earn eight percent on your portfolio."
Basically we're getting a lot of donations.
And with those donations we're using to buy supplies and food for everyone.
This is our dish washing area.
"And we have feeding tables here, it's like a buffet."
And all our storage is in the center.
And that's our donation area over there.
"The importance of having a strong media presence is unquestioinable, i mean, we need to have very powerful, positive media representation."
"And if we're not getting it from the mainstream media outlets,"
Then we've got to do it and create it ourselves.
"We're not allowed to erect any structures here in the plaza, so we're not allowed to put up any tents, we're not allowed to hang anything from the trees,"
"So when it rains, we pretty much just have to cover everything with tarps."
"We have one generator, I think another one just came recently,"
"We're running laptops, recharging batteries, recharging cell phones."
"We have a bunch of shooters, people out filming, who have signed up for different shifts, or have basically just showed up and said,"
"""Look, i have a camera, I'm ready to film."""
"We send them out to go film a workshop, or a march or a protest, whatever, and then they come back and we have an ingest department, where they ingest the footage, transcode it, whatever needs to be done,"
"And then give it to an editor, who either edits here, or in an off-campus location to bring it back to upload."
[protester]
I love my freedoms and this is my street!
I won't be surrendering because I have freedom in my streets!
"Yeah, we'll focus on that, all right?"
"Let me know if it's too much pressure or not, all right?"
"It's a stressfull environment, you're always going to have people kind of itching for some kind of confrontation, and this is anti-confrontational."
"This really can do a lot for people, you know?"
"Bring down stress levels, and you think differently, you speak differently, so if they're in a confrontation with someone else here because they've been sleeping out here for two weeks, or a police officer or a heckler, they might handle it in a calmer, more rational way."

"Alright, so hopefully you used some tools to make that a little bit simpler for you."
"If we load up the developer tools here, we can see that we've already got a syntax error."
"And if we go over, and click right here on line 28, and it'll take us right to where the offending error is."
"But they can be very substantial victims, I mean, in this case in Afghanistan, individual soldiers who have lost their lives, have lost all their life."
However it is true that the kill ratios for this war are disturbing.
"So, the event that I just showed you before, of 181 people being killed,"
There was one US soldier who died versus 181 people who were claimed to be Taliban.
When you have kill ratios like that war becomes indiscriminate.
And when the vehicles for killing are aerial
"AC130 Gunships or Apaches, you really have a video game."
Because you press the button and you see an explosion and there's very little effect on you.
Everyday people walk down the street and step on ants and no one pays too much attention because ants can't defend themselves.
"So we, I think, should actually never be in a position where militaries are so unequal in their relationship because that leads inevitably to abuse."
Ann please.
Thank you.
My name is Ann Linda.
I'm from the Social Democratic Party and I have two questions.
"One is the most attention has been given to those leaks that have been about war, in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"Are you intentionally trying to get [your] most attention to these or are you also trying to get attention, for example, on exploitation, child work, or forced labor, or things like that."
Or is it peace and war that are
Wikileaks' main area of concentration?
"And the second question is do you care how the material you get is gotten, in a way?"
"And the question is because in Sweden, to simplify it, if you are in authority and say something to journalists, the authorities cannot see from where the leak is."
That's forbidden.
"But if someone is trying to break in to get the same material, then it's forbidden."
And they could be taken to court.
Do you care if somebody breaks in to get the material or do you only take material that someone on the inside has given to you?
Yea.
"For focus, we are very clear to prospective whistleblowers and journalists or other people who have been censored what we do and do not do."
I think that is one of our strengths as a media organization is that we do not see ouselves as merely representing an opinion and then looking for news that backs up that opinion.
Rather we see our role as representatives of people who have information to provide the public.
We see our role like lawyers.
Lawyers represent their clients to a court and to a jury.
"We represent sources, whistleblowers and people whose freedom of speech is under threat to the jury of public opinion."
And so we try and get as much impact for their material as possible.
"""This is unbelievable information."""
"And as I began to move through this,"
I realized that we spend more on healthcare in this country than any other country in the world.
And that disease doesn't know party lines.
Cancer doesn't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat.
We spend 16 cents of every dollar in this country managing disease.
"And as I thought about that, I thought,"
"""None of us can do everything, but all of us can do something."""
"And right now, we've got this prototype, this new technology in our food supply."
"And I thought, it's kind of like the fax machine - you know, maybe it served its purpose there for a while, but the two products that it's brought us have allowed an increased spraying of weedkiller, and for something to produce its own insecticide, and maybe it's time for a new technology."
"Because right now, these farmers, they sign End User Agreements, where they have to license the use of this technology, they're charged royalty fees, trait fees, licensing fees."
I spent time with these guys on their farms - and this is not the farming that their grandfathers did.
"At the same time, the Department of Justice is investigating this stuff because of the monopolistic practices, the way that these seed companies can increase their prices five to ten percent in order to drive shareholder return."
"And while none of us can do everything, all of us can do one thing."
Because each and every single one of us has something that we are uniquely good at.
"And when you leverage that with something that you're passionate about, you can create extraordinary change."
"And as I leaned into this - you know people were trying to call me an activist, and they were trying to call me an advocate - and I just thought none of those terms hit me quite right, because I realized that this was so totally inspired by love."
"And I thought, what do you call people who are working and totally inspired by love to restore the health of our country, and to create a better way?"
"And I realized that our country was founded on that spirit, and that you really simply call us citizens."
"And so I invite you to lend your talents, to find a friend, so that together, we can create the change that we want to see in the health of our families, and the health of our food system, and in the health of our country."
Thank you.
(Applause)
"hehehe, yeah baby ! alright then... what are your thoughts on driving the car? what is your reaction?"
"Very possibly, the fastest car I've ever been in - unbelievable unbelievable - really like a rock, specially that second gear shift it is like the front wheels come off the ground,"
"I think, i'm speechless - it is amazing !"
Not bad for a car that was engineer to try to be efficient - yeah
Yeah - Close the mind !
No reason why efficiency has to be boring.
That much is clear...
Wait!
The crates from the Juarez are in the hold.
We gotta get to a phone.
"Just like we said there's a set of pizza and movies, all of which leave you indifferent."
How do you decide which pizza and movies to choose?
"Well, you bring in the relative price of pizza and movies."
"Here, we're going to bring in the relative price of capital and labor to determine how we choose between capital and labor."
"So to do that, we're going to draw isocost lines which are going to be just like our old budget constraints."
"Isocost lines which represent the cost of different combinations of inputs, just like our old budget constraint represented the cost of different consumption goods."
"So if you look at figure 9-1, here we're going to have isocost curves which are going to represent-- and we're going to assume here that the wage is $5 an hour, and the rental rate is $10 per unit of capital."
"So, in other words, the $50 isocost line in figure 9-1 shows all combinations of labor and capital that cost $50."
"So you could spend $50 in production if you had 10 units of labor, and no units of capital."
"Or five units of capital, and no units of labor, or any combination in between."
These are all the combinations of labor and capital that cost $50.
"Likewise, the $100 isocost is all combinations of labor and capital that cost $100."
So each of these isocosts give you the combination of inputs that cost a certain amount.
Just like a budget constraint gave you the combination of pizza and movies on which you spent your income.
"Now, you may have said well, wait a second, the difference with consumers is we knew their income so we knew what their budget constraint is."
"Here we don't know whether to choose the $50 cost, the $100 cost, $150."
We don't know what the total amount is.
"That's what makes firms hard, that's why we have an extra step."
"So hold that thought, we'll come back to that next lecture."
"For now, let's just say there's a set of trade-offs that the firm can choose from, and a set of isoquants that they have."
And what's the slope of this isocost line?
It's the negative of the wage rental ratio.
The slope of the isocost is minus w over r.
The slope is minus w over r.
"It's basically the trade-off between labor and capital's going to be determined by the relative prices of those inputs, so slope is going to be minus w over r."
"So basically, how many units of capital do you have to give up to get the next unit of labor?"
"Well, what this isocost tells you is you have to give up 1/2 a unit of capital to get a unit of labor."
So the slope is minus 1/2.
"Likewise, you could say you have to give up two units of"
labor to get one unit of capital.
"So that's why the slope is minus 1/2, that's what it's telling us."
"Once again, budget constraints are about opportunity costs."
"I can expect that maybe a lot a lot of this will get better in the future, but as of right now, it's really not the ideal viewing situation for those of us who are trying to engage our audience and trying to, and trying to interact with them and illicit feedback and all that kind of stuff."
I'd love to hear from you guys what you think some of the impact that smart TVs will have on our audience development and the content that we make here on YouTube and all that.
Comment below and let me know!
I'd love to interact and dialogue with you guys there.
"Also, if this is your first time hanging out, make sure you subscribe."
"We're continually talking about news and things and changes happening and the online video industry and what that means for those of us who are online video creators, so make sure you click on subscribe button."
"Got a lot of awesome stuff coming for you guys like Google Hangouts and an eBook and a whole bunch of stuff, so make sure you also check us out on Facebook and all the other"
"links there below, Google Plus and all that kind of stuff for sure."
"So, looking forward to hanging out with you guys more and"
"I'll talk to you guys soon, bye."
I started working with a boy who had just got expelled from school.
He had an interest in computers and at my office I noticed that there was a few lying around that nobody was using.
I got it to this kid and it completely turned things around for him.
Since that time we have been able to help thousands of people.
Eighty percent of the people that get a computer system from us have never had one before.
It's the ability to do a job search.
It's the ability to write a resume.
It's the ability to have access to the internet.
"By donating their equipment, local businesses and individuals get to be a part of that."
So many times a business or organization will spend thousands of dollars to get rid of their computer equipment.
For us we pick it up at no charge.
All those chemicals don't end up polluting the environment and the best part of being it gets to someone whos never had anything.
As this program has evolved we have established relationships with local colleges.
"Its a good learning experience for student interns, and work study students and service learning students."
The mission of PCs for people is pretty simple.
We basically try to help provide some hope and opportunity for people.
I think it is important for people to have the opportunity that everyone else has.
It's the right thing to do.
Let's write 0.8 as a fraction.
So 0.8... the 8 right over here is in the tenths place.
It is the tenths place.
So you can read this as 8 tenths and we can write that literally as being equal to 8 tenths or 8 over 10.
Can you get enough players?
Can you get enough of the pieces to go?
"And if you offer a sufficiently compelling value proposition and a real differentiator, these things can grow big very quickly."
"I think the lesson of the Internet is that new businesses can grow very, very quickly when you get just the right combination of things and you get scale. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"And in the mobile internet, we have it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Yeah.
We clearly have had that this year.
"And, by the way, we've been waiting for years, so we've talked about this for a long time."
"So, again, in the â€˜What's New,' I think it's finally there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Who would've thought that the best signet that could've ever happened to the mobile Internet is that the growth was constrained by the carriers in their decks for so long and that it would happen to get traction at the time when the economy was very tough? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"And one of the interesting things about the carriers is the carriers are looking for new sources of data revenue and, you know, you asked earlier about the netbooks?"
"Some of the carriers are saying, ""Well, why don't we subsidize all of these different kinds of devices in the same way that they do with mobile phones today?"" Everybody understands the mobile phone plans, and they're subsidized, and so forth, to get those things out of there."
"And, again, that's another new thing that I think will serve as an accelerant to an already exciting industry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Any questions? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
Thanks.
Greg sort of crossed specific capital.
Mary mentioned Japan as really leading in the mobile Internet.
And I wanted to understand what you're optimistic about in terms of other countries that are coming along.
Certainly it's not this country.
"But other countries that you think would follow the footsteps of Japan with mobile advertising, other revenue?"
Second question is what is your venture capital and M&amp;amp;A strategy going forward? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"With Japan, we have now partnerships, I think, with two of the three, or the three, depending on exactly how you define the leading mobile providers."
And the monetization is excellent.
"And so when you get it right, when you have the right ad product and the right search product on the right device and, of course, Japan, the products themselves are all different."
"Anyone who has spent their, tried to get your own phone to work on their networks, so we know that as a proof point."
And that's been true for a couple of years.
"So, we're now attempting to replicate those kinds of deals."
The obvious prize will be China because of the simple volume there.
"There's enough growth in CPMs and, basically, application use and wireless data networks in China that that's sort of the next really, really big one."
"The penetration for mobile devices in Europe is very strong, but the economies are not so strong."
We'll wait and see what happens there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
You mentioned-- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
We got from here that the source of the paradox is the simultaneity issue in the Garage's frame.
Indeed the ladder is contained in the garage.
In the
"ladder's frame, this never happens and the reason is that simultaneity is relative, and because the ladder is moving, the relativity of simultaneity means that at the same time, that say, the left hand entered the garage, in the ladder's frame the right hand was already out, okay?"
"So, what's our graphic representation?"
"Well here's our graphic representation, this is already familiar."
"I was here careful to remind myself that I'm plotting CT, so the red line that goes off at 45 degrees is the world line of a light beam."
"You don't need a light beam here, but it helps me to draw the t prime, CT prime and x prime axis so that the light cone bisects them."
"And what I have here, these two black lines to represent the garage These two blue lines represent the world lines."
X prime equal to zero is the T prime axis.
And x prime equals to L is the bold line of the right side of the garage and so this point here is X prime equal to L and.
"Both sides of the garage are moving, of the ladder are moving."
Both sides of the garage are stationary.
"I may have called the ladder a garage, but hopefully you understand what I am saying by now, and you're used to my ambiguity."
A word on scales in these diag rams and a very important point.
"So, suppose that I were to draw a grid of lines so these are lines of constant t, these are lines of constant x and some units so these are, and, and"
I've picked the unit so they are compatible.
"In other words, that if in some units this is one, two, three, four so my garage in this case is precisely four units long."
"Then CT is also one, two, three, four and you can see that because these, these things intersect the 45 degree."
Light count.
And so I've drawn these.
"How do I draw the point, t prime = to one?"
Where along the t prime axis is t prime = to one? and one way to think about it.
"One, naive way, is to just measure this same length along this axis."
"And because it is, The axis is, is, not vertical."
That would lead you to some point.
Around here and you'd maybe try to set that as t prime equals the one and that would be incorrect.
"The point is that the distance along this axis, in general, distances in this 2-dimensional plot are completely meaningless. well, how do you measure distances?"
"Well, the distance is this, between any two points."
"Is the square root of the difference in x squared, the horizontal difference, plus the vertical difference squared."
"That's, the Pythagorean Theorem which applies very well to the Euclidean surface of this A tablet upon which I am drawing it or to this Euclidean surface of this slide, but this is not a physical quantity."
"In particular, there is no reason why it isn't all related to x prime squared plus c^2 t prime squared."

"Before we can look at the paint, we have to undress it, what we call stripping the wax off."
"Now, if you guys remember back in the first episode when we cleaned the Audi R8 Blackbird, we talked about dish soap versus car soap."
"Now, 99% of the time, you want to use car soap."
Why?
Because you want to leave all the wax on the car.
"In this particular case, you actually want to use dish soap, because it removes all the wax, and then you can actually see what's going on in the paint."
"Stripping the wax is essential for paint correction and requires a little more than switching from soft car soap to strong dish soap, and of course, following the same steps as you normally would when cleaning your car."
Add a few squirts of dish soap to your clean wash bucket and/or foam gun.
Then rinse down the paint with hose water to remove the loose dirt.
"Next, use the foam gun or the wash mitt to apply the dish soap that will emulsify the wax, uncovering the paint beneath it."
"Once the car is completely washed, use your clay bar, along with the wash mitt and the dish soap as a"
"lubrication, and remove any contaminants that may remain embedded in the paint after the initial cleaning."
"Now, we can be sure the surface is uncovered, or what we call naked paint, so that we can see how bad the scratches really are without waxes or silicones hiding them."
"Now, that the car's been stripped, what I like to do is use my crazy tools here to inspect the paint at the microscopic level."
"What that does is it shows me what's going on and how bad the paint is, and it helps me approach it and fix it or repair it in the best and fastest way."
"Mind you, these may not be necessary for the weekend warrior, but I still think they're pretty cool."
All right.
"So the first thing I have here is an assortment of lights, and my favorite one is this Brinkmann Dual Xenon light."
"Now, what I do, is I use it by shining it right here on the quarter panel, and I can see any of the swirls that are present."
"Remember, we removed all the wax, so what I'm seeing is actually there."
This is a great tool for visualizing how bad the damage is.
The second little tool I like to use is my infrared thermometer.
"Now, what I do is I shine it at the paint."
"Right now, it's telling me it's 83.5 degrees."
"Now, anything under 100 degrees is usable, meaning I can actually work on the paint here."
"If it's above 100 degrees, it's too hot for me."
"So I'll let it cool down, or I'll put some water on it, or"
I'll pull it inside the garage.
"Now, the reason why you want it so cool is the products happen to flash, meaning they burn up too fast, and it reduces the rate of abrasion that you can use to fix the paint."
So this is a very useful tool to figure out what temperature you're at.
"Now, the most useful tool I have is the PosiTector paint depth gauge."
And yet all the silver in the mines of Potosi couldn't help the inexorable economic and political decline of Spain's empire.
Why was that when Pizarro seemed to have struck it so incredibly rich?
The answer is that the Spaniards had dug up so much silver to finance their wars of conquest that the metal itself suffered an extraordinary decline in value.
More silver coins didn't make Spain richer.
They simply made prices higher as an increased quantity of money chased the same amount of goods.
What the Spaniards didn't get was that money is only worth what other people will give in exchange for it.
"And whether money takes the form of silver coins, sea shells, bars of gold, or bank notes, that's been true from Ancient times right down to the present day."
Even lumps of clay can work better than silver coins if people have enough confidence in them.
"In Ancient Mesopotamia, nearly 4 000 years ago, people used clay tablets, like these ones, to commit themselves to particular financial transactions."
"For example, this one, found a little southwest of Baghdad, specifies that a debtor will repay a lender 330 measures of grain on the harvest day."
But this one's even more fascinating because what it says is that a debt of 4 measures of barley should be repaid to the bearer of the clay tablet.
And it's that idea of repayment to the bearer that really fascinates me.
"If the phrase sounds familiar, then it should."
Just take a look at the 20 pound note.
Bank notes have next to no intrinsic worth.
"They're simply promises to pay just like the clay tablets of Ancient Babylon, 4 millennia ago."
"On the back of the 10 dollar bill, it says ""In God We Trust""."
But it's not really God you're trusting in.
"By swapping your goods or your labour for a fistful of these things, you're trusting the U.S. Treasury Secretary not to repeat Spain's mistake and produce so many of the damn things that by the time you come to spend them, they're worth even less than the paper they're printed on."
"Today, we're quite happy with paper money."
"Even more amazingly, we're happy with money we can't even see."
Millions of dollars pass through this woman's hands every day.
"Or rather, across her computer screen."
"She's a foreign exchange dealer, whose business is literally buying and selling money."
"Each day, around $3 trillion changes hands in transaction like these around the world."
And it's all built on trust.
It has to be when you can't even touch the stuff.
That's what the Conquistadors got wrong.
"They failed to see that money is about trust, even faith; trust in the person paying you the money; trust in the central bank issuing the money; trust in commercial bank that honours the cheque."
Money isn't metal.
It's trust inscribed.
"And it doesn't much matter what it's inscribed on-- paper, silver, clay, or a screen-- provided the recipient believes in it."
"So, the eight%, the higher returns, the more likely it is that you are jumping all over the place, like the stock market."
"So, if you want to be safer, what you have to do?"
"You have to lower the interest rate to say, four%."
"Put it in a bond issued by the government, in the long run, and you'll be safer."
But what will happen to the 2.59 million?
Do this exercise for yourself.
"Let's, after this class is over, use four percent instead of eight%."
And what will you see?
A dramatic drop in the amount of money that you have at the end.
"So, what, why am I emphasizing so much in one little problem?"
"Because that's what Finance's beauty is, you know."
"If you understand these problems inside out, and you know how to use the Excel spreadsheet to calculate the answer, you've arrived."
"So, if you use four%, what happens?"
You kind of get rid of your nervousness about risk.
But what happens to the amount of money you have?
"It'll drop dramatically, right?"
We know that.
We know the power of compounding.
"It helps when an interest rate goes up, it hurts when it goes down."
"So, having said that, if the interest rate is four%, you're going to suffer."
"What, what can you say about the eight%, four percent choice?"
Neither one is good or bad.
Neither one is good or bad.
"What's important is you have control over the four and the eight in the following sense, not that you can predict it but you, if you choose to put four percent in your calculations, it has to be matched by your investment strategy."
"So, if you are thinking you're going to earn eight percent and put it in the bank, especially today, and if this low interest rates go on, you're dreaming."
"You'll have closer to $400,000, if the bank is still there after 40 years, right?"
"So, so think"
like that.
"Everything is under your control and the beauty of markets is for most of us, we do not need to second guess what the interest rates are."
All we need to do is match our preferences of risk with our investment strategy and then not worry about it too much.
"Hi, wo shi"
"We now know what an oxidation state or and oxidation number is and what it means when things are oxidized or reduced and lets see how that actually happens in reactions so what we're going to study is this video is oxidation/reduction reactions and all that is a reaction where somebody is being oxidized, which means electroons are being taken away from them, and someone's being reduced, which means they are being handed electrons or they are taking electrons away from someone else, and sometimes this has been termed, because you have the red in reduction and you have the ox in oxidation an they switch them around and they call i it a redox reaction, and it sounds like a very fancy chemistry term but it just means a reaction where something is getting oxidized and if something is getting oxidized, something else is getting reduced, so lets study a bunch of them."
But that's going to be ok because I'm not going to be a moving target.
I'm going to rest my hand on top of my hand to go into my patient.
"So that's ok, there's no way I'm going to stick myself here."
I'm not moving toward my hand.
"So with a 90 degree angle, a nice smooth motion I'm going to inject the medicine the length of the needle into the patient's muscle."
Move my nondominant hand to hold the barrel of the syringe.
Aspirate by pulling back up on the plunger.
Check for blood return.
No blood return.
Administer my medication slowly.
"I draw my needle and I can message it a little bit here, ok?"
This needle is now dirty; it is not recapped.
Toss it in your patient's sharps box.
Ok.
So then I would reposition my patient and do my documentation.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; In this module we're going to introduce Martingales.
Martingales play a very important role in finance.
"They won't play a hugely important role in this course, but they will crop up now and again and it's worthwhile understanding what they are and seeing one or two examples of Martingales."
"We're going to have the following definition of a Martingale, a random process, Xn is a martingale, with respect to the information filtration Fn and probability distribution P, if these two conditions are satisfied."
The first condition is just a technical integrability condition which states that the expected value of the absolute value of Xn must be finite for all n.
"The really important condition, is condition two here, which states that the expected value of Xn plus m, given Fn, is equal to Xn for all nm greater than or equal to 0."
A quick comment on what I mean by information filtration.
"So the information filtration, Fn, is just a complicated way of recognizing the information we have at time n."
So Fn will denote all of the information in our model that we know at time n.
"So usually, you will actually, it'd be the case that Fn is equal to the information given to you by X1 up to Xn."
"So basically, it's just recognizing that at time n, we've already seen the values"
X1 up to Xn.
"Returning to condition two here, we see that what this is really saying, is that the expected value of X, at any time in the future, is equal to its current value today."
"And so, Martingales have often been used to, to model what are called fair games, they've got a rich history in gambling, for example."
"Because this condition here, models the idea of a fair game, so your future pay-off, or your expected future pay-off, is equal to your current wealth today, Xm."
"We define a sub martingale, by replacing condition two with a greater than or equal to sign, And we define a super martingale by replacing condition two with a less than or equal to sign."
A martingale then is both a sub martingale and a super martingale.
Computers allowed us to generate digital contents.
Internet has allowed us to share those contents.
Nowadays more than ever before we have access to tools that allow us to understand our reality and to transform it.
"By backing this project you will collaborate to make ""smart cities"" being produced by smart citizens."
"Hello, my name is Martin Hausenblas and I'd like to thank you."
"By now there are more than 45,000 marketers in more than 170 countries worldwide."
"Thanks to your hard work, taxi drivers and passengers have also begun registering."
The highest priority now is to launch Liftago in the first 4 markets:
"Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania."
"The better we launch in these markets, the easier and faster the launch will be in the markets that follow."
Today I'd like to answer some of your questions and also show you the Liftago Taxi app for the first time!
"Before I start, I'd like to point out that the key to success is the understanding of our product and the way we do business."
That's why I'd like to ask you to carefully go over the materials we provide in our newsletters and on our website.
"If you haven't taken a look at them yet, please do so now."
Now to address your questions.
When is the launch of the Liftago service?
"We are launching the service in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania in June."
We'll keep you updated about the launch timing for the next markets.
Our aim was to launch the service a couple of weeks ago.
"Unfortunately though, software development is not as predictable as we'd like it to be, especially when developing such an innovative service as Liftago Taxi, together with our Liftago Community Business."
Currently we have been field-testing the apps and there's still some fine-tuning of features ahead of us before we can launch the service.
What happens after the launch of Liftago Taxi?
"First of all, we'll celebrate!"
"More importantly, the true work will begin."
"We'll launch the full version of the Liftago website for passengers, drivers, and marketers."
We'll launch the apps and send a download link for Google Play or the App Store with your invite code to all of your pre-registered members.
How do we know that a new member belongs to your community?
The key to that is in the invite code.
You've already been using your invite code to register new marketers or to pre-register new taxi drivers and passengers.
"If you don't know how to use it, take a look at our materials on our website."
"After the launch, share your invite link through www.liftago.com, and also directly from the Liftago apps in various forms, such as QR code, sms, e-mail, or social media."
"Users can install our apps also without the invite code, but it will be much easier for them to simply click on your invite link."
So what we are seeing is that maybe we're just discounting kids too early and we are assessing them at the wrong times.
And it is kind of a predetermined future if you do it that way.
Tom:
How did we loose our way in this country when it came to science education?
Tom:
How did we loose our way when comes to science education in this country?
"When I was a younger guy, the Russians were beating us into Space so a lot of people went into Engineering, went into Sciences."
The Space Race helped accelerate all of that.
"But then we lost our way, it seems to me, in the last part of the 20th century."
Sal:
"You know, I think that it has just been bad branding."
"I think, you know its funny, because Science and Engineering are fundamentally creative professions."
"I mean 'engineering', the word 'engineering' is to build things that have never been built before."
"And the way it's shown and the way, and all of the hoops that you have to jump through in your education, make it look like its a non-creative field, but when you look at it in the real world, it is a very creative field."
"So I think the real thing is to get more kids engaged, to show them that 1) the math and science itself is beautiful and it tells us more about the universe, or as much about the universe, as philosophy or anything else."
"It really is a form of philosophy and not only that, but the end point you're going to isn't a boring job."
"It is a creative job, it is redefining what people's experiences are."
"I think that if you do it that way,"
I think that a lot of more people will want to get into it.
Tom:
"I take of Cyber Space is the new second 'Big Bang', we're creating this new universe our there, just like we did with the physical first bang."
"And one of the things that's happening is that we're watching all these planets which one is going to drift too close to the sun, which ones are going to form together and form new lifeforms."
"As you look at your model which has been successful, have you already began to think: how can we expand that model to other areas?"
Sal:
"Yeah, we've already thought about it."
"So you know that we have the videos I do right now and we have this whole software platform and I think the interesting thing is we are going to start branching off from mathematics, our videos already cover the things in biology and economics and all the rest."
"But our exercise platform: try to do economics, physics, chemistry, and then start to think about how can we do the humanities?"
How can we give people the basic scaffold of say American History?
"And then I think it would be really interesting to see how we can do things like creative writing, where people are doing projects and maybe they can peer review each others essays and things like that."
I think that there is a whole universe that we are just beginning to explore.
Tom:
Well we look forward to your exploration.
"Then, it is simply a question of, are your risky or you're unrisky? it's more complex than that."
"So, as an example of risk and risk perception and acceptance we can take a look at Facebook. this was a firm started by a college student in the U.S. in 2004 that was based initially on an idea that he had in high school. he'd launched this social networking platform at Harvard."
"Within two weeks, had half the student body signed up."
Quickly grew that to 30 other colleges in the region.
Moved to Silicon Valley.
"Partnered with Sean Parker of Napster, and really began to grow in scale the firm."
"They were able to go out and successfully raise some venture capital in the context of, initially,"
Angel Investment.
"And then later, larger traditional VC funding at evaluation of $100 million shortly after the firm was launched."
"So, very rapid growth."
"They continued to grow the firm and expanded it into serving high school students, and expanded their feature side as well of photo sharing."
"They then raised significant rounds of funding thereafter, and had a much greater val uation."
"Shortly before this, the firm was viewed as being worth $100 million based on future profit potential, and now they are over $500 million."
"And they were supporting anyone with an email account, and so they have grown from the college niche to high school, to now anyone that wanted to be a member."
"They then were offered a $750 million to be acquired, to be bought, to be owned by Viacom, and Mark"
Zuckerberg and the Facebook team declined.
"Earlier that summer, they had a $one billion."
"Shortly thereafter, Viacom attempted to acquire the company for 750 million."
Zuckerberg and the Facebook team declined.
"A few months later, a billion dollar offer, declined."
"The following year, Microsoft $240 million investment for 1.6% of the company making Facebook worth $fifteen billion based on that investment."
"500 million members signed, and one billion in revenue achieved."
And all of that happened in a span of approximately six years.
"So, in that way, what we see is rapid growth and to grow the company at such a high scale. there were multiple opportunities to be bought and to be acquired that were turned down, and the expectation of the Facebook team is that there were greater upside ahead."
"So, with that, when we look at risk it's easy to be risky when the stakes are low."
"But, when you are working in a high stake situation, we want to think about, well, again what are we risking?"
Is it financial?
Is it safety?
Is it ethics? so all of these certainly play a role.
"Within entrepreneurs, there's not an element of, again, seeking risk but it's more about perception and capability and what they see as a relative return."
"So, when we look at entrepreneurial motivation this is certainly central to understanding how entrepreneurs make decisions and how they perceive risk."
And there are three factors involved with that.
And then you only have one kid.
"If you were more like cows, you might have taken us over by now."
"Little did you know, but the greatest evolutionary advantage: being useful to humans."
"Like, here is a graph of cow population."
And here is a graph of elephant population.
"Elephants, if you had just inserted yourselves in the human life like cows did you could have used your power and intelligence to form secret elephant societies conspiring against the humans."
"And then you could have risen up and destroyed us, and made an awesome elephant world, and elephant cars, and elephant planes."
"It would've been so great, but no...you gotta be pregnant for 22 months and just have one kid."
So annoying!
"Best wishes, John Green."
But back to the agricultural revolution and why it occurred.
"Historians don't know for sure, of course, because there are no written records."
But they love to make guesses.
"Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture even though it was more work, or abundance gave people more leisure to experiment with domestication or planting originated as a fertility rite - or as some historians have argued - people needed to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol."
"Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists, believed agriculture was an accident, saying:"
"""A wild and unusually good variety of native plant might attract the attention of some wise, old savage"""
"Off-topic: but in will know in the coming weeks, that the definitions of ""savage"" tends to be ""not me""."
"Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't really an agricultural revolution at all, but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary desire to eat more."
"Like, early hunter/gatherers knew that seeds germinate when planted."
"And when you find something that makes food, you want to do more of it."
Unless it is this food.
Then you want to do less of it.
I kind of wanna to spit it out.
That's much better.
"So, early farmers who would find the most successful forms of wheat and plant them, and experiment with them, not because they were trying to start an agricultural revolution, because they were like,"
"""You know what would be awesome?"
"More food!"""
"Like, on this topic we have evidence that more than 13,000 years ago humans in Southern Greece were domesticating snails"
"In the Franchthi Cave there is a huge pile of snail shells, most of them are larger than current snail, suggesting that people who ate them were selectively breeding them to be bigger and more nutritious."
"Snails make excellent domesticated food, by the way, because A, surprisingly nutritious, and B, they are easy to carry since they came in their own suitcases."
"And C, to imprison them, you just have to scratch a ditch around their living quarters."
That's not really a revolution.
"Now for all but the longest wavelengths, a radio telescope is just a dish, much like the main mirror of an optical telescope."
"But because radio waves are so much longer than visible light-waves, the surface of the dish doesn't have to be nearly as smooth as the surface of a mirror."
And that's the reason why it's so much easier to build a large radio telescope than it is to build a large optical telescope.
"Also, at radio wavelengths, it is much easier to do interferometry."
"That is, to increase the level of detail that can be seen by combining the light from two separate telescopes, as if they were part of a single, giant dish."
"The Very Large Array in New Mexico, for example, consists of 27 separate antennas, each measuring 25 metres across."
"Now each antenna can be moved around individually, and in its most extended configuration the virtual dish mimicked by the array measures 36 kilometres across."
So what does the Universe look like in the radio?
"Well, for a start our Sun shines very brightly at radio wavelengths."
So does the centre of our Milky Way galaxy.
But there's more.
Pulsars are very dense stellar corpses that emit radio waves only into a very narrow beam.
"In addition, they rotate at speeds of up to several hundred revolutions per second."
"So in effect, a pulsar looks like a rotating radio lighthouse."
And what we see from them is a very regular and fast sequence of very short radio pulses.
Hence the name.
The radio source known as Cassiopeia A is in fact the remnant of a supernova that exploded in 17th century.
"Centaurus A, Cygnus A and Virgo A are all giant galaxies that pour out huge amount of radio waves."
Each galaxy is powered by a massive black hole at its centre.
Some of these radio galaxies and quasars are so powerful that their signals can still be detected from a distance of 10 billion light-years.
"And then there's the faint, relatively short-wavelength radio hiss that fills the entire Universe."
This is known as the cosmic microwave background and it is the echo of the Big Bang.
The very afterglow of the hot beginnings of the Universe.
Each and every part of the spectrum has its own story to tell.
"At millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths, astronomers study the formation of galaxies in the early Universe and the origin of stars and planets in our own Milky Way."
But most of this radiation is blocked by water vapour in our atmosphere.
"To observe it, you need to go high and dry."
"To Llano de Chajnantor, for example."
"At five kilometres above sea level, this surrealistic plateau in northern Chile is the construction site of ALMA: the Atacama Large Millimetre Array."
"When completed in 2014, ALMA will be the largest astronomical observatory ever built."
"64 antennas, each weighing 100 tonnes, will work in unison."
"Giant trucks will spread them out over an area as large as London to increase the detail of the image, or bring them close together to provide a wider view."
"Also, we saw the invention of computer gaming, and the computer game authors pretty quickly realized that having READ statements didn't work for most games, that you wanted a different way of organizing the program so that it could be more responsive."
"But the mainstream didn't see much of this until, say, 1984, when the Macintosh came out."
"The Macintosh was the first mainstream product that got in front of mainstream programmers with this radically new idea of how to do interactive programs, which was not based on READ but on event loops; a radically different way of writing programs."
Were the programmers happy to have this new model?
"No, they were quite unhappy."
You have to write programs inside out!
Waa.
"Nobody can do that, it's too hard."
It's just not the way God intended us to write programs.
We should go back to the command line as he intended.
"So Apple had to work really hard to try to convince programmers no, really, it's OK, you can be successful writing in this model."
"They released a program called Mac App, which was a template of a Pascal program that already came with an event loop built into it with prototypes for setting up menus and things like that, so all you had to do was hook your logic into it."
"That was just too hard, it was rejected."
"It looked like Macintosh was not going to be the big success that it turned out to be, except for one thing:"
HyperCard.
"Bill Atkinson had this little multilayer paint program with a silly little scripting language in it, and suddenly everything took off because non-programmers could be incredibly productive with HyperCard."
"They could get a stack -- that's what they called programs at that time -- and they could open it up and look at the scripts inside of it and fiddle with them, and make wonderful things happen."
"In fact, there were thousands of stacks running around the world, most of them being written by people who had no business programming, just because it was fun and easy."
"After that the professionals kind of went oh, OK, I guess it's not that hard, we could probably do that."
Then we saw an explosion of programs for Macintosh and Windows when a new generation of programmers were finally able to work with the event loop.
HyperCard worked because it was all about events.
You didn't have to build an event
"loop; it was built in, it just worked."
All you had to write were the event handlers.
"A program -- again, a stack -- was just a collection of event handlers attached to things"
like cards and buttons and fields.
And the events could bubble up — that's how it did delegation.
"It called it inheritance, but it really wasn't inheritance."
It had events
"like on mouseUp and on keyDown, on cardEnter, which would be equivalent, say, to on load today."
"And on idle, which got fired whenever the event queue was empty."
I don't think they knew what people were going to use that for.
"They run the first 10 minutes of the film, and then they stop it dead... and then they run commercials on the screen, and they have a break... where they walk up and down selling ice cream sandwiches and pop corn... completely interrupting the movie."
"And I remember the first time I witnessed that, I turned to someone in the audience and asked..."
"""How many pauses are we going to have to sit through?"""
"And they said, ""just one."" But it's a real interruption."
"So this is a practice that's been going on for a long time in Europe, and now it's come to America."
Why?
Because theater chains are in trouble.
Theater chains just aren't making as much money as they should on their films...
"And also you have to realize that studios have what's called a ""90/10 split"" on the first week."
Most of money goes to the studio.
Only 10% goes to the theater.
"And since most movies these days are what's called ""front loading""..."
They make all of their money in the first couple of weeks...
"Even though the split increases for the theater as it goes out into the second and third and fourth week... or ""frame,"" as they call it in the business... it's just not that much money."
"So commercials, unfortunately I'm afraid, are here to stay."
"When a movie says it's going to start at 1:30, I usually show up a 1:45, and miss all of the commercials... and that's pretty much what I recommend that you do."
"Commercials are, unfortunately, part of the contemporary movie scene, and will stay that way..."
But it's necessary to maintain the theatrical experience... and that's what we really need to do to keep films in theaters.
"I'm Wheeler Winston Dixon, and this is Frame By Frame."
"If you look at the history of the world, a huge fraction of the improvements in the standard of living have come because private businesses have created new products, have given people jobs, have generated profits that raise people out of poverty and allow them to live fruitful and productive lives with reasonable standards of living."
"We can have much more of that, and it will have beneficial effects around the world, if we step back from the excessive regulation and have a much more capitalistic system."
"My name is Jeff Miron, and I'm Director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Economics at Harvard University."
I want to talk about three myths about capitalism.
The first is that being pro-capitalism is the same as being pro-business.
Nothing could be farther from the truth.
"The point of capitalism is to make sure that businesses have to compete vigorously against each other, and that benefits consumers."
It's not good for the businesses per se because they have to work really hard.
"So many businesses understand this, and they hate capitalism."
"They're constantly trying to get government to erect various rules, restrictions, regulations that help them, but they're not in the interest of the consumers."
So pro-capitalism is good for consumers.
That's who we're ultimately trying to help.
A second myth is that capitalism generates an unfair distribution of income.
"Now when you take your office as a doctor, if you want to see more patients in the short-run, they might be crammed into your office, and in the long-run you might build a bigger office."
"So in the short-run, how hard you work is variable."
"In the long-run, how big your office is is variable-- how many secretaries you hire, et cetera."
But your medical school spending is gone.
"That's not variable in the long-run, that's sunk."
"And that's a very important distinction is between basically these fixed costs, what we call fixed costs."
"Which are costs where, like the costs of the office and the machinery the physician uses, which can be changed over a 10-year period, versus sunk costs which once paid are gone forever."
"And the key reason, just to give you a hint about why these will matter, is because when firms set up this-- we may see firms in the market losing money."
You may see firms in the market losing money.
"In fact, in any point in time we see lots of firms in the market losing money."
"You might say, why don't they go out of business?"
The reason they don't go out of business is because they've already pay huge sunk costs.
It's not efficient to go out of business.
They've already invested a certain amount.
"It's not going to be efficient to go out of business, because then they'll give up the cost they've invested."
"So if you're a doctor, and you've spent all this money on med school, and you're not making money as a doctor in the first couple of years."
"If you quit and go do something else, you've just given up all the investment you made in med school."
"So if there's any prospect that eventually you'll make money, you might want to hang on and keep being a doctor."
So that's the difference between a fixed cost and a sunk cost.
"So I'm going to come back to that, but it's important to remember that distinction when we talk about competition."
"So let me stop there, and we'll come back on"
"Wednesday, I guess."
Have a good three-day weekend.
We'll come back on Wednesday and we'll talk about competition.
One of the things we of course are tremendously interested in is the whole idea of the Readymade.
We are familiar with the concept of junk sculpture.
"This is something that such artists as and even Picasso in earlier days more or less advanced, to pick up an object which was made for an entirely different use, possibly a discarded object, which because of its shape and its patination, its configuration, suggests another possibility."
"It may be a very satisfying texture, a very romantic kind of quality about the piece, in other words, it became a kind of chosen object but chosen for esthetic reasons."
In what respect does junk sculpture differ from the concept of the Readymade?
"Let's say for example, the Bottle Rack or the Bicycle Wheel?"
"This was of course the difficulty when it came to my mind but that was back in 1915, when I applied the word Readymade to these objects."
"In fact, I only made 13 of them in my life, in 40 years so it is not very much of an occupation."
Now what does statement two tell us?
6 of the cans sit exactly along the length of the carton.
"So they're telling us that these cans, there's 6 cans that fit right along the length, which we figured out from statement number one."
But that also gives you the same information as statement number one.
Because you know that these are cylindrical cans.
I think it's a safe assumption to say that these are circles.
Yeah.
"A cylinder, you're assuming that the tops are circles."
"So if you say that 6 can fit that way, then you know that the diameter of each of them is 8 centimeters and then you can make the same argument that the diameter's 8 centimeters to say that 4 can fit the other way down."
"So two, alone, is also sufficient by itself."
"So the answer is, what is that, C?"
"Both statements-- no D, each statement, alone, is sufficient."
See you in the next video.

Steven:
So this is a painting that really does show the opulence of imperial France.
The moment that's being represented is clearly intermission.
The chandelier has been lowered into the space of the audience.
"The lights are up, and so the audience's gaze has shifted from the stage to themselves."
Beth:
"So Cassatt's family, although it was very wealthy, actually her father refused to support her desire to be an artist, and although he paid for her basic living expenses, refused to support her art supplies and her studio where she painted."
Steven:
"This, despite real support from the leading artists of the day."
"She was a close friend of Degas, who had enormous respect for her ability, and she was an extraordinary painter, in every way a peer of the great impressionist painters in Paris."
Beth:
This painting displays a virtuoso technique.
"Mary Cassatt gained her knowledge of painting from a variety of sources, but it was difficult because she was a woman."
Steven:
"Her first formal classes were at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art, but women were not allowed to study from the nude, even from within the context of art school."
Beth:
"And like many artists of her generation, they moved to Paris where there was a little bit more freedom for women who were aspiring artists."
"Although she couldn't enter the Ăcole des Beaux-Arts because she was a woman, she did enter the private studio of several accomplished artists and studied with them."
Steven:
"But the world was still a restrictive one for her, even in Paris, and she was not, for instance, able to spend time with her friends like Degas at the cafes."
"We see that, actually, reflected in her subject matter, which tends to be domestic, or perhaps a night out at the opera."
Beth:
"It's difficult, I think, to remember those restrictions for women when we look at this painting because there's an extraordinary sense of freedom about the woman who's depicted here."
She's leaning back on her right elbow.
"There's a strong diagonal that has a sense of informality and movement, real self-confidence"
Steven:
"The woman with a pearl necklace, perhaps Lydia seems so much her own agent in the world, and it really does remind us of the tensions that existed at the end of the 19th century, as women were really entering into the public space."
"You know that the tension between public and private is played out, not only in terms of the subject matter, not only the fact that they're in a kind of semi-private space within this booth in the public space of the opera house, but also in the contrast between light and shadow that plays across Lydia's body."
Look at the way the light picks up only the side of her face.
The front of her face is in shadow.
"Not only is it rather brave on Cassatt's part, but it also speaks to the representation of bourgeois culture, this notion of privacy and its importance, even as one views the stage with others."
Beth:
Pressures for reform come from all sorts of directions and it is constant; why should not it be?
"As this country changes over the years, so what people expect from their Parliament is changing."
We had a massive controversy a hundred years ago about whether women should be given the right to vote and whether they should be in Parliament.
Of course in recent years we had a woman
"Prime Minister in Margaret Thatcher, so that was a dramatic change, as have been the number of women Members of Parliament in the House of Commons."
"More recently there have been similar pressures saying that Britain now is of course a country of many ethnic groups, many people of different cultural ethnic-social backgrounds."
Perhaps Parliament needs to be more representative of that diversity?
And we have seen that in all political parties now.
"When you look at both sides of the Chamber, you will see that the people who are sitting there reflect the diversity of the country."
Not perhaps entirely to the level required but huge progress has been made in recent years in that direction.
Pressures for reform of Parliament and its procedures come from many quarters.
They come from Parliament itself.
I can remember well the days when I was a young backbencher myself and there was a very considerable move for select committees.
"Now, select committees are hugely important."
"Committees go into the development and the wherewithal as to what is happening in various government departments. They are very important,"
But there was a great deal of contention. There were groups that did not want to go that far but we won through and we have now the select committees.
So there is change that is made there that comes from Parliament itself.
"It comes from Parliament itself too when we want to restrict the number of constituencies there are, thereby restricting the number of Members of Parliament."
"It comes also from outside, from outside bodies, from non-governmental organisations, from business and from industry."
We are by no means perfect.
We have warts and all.
"But change is constant, it is constantly there and we examine it from whatever quarter it comes from."
"The Parliamentary system in the United Kingdom is a work in progress, requiring regular scrutiny."
We are constantly looking to improve; building on the positive and learning from negative experiences.
"I think the strengths of UK Parliamentary system, and I would almost answer this in the same breath as what are the weaknesses, the real answer is that the system is as effective as its Members want to make it."
I think its strengths are that it is willing to change.
It is willing to look at itself and say that these things are not good enough.
We must make some improvements.
We must make progress.
I hope you have enjoyed this production and that it has offered an insight into the way in which the United Kingdom Parliament operates.
We all look forward to working together with you in the future as friends and colleagues.
"August, 1984."
My question is around working in a country or a continent like ours where there is so much social inequity.
"And those of us who are teaching, many of us are probably working in schools where much of the leadership and ourselves does not reflect the backgrounds of our students."
We are probably dealing with folks who are coming from backgrounds and inherited ancestry of inequity in our area.
My question is -and I was especially drawn towards Jon.
He said in a biography in the book about working with creating spaces for sanghas of color in creating retreats even  for people of color practicing this.
I am wondering what you can say  to us about what we can do to demonstrate our mindfulness and  our sensitivity to that with our students.
But also encourage us to release.
What we want to hold on to is our story of pain and suffering.
How it is stopping us for going forward.
"And that is a very not politically  correct thing to say, encouraging us to release  what pain we can, especially when it is around our identity is being racial or ethnic one down to the rest of society."
I am curious of what you  have to say to us about that.
"(J.K. Salunga) I think I'll try to respond,"
Maybe I can have a conversation with you afterwards to share my experience.
I think the issue of difference is something that is definitely a very rich area for mindfulness practice.
To be able to have that just like an area of contemplation.
I think you even raising this question it is a very nice question.
That would be the same even for me when I work with students that  might be second language learners and working through any sort of differences.
So I really appreciate your question.
"I think, if I can share about the people of color, that are mostly my students,"
I think that space there is the space that sometimes people may not fully understand.
But I think it is an issue of safety.
"So maybe I can ask you how do you communicate safety  in your classroom, so that students feel like whether they are different from you, there is a sense of safety there,  that they can do that."
Or maybe you are being able to share  about resources that are available.
I think those are just maybe  quick things that are coming to mind.
"But I think those spaces for me,  in terms of supporting that cultivation, it is way be safe, so that you can go in and be able to explore some other things that sometimes in other spaces that type of environment is not readily available."
"There are obstacles to being able to enter, and explore and work."
"So I can end here,  we'll talk later."
"(R. Brady) I'd like to add one thing to that, if I may."
"In our recent conference  of mindfulness in education, we had a psychologist, Sam Himelstein, who works with incarcerated youth."
"Most of the young people  are members of gangs, perpetrators of violence  and victims of violence."
He talked about one of his colleagues  in his organization who he described as a nerd.
"He said, ""This is the last person you would expect to be able  to relate to the clientele."
The dietary restrictions for the MAO inhibitor actually only apply to the nine milligram and higher doses.
"So, the lower end we don't need to necessarily restrict."
"It can be a little confusing for patients, so you have to be pretty clear on it."
And you still have to follow the wash-out rules that we just talked about.
It's not any simpler in terms of getting the patient on or off the medication.
But this is a new drug that just became available in the last couple of years.
"So now we're going to talk about the SSRls, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors."
"And these consist of Citalopram, Escitalopram,"
"Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine,Paroxetine, and Sertraline."
And we're going to talk about some of the differences between each of the agents.
"This is a class of drugs, but they are all unique, and just because someone tries one and has a positive or negative experience, doesn't mean they will have the same experience on another agent."
"So, oftentimes we think of the SSRI as just being this simple, easy drug to work with, and it just increases the amounts of serotonin - it doesn't have any affects on other receptor sites."
"But, as you'll see in the next slide, this isn't as clean-cut as we envision it to be in this slide."
"So you can see we've got the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but we've got all this other noise going on that makes each combination of the antidepressant, how they use these other receptors, give each drug its unique profile."
The first SSRI that we're going to talk about is Fluoxetine.
"This is Prozac, Prozac weekly,"
"Serafem also, and Fluoxetine generic."
Fluoxetine has multiple indications.
"It's indicated for Major Depression, which we're focusing on."
"It's also indicated for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"
"Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder, which is where the Serafem actually comes into play,"
"Bulimia, Panic Disorder, and Bipolar Depression - when it's combined with a different antipsychotic."
The average dose of someone taking fluoxetine is twenty to eighty milligrams a day.
It only needs to be dosed once a day.
The weekly preparation: basically the rule is ninety milligrams is equal to twenty milligrams a day.
So ninety milligrams a week is equal to twenty milligrams a day.
"Some of the unique aspects of fluoxetine: it has a very long half-life, because it has an active metabolite."
"So the half-life is up to even three, four days."
"So, it's a positive for patients who forget to take their medication from time to time, because we're not going to see any symptoms of withdrawal, the blood levels are going to stay pretty clean, we're not going to have any issues with that."
We do see some levels that can see some synergistic effects.
"Now, all these drugs"
- we talk about SSRls increasing just serotonin - you get indirect effects on other neurotransmitters.
"And, I just happened to have made a bean dip yesterday and I'm going to turn some of that dip into a sauce."
"So, when you start with the bean dip, you can do any type of dip - hummus or black bean."
What I made is actually is white bean dip with some Italian herbs and some nutritional yeast to make it taste a little bit cheesy.
"So, you get your bean dip, made to the consistency of a dip, and then if you want to make a sauce out of it, you just add more water."
I'll post this garlic herb sauce recipe over at healthyveganrecipes.net.
I'm going to make this into a sauce and I will show you how to that right now.
One awesome thing about unpacking is I got to find all of my kitchen stuff that I packed away last May that I have not seen since.
"So, that's been like 8 months of not having my kitchen stuff."
"One of the things that I love are these pyrex dishes, they're glass and can with a plastic lid, so I can put this right on the fridge, and I can keep my food in glass instead of plastic containers, which is awesome."
These are made by pyrex but I think there are other companies that do the same kind of thing.
"So, here's my white bean dip that I made yesterday, you can see its very dip-like consistency and all you need to do to make it a sauce is to add water."
"I'm just going to spoon out the amount that I want, and again, if you're looking for the recipe for this dip, just head over to healthyveganrecipes.net."
"This is going to be a lunch for us, so that should do it."
I've got that in a bowl and you can do this in a blender.
You can actually just do it to a sauce consistency first but I did a lot of beans.
"I cooked some dried beans and I end up with quite a lot, so I made the dip first and today I feel like a sauce, so here we go."
What I got in here are some Italian herbs.
You can choose from whichever herbs you like.
"I think I have basil, chives and oregano - I can't quite remember, and I got some nutritional yeast in here, which is always a nice addition to a sauce - it's this yellow-flaky-stuff."
"And for salt, I'm using something called herbamare."
"It's a mix of salt as well as some dried herbs and some kelp, which is awesome to add iodine as well as making this salty but reducing the actual sodium content."
"I want my sauce a little bit runny, and all I'm doing is just stirring this up with the water so you can see it's quite runny - it's actually a little bit too runny, so I'm just going to add another spoonful of the dip."
That's a nice thing to have some dip at hand.
You can use it for all kinds of different things.
"Phil and I use it for snacks all the time, its fantastic."
"So, that's something really good, take a little taste just to make sure that as you water it down, it doesn't"
lose the flavor.
That's really nice but I think I just add a little bit more nutritional yeast.
Nutritional yeast is another thing that I pulled out of my box of kitchen stuff that I'm so happy to find.
"So, that's ready to go."
"And then, what I'm going to do is I'm going to serve it over cauliflower - cauliflower is not so exciting most of the time."
This one has few little brown spots that I'm just going to thinly slice off here.
"This is a space of the scan line in which I search, often called disparity, and for one location this is actually being minimized right over here."
Here's the basic algorithm for SSD minimization.
"We take two patches--one from the left image, one from the right image."
"We normalize, so the average brightness is zero."
We then take the normalized image and take the difference.
Then we square the difference.
That gives us a sum-of-square image.
Then we can sum up all the pixels to get a single value.
"This is our SSD value, our sum-of-square difference value."
All of these operations are easily implemented using the material you already know.
"The smaller the SSD value, the closer these two images correspond."
"This is a very common technique for comparing what's called image templates, where your left image is a template, and you're searching the left image for the optimal template."
"As you vary the location of the right image, you can find different SSDs."
You tend to get graphs for the right image.
"With an image template, it gives you certain errors."
Sometimes you get a very small disparate error.
"That's the place you'll pick for the best, mostly likely alignment."
"Hello and welcome to Freshly Served, healthy vegan recipes in Europe."
Tonight Phil and
"I are in a small town on the very South coast of Turkey called Kas and we are cooking in the kitchen on the, on the roof top of our hostel looking out into the surrounding hills around Kas, very very beautiful spot."
"Tonight, I am going to make a dish out of rolled oats because they were the only whole grain I could find in the grocery store and I am actually been meaning to make a dinner with oats for a while so we'll see how that comes out."
And what I've got so far is some vegetables that I've chopped up.
"I got onion, zucchini and mushroom."
"I'm gonna cooked those and then throw in the oats and get everything cook together and then I'm gonna throw in a raw avocado which is a little different from what I'm used to seeing because it has more of a smooth skin but it feels really soft, looks beautiful."
(Video Clip Playing)
"So, I've got this pan heated up and then I got all the stuff in the hostel come in to the company so far, they have a lovely bottle of Turkish olive oil right here so"
I'll pour this a little bit into the pan and then I'm gonna grab my mushroom first.
"Mushroom are the only vegetable that go in before the onions and that is because they take longer to cook and they like to soak up the oil, when you first throw them in you might feel like you need more oil but you don't."
"Just give it a stir, leave them on the heat and they will start to release their own juices, you don't need any more oil than that."
"Now, mushrooms do takes a little more time to cook so leave them enough time on the heat."
"While they are cooking I want to remind you to go read the recipe down below, HealthyVeganRecipes.net and you can also sign up for the hidden section of our website to check out all the stuff that we've been doing on our travels, be sure to go and sign up for that at HealthyVeganRecipes.net/Europe."
Everything is free there but you do have to go to that section of our website.
"And their language classes, much like math classes, focus too much on memorization and not enough on immersion"
"But just pretend you're in math class,"
learning about graph theory so that I can draw the parallels because here's the 2nd doodle game which is very much mathematically related.
Draw a squiggle all over the page and make sure it closes up.
Pick an outside section and color it in.
Now you want to alternate coloring so that no 2 faces of the same color touch.
"Curiously enough, much like the weaving game, this game always mathemagically works out."
"It also works really well if you make the lines spiky instead of a smooth curve and once again, it works with multiple lines too."
"It probably has something to do with the 2 colorability of graphs of even degree, which might even be what your teacher is trying to teach you at this very moment for all you're paying attention."
But maybe you can chat with him after class about snakes and he'll explain it to you because I'd rather move on to the next doodle game.
This is a combination of the last 2
Step 1: draw a smooth closed curve
Step 2: assign overs and unders
Step 3: shade in every other face
"After that, it takes a little artistic finesse to get the shading right, but you end up with some sort of really neat surface."
"For example, this one only has one edge and one side but if you're interested in this, you should really be talking to your resident topology professor and not me."
"But here's the thing: if someone asked you 5 minutes ago what tangled up snakes, demented checkerboards, and crazy twisty surfaces have in common? what would you have answered?"
This is why I love mathematics: the moment when you realize that something seemingly arbitrary and confusing is actually part of something.
"It's better than the cleverest possible ending to any crime show or mystery novel, because that's only the beginning."
"Anyway, have fun with that."
Sugaring is a topic of hair removal that comes up often.
And let's clear up all the myths about it.
"First of all, it's from decades and decades ago."
It was a type of wax people used to make from sugar.
"It's a very inexpensive way of doing it, because you can actually go on the internet and find out how to make this wax at home."
But this is sugar wax.
"I don't recommend it, it doesn't get the fine hairs if it's coarse, so it's not the best."
"And then also in the past there have places that have come out with, like, a sugar wax just because of the name, it was more of a marketing kind of thing."
So my point is stay away from sugaring.
"There's plenty of high-tech, result-oriented waxes out there that give you a great result."
You don't really need to make a wax at home.
"Sugaring doesn't work great, because you have to keep going it over and over, but, I mean, you could make a great sugaring product, but, I mean, there's things out there, like, why go backwards?"
"So if we go over to our expression, say well, just as before, we'll make it pi b now, instead of a, still is I zero, over four pi sigma."
One over R minus one over R prime.
"And you look at that and you say, hm, this is just the same as we had in part a, so therefore the answer is just the same as in part a."
Is that right?
"Well, actually, no, because r is the distance now from point b, from point B to the source, so R is here."
And that's just a little bit longer than it was in part a.
"In R prime, the distance to the distance to the sink is just a little bit shorter than it was in part a."
"So even though the equation is the same, the two distances are, are a little bit different."
"Some people would say, well in order to distinguish these symbolically, you might want to put a subscript on the r's."
"So I'll do that here, indicating that these r's come , come from field point B, rather than field point A."
"So, once again, I'll count on you to go ahead and substitute the numbers in."
I think you'll find it worthwhile to do so.
"You have to do one over RB and one over RB prime, with high precision, so as to retain any significant procession, and the result, but the result should not be zero, and in fact because of the symmetry of the problem, we can see that if you do this, it should come out to be the negative of the result that was found in part A."
Check and see if that what's happens.
So here we are in the problem session part
"C, and this part of the question it asks, what is the voltage between point A and point B?"
"And we are in very good shape to answer that question, because we already know the potential of A and the potential of B."
So the voltage between two points is simply the difference in the potential of two points.
So we can see Vab is equal to phi A minus phi b.
"You have the values for phi a and phi b from the previous section, previous sections, so if you could go ahead and substitute those in and put the net result right here."
Please do that now.
So now I thought I would ask you a more difficult challenge question.
"If you look at the calculations we have done so far, you'd say, well now look."
"Five p involves, for either p of a or p of b, if it's a we could say, okay, it's five a."
"And if we want to, we can put superscripts on the R, so that we have RA, or prime A."
If we want to we can factor out I0 over four pi sigma as we did before.
"But when you get it all done what we're doing is we are computing two terms, and each term is very similar to the other."
They're just a little tiny bit different.
"That seems like a situation that needs improvement because when you compute two things that are very close in value and then you subtract, it's confusing, it's repetitive, and it's prone to error."
That is to say human error but also error in computer calculations.
"I mean most numerical error comes from doing subtractions of two quantities that are very similar, because then there's a big loss of numerical significance."
"So is there a way, mathematically to reduce the two terms to one?"
"It's better not to be associated with me actually because.... (Offscreen) No, no no."
Here we go.
"Thank you, sir."
(Mic) Thanks for all the work you're doing in Britain towards a rational psychedelic use.
"(Mic) Epigenetics, I believe that that's going to become a factor in some of these areas, do you have any information on that?"
"Well we don't do any, we haven't even considered doing any epigenetic studies in humans yet."
"I don't think the technology's there, I suppose one could in animal studies."
"There will be changes I'm sure, I'm sure those layer 5 cells will show epigenetic changes following a single dose."
That's a really interesting thing to do but we don't have that technology.
(Mic) You mentioned that people with depression have higher densities of 5HT2A receptors.
(Mic) Have you seen any connection with that and maybe high tolerance in people with depression?
"That's a really interesting question, yeah."
"We've never, we haven't administered Psilocybin to people with depression yet because we haven't crossed that threshold for getting the drug for clinical use"
"We would love to do that, we'd love to scan people,"
"look at the number of their receptors, look at responsivity the trouble is PET scans are hugely, hugely expensive you're talking twenty thousand dollars a scan we don't have that kind money and we don't have a 2A tracer currently running in our lab but at some stage in the next year or two I think we will have a 2A tracer then if any of you wants to fund that research let me know and we'll do it, alright?"
(Mic) Speaking of funding research has the success of Drugs Live on Channel 4 continued the conversation about funding further research at all?
Any of your other studies?
"Well, we are negotiating to do another study this year with them, yes."
"Hopefully we can get it done, yeah."
"That won't be with Psilocybin, that will probably be with different sorts of cannabis."
(Mic) Thank you.
"(Mic) At my location in Florida in the sensitive political area, that I4 corridor, gives me the opportunity to meet with a lot of politicians coming through and lets me work as a kind of psychedelic advocate and lobbyist."
(Mic) Are there any names of people I can consult and write to to get better information?
Maybe we can talk afterwards I'm not entirely sure you are saying but you can ask me afterwards.
(Mic) The effect of MDMA has been tied to upping the Oxytocin level and one gets many of the same effects with Psilocybin.
"Camaraderie going up, empathy going up, trust, contentment."
(Mic) Has anyone looked at or have you looked at perhaps the Oxytocin level going up?
"So yeah, we've done that in the MDMA study but I haven't got the results,"
"I haven't got adequate assays of the Oxytocin during it,"
I'm not happy with the reliability of the assay.
"We have not done it with Psilocybin, I don't know why."
"It's just a bit of a chore, we've tried to avoid the need to have needles in people because that does change the way in which they experience the scanning and that but we could do and it is a very good question."
Has anyone done some?
"I don't know if anyone's ever done Psilocybin and Oxytocin, it's a very difficult assay, Oxytocin though which is why I'm reluctant to say anything about what the results are with the MDMA."
Some people it goes up a lot but it is very unreliable.
(Mic) I was just wondering what you think about Salvinorin A which has some overlap in the phenomenology with the serotonergic agonist but does not effect Serotonin receptors in any way.
"No, I think it is a really interesting question and I think it would be fascinating to study that drug too."
"Similarly Ketamine, there are some studies with Ketamine."
Functionally utterly different but one thing there is some convergence in terms of uncoupling the Anterior Singulate from Posterior Singulate.
"Salvinorin would be a great experiment to do, we were wondering about doing that if we can get the compound and be allowed to use it legally."
"(Mic) Hi, thank you for your talk, both you and Robin were real interesting."
I have two questions.
"One of them is, in your Psilocybin study were your subjects Psilocybin naive?"
"No, they're all Psilocybin experienced, we wouldn't be allowed to give it to naive subjects."
(Mic) OK.
My other question is it appears that the resting state scans of Psilocybin may give you different results if you're looking at Psilocybin assisted psychotherapy.
Can you comment on that?
Was there something that I missed at the meeting then?
"(Mic) Oh no, I was just curious if you think that you may get different results from the brain scans."
"I suppose the simplest, the current thinking is this, is that in depression you'll have the DMN will be over-connected and that will relate to the degree of negative rumination that patients have and that you will uncouple that and that will stay uncoupled and we do have funding to do the scanning as well as the clinical trial in depression so we'll look at that and see if we can show that there is an enduring effect."
(Mic) Is there any reason to expect you would get a different result if it was Psilocybin in the context of Psychotherapy?
"I hope not, one would hope that psychotherapy would improve the response but one doesn't know and of course I don't think we actually know whether the sensitivity to Psilocybin will be different in people with depression you could argue it both ways so in fact in the depression study we're going to use a low dose first just in case but if anyone here's got experience of using Psilocybin in depressed people and can reassure us that they're not super-sensitive"
let us know.
(Offscreen) Thank you.
Thank you Professor Nutt.
(Offscreen) Please help me thank Professor David Nutt (applause)
We never paid any heed to the ancient prophecies.
Like fools we clung to the old hatreds and fought as we had for generations until the day the sky rained fire and a new enemy came upon us.
"We stand now upon the brink of destruction, for the Reign of Chaos has come at last."
A man carries big bags of candy... ...for his big candy pile.
But this man and his dog have no candy.
See?
This lady knows where the sweet shop is.
A plan is formed.
"Sometimes I'm tempted to believe that I'm wasting my time, but when meeting people that we have prepared and helped, and I see that they have become men and women of God, well, then everything makes sense."
There is always someone who occasionally emerges and gives me the dumb.
"It will never fail, struggles and moments of sadness."
But it's also true that I will never miss the moments of joy.
"Q: what message do you want to let young people who are considering the missionary field but they think that the ideal of a successful Ministry to get important backers, convert the masses, become famous and write about themselves?"
A:
That they are wrong.
"Must give up their ambitions, to build an empire, because with or without their God's work will continue."
"Many men have already fallen because of pride, which is Satan's syndrome."
"The madness of wanting to do things without God, is terrible: when you decide to do things in the manner your usurping the name of Christ, is a desecration."
"Therefore, so that Christ may be in you, as saying Moody ""the extent of the Kingdom is in anything considered""."
"It's hard to explain it, because if you have a vocation, what you do will be different from what you expected."
"You have to take inesperati, and places that message that Christ gave to Peter is critical, ""Verily, verily I say unto you, that when you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you wanted; but when you grow old, stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and lead you where you wouldn't want '."
"""(John 21:18)"
"In short, the Ministry is this: you must only obey God, and then comes what must happen."
"Look, I can't tell who has not suffered, because this knowledge gained at the age of 28 years, it was only after many hardships and struggles."
"But for the grace of God, I can say: you die to yourself."
"Not be neither hypocrite, fake, and not think that get famous can impress God."
"You might also look like pitiful, when in truth you're poor, blind, naked and miserable."
A true man of God believed to give rather than receive.
"When his heart is determined to conquer a Kingdom for himself, is already a victim of Satan."
"A message that I can leave it: love others more than yourself, otherwise you will be useless."
Success.
"All of us worry with this: we want to get famous, let us know,"
"We claim that others devote biographies, to let us know on the other side of the ocean."
Those who want to get into a Ministry not to become famous in the world knowing that he will be any?
Those who prefer that the Ministry is occupied by people not interested in becoming idols?
Christ wish!
"There are men in Brazil and around the world to reflect the glory of God, willingly chosen will sacrifice fame!"
People who are the true Gospel witness without giving any attention to themselves.
"My message to those who are Christians but not famous, and who want to enter the Ministry, and that they are attracted by the fame and popularity, is: look to Scripture, and considered the example of Christ."
"Follow the Apostles as an example, as their not promoted themselves in order to magnify Christ."
"We've done sessions in California, in New York, in Chicago, in Boston..."
I've been to Montreal once before... our partners Savoir-faire Linux was there...
"We've been doing sessions across Europe, the UK, Germany,"
"Norway (where CFEnfgine is based originally),"
"France Italy, Spain, Switzerland..."
We've been all over the world !
"The next one is gonna be in Montreal with you guys from Savoir-faire Linux, that's gonna be in September."
We've tried to tailor the course to adapt different types of public.
First half day is actually a generic introduction.
"It is a non technical morning where we cover why you'd want to do automation -- how it works, basically."
We compare the various automation tools available around there at the moment.
So that can be useful for less technical people maybe
-- Managers or ClOs -- to attend to get a feeling for what the tool can do.
We do accept attendees for that just half day.
After that we dive into CFEngine fundamentals.
"So we have one-and-a-half days of understanding how CFEngine works, how you set up a server, how you set up a client how you can edit configurations files, copy them, run processes, install packages"
-- all the basics sysadmin features used in CFEngine.
"One by one, we've got the theoretical presentations but also a lot of practical hands-on."
I really believe that the best way to learn what CFEngine is but probably most technical things is to practice to do it yourself with someone experienced seating next to you to help.
"And then the third day is what I call the advanced class, the industrialization course. and we're basically putting together all the building blocks that we learned the first two days so that you make useful solutions."
To benefit from the course altogether you need a system administration background because when you automate things system administration comes up.
So you need to know about them before you automate them.
You don't need to be a super senior hot guy
"-- just if you understand the basics of Linux or Unix system administration how to run services, install packages, edit config files, you'll be fine."
The third day actually continues on from the second day so anyone following the first two days can follow the third day as well -- no problem.
"People who already have some CFEngine knowledge and wanna come along for the third day, that's fine too."
-- Goodbye Jonathan !
-- Goodbye and thank you very much !
Not all the content that is used in a given resource is of the author's own creation.
"Respecting the copyright of those who we borrow and build from is an essential component of the dScribe process, and in strengthening the culture of sharing."
"As you go about assessing the resources, OERca keeps track of the decisions you make in clearing content, and allows you to escalate difficult questions to Open.Michigan team members through recommending an action."
This video will give a brief explanation for each of the six recommended actions and the six final actions that can be selected.
So they worked with sound instead of against it with Scarface and the gangster film.
Howard Hawks brings sound more fully into service of character and drama.
Sound is the way that Tony Camonte dominates the world.
The sound of his voice on the soundtrack makes him the most powerful thing in that universe.
And the gunshots are an extension of him.
"At the same time, Hawkes gives us the painful silences that follow the violent action."
Something that Tony is unaware of until the end when he has to live within that painful silence.
So manipulation of soundtrack of sound effects and ambiance becomes a way of tracing a characters rise and fall of giving a character arc for Hawkes and Scarface.
And finally Ghost Ship shows us Hollywood the fully forged sound aesthetic.
Sound is accepted in Hollywood by 1943.
It's not novel or new anymore.
And it does its job tt gives you a solid world with emotional underscoring.
"People accept what they see as part of the world, but sound is always there shaping the way you respond to the image."
"And sound becomes, more or less, unnoticeable."
"We're used to the orchestral sound track, we don't notice it but it's there working on us."
"Nonetheless, sound can rise out of the background, express emotion, psychology, and things like that."
"It's there, always there, it's a fact of seeing a movie."
But it's there and can be tapped by filmmakers and brought forward.
"So what Ghost Ship shows us, is a film that takes sound, and really pushes it and experiments with it."
"This is a fact of film technology, you have a change in technology, from silent to sound."
Sound is new and novel for several years and artists work very hard to make self story and they experiment with it.
"But then once they have the conventions they can rely on the default conventions and, and just let it get it's job done."
But what we see in Ghost Ship is that the potential is always there for that technology to come forward and to become creative once again.
We have a film that experiments with sound and image to create an unsettling atmosphere to move the audience and it's proof that the Lewton's films and Ghost Ship in particular is proof of the continued creative potential of sound or of any technology really any technique after it's become normalized.
We see it with sound in Ghost Ship and we'll see it with color again at the end of that unit.
So this has been an overview of how sound works in cinema by looking at the birth of sound and the vanishing of silence.
Our next stop is to think about what happens when black and white is replaced by color.
"When young people see Dr. King caught in 1963 talking about his dream, what was that dream?"
"When we look at the atrocious numbers of people that are poor and struggling today, King's legacy speaks to that."
"When we look at people who are dealing with 'How do we respond to a nation at war, King's legacy deals with that."
But we want to expand his legacy to talk about other issues that he didn't necessarily address.
"So when we do all of that, King's legacy is alive, it's vital, and it certainly applies to young people right where they are today"
"Before you send something off to your editor before you send something off to be peer reviewed, there's a little check list you ought to go through on that very final draft."
"Once you revise it and the prose is sounding good, there's a few other things that I want to make sure that you think about and check."
"So my little checklist for the final draft, got to check for consistency and in particular for numerical consistency."
You also want to check and make sure that your references are not what I call references to nowhere.
And I'm going to talk a little bit more about.
"So those are kinds of things that kind of a high level that you want to make sure you've, you've checked off your list before send something out."
"So, checking for consistency just means, make sure that you don't have things that are totally contradictory in different parts of the manuscript, and, and this happens often."
"I was recently editing somebody, somebody's work, and in the methods section, they said, we followed participants for a minimum of two years."
"And then later on, I went over to the results section, and I read, the average follow up time was 1.5 years."
"So I was going, huh."
"If every participant was followed for more than two years, how could the average be 1.5 years?"
It didn't make any sense.
So they probably had an incorrect word choice there.
They didn't need a minimum of t2wo years.
They actually were.
"Their, their goal was two years."
So that was a little inconsistency.
"So try to pick up on those, because reviewers will look at those in with, with great, you know, it raises a lot of questions, a lot of red flags."
Even more importantly. well I think it's more important cuz I often focus on the statistics and the numbers of papers is make sure that you check for numerical consistency.
So do the numbers in your abstract.
Match the numbers in the rest of the paper.
And I put that one up first because it's a frequent thing that I see.
"The papers I'm reviewing, or even in papers that are actually published in"
"literature, that sometimes for some reason the abstract numbers don't end up matching things in the rest of the paper and I don't know why that's such a frequent occurrence."
I think it's possibly that people write the abstracts first for like a presentation before the data analysis is really final.
"And then, they end up cutting and pasting that abstract and they forget to change all the numbers or maybe there's a cutting and pasting error just from going from the tables and figures in the text to the abstract."
"Or, I don't know why it is, but there, there seems to be often a lot of inconsistencies there."
"I've seen many examples also, where the numbers and the text don't match exactly the numbers in the tables and the figures."
"So for example, I was doing a statistical review of a paper just this week."
"And, I got very confused because I read the numbers in the text and then I went to table two, where they told me to go,"
And the authors had basically subtracted column one from column two to come up with the numbers in the text.
They had just done a subtraction.
"Android, the basic theme is always black, the background, whereas iPhone is always white."
"So I'm wondering if you can speak to that, or why you guys decided that kind of design?"
ALEX FAABORG:
There's a few functional things.
The OLED screens consume less power when they're not illuminating.
"Also, they're occasionally very bright, so you don't want to just burn the retinas of the user."
Those are very literal things.
Christian can speak to the [INAUDlBLE].
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Particularly when we first
"launched Nexus 1, the OLED screen on that device is amazing, and some of these design decisions were made based on that."
AUDlENCE:
Right.
"So you talked a little bit about how people have assumptions that they've made based on a world that we've all got, and how that's not always that important."
"And like a good example of that is that designers, I think, try and do a lot with color where green is a positive action and red is generally error, warning, whatever."
"And so in Gmail, the Compose Mail button is a bright orange red, and I've always wondered, what is some of the thinking?"
"I don't know if you guys worked on that, but what is the thinking that makes you break that really, really firm color association model that most of us have?"
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"So first off, I won't put words in your mouth, but when we're talking about the design process, sometimes it's really important to get those associations out of our mind to make sure that we can work on that more fundamental level."
But those associations are extremely important.
"And so once we've kind of worked out, how do we make it work without these kind of elements of style and trends and all that stuff, it is really important to layer that stuff back on to evaluate the work."
"In terms of the specific choice of that color, I can't speak to it, except for the fact that red is a signal for, look here."
ALEX FAABORG:
"Also, I didn't work on it either, so I don't want to put words in the mouth of the designers that did, but one thing you can see from the design is that the colors, they have external consistency meanings, but they also have really good internal consistency meanings, where blue is always representing Search, green is always representing Share, and red is representing Create."
"And that's not the kind of thing that you have to actually know, or on a conscious level know, but it's the kind of thing that on a subconscious level, as you're trying to find the Search button, or you want to quickly share something, you start to pick up those color associations as you're doing your targeting."
So I thought that was a really nice touch they did with the design.
AUDlENCE:
Thank you.
AUDlENCE:
"I work at a fairly large media company, and many projects I end up working on tend to have five or six design cooks in the kitchen, and I'm primarily an engineer."
I was wondering if you had any suggestions on ways to influence the design when I see something bad or that I disagree with from that position?
ALEX FAABORG:
little nervous about all of this sort of popular sentiment and crowd action.
And I even had--let me find my favorite arrogant aristocratic quote.
Okay.
So I even found random arrogant elite guy quote in 1774 who observed with true disdain:
"""The mob begin to think and reason."""
"This is Gouverneur Morris, who actually has a really great sense of humor but also he's really kind of aristocratically disdainful."
"And he says he believes ""with fear and trembling that if the disputes with Britain continue, we shall be under the worst of all possible dominions."
"We shall be under the domination of a riotous mob."""
Okay.
"So Gouverneur Morris is an extreme example of some sort of elite concern about what the Revolution means, what does it mean that people are rising up."
So that was going to be today's lecture.
That was my plan.
"But when I started thinking about the lecture and thinking about just preparing it and tweaking it, and again I had last thought about it back in December-- and you know, when you make a syilabus for a course you think about the course, you outline it, you think it's all going to go well, and then you get halfway through the course and sometimes different things seem exciting to you or you suddenly get a gut feeling that: 'wow, I was going to have a really abstract discussion today, and I don't want to have an abstract discussion."
[laughs]
I want us to be grounded in the actual Revolution.'
"All of those things happened to me when I was thinking about today's lecture, and I decided at the absolute"
last minute I wasn't going to give that lecture-- at literally the absolute last minute.
Today--This morning for me was like a reality show called
"""The Lecture"" and I was like:"
"'Freeman, three hours--research and write a new lecture.'"
So I was sort of frantically at my desk.
"So not only did I research and write a new lecture, but it's based entirely on primary research."
"So I mean--I really researched, you'll hear, and I'm going to explain in a moment what I'm actually going to be lecturing on, which is related to what I'm supposed to be lecturing on."
"But basically I just came up with something that to me felt more interesting, more immediate, that's going to show some of the same things I would have been talking about in my big, broad, general way with my"
"leadership and citizenship lecture, but instead I'm actually going to base it on real people in a real place, sort of really showing you as the Revolution's unfolding what happens to people in this place and how do events and ideas affect them."
"So when I said I hope I have a minute or two at the end-- given that I literally was printing this out as I was grabbing my coat to run here, hopefully this is all going to work and the lecture will go swimmingly."
This is true confessions.
Right?
"I should never get up in front of you and say,"
"""Maybe my lecture will die."""
[laughter]
Okay.
So the analyst in me wanted to see what are the rates of cancer here in the US versus the rest of these countries that never allowed this?
"Because while correlation is not causation,"
I wanted to see the data.
"So I turned to the American Cancer Society and I learned that one in two men, and one in three women are expected to get cancer in their lifetime here in the US."
I then learned from the Centers for Disease Control that cancer is the leading cause of death by disease in kids under the age of 15.
So I wanted to learn more because milk allergy is the most common allergy in the US according to CNN and the Wall Street Journal.
But I was an analyst so I knew correlation wasn't causation.
"And so I turned to soy, because a couple of years later, scientists genetically engineered the soybean to contain a new protein so that it could withstand increasing doses of weedkiller."
"Again, it makes sense as a business model."
"If you're a chemical corporation, you're trying to sell weedkiller."
"But at the same time, it had never been proven safe, there were no long-term human studies, and the one human study that had been conducted showed a 50 percent increase in the rates of soy allergy."
"And so when I learned that, I thought,"
"""Why is nobody talking about these foreign proteins, and the risk that they might present, and that they might trigger an allergic reaction?"""
"Because I was learning that while protocols were in place, there were no definitive tests to determine whether or not these proteins were causing these allergic reactions."
"So I reached out to some food allergy doctors, some food allergy organizations, and they pretty much had an allergic reaction to me."
"So I pulled their financial statements,"
"(Laughter) and I learned that some of the largest food allergy organizations, and some of the most prominent researchers, were funded by the agrichemical corporation that was engineering these proteins into our food supply."
"And as I sat on that, I thought,"
"""You know, I guess technically, there's nothing wrong with that."
"But I sort of wish these guys were more like Nascar drivers and maybe wore those logos on the fronts of their jackets."""
(Laughter)
"And so I thought, ""You know, what else?"""
"And I learned that a few years later, in the late 1990s, using this new technology, scientists genetically engineered a new protein into our corn."
It was to reduce the spraying of insecticides over cornfields.
Who could argue with that?
"But what they did was that they engineered that insecticidal protein into the corn seed, so that as the corn plant grows, it manufactures and creates its own insecticide which it can release as it grows."
It's a brilliant business model.
"But because of that new protein, that corn was then regulated by the EPA as an insecticide."
Countries around the world again said there are no long-term human studies we don't want this in our food supply.
Some countries didn't want it fed to their livestock.
"And in some countries like France and New Zealand, they didn't even want it planted in their soil."
"And yet, here in the US, we introduced it."
"Well, the only place you can go from V is to T and then at T there's nowhere to go."
So we recursively call DFS of T. There's no edges to go through.
"We finish the for loop and so T is going to be assigned an F value equal to the current label, which is N and here N is the number of vertices which is four."
So F of T is going to get.
Sorry T is going to get the assignment the label four.
"So then now we're done with T we back track back to V. We decrement the current label as we finish up with T. We get to V, and now there's no more outgoing arcs to explore, so its for loop is finished."
"So we're done with it, with depth-first search."
"So it gets what's the new current label, which is now three."
And again having finished with V we decrement the current label which is now down to two.
So now we go back to the outer for loop.
"Maybe the next vertex we consider is the vertex T. But we've already been there so don't bother to DFS on T. Then maybe after that we tried it on S. So, maybe S is the third vertex that the for loop considers."
We haven't seen S yet so invoked DSF starting from vertex S.
From S there's two arcs to explore the one with V. V we've already seen nothing is gonna happen with arc SV.
"But on the other hand the arc SW will cause us to recursively call DFS on W. From W we try to look at the arc from W to T, but we've already been to T so we don't do anything, that finishes up with W so depth-first search then finishes up at the vertex W, W gets the assignment of the current label, so F of"
W equals two.
"We decrement current label, now its value is one, now we backtrack to S, we've already considered all of S's outgoing arcs so we're done with S, it gets the current label which is one."
"And this is indeed one of the two topological orderings of this graph that we exhibited, a couple slides ago."
So that's the full description of the algorithm and how it works on a concrete example.
"Let's just discuss what are its key properties, its running time and its correctness."
"So as far as the running time of this algorithm, the running time is linear; it's exactly what you'd want it to be."
And the reason the running time is
"linear is for the usual reasons that these graph search algorithms have run a linear time, you're explicitly keeping track of which nodes you've been to so that you don't visit them twice."
"So you only do a constant amount of work for each of the N nodes and each edge in a directed graph, you actually only look at each edge once when you visit the tail of that edge."
So you only do a constant amount of work per edge as well.
Of course the other key property is correctness.
That is we need to show that you all are guaranteed to get a topological ordering.
So what does that mean?
That means every edge.
Every arc travels forward in the ordering.
"So if UV is in edge, then F of U, the label assigned to U, in this algorithm is"
less than the label assigned to V. The proof of correctness splits into two cases depending on which of the vertices U or V is visited first by depth-first search.
"Because of our for loop, which iterates over all of the vertices of the graph"
Thank you.
"Just because for accessibility, auditory accessibility as well."
Diane:
"Diane Gallinger, and I'm a independent museum specialist and my question is for some people who are um, who have.... visual issues, they are not necessarily trained in using or working with tactile diagrams, now that I know at the Louvre, they have a program where they actually bring them in for workshops and work with let's say models of figure of models so that they get used to the feeling the full three-dimensional model and then they work to getting used to the feel of that so how that would translate into the feel of a two dimensional tactile diagram."
"But if you were just working, say in a small community in Ontario, which is where I am at right now, you have people who are coming in and doing programs and working with tactile diagrams but they may not necessarily have a background in using tactile diagrams and yet they may be, if you don't have the opportunity to do ongoing workshops with them to sensitize them or give them more experience in using a tactile diagram."
"What would you recommend for someone like myself, who is doing that program to enable someone who is new at working with this, to be able to comprehend the feeling of your hands."
"And I do do,. visual descriptions and do work with models that they can relate to the diagram as well, so it's not, you know, not being used just in on its own to use the two depiction but it's just how do you get over that hump apart from maybe using something like visual description or a tactile model, so how do you help them to use a two dimensional tactile diagram?"
Dr. Kennedy:
"Um, great question."
I'll tell you two stories.
"One of them is, imagine a blind woman"
"I was doing a test in Ottawa and she said, uh, You know, I'm no good with space and"
I can't do this kind of thing.
"Uh I have no experience with pictures, I can't draw."
"And I basically said to her, take up thy pen and draw."
"And she started, and her first drawing was a scribble."
Drawing on a raised page line drawing.
"I said, well Kit, and her first drawing was a scribble."
And then she looks upset __.
"I should draw this box, that I was offering to her, this way, and then the next drawing, within minutes, had some scribbles but also a clear face of the box."
"And I actually, that's like a change from say a two to three year old to a three or four year old sighted kid."
That takes a year.
"And she went from that in less than five minutes and then she said, ""Oh, no, no, _"""
"Her next drawing had two faces attached side by side like a fold out drawing, which is typical of a seven year old sighted child."
"So then, in fifteen minutes she had gone through three or four years of drawing ability on her own."
I had never taught anybody.
I just want to know what they can do when they think about what they are doing.
"And how they think they might improve, and then what I see is that gradually themselves getting better because the drawing development sequence that unfolds in a sighted child, also unfolds in the blind."
And they push themselves because they _ themselves.
"Okay, second story, is Esref herself."
"So she was encouraged to draw, so she said ""Okay, I'm going to draw an advent wreath."""
If you don't know what that is.
It took about 150 million years for the distance between to continents to come to what it is today.
It's a story that began when Africa and the Americas were still joined together
"It's impossible to explain, to think or even to redirect the country's history"
"Obviously many species had already existed before, but the diversity has been"
One cannot thrive without the other.
So I think this point is crucial.
So the relationship between the water and the forest is a very close dependency.
"Starting about 150 million years ago, the two continents started separating"
The Atlantic Forest is one of the world's rain forests.
"The forests were entered, worked on,"
The measurements that have been made in recent years indicate that
The numbers are overwhelming.
The ocean waters recede from the coasts.
The principal conditioning factor in the Atlantic Forest is climate.
The story of the Atlantic Forest is a very old story
"There was rain and heat arriving at the Scarpas,"
These forests have a long biological history.
They live in traditional communities that know how to manage the Forest's resources
"They occur mainly in between the tropics,"
They show that we won't see even 30 more years of forest coverage.
They were long-term cycles that set new conditions for life on the planet.
This destruction didn't end with the economic cycles of the past.
"Through plains, dunes and valleys,"
Two of these areas are in Brazil: the cerrado and the Atlantic Forest.
"Waterfalls, springs, groundwater..."
All this right in the middle of the jungle.
"We need to consider not only their culture, but also how to return these benefits"
"We soon realize the importance of this rain forest,"
Weather becomes drier and cooler.
"You don't find such abundant water in a place without a lot of vegetation. all the way to the top of the mountains. all these are bits of our history that have seized upon the Atlantic Forest. and irrigate Brazil's Southeast Region. and it still has not stopped increasing. and so many benefits are being taken from the Atlantic Forest. and that water is a constant sight here. being reduced to practically 80 thousand square kilometers, but hosts the highest plant diversity index on the planet. coming from the Atlantic Ocean, which causes rain along the entire coastline. decomposing the rock that was forming, allowing vegetation to grow improved by a series of climate changes. in areas that see more than 1800mm of yearly rainfall. is home to a very large traditional population, known as glaciations."
"largely eliminated by social and economic processes. mangroves and bushes spread only about 8% of its pre-colonization size. particularly at this time when there is so much debate over biotech and patents, rain forest area is located inside Brazil. spawning the environment where today there lies the Atlantic Forest sustainably, i.e. there is a traditional science to the handling of the Atlantic Forest, the clearing of forests for coffee plantation, sugar cane taking over the Northeast, the forest roams. those who have lost at least 70% of their original vegetation are known as ""hot spots"". to these traditional communities. we've lost about the size of a football field every four minutes. which we need to understand, rescue and value, whose culture is connected to the Atlantic Forest. without going through the Atlantic Forest as a starting point."

"They come one by one, all seeking answers to puzzling questions and ways of coping with the uncertainties and challenges that life can bring."
"Almost universally, they leave with new optimism and new tools to help them deal with the issues of concern."
They are people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or the parents of children with disabilities and most have felt the frustration and pain of struggling to deal with the system.
These individuals have come to Partners in Policymaking and their needs and circumstances vary.
But all have sought ways to find new answers and to bring about change.
They learn how to make their voices heard to play a role in policy development.
"Wanda Mills has lived with difficult disabilities for much of her life, but persevered and went on to employment with the tax department in the town of Sylva"
"When her parents passed on, she moved to her own residence, cooks all her own meals and maintains the household."
She credits the Partners program with helping her to interact in the community.
It has changed my life completely.
"I have always wanted to be a public speaker. and that was a crazy idea, but Partners helped me realize that I could be a public speaker."
That has always been a life dream of mine.
"From my perspective, it is to help parents of children with disabilities to not put their child in a box, but let them be all they can be, however little though that may be."
That is so important.
[male voice]
Wanda is increasingly speaking out on issues of concern to people with disabilities addressing groups in a number of North Carolina communities.
"The Partners program director,"
"Deborah Whitfield, an attorney who herself is a graduate of the program in Texas understands the growth process and now keeps the proceedings on track in North Carolina."
"There are some challenges, people who believe, that you know they can't do it because many of them haven't left their own communities."
Many have never gotten on public transportation.
Many have not even lived in a hotel room.
"So when you see those individuals who come to this training for the first time, get that experience and soar it is a delight to be a part of that process."

"The creator of the Partners advocacy program, Dr. Colleen Wieck, of Minnesota, said it was prompted by a specific need and then grew from there."
"The last witness at the 3-hour hearing was a young parent from International Falls,"
Minnesota.
"And, everyone was giving her mixed messages about what to do to testify in front of U.S. Senator Dave Durenberger"
"And, after that hearing, two of us got together and we realized, we could teach the skill that was missing."
"And, we could do this in a systematic way, as well as teach best practices about disability services."
"And, as a result, we created this eight weekend program that's designed to teach both- what is best practice in education, assistive technology, living and employment, as well as how to communicate with local, state and federal officials."
"And we can see some increase: you can see in the top that there's some norepinephrine activity, some of the serotonin 2C activity that we highlight could increase some norepinephrine and dopamine."
"So if you think about some of those initial symptom comparisons we talked about,"
"Fluoxetine is a little more activating, may help a little more with concentration, may be helpful in some of the sedated and fatigued patients."
"With its long half-life and active metabolite, though, it might not be great for the elderly."
"There are a lot of drug interactions, though, with Fluoxetine, both with the Fluoxetine and the active metabolite."
"So you have to be careful with using the drug, in terms of drug interaction monitoring."
"The next agent we'll talk about is Paroxetine, and there are multiple formulations, again:"
"Paxil, Paxil CR, and Paroxetine."
Paxil versus Paxil CR: the only difference is that the CR is better upon initiation.
Paxil's a little difficult to start.
It's very hard to get on and off of this drug.
"So, the CR has a little bit different absorption, and so it absorbs lower in the stomach, rather than in the stomach, more in the intestine, so you don't get as much nausea with the drug."
"And so you do some slight dosage adjustments, but there's no benefit of Paxil CR over Paxil or Paroxetine after the first two weeks of treatment."
"So, again, we don't really see anything in terms of the use of this agent."
The dose of Paroxetine is anywhere from ten to eighty milligrams.
"Again, multiple indications:"
"Major Depression,"
"Obsessive-Compulsive, Panic, Social Anxiety Disorder,"
"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,"
"Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder."
"As we talk about some of the other anti-depressants, you may not see as long of lists of indications, which is fine, it doesn't make any one drug more superior to another when they have more indications."
It's just what that particular manufacturer decided to study and gain FDA approval for.
But it doesn't make a drug better or worse than another.
"That doesn't make a drug that's not indicated for something that we can't use it for something, potentially."
"Some of the unique aspects of Paroxetine is it does have a very short half-life, so we have to be careful with withdrawal."
Withdrawal can occur by missing one dose of this medicine.
"And the withdrawal is something like a flu-like symptom, flu-like phenomenon, so people get very nauseous, sweaty, they may feel a little off-balance, they may have some reality distortion, often, too."
"So you have to be careful with this one, with someone with compliance issues and forgetting to take their medicine."
"This is probably the more sedating, calming agent, so it's better with patients who have insomnia, they might see a little actual fatigue."
"We do see some anticholinergic side effects, though with Paroxetine: the dry mouth, sedation, constipation."
"And we can see waking, clinically, with Paroxetine also."
"Across the board, most of the antidepressants are weight-neutral."
"It's something that's happened over the last five or ten years in consumer electronics, but it's fundamental."
"So, what's happening now is that people are finally getting it to the point where we can build computers and computing technology that people actually want to use in their daily lives, it just works."
"It's taken us a very, very long time and I'm very proud to say that the just works option finally is available."
"It starts from a new strategy in the industry which I'm going to call ""Mobile First."" If you look at what's happening today in the industry, the best applications, the most powerful new uses of computers are occurring on smartphones."
"Now, why?"
"You would think that they would occur on these big, big expensive computers that are still being made."
"No, because the smartphones are so powerful now, and they have everything that you need to have a great information source, a great entertainment source, and of course, it's a very, very large market."
"So this new generation of programmers, the new generation of companies are starting Mobile"
First.
"And in a particular, smartphone first."
"It's interesting that smartphone sales will soon surpass PC sales, never to--never to catch-up again."
"And the mobile web, which is the web services that the mobile use is using, is growing eight times faster than the equivalent desktop web from ten years ago."
"So, not only is this a larger market, but its also growing much, much quicker."
"As a result, we see all of the developments that are occurring today."
And this is against the backdrop of pervasive connectivity.
"I don't need to tell you, Europe and Germany are particularly good at this."
There are very high-speed networks all throughout at least the western world.
"And when you go on vacation or you go to another country you don't normally visit, you're shocked to discover that they have no data connectivity or a small amount of data connectivity."
"We take it for granted that these networks have always been there, but in fact, they're relatively new, only a few years."
So how quickly we forget?
"It's interesting that the next generation of mobile technology, which is called LTE will generate 50 megabits per second."
"I can remember thinking, ""Oh, if we could just get to one megabit per second, I'll be happy."" Well, of course, I'm never happy and now I want 50."
"When we get 50, I'll want more."
What can you do with 50 megabits?
"Video, real-time streaming, all sorts of things that you could never imagine doing with a handheld device, all of these now are possible because of the technology that people are using."
"It's interesting that the Internet is now so pervasive that one estimate has 35 billion devices connected in one form or another, including devices in cars and all sorts of other kinds of things, many more than the kinds of devices that we're used to."
It's amazing that this is all occurring.
And this is giving us an opportunity to build these large platforms.
"And so, there's a set of products, a set of platforms and a set of companies that are driving this move forward."
"Let me give you an example, look at the iPhone and the iPad; new powerful applications that could access the data in the back, Google, of course, is a partner."
We'll show you Android.
We'll talk about Chrome OS.
"It's about a passion for the next generation that learning from own mistake, that it's selfishness, it's greed, it's self-interest that has made this country poor and corrupt."
"And so, we hope that we can get more of the students in Xavier to really invest in countryside development."
We're coming up with our social innovation camps this summer.
We are building a 100-bed facility now in Angat.
"And we'll be inviting the Business and Management students and even the third year and fourth year high school to come up in our career camps and also for us to really train them in social entrepreneurship, in green innovation and so on."
"So, we have - this is, to me, the most interesting place in the world to live in."
"It's, to me, the most exciting time to be Filipino."
"And it's not even about legal citizenship, it's not even the colour of our skin."
"Right now, I have with me our volunteers from France."
"This year, we're expecting over 1000 people from Europe who will do their internship with us in our Gawad Kalinga communities because they're starting to see that this is now the Asian age and this is also the time for global partnership, that those who have developed technology in the West will be able to really work with the creative talents of our country, to really transform this country and make it productive and expand the market base."
A lot of big business now are supporting us because they realize that investing and bringing people out of poverty makes good business sense because it expands the market base.
And it also brings peace which is very important in terms of sustainability.
So this is just an old man rattling.
I am very - I'm always very impatient for young people to wake up and for them to now be connected because many of our young people have very
- they are very idealistic.
Their hearts are less corrupted and their minds are less polluted but they're just disconnected.
"They're connected through social networking, they're all Facebook users, Twitter users."
"They go to the clubs, et cetera."
But they do not know the poor.
"So the first thing that this - the brightest and the best of people here and abroad, just"
"like what the French are doing, is for them to know the poor because that is the abandoned wealth of the world."
For them also to go to the rural areas because it's not just in the malls that you find opportunities or in the developed areas.
"Because, you know, areas that have hit rock bottom have no place to go but up."
That's where the opportunities are.
"And so, again, we hope that you can continue to help us as we transform the countryside."
"First, we're addressing the needs of the disaster victims right now, we are building 5000 homes for the Sendong victims in Mindanao."
We have a team right now to help also the earthquake victims in Dumaguete.
And the amazing thing is just build and they will come.
"If they - if you build, you tried and if you show the world, the people also who are part of this because that cannot be done by one man or one organization."
"My role is to just create the platform, my role is just connect people, my role is to just for us to really be on the same page in terms of the kind of world we want to build."
"And so, this is an exciting time."
My only problem is that I have enjoyed working with young people.
"Why can't we just say ""he called me a pig"" and then forget about it."
"Instead of allowing us to trigger that emotion of anger, ill-will whatever else it is."
"The anger that comes up in you, you actually you allow it to happen."
"There is no reason for it at all, you don't have to follow that path."
"If you trace anger back, where did you get angry from, you can actually see a series of irritations which you dwell upon, you think about, and you create the fire."
"Anger is like a blaze, like a forest fire, but all forest fires they start just with a small spark."
And even that small spark it starts just with a small little fire in the twigs or in the leaves.
If you catch it quickly it's just so easy to put out.
"But a lot of times we don't notice it that easily, until it gets so big, so big it's a forest fire."
"Living in the bush, and having experienced major bushfires, I know just how difficult they are to put out once they are fully alight."
It's much better to catch them earlier.
"If you can catch these negative emotions earlier, through you mindfulness, through your awareness, through your mental training, it's not that hard to actually to transcend emotions such as anger, or fear, or grief."
"If we really want to, we can train ourselves."
"And it's not like a training of willpower, it's always a training of wisdom power, to see where these things come from, to see their cause, how they're built up and catch them earlier."
"Even some of the people who have panic attacks, who get very afraid in certain situations, sometimes you think the panic or the fear just comes up almost immediately, but it doesn't, there are signs there.."
And trouble is that sometimes we're so busy that we're not really aware what's going on in our body or in our mind because we're taken up with the needs of the moment.
"We don't actually notice how these emotions are getting built up in us, and how they're being reinforced by unskillful thought patterns."
"Even like depression, another negative emotion, we create that."
"And again through some unskillful thinking, not being mindful, not actually understanding where these things come from we build up the negativity, minute by minute, day by day, until in gets so strong and then we notice it like the huge fire."
"So what are the ways of understanding these emotions, especially the negative emotions, is actually to trace back where they come from."
"If you're angry, if you're afraid, ask why."
"Over in Thailand, the Thais are just so so afraid of ghosts."
"And there was amazing, that sometimes like the one thing they were most afraid of was actually being with a newly dead body."
And being a Westerner I wasn't afraid of that at all.
I remember once when
"I think it was Ajahn Chah's brother that died and was being cremated, I told one of the monks - I'm just going to go and do some meditation by the corpse."
"He said ""what?!"" I said ""I'm going to do some meditation by the..""."
"He said ""have a cup of coffee""."
I thought - that's really nice.
And I couldn't understand why they were giving me all this coffee.
"And the reason way they were so impressed that anybody could sit in meditation next to a newly dead corpse, because they were just so afraid of that."
"So once I found that out, I always went to say I'm going to sit by a corpse, and they brought all this nice coffee."
He was a researcher and a doctor working out of the
University of Minnesota.
"And you might recognize his name, or perhaps you've heard of the K ration which is the type of food packets that the soldiers in World"
War two ate was named after K for Dr. Keys.
"He worked in a variety of different backgrounds in and round of nutrition, but we do refer to him as the father of the"
Mediterranean diet.
"Another thing that he was very well known for, was his book in his publication called The Biology of Human Starvation."
"This way published in the post world war two era, and he really did some of the seminal research on reef feeding, and how we feed an individual who has previously starved."
"But that, but back to his work in the Mediterranean diet realm."
"In the period from 1958 to 1970, he conducted what was called the Seven Countries Study."
"And he surveyed men in eighteen different areas of seven different countries, and these men were aged 40 to 59."
"He was the first person to scientifically explore what associations existed among diet, disease risk, in different contrasting populations."
"He did a very thorough chemical analysis of foods that people in these different areas ate, and also did documentation about the foods that they eat."
He demonstrated the degree to which the diet and in particular saturated fatty acids and cholesterol
"levels, would predict present and future heart disease."
"Now to you, especially at this point in the course, you It might come as no surprise that a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol helps to reduce heart disease risk."
"But at the time, Dr. Keys was fascinated by middle aged American males who had really high risks of heart attacks."
"How come other comparable males in other parts of the world, weren't having the same experiences and the same rates of heart attack."
And that's really what he initially sought out to study and he turned into really starting to exploit and really highlight the benefits of eating a Mediterranean diet.
Sort of the basic principles of the mediterranean diet.
It's primarily a plant based diet that includes herbs and spices for added flavor.
"There are some animal products but red meat intake in particular is limited, there is a focus on fish and on poultry."
There's low intake on processed foods and the emphasis is on fresh whole foods.
It includes fish and foods from the sea and a moderate consumption of dairy and wine.
There's also the notion that activity is part of the healthy lifestyle.
"And as far as the fats go, there's a focus on good fats with the primary fat of the Mediterranean diet, being olive oil."
What you see here is an image that's showing the Mediterranean diet pyramid.
This is a visual teaching tool that was developed or introduced in 1993 and it's a collaboration between the
"Harvard School of Public Health, the European Office of the World Health"
Organization and the non profit organization called Oldways.
It's based on the dietary traditions of the people of Crete.
"The island of Crete in the country of Greece in Southern Italy, around 1960."
It's a measure of how the increase in the number of copies scales with the decrease in the size of the segment.
"And very roughly, it's sort of the density of the self-similarity."
"Let me quote a little bit from my own book, ""Complexity:"
"A Guided Tour."" where I talk about what fractal dimension means."
"""I've seen many attempts at intuitive descriptions of what fractal dimension means."
"For example, it has been said that fractal dimension represents the roughness, ruggedness, jaggedness, or complicatedness of an object; an object's degree of fragmentation; and how dense the structure of the object is."
One description I like a lot is the rather poetic notion that fractal dimension quantifies the cascade of detail in an object.
"That is, it quantifies how much detail you see at all scales as you dive deeper and deeper into the infinite cascade of self-similarity."
"For structures that aren't fractals, such as a smooth, round marble, if you keep looking at the structure with increasing magnification, eventually there's a level with no interesting details."
"Fractals, on the other hand, have interesting details at all levels, and fractal dimension, in some sense, quantifies how interesting that detail is as a function of how much magnification you have to do at each level to see it."""
Hello Space Lab!
"I am Sean Carroll, here at the Calfornia Institute of Technology where I am a theoretical physicist and the author of From Eternity to Here:"
The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time and I'm here to answer your questions.
The first question is:
"""If you would travel at 99.9%  the speed of light,"
"""what would things look like?"""
"And ""Is it possible that you can invent something like warp drive"
"""that would let you go faster  than the speed of light?"""
"And I love how specific this question is,"
"""99.9% the speed of light"" makes me think  that whoever asked the question has some sort of invention in mind  that would let us do this."
"It's far beyond what the spaceships  we can build right now, but you never know."
It's just a technology challenge.
"And the answer is really,  the world wouldn't look that different."
There is of course  what we call the Doppler Effect.
"If you're moving  in the direction of something, the light that gets to you coming from that direction is squeezed together."
"The wavelengths,  no matter how long they are, they are relatively shorter  from your point of view since you're moving toward them  as you look."
"So, all the red light you see  is what we call blueshifted."
The blue light is squeezed  to the ultraviolet and so on.
"Now 99.9% the speed of light  is a very, very fast speed so this Doppler Effect, this blueshifting, is quite severe."
You'd have to worry about the amount of radiation that you were looking at.
The things that are ordinarily ultraviolet would be X-rays to you so you better have some protection in front of you.
"And also, just because the signals that are coming from you are compressed together it looks to you like the things in front of you are moving faster  than they would otherwise."
Some of these errors have dramatic consequences and cause severe diseases.
"The investigation of these errors also permits the reconstruction of genealogies, in humans as well as in animals, thus tracking back the evolutionary history of species."
"DNA forms the chromosomes, contained in the cell nucleus."
"A second genome, maybe some of you didn't know, is in the mitochondria, organelles devoted to the production of energy."
Mitochondrial DNA has a number of interesting features.
"Among these is its mode of transmission, only along the maternal lineage, from mother to progeny."
"Hence, the investigation of mitochondrial DNA variants permits to reconstruct the ""female history"" of species."
Let's go back to bovine.
When did the history of domestic cattle start?
"At the onset of agriculture, about 10,000 years ago."
"Agriculture marked the beginning of a new era, the Neolithic, and represented a fundamental step in the evolution of modern society by fostering the conversion of hunter-gatherers into farmers."
Farmers created stable settlements.
"Stability and food availability permitted a demographic expansion of human populations and their stratification in classes, most having occupations other than food hunting, seed of complex modern societies."
Archaeological and archaeobiological records indicate the existence of two and perhaps four sites of cattle domestication.
"The most ancient site is in the Fertile Crescent, dated about 8,500 years BC, in an area at the border of Iran, Iraq and Turkey."
"Here the wild ancestor Bos primigenius, a very dangerous animal of extraordinary strength, got domesticated as Bos Taurus, the European type cattle we see in our farms."
Another very important site is Pakistan.
"The first evidences date back to 7,000 years BC in the Indo Valley, where they domesticated ""Bos Indicus"", the zebu, the humped cattle now widely spread in South Asia and Africa."
"Two other possible domestication sites,"
"North Africa and Far East Asia, are still under debate."
What information on domestication is contained in cattle mitochondrial DNA?
"The coloured spheres you see here represent animals, grouped in geographic areas: you can see a geographic map and group of spheres in different areas:"
"South West Asia, Anatolia, Central Europe, Africa, etc."
You also see colours.
A given colour represents groups of animals having similar mitochondrial DNA sequence.
Different colours indicate animals with different mitochondrial sequences.
Colours indicate genealogies.
"The reds are a large family, the yellows another large family and so on."
"Branches of spheres are present within colours, indicating the existence of variants also within genealogies, the wider the branching, the greater the variability in mitochondrial DNA sequences within a family."
How can these pattern be interpreted?
In Anatolia and South-West Asia the genetic variability is higher than in Europe and Africa.
You may see the presence of all colours and wide branching here.
"A couple more things about sick day management for diabetes, if you feel that you are dehydrated, and usually you know you're dehydrated if you look at the color of your urine, the closer it is to dark yellow or orange."
Amber colored urine implies that you're very dehydrated.
"Drink things like water, club soda, diet soda that's caffeine-free or even you can drink salty beverages like tomato juice or chicken broth when you're sick."
"If your blood sugar is low and you're sick, make sure that those drinks that you're drinking include some sugar."

VlKTORlA KOLESNlKOVA:
"One of the myths, I think, concerns the financial side."
"There is a conception, or a perception, I guess, that"
United States education is quite expensive and is not affordable and out of reach for many students.
"So the two-year college system actually helps to dispel that myth by providing outstanding opportunities to cut the cost of the bachelor's degree in half, at least."
"So most two-year community colleges would cost between $5,000 and $7,000 a year."
"And Foothill and De Anza colleges right now are about $5,300 for a whole year of tuition."
"And while you're studying there for two years, you're completing for same courses of major U.S. Universities, particularly those that are on our articulation agreements -- for example, UC Berkeley -- or even private instutitions,"
"like University of Southern California and Pepperdine, St."
"Mary's, for example, or Santa Clara."
And you're not paying their tuition for the first two years.
"So when you transfer, you receive course credit."
But you've saved the difference on the costs.
And another interesting characteristic is that there are more scholarships available between second and third year while you can already establish your academic performance.
"You participate in extracurricular activites, which are plentiful at many college campuses."
You can build up your resume.
And you already appear as a well-rounded student with significant experience studying in an American insitution.
And you are then able to receive more partial and sometimes full scholarships.
"It actually provides a wonderful opportunity for a student to get a bachelor's degree, sometimes from a very prestigious university, while not having to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars."
So that's probably one of the most important myths that I hear.
PAUL McVElGH:
It's true that community colleges in the
United States are both technical and vocational kinds of institutions.
But the big difference from the typical community college in other countries is that they also have the transfer capacity.
Jenny Macintyre.
Shayne Currie was on the list.
Is Shayne here?
From the Sunday Herald?
"Given the events of the weekend, which have involved the news media in some difficult legal decision-making, today's forum is pretty timely."
"In the case I'm referring to so obliquely, questions arise over coverage of failed suicide bids, presumably not covered by the Coroners Act: reporting the activities of celebrities; contempt of court, given that the person involved in this faces an impending trial; and a relatively new legal remedy that he and his family may have available to them, the tort of privacy."
"This was only recognised by the Court of Appeal of 2003 in the Mike Hosking versus New Idea case, when Mike tried to stop pictures of his kids appearing in the magazine."
"He failed, but the judges recognised that the tort of privacy, which is..."
"A tort is... gives you the legal right, one Person A, to sue Person B for damages, and it's undeveloped in New Zealand, so I'm not sure whether it applies in this case or not, but it might do, so it'll be interesting to see whether Sunday News cops it, or not."
"Read my blog, there's more on it."
"Okay, if you turned up today in the hope of hearing something relatively rare in this country, a journalist breaking ranks and dissing his own profession,"
"I use the word ""profession"" in quotes, and those who purport to be its guardians and spokespeople, then I'll probably disappoint you."
You've read the synopsis of what I was going to say.
"Due to the demands of the printer, that was written before I'd written this paper, or done any research, or had a chance to position my thinking."
I'm not an expert in this area.
"What was expressed in the preview came from something that happened once a year in my hometown, New Plymouth, when I taught journalism there for five years."
We had a thing called Death Week.
It was an idea borrowed from the Australians.
"I went to a conference there, and I thought I heard a journalism educator mention Death Week."
"In fact, it was only Death Day, but we..."
"I found in our course there were so many times when we were dealing with the coverage of trauma, homicides, and road crashes, and ghastly things, so we aggregated that into a Week."
"And one of our best speakers was the local coroner, someone who's long since disappeared under the new system."
"He was a bit of a renegade, this guy, and he was a very straight talker, and he ran to his own rules, basically, and they were not legally correct, but he didn't care."
"And he said if the local paper, who complained all the time, wanted to do anything about it, they could go to the Judiciary, but he knew damn well they wouldn't, because it would be too expensive, and they didn't."
"But what he said, the phrase that resonates still with me, is:"
"""Suicide is nobody else's business""."
"And his rule was, even though the law said that he should allow the name and the fact that the death was self-inflicted to be published, he said no."
"And he might make an exception if it was a local celebrity, but that was a big ""might""."
The 2006 Act has tidied all this up.
"We now have professional, or full-time, coroners, and I presume now they're all kept in line by the Chief Coroner."
"But in those days, the coroners were a law unto themselves."
You got a great variation around the country.
You might be tempted to think that you can get away with just cancelling.
What I mean is you might be tempted to think that something like this works. let's say you wanted to differentiate g of f of x.
You might set f of x equal to y.
"And then, you might think, well, what you're really trying to calculate is the derivative of g of y and okay."
"And then, you might say, well, the derivative of g of y, that will be the derivative of g with respect to y times the derivative of y with respect to x, and that's really the Chain rule."
"I mean, this first thing is the derivative of g and this other thing is the derivative of f just like you'd expect, and then you're trying to say that you can just cancel, alright?"
You're not allowed to just cancel.
"I mean, the upshot here is just that dy/dx is not a fraction, alright?"
"You can't justify this equality by just canceling because these objects, the way you're supposedly doing the canceling, they're not fractions."
We need a more delicate argument than that.
One way to go is to give a slightly different definition of derivative.
"Well, here's a slightly different way of packaging up the derivative."
"The function f is differentiable at a point a, provided there's some number, which I""m suggestively calling f prime of a, if the derivative of f at a, so that the limit of this error function is equal to 0."
And what's this error function?
"Well, it's measuring how far my approximation is that I'd get using the derivative from the actual functions output if I plug in an input value near a."
"In some ways, that's actually a nicer definition of derivative, since it really conveys that the derivative provides a way to approximate output values of functions."
"In any case, now, let's take this new definition of derivative and try to prove the Chain rule."
Try to approximate g of f of x plus h.
Try to discover the Chain rules.
"So, I want to be able to express this in terms of the derivative s of g and f, at least, approximately, and then control the error."
"Well, I can do that for f because I'm assuming that f is deferential about the point x."
"So, this is g of, instead of f of x plus h, f of x plus the derivative of f at x times h plus an error term, we should be calling error of f of h times h."
I'm going to play the same game with g.
This is g of f of x plus a small quantity.
"And if I assume that g is differentiable at the point f of x, then this is g of f of x plus the derivative of g at f of x times how much I wiggle by, which, in this case, is f prime of x h plus that error term plus an error term for g, which is the error term for g."
"And I have to put in how much I wiggled by, which, in this case, is f prime of xh plus the error term for f at h times h times that same quantity, f prime of xh plus the error term for f at h times h."
"Alright, so that's exactly equal to g of f of x plus h and I'm including all of the error terms."
"Now, we can expand out a bit."
"So, this is g of f of x plus, you can multiply these two terms together, g prime of f of x times f prime of xh."
"That's looking really good, because that's what the Chain rule is, right?"
It's supposed to give me this as the derivative of g composed with f.
"Plus, I've got a ton of error terms now."
Man has forgotten to love the world and all it contains and curiously is striving to understand it all.
"The countless henchmen who call themselves philosophers today, have never met sophia."
They are sealed around their own circles and do not know what wisdom is but who must solve the crisis if not the philosophers?
Who must innovate if not the philosophers?
"However, thats how I look at it!"
"But then again I was amongst those who introduced Pythagoras for Sophia, back then so I may be a little biased.."
"Let us instead ask our expert of today, Ole Fogh Kirkeby philosophy, master's in human and professor of management philosophy at Copenhagen business school. and director of the ""Centre for Art and management""."
"What do you say Ole, I'm biased or we have a crisis in philosophy?"
Ole:
"No, you are 100% right when you say we have a crisis in philosophy. but it is also a science crisis but funny that you should talk about ""the wisdom"", of it's become a fashionable word, a New Age phenomenon but it is very interesting because if you go back and look at one of socretas contemporary philosopher named Antístenes."
"He was a cynic and lived very old-fashioned, very poor, very simple"
He was asked what wisdom was and replied that it was about being as good as possible to unlearn everything you have learned.
Martin:
It is quite Taoist..
Ole:
"It is quite Taoist, yes and I have through out the summer been reading Chinese philosophy which puts you in a bad mood because this is where Greek philosophers got it from but trade routes were as such back then."
They had a different way of thinking..
Martin:
So it was not just spices and gold it was also philosophy from east to west?
Ole:
"It is quite clear there has been a huge exchange and if you start to think about life, you will reach to some of the same thoughts except of course that the Greek community is a fabulous community because it invents democracy and is so dynamic."
That you will not find in the Chinese feudal society.
Martin:
"No, China in the thirteen century, somehow turned the key as they burned their fleet and dissolved their academies and it is also true Islam, and at the time it was thought that ""now we know enough"" and that's about where we are now.. somehow people keep studying but they keep running around the same circles and what should be the recognition process where you say ""How do we improve the way of life"" is somehow removed, is not it?"
Ole:
"I 100% agree and therefore when I give lectures which I do a lot about a phenomenon that I've taken up from the Greeks, and then developed myself called Probtrektik, which means to turn its essence to essence in your life, to strengthen a person to think about why it lives and what it wants with his life."
"When I give presentations on ""Probtrektik"""
"I always start by saying that I follow the philosopher named Epicurus who was famous for letting the desire be in the right center but the good thing Epicurus said, was that ""the philosophy which does not relieve any suffering is false"" and I like it because suddenly you get philosophy ""into life"""
Martin:
Let's just highlight this ..
The philosophy which does not... so that means that philosophy is a human healing project?
Ole:
"Let's explore our second strategy for graph search, namely depth-first search."
"And again, like with breadth-first search, I'll open by just reminding you what the depth-first search is good for."
And we'll trace through it in a particular example and then we'll tell you what the actual code is.
"So if breath first search is the cautious and tentative exploration strategy, then depth first search or DFS for short is its more aggressive cousin."
So the plan is to explore aggressively and only backtrack when necessary.
And this is very much the strategy one often uses when trying to solve a maze.
"To explain what I mean, let me show you how this would work in the same running example we used when we discussed breath first search."
So here if we invoke depth first search from the node number S.
"Here's what's gonna happen, so obviously we start at S and obviously there's two places where we can go next."
"We can go to A or, or to B, and depth-first search is underdetermined like breath-first search, we can pick either one."
"So like with the breath-first search example, let's go to A first."
So A will be the second one that we explore.
"But now unlike breadth-first search where we automatically went to node B next, since that was the other layer one node, here the only rule is that we have to go next to one of A's immediate neighbors."
"So we might go to B but we're not going to B because it's one of the neighbors of S, we go because it's one of the neighbors of A, and actually to make sure the difference is clear, let's assume that we aggressively pursue deeper and we go from A to C. And now the depth-first search strategy is, again, just to pursue deeper."
"So, you go to one of C's immediate neighbors."
"So, maybe we go to E next."
"So, E is going to be the fourth one visited."
"Now, from E there's only one neighbor, not counting the one that we came in on."
"So, from E we go to D. And D is the fifth one we see, now from D we have a choice, we can either go to B or we can go to C. So let's suppose we go to C from D. Well then we get to a node number three, where we've been before, okay?"
And as usual we're going to keep track of where we've already been.
"So at this point we have to backtrack from C back to D, we retreat to D. Now there's still another outgoing edge from D to explore, namely the one to B. And so what happens is, we actually wind up wrapping all the way around this outer cycle."
And we hit B sixth.
"And now, of course, anywhere we try to explore, we see somewhere we've already been, so from B we try to go to S, but we've been there, so we retreat to B, we try, we can try to go to A, but we've been there, so we retreat to B. Now we've explored all of the options out of B. So we have to retreat from B, we have to go back to D. Now from"
"D we've explored both B and C, so we have to retreat back to E. E we've explored the only outgoing mark D, so we have to retreat to C. C we retreat to A. From A, we actually haven't yet looked along this arc."
But that just sends to B where we've been before.
"So then we retreat back to A. Finally, we retreat back to S and S, even at S there's still an extra edge to explore."
"At S we say, oh we haven't tried this S-B edge yet but, of course, when we look across, we get to B where we've been before and then we backtrack to S. Then we've looked at every edge once and so we stop."
That's how depth-first search works.
You just pursue your path.
You go to an immediate neighbor as long as you can until you hit somewhere you've been before and then you retreat.
"Now, why do we need another search strategy?"
Breadth first search was pretty cool.
"And I have come here today to offer you my condolences and my regrets and importantly to apologise to each of you for this tragedy."""
"General Allen's new directive to limit airstrikes comes nearly two years after his predecessor, General David Petraeus, also issued new rules that were billed as a major step toward reducing civilian casualties."
Syrian government forces have launched new attacks in several parts of Homs province in one of its largest offensives in recent weeks.
Syrian activists say at least 35 people were killed in bombings in the city of Homs as well as nearby towns.
The attacks come days after UN monitors were able to reach the village of al-Qubair in central Hama province in the aftermath of a massacre of up to 80 civilians.
"Syrian forces had previously blocked the monitors from visiting the site, fueling allegations the regime was trying to hide evidence of the killings."
A member of the UN team said the observers had come across human remains.
What we saw most [prominently] were two homes — one was damaged mainly from the rockets and BMBs and other calibers-small and large calibers bullets.
We found a variety of different kinds of bullets there.
The other was burnt [buildings] with bodies inside the bodies.
You can smell the burn of dead bodies.
"You coan also see body parts in and around the village."""
"According to UN figures, government-backed forces in Syria have killed more than 10,000 people during the more than year-long uprising against the Assad regime."
"President Obama took criticism from Republicans over the weekend after saying the private sector is ""doing fine."""
"Obama was comparing the private sector's gain of 4.3 million jobs in the past 27 months to the public sector's loss of 550,000 jobs over the same period."
"On Friday, Obama clarified his stance."
The economy's not doing fine.
"There are too many people out of work, the housing market is still weak and too many homes under water, and that's precisely why I asked Congress to start taking some steps that could make a difference."
"What I've been saying consistently over the last year, we've actually seen some good momentum in the private sector."
"We've seen 4.3 million jobs created, 800,000 this year alone."
Record corporate profits.
"And so that has not been the biggest drag on the economy."""
"While Obama's comments drew widespread scrutiny, Republican candidate Mitt Romney drew far less media attention after openly attacking the hiring of firefighters, police officers, and teachers."
"Speaking in Iowa on Friday, Romney invoked the recent election in Wisconsin to criticize Obama for pushing a measure to help states regain public sector jobs."
He wants to hire more government workers.
"He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers."
Did he not get the message of Wisconsin?
The American people did.
"It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people."""
Attorney General Eric Holder has appointed two prosecutors to head a probe into recent leaks of information on classified government programs.
"Holder announced the investigation after bi-partisan anger over published reports revealing President Obama's secret ""kill list"" as well as the U.S.-Israeli use of cyberweapons to target Iran's nuclear program."
The FBI had already announced a probe of the cyberweapons operation last week.
"Creating official tweets official websites, where you could see exact calls to meeting."
"I'd like you to tell me if it was easy for you to get that information, if there was any tension, how the whole thing evolved..."
It's complicated.
JL:
"Yes, it's complicated."
"I can give you lots of good examples, and one bad one which changed my attitude."
And I think it was the second big day.
The second big day.
We're talking about the 17th or the 18th.
"In an assembly I heard twice, twice, how everyone in the assembly, 1500 people, unanimously approved of demonstrating on the day of reflexion."
"The assembly moderator asked if they knew what they were doing, and if they were sure they wanted to demonstrate and call a demonstration for the Saturday."
And everyone said yes.
I informed about that immediately through Twitter about the demonstration call on the Saturday.
"From the moment that was decided in the assembly, it went through the legal commission, the communication group, and they decided"
NOT to call the demonstration because it would bring them too many legal problems.
"So they denied that the assembly had made that agreement, they said they would be there, but that they didn't call upon anyone to go."
"As they were denying that, the communication group denied to me that the assembly had decided to demonstrate, and they started calling everyone who had said the assembly had made that decision manipulators, rather than explaining it another way."
"I understand that kind of thing, no-one's asking the Puerta del Sol communication group or the legal commission to work as a large corporation press office, I can't ask that of them, but from that first moment you realise that if you really want to inform of the shades of what's happening there, you have to spend hours and hours there, experiencing it first hand and not allowing any official press release to tell you what's going on."
Just like in the rest of the world.
"But it's more in this case, because it's much more complex."
"From that moment on I knoew that the key to everything was in the legal commission, in the commision to dynamize assemblies, in the commission coordination group... what the 15M was, and what it was going to be, was developed in these work groups."
And I just did my job and worked hard talking to people and meeting people.
Calling and having coffee with people.
Meeting people who understood that journalists are not always dangerous or have bad intentions.
And from then on I was able to write reports of my own.
"And in a few years, read them, share them, check them, criticise them, and see that I took a chance."
"Reports like the first 40 hours of Sol, many hours going through non-official channels to inform about what was happening."
"Or a report, also very sensitive, that I titled:"
"""The Sol camp, trapped in itself"", about the problem that arose regarding if they should camp or not."
"Obviously you have to talk to a lot of people and be very careful not to hurt feelings, to avoid taking anything to the category of definitive, because nothing was definitive- or official- there."
"But on the other hand, while I say that all the journalistic work was done getting around the official channels, on the other hand regarding diffusion and communication, the heights that the 15M got to in social networks was spectacular."
The community management in Twitter from @acampadasol is spectacular.
"They contribute a huge amount to the amount of waste that needs to be dealt with, so, you know, they can make a positive impact by perhaps the hotels that they choose to stay at, making sure, asking, ""ok, what's your environmental policy?"
What do you do with your waste?
"I want to make sure that the waste that I'm creating at this hotel, or what the hotel is creating is ending up at the right place, not going and polluting the rivers and going into the ocean and actually degrading the whole tourist experience."" The whole point of going to a place for a holiday, a nice holiday, is to relax, maybe enjoy the sea, but if there's a bunch of trash in it, then obviously it's not really what you came here for."
So you can ask your hotel what they do with their stuff.
"You can, before coming here, make a pledge to support a local organization that's maybe working to support the environment, to keep the place that you're coming to visit beautiful and functioning, and you can donate to those organization, those non-profits, and support projects like that."
"And, on a larger scale,"
"I would like to see the places, the tourist destinations, perhaps saying that 1% of money that you spend on hotel or food or airline tickets goes to supporting an environmental fund, or a green fund."
"There are places that have done that effectively, like Gili Trawangan, off the coast of Lombok, has the Gili Ecotrust, so you know, just a small amount, I think it's a dollar per day per tourist goes to that fund, and that helps to do the waste management and addresses different environmental issues. / Everyone wants to be green, and basically the first phase of that is you have some pioneers that are being green, and then everyone jumps on the bandwagon and says they're green, and more often than not, unfortunately a lot of people are just saying they're green."
"They might have good intentions, others might not, but it's just a marketing element, and they say ""We're green!"" or ""We recycle, we do that,"" but as people, as customers and people understand that it's not enough just to say that, they have to prove it, they have to explain what they do."
"And even you know, just asking questions and that, it adds up, it helps. / At the top of any waste management plan should always be prevetion first, then reduction, and then you start looking at, ok, well the waste is already there, what can we do with it?"
Can we reuse it?
"Ok, if we can't reuse it, can we recycle it?"
"But it's got to be in that pyramid of priorities. / So what the coalition is doing right now is to encourage business to do waste prevention, we call it Plastic Detox Bali."
"Our community, right now, people right now, are addicted to plastic."
"They tend to freak out, like ""WHAT?"
"No plastic allowed??"""
"We have to keep reminding, we're not anti-plastic; we need plastic."
But you need to learn how to use it wisely.
"So, to help them ease this addiction,"
"I guess, Plastic Detox Bali."
There's a series of actions that business can take.
"Like first, we ask them not to provide plastic bags for free. / What I think should be done on Bali, and perhaps in the rest of Indonesia, but certainly in Bali, is first introduce a bag tax."
Make people pay for it.
Pay for the plastic bag.
Pay for the privilege.
"Pay for the mounting external costs, because then hopefully people will realize this is not free."
People think it's free now and they think it's modern.
"They think free, modernity, nice, ya?"
"""Asik, dong?"""
But it's not.
Because what about the cost of cleaning it up over the long term.
What about the health costs incurred by people who inhale the dioxins created by burning it.
They're all different kinds of scenarios you can come up with here.
"The thing to note there is it's such a simple enhancement to TV, yet it makes it so much more interactive."
"So all of your TV, all of the Internet and a way to find everything you watch, want everything you want to watch, as well as the way to integrate the TV and"
Internet together.
"One last thing I'm happy to announce, soon we'll be bringing tens of thousands of the same applications you can get on your mobile phone to your TV."
We're going to be launching support for Android Market in early 2011.
"TV, a full web, tens of thousands of applications."
Google TV gives you access to more entertainment than any other living room device you've ever experienced.
Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Thank you, Brittany."
So that was phenomenal.
I think you've seen two really
historic things today.
"The first, of course, with Google Television, you saw--and it happened so fast, you got used to it--you saw an active browser with a picture and picture window of the screen show that you would or previously selected in your web search."
"You also saw in the selection in search that you had five television shows, 230 YouTube videos and 5,000 other sites that you could visit over Star Trek."
"All of a sudden, we can combine the two together."
"The other thing that's happening is because this is a Chrome-based solution, talking about browsers, you can actually program this, and it'll be possible, over time, to actually write programs and program your television to do exactly what you've always wanted to do rather than just yelling at it, which is what most people do."
"So--and in Hugo's presentation, you saw the ultimate extension of what we could do technologically by having people who, at least in theory, can't speak the same language, literally being able, with a little bit of help, to communicate and do an economic transaction on the shoe department."
"The important thing here is that these are things that were the stuff of science fiction a few years ago, and now they are very, very real."
So what I'd like to do is talk a little bit about the political context of all of this.
And then talk a little bit about the future and then take your questions or comments.
And thank you--thank you both again.
"The Internet is creating a great Internet disruption, and that disruption is changing so many things."
It's affecting so many of us in so many different ways.
It's--there are many quotes in this.
"Joseph Schumpeter called it the ""perennial gale of creative destruction,"" that over and over again, some assumption that we had is no longer true and a new assumption takes forth."
And the Internet has replaced the economics of scarcity.
How difficult it is to get to things with the economics of ubiquity.
You have to be everywhere.
You have to be--you have to be all over everywhere all the time.
"And any business that's built on controlling or restricting the flow of information is having difficulty, whereas businesses that are about popularizing information, getting it as broadly as possible, tend to benefit in this new world, and you see this from our technology."
"And all of these disruptions are both terrifying and exciting, especially, obviously, for the incumbents that are affected by this very seriously."
"We'll talk about a new product called Google Television that's part of--part of this right now, which, again, think of them not as devices but rather as portals onto this very, very large set of data and supercomputers that are in the back."
"So it's not the smartphone by itself, and it's not the network by itself, it's the smartphone and the network and then all of the information that is behind it; it's the sum of that that is creating all of the excitement that everybody cares so much about."
"Now, in that model, which is called Cloud computing, it's like having a supercomputer in your pocket."
This happens all the time.
"When we do voice translation, when we do picture identification, our computer, the smartphone, all it does is send the request to the supercomputers that then do all the work."
They wait and then the answer comes back.
"The smartphone itself just has to have enough power to get to the network, take the picture or what have you and give you the answer."
"So it's the sum of all of that that has made such a huge, huge phenomenon."
"So when I go for example to the--to the cathedral, the Berliner Dom and I say, first question is ""How do I get there?"" Well, it'll say you can--how long to get there to walk or bike, you have lots of bike paths here in Berlin."
"And when I get there, I can say, ""Navigate to it"" it will tell me there."
"I can point it at the cathedral and it will tell me all of the information about the cathedral, you know, in this particular case, yesterday, the building dates back to the 15th century; the present building was completed in 1905, reconstructed after the war and the organ has a 113 stops, whatever that is."
"So, all of a sudden, my experience as a tourist, I found it where I wanted to go, I was told this is the most important place."
"I managed to walk there by myself, I looked up and everything"
I needed to know was right there.
And I can repeat that in all of the great cities of
"Europe and, in fact, in all the great cities around the world, and soon, we think, pretty much everywhere."
That's an amazing extension of my experience here in Berlin.
This is a form of artificial intelligence.
Its intelligence where the computer does what it does well and it helps us think better.
"One way to think about it is the computer and the human, together, each does something better because the other is helping."
"We help the computer, the computer helps us."
How do we help the computer?
"You do it all the time because you help tell the computer, ""This is a--this is this kind of an object, this--this is that kind of an object"" and we use those signals, they're called classifiers, and all of a sudden we learn, this is this type of thing, this is that type of thing and the computer can then map that."
"Obviously, humans then benefit from all that information as you go."
"So in this notion of augmented humanity, of Google helping, computer companies helping, it's not a new idea."
"It's been around along time, Bill Gates in 1990 in Comdex called it ""Information at your Fingertips."" All the information that someone might be interested including information they can't get today."
"And we're nearly there, which is what's so profound."
"And literally, you can know literally, everything."
"It's fantastic, right?"
And this is only going to become more pervasive.
"Think about it as hearing, speaking, thinking, augmenting the way you understand things, all of it literally available to you now."
"That's the big change because of the combination of the mobile device, the network."
"like my kitchen waste: more or less, like 70% is organic, so I have a compost box, I just put this 70% of organic [waste] into the compost, because this will go back again to nature, you know, back again to my vegetable plot, and then the rest, 30%, most of this 30% not organic garbage is recyclable, and has an economic value, too, because in Bali we have 'pemulung'."
Pemulung are like the garbage collectors.
"Sometimes they buy it from you, from every house."
"They will travel around [saying], ""berang bekas, berang bekas,"" meaning like ""garbage, garbage,"" and then they will buy it."
"They have a really good value for plastic, for bottles, like beer bottles, for paper, for aluminium, metal, steel, copper, they have a really really good price to buy it from the people, and most of this 30% not organic garbage from my kitchen is recyclable, so you can sell it, or just give it, to this garbage collector, and this 25% will be going to recycle, to be something good, new goods, and so only 5% is your actual garbage, what we call really garbage."
This is
"like the soft plastic material, like biscuits,"
"'kemasan' biscuit packaging, or plastic bags."
"So, from my opinion, if there's only 5% garbage going to the dumping place because we cannot do anything with it"
"I think the dumping place would not be so full so quickly. / So I think the most practical way now that we in Bali don't have a waste management facility yet, a proper one, is to do waste prevention: each household can do that, like bringing your own bag, bringing your own container, bringing your own bottle, so you don't add more waste."
I know it looks just small.
"""But it's only one plastic bag!"" But well, I worked with a group of students once, and we asked them to observe how many plastic bags entered the household each [day], and one student came and said, ""5 plastic bags""."
"Ok, let's calculate."
"In a month, that will be 150."
"And how many people, how many families, more or less in your banjar (village)?"
"She said, ""55""."
"That means, in a year, there will be more than like 10,000 plastic bags."
That's a lot.
"This happened to me, because when we're talking about plastic, for example, the big problem in Bali, I tried to live a one month ""plastic diet""."
"We call it ""plastic diet""."
"Just to get the data about how difficult it would be to live without, to minimize as much as possible using plastic."
It can be done.
"We go shopping, we just bring our own bags, our own carrier, so it's not so difficult."
"For most of our customers, we provide them with a monthly recycling report."
"So, they get a sheet of paper that says, ok these are the things that you were able to recycle: this much aluminum, this much plastic bottles, this much of this other plastic, paper, blah, blah, blah."
And then we go down the list of other things that were man made but weren't recyclable.
"You know, styrofoam, or some hazardous stuff."
"And then we go down into the organics and explain to them the food waste we collected and all that, so they have a record of what actually they are producing."
"And at first, you know, they're like, ""oh, that's cute, that's nice, whatever,"" but after a while, when they look back and they see, over 6 months or a year, they realize actually how much waste they produce."
"And in some cases, it's quite shocking."
"So it's kind of a wake-up call, and it makes them realize that yes, they are polluters; they have to think about their impacts."
I think tourists have an enormous responsibility for the impacts that they create on any country that they visit.
"On this couch we have had talkes about the importance of planting the world's deserts and there's a lot of desert in Africa, about 9 million square kilometers of desert infact"
"Now ... if they were green, perhaps there wasn't a great need to go up here in order to take over our values then perhaps it was..."
"Well, I think of the fact that you want to make small units strong and if that was to be spread all over the world .. then it also has something to do with the simple infrastructure and where to get food from"
Ole:
"Yes, but it's easy enough to turn desert development for the're made ​​of things we have done ourselves, right? and at the same time we have to look at the fact that the entire world population could be fed by an arial equivalent to france so we're not really that bad of yet.."
Martin:
"But in the middle of the Sahara, they are.."
"They are, and therefore we must make Sahara fertile it would be a great picture and we can easily do that"
Martin:
"And you would be willing to spread the Danish society, perhaps not as it is now, but in some ideal version, places around the world?"
Ole:
"At some point, I would say that the Danish ... and Scandinavian ... not only the Danish .. came closest to an ideal society that has existed such a relatively stable society seen in world history partly because, after second World War the right and the left wing, stood together deciding that people who could not support themselves was in their right to recieve govermental support"
"It was not a charity, it's about to change into now, right."
In the Baroque period they started to give civil rights ..
"The ""soras theorists"" fought for that.. you get political rights in the 1800 century and in the 1900 century, voting and so on and finally after the second World War Il, you get the social rights"
Martin:
"But there are some fundamental problems that we also need to look into today, in order to resolve them"
One is technological unemployment which means the more machines we get the less work there is !!
The second is the combination of democracy and market as democracy hasn't been standing alone since ancient greece
It is the combination of free market forces that does that you have advertising that manipulates around with people you have messages that are becoming more and more superficial for everyone to understand them and you have journalists and spin doctors who sit in all the management positions and you have the media talking down to people
This issue we probably also need to be addresseing too?
What do you say?
Ole:
"Yes, we have a terrible problem in the fact that we don't even own our country"
"If I had that much power, we should also be able to impose the small units but these small units would of course also be knowledge, culture and information-units and ie. on those that type of advertising would rebound because it did not fit their reality but again one must be careful that it doesn't accomplish a totalitarianism"
Martin:
But you have only until 21.12 so I guess it can not avoid becoming a totalitarianism?
Ole:
"No, it is very totalitarian..."
Martin:
"Norway, for example, already has these units cause they have their little villages and has a right to theater, public swimming baths and other things"
"Great things happens, especially culturally out in those small communities"
She came to
Partners when she was struggling to find ways of opening up workable education pathways for her daughter who has a visual impairment.
"We were having difficulties with our Onslow County school system where we live, and she was having to travel about two hours on a weekly basis just to be able to attend school and having to live somewhere besides her home environment."
"And, someone told me about Partners and asked if I thought I would be interested."
And I didn't know anything about Partners at the time.
And what happened was ultimately learning and being able to meet the people that Partners
[laughs]
It's almost like they pull them out of a hat but they're absolutely fantastic.
"And those people were able to show us not only knowledge but give us the power, show us power that we actually had, that we could change and make a difference to bring our children either home, in our case, or do what needed to be done so that they could get education."
"In every situation for us, and that's just being parents of our children with a disability."
[male narrator]
"One young graduate of the program, self-advocate David Chatterton feels that the Partners program has been a great experience, and helped in preparing him for a career."
"I went into Partners because I wanted to meet new people, but also, I just kind of wanted to make a change in my life and to kind of get a strong sense of you know not letting people put you down, and what not."
"It was overwhelming, just because it goes deeper into the whole disability area."
I love to educate myself.
I love that others educate me as well.
"So, going into Partners, you meet a lot of people that share a lot of the same visions as you."
[male narrator]
"David is now looking to the future to continue his education, pursue a career and use his advocacy skills."
"Nurturing leadership and advocacy, and providing the voices of the future for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is a primary purpose of Partners in Policymaking"
"Holly Riddle, the executive director of the"
"North Carolina Council, says it is a strong supporter and funder of the program."
"Many boards, commissions, committees, offices are staffed or are joined by Partners in Policymaking graduates."
"When people come to Partners, they are the finest leaders that we get application from and when they come out, they can't be beat."
It has always been the case that it is from individuals with disabilities and families that innovations come.
"When you're that close to the life of someone or when it is your own life, you think on your feet so many of the ideas that inform the field today at a systems level began in someone's living room in a classroom with an individual, or with a family many of them Partners in Policymaking graduates."
[male narrator]
"There remains a challenging road ahead for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and the hope for change lies in improving the policies and systems designed to support and encourage these individuals and their families."
"It is people, such as the graduates of the"
Partners in Policymaking program who will bring about that system change.
"And after Partners, became empowered, and knowledge is power."
"And once that happened, the bitterness, the anger- it left."
- there is a number for everything these days - and you might have heard of Dunbar's number; who has?
"OK, good."
Dunbar's number is essentially a cognitive limit to the number of people one can have or maintain stable social relationships with.
Any guesses how big is that number?
One?
No.
How much?
49.
"OK, we're getting closer."
"It turns out it's 150, which, if you think, is not that little."
"So if previously, when you were counting your friends and people you like to talk with, if you counted more like 49 or 60, even if you got it up to 100, you can see that there is still quite some space or room for enlargement, so to say, of mind and heart in respect to other people, which leads me to the next question."
So how do you establish and maintain a meaningful relationship?
It seems that it doesn't happen in these business card swapping and bar hopping occasions.
It seems that relationships that are meaningful or serious are grounded in meaningful experiences.
Let me explain you what I think these ways are or what these experiences  that bond us are.
"Let me explain it with a simple diagram, sort of my take  on Maslow's pyramid of needs, and I apologize for such a cliche, but, you know, whatever works, as Woody Allen would say."
"What we have at the bottom of that pyramid, I would say, are random social gatherings."
"You can get to know people in public spaces: bars, nightclubs, or events."
"Usually, in those circumstances, a considerable amount of alcohol is used, and not without a reason, because you might have noticed that with every next drink you become more sociable, and people become more interesting, and you can certainly form at least some type of relationships that way, but you might've also noticed that these are not the most lasting relationships, so I wouldn't suggest you to stay on this biological, so to say, level."
"The next level, I would say, is that of geographical proximity."
"We are friends with people we grow up with, that are right next door from us."
And you certainly do share some basic interests and needs with your neighbours:
"you don't want to be robbed, or you might need to share some home appliance once in a while, and, of course, less and less so, but at least the option of becoming friends with your neighbours is always there, it is physically available."
"But again, as I said, less and less so these days."
"So, the first level, strangers in a bar; the second level, neighbours; the third level, of course, family."
"These are actually people you can rely on, who will show up, most likely, in that hospital."
"Of course, you inherit a certain group of people, and then you add a few more, but then altogether, that is a rather narrow group of people, unless you're working hard on the number of children, or something like that."
"So we move to the next level, and this the level, I would say, the majority of our friendships form, and this is the level where actually our interests bring us together."
"Hopefully, you study what you're interested in, hopefully, at a university you like, hopefully, you ended up working in a field that you're interested in."
This is actually the level that you can spend days and nights talking about subjects that nobody else seems to care about.
"This is where you're bound to run into shared troubles, or find out something, or you create something new."
"It's all great, and altogether, I would say, for many people it's perfectly enough with people and their friends from the combination of these levels."
"Yes, art is a great source of inspiration for a lot of other areas such as leadership for one discovers's what artists can ... see, I called it in my dissertation titled ""Events and body shells"".."
"I called it ""translokutionaritet"" which means ""I know only what I mean, when I hear what I say"" it can be compared with .. now, you're a artist painter, right?"
"And when you start to paint, take the picture takes over, right? and paints for you ... that's also ""translokutionaritet"", right? but the importance of companies and processes ... when you get something going, you'll be able to learn from it and be able to change course and think ""What the hell is that I've got going on here"" and ""Hey, this can become something better and much different and stronger and bigger"" and all that experience has"
Martin:
"But I also think about.. ehrm ... if you believe that this artistic process, in which one is has the need to open a lot more for the deap values ​​in oneself can help managers to take some more humane decisions?"
Ole:
"Well, I think it is important for two reasons.."
"Firstly, because the leaders are forced to make innovation not just make new products and services but also change the organization in a certain way and also do so in a humanist way, right? so therefore in every way in a world where art really is commercialized and remooved from the ideal of the work as something substantial and as a messenger from the other side then yet it is as if the positivity of art is foaming and flowing on to other worlds while parts of the art just becomes ""installation art"" or Damien Hirst over again."
"A laugh, right?"
"So speculative art.. and yet, the hole artistic way to be which throughout history has been characterized by that in art, the human values is realized as well as the existential problems, right"
"Thats what the artists expresses and it also starts a need to express both the existential and the valuational flowing on to almost, one might say, the banal sphere of the economy, in technology"
"look at the design, look at ... in general ... we become much more artistic because we become much more spiritual"
"I think so, I see it!"
Martin:
"I sometimes think about the invention of conceptual artists which of course doesn't really have a piece it is a sign that the idea of ​​a work piece, at a very high level of professionalism and craftsmanship, are disappearing in benefit that some of the things might leak out among us?"
"Because you can say, if we had the artistic way of expressing ourselves at the moment and with each other, we wouldn't need so many works of art.."
Ole:
"And that was what I tried to say.. to dealing with other people ... both in communication and in private life, by all means but also, from managers to employees and back again ... can be an art the arts also means that you master and that you can"
"Martin: and it is very exciting, I think."
Ole:
"So what I tryed to say was, I don't think the dream of arts ever dies because the works'll retain there power and force if those that redeems it is good enough it'll launch itself.. but there will not be as many of them as they are more spread out in the sence you said it, and I really like that."
"Holes are made in the art into real life, right? which leaks out a warmth and a force to become a much more artistic expression"
Martin:
"And I know this is something you use together with Peter Hanke, the conductor"
Ole:
"I have, yes. and a conductor's also a leader, right?"
Does it have anything to do with that?
Ole:
"Yes oh yes, to put it mildly."
Martin:
So I wonder ..
"Are there any others that does that around the world, since you have so much faith in a cultural awakening?"
"In case of thorotrast, it is proven that P53 is damaged in the first stage, and it takes 20 to 30 years for the 2nd, 3rd mutations to occur, causing liver cancer and leukemia."
About iodine-131.
"As you know, iodine accumulates in thyroid gland, and that is most noticeable during the formative phase of thyroid gland, i.e. in small children."
"However, when the first researcher in Ukraine was saying in 1991 ""There are an increasing number of thyroid cancer"", researchers in Japan and the US were publishing articles in Nature magazine saying ""There is no causal relationship between the radiation and thyroid cancer."""
Why did they say that?
"Because there was no data prior to 1986, there was no statistical significance."
The statistical significance was finally noted 20 years later.
Why?
Because the peak that started in 1986 disappeared.
"So even without the data prior to 1986, the occurrence of thyroid cancer and radiation exposure from Chernobyl had the causal relationship."
Epidemiological proof is very difficult.
It is impossible to prove until all the cases are done.
"Therefore, from the viewpoint of ""protecting our children"" a completely different approach is required."
"Dr. Shoji Fukushima from a national institution called Japan Bioassay Research Center, which researches health effects of chemical compounds, has been studying diseases involving urinary tract since the Chernobyl accident."
Dr. Fukushima and doctors in Ukraine studied parts of bladders removed during more than 500 cases of prostatic hypertrophy surgery.
"They found out that in the highly contaminated area where 6Bq/liter was detected in urine, there was a high frequency of mutation of p53 though 6Bq may sound minuscule."
"They also noticed many cases of proliferative precancerous conditions, which we assume was due to the activation of p38 MAP kinase and the signal called ""NF-kappa B,"""
"leading inevitably to proliferative cystitis, with carcinoma in situ occurring with considerable frequency."
"Knowing this, I was astounded to hear the report that 2 to 13Bq/liter [of radioactive cesium] was detected from the breast milk of seven mothers in Fukushima."
"We at the Radioisotope Center of Tokyo University have been helping to decontaminate Minami-Soma City, sending about 4 people at a time and doing decontamination work for the length of 700km per week."
"Again, what's happening to Minami-Soma clearly shows that 20 or 30 kilometer radius [from the nuke plant] doesn't make any sense at all."
You have to measure in more detail like measuring each nursery school.
"Right now, from the 20 to 30 kilometer radius area, 1,700 school children are put on the buses to go to school."
"Actually in Minami-Soma, the center of the city is located near the ocean, and 70% of the schools have relatively low level of radiation."
"Yet, children are forced to get on the school buses to go all the way to schools near Iitate-mura [where radiation is higher], spending 1 million yen everyday for the busing."
I strongly demand that this situation be terminated as soon as possible.
What's most problematic is the government's policy that they will compensate the residents for the moving cost only if their areas are designated as official evacuation zones.
"In a recent committee held at the House of Councilors [Upper House], then-President Shimizu of TEPCO and Mr. Kaieda, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry answered that way."
I ask you to separate the two immediately - compensation criteria issue and children's safety issue.
I strongly ask you to do whatever you can to protect children.
"Another thing is, what I strongly feel when I'm doing the decontamination work in Fukushima is that emergency decontamination and permanent decontamination should be dealt with separately."
We've been doing a lot of emergency decontamination work.
"And we called it Padugo, bleeding for the cause."
"Anyway, the first village we created in Bagong Silang has inspired many people to discover that they can do it."
And many of our people abroad started to build their own village in the poorest towns or barangays where they came from.
"And after we launched this in 2003 with various schools, a lot of young people who became our volunteers, we have been able to build 2000 communities and impacted then the lives of about 1 million people."
And what is interesting is that our latest count is we've had already more than 1 million volunteers in our communities.
So it has become the work of nation building.
"And lately, we are very happy that our legislators have also taken notice and are now have filed a bill called House Bill 4374, it's the House Bill for Volunteerism for Nation Building."
"And the goal is to build 50,000 communities, one per barangay following the Gawad Kalinga model."
"So that's addressing the issue of social justice for 5 million families in our country because that will now become the platform for good citizenship, for productivity and for bottom of the pyramid wealth creation."
"And so, after building the first village, we're now embarking on the second phase."
We call it the phase of social artistry.
"We're now building the Enchanted Farm village university in Angat, Bulacan."
This is the first of 25 farm village universities.
Farm because it really encourages people in the city to go - to find opportunities in the countryside.
"It is about the management and the business graduates of the top schools in the city to work with scientist and to work with the agriculturist and to work for the rich, to work with the poor for us to really transform this country into a land of squatters, into a land of rebels in the countryside and to be able to see that we have over 12 million hectares of underproductive land where we can plant coffee and cacao."
"Because what is to me is really disturbing is a country that can feed the cattle and the carabaos and produce milk because we have kakawate, we have grass, we have malunggay and we have, you know, napier, everything is here, but we import 99% of our milk."
"And we can produce the best chocolate, we can produce, you know, the best ice cream using"
local ingredients and so on.
"So now, the second phase is to really look at the different industries that are undeveloped."
"Like our chocolate, we only - we consume 36,000 tons of chocolate beans but we produce only 6000."
So why should we import?
"And to me, it's very tragic that the producers of cacao and coffee are from the equator belt and down but the rich countries own the brand and own the wealth."
"And so it's very, it's important for us to really just, you know, go back, reconnect with the resources that we have."
"And so, we hope that we can - we are moving to the phase of sustainability through innovation."
"Before Gawad Kalinga, it was not the practice in this country for landowners to donate their"
land to the poor.
"But when we show that if you have ten hectares of land and you give two hectares of it, we can bring 100 families out of being informal settlers, out of living in the slums and build communities where people have strong values, that people can build their homes and can now really have the motivation to work or send their children to school."
"We realize that we'd trigger economic development, we bring peace and order, land values start to go up."
"And so, land owners now - now, we have land coming out of our ears."
"So in seven years, we're able to raise enough land in 400 towns good for 1 million families."
So I don't think it's a problem for us to get land for 5 million - to get 5 million families out of being informal settlers in this country.
"You know, it is about solidarity."
O is the circumcenter.
This is all a little bit of review.
"So if we have three points, we have a unique triangle, that triangle has a unique circumcenter which is equidistant to the three points of the triangle."
"I should say three vertices of the triangle. and that distance between the three vertices,"
Let me draw that in a different color.
"So this distance, the length of OA,"
"The length of OC, and the length of OB,"
"So OA = OC = OB, which is the circumradius"
"And, we've learned when we first talked about circles, if you give me a point, and if we find the locus of all points that are equidistant from that point then that is a circle."
"And when I say locus, all I mean is the set of all points"
"If you give me any point right over here, so that's an arbitrary point and you also specify a radius, and you say what is the set of all the points on this two dimensional plane, that are equidistant that are a radius away from the center that uniquely defines a circle"
That's how we define a circle.
"And similarly, if you say,"
"look, if you start with a center at O and you say all the points that are a circumradius away from O, it will uniquely identify a circle, and that circle will contain that points A, B, and C because those are the circumradius away from O so they are included in that set."
So the circle would look something like this
Trying my best to draw it
Now everything we've talked about now
"like in the last few minutes, is all review."
"We know all of it, but I went over it just to kind of reinstate a pretty interesting idea that if you give me three points, that defines a unique triangle, and if you have a unique triangle, and, let me make this clear, this is three non-colinear points"
So three points not on the same line
"If you have three points that are not on the same line, that defines a unique triangle."
"For any unique triangle you have a unique circumcenter, and circumradius"
"And if you give me any point in space, any unique point, and a radius the set of all points that are exactly that radius away from it that defines a unique circle."
So we went through all of this business of talking about a unique triangle with a unique circumcenter and unique circumradius to really just show you that if you give me any three points that eventually really just defines a unique circle
"So just as you need three points to define a triangle, you also need three points to define a circle"
Two points won't do it
"And one way to think about it is that if you give me just two points, there's an infinite number of triangles that I can construct with those two points because I can put the third point anywhere"
I could construct this triangle
I could construct this triangle.
I could construct this triangle.
"And all of these triangles are going to have different circumcenters and different radiuses, and so they are going to construct different circles that circumscribe about those triangles"
"So for example, this would be one circle that could circumscribe that triangle"
So the scales in this diagram are misleading.
"If you really want to lay scales on it, you need to use the invariant interval or, the appropriate hyperbolas to draw these distances."
This is one of the reasons why doing calculations from these graphs can be confusing the thing that is always meaningful in these graphs is the order of things.
"In other words, what is true is that the entire region above the'x' axis is positive't' and that an event that is. further up than another is later as viewed by this observer and similarly the entire region above in this sense, the x prime axis is at +t prime and the region below it in this direction is at -t prime and the order of the events can be read off from this grid, you draw the grid and if you have some random event over here the infamous birthday party that we spoke of, over here."
Then to read off its X and T we drop.
Parallel to the x and t axis and we see that this happened at x a little larger than two and t getting close to four.
"If you want to plot this in x prime, t prime co-ordinates we."
Draw lines parallel to the axis because remember this line is a line of constant T prime.
"It's parallel to the X prime axis, and this is a line of constant X prime."
And we see that this happened at X prime a little less then one and T prime somewhere between two and three is when this birthday party happened.
"So this is how we read coordinates off of these space time diagrams, I hope that was helpful."
And now
I am going to erase all these grids which are just confusing.
And note that I have marked here our favorite two events.
"Event number one is the instant t equal to zero when the left end of the ladder enters the garage and notice that as anticipated because I made this point which we know is L root one - v^2 over c^2 less than G then there, the entire ladder at this point is enclosed in the garage and this goes on until the time of this event labelled two, event number two is the instant where the right end of the ladder starts protruding from the garage and so as I suggested there, there is this whole region here from t1 to t2 where the entire ladder's inside the garage, okay?"
"So, now we can ask what happens if I close the door."
"Well if I close the right door and oh, sorry and I forgot to note on the other hand we can see directly from this diagram that at event number two."
While in the garage frame event number two happened after event number one and indeed for this whole time the ladder was inside the garage.
"In the ladder frame, event number two occurs before event number one, remember these are all the events that are simultaneous with the ladder entering the garage."
Event number two corresponds.
To some negative value of t prime down here and indeed it preceded as seen by the ladder event number one there as seen by the ladder the right end poked out of the garage before the left end got in and the ladder was never in the garage.
"So now you can ask, alright well, what happens if I close the door?"
"Well if I close the door, then let me decide that the front door of the gara, the, the, the, the door of the garage at g is going to be closed."
"What that means is that the right end of the ladder travels, at event number two it hits the garage door and from that moment on the left end, the right end of the ladder is at rest and moves along this green trajectory."
Now.
"The way we're used to thinking about it, is a ladder is a ladder."
If at this point in time.
"The ladder stopped, then the entire ladder stopped and if voila, we have the entire ladder contained in the garage as seen by the garage frame."
"But, this is confusing because in the ladder frame, remember, at when this event happened, in the ladder frame, the left end of the garage wasn't in the garage yet."
The left end of the ladder wasn't in the garage yet.
So what is this saying?
"Well, the answer to this is that we have made an unwarranted assumption here."
All I can do is read through his budget requests and see his numbers and some of the reforms and things that he's proposing.
A couple of notes on that are that he is proposing a 50% cut.
He's viewing the Community Services Block Grant as one of those programs he's willing to give in and give up some of the funding in this great debate over the debt limit and the deficit and which programs should be cut and which ones should be saved.
There's an obvious conclusion that can be drawn that the President views the Community Services Block Grant as one of those programs he's willing to give up some funding for in this process.
"However, a number of the reforms that he's proposing targeting resources to high performing innovative agencies in this performance based funding approach, this is not just the Community Services Block Grant that he's talking about."
"This is really government wide efforts to increase the performance based approach to funding, to look at how agencies in the government are measuring performance and managing performance and providing funding based off of that."
There's a number of different programs that you'll see get funding increases in the budget based off of their ability to show that they are performing effectively and efficiently using the dollars that are given to them.
There's view here that the Community Services Block Grant is unable to do that at the moment.
Arley:
"Just to add to that also, Mark."
"You're exactly right, but another thing is they're also looking at past performance by way of what the General Accounting Office has determined."
And also the Office of
Management and Budget will be looking at the program.
Some of you may remember a General
Accounting Office letter of 2006 that was very critical of the Community Services Block Grant.
Those
Accounting Office letter of 2006 that was very critical of the Community Services Block Grant.
Those things are all in the record.
They also look at the OlG reports from state to state and also national reports concerning programs and some of those things will also work against the Community Services
Block Grant.
"There are some new people in the administration that come from other non-profits and other successful non-profits who are probably more generally focused on one specific aspect of eradicating poverty or something of that nature, and they seem to think they had a better approach in and better outcomes of production rather than the Community Services Block Grant."
"So there are some things working against CSBG, and we've been working with the administration and working with"
Congress to combat that.
"We will continue to do that even though there is a request here for a 50% cut, our first move is to try on the Congressional side to say, ""Do not cut this program"" and to give reasons as to why it should be upheld."
And we'll also be working with those Congressional members to explain to them why we think their local programs or state programs are very beneficial.
So we may want to highlight some specific programs.
This is an uphill battle.
This is the third year that the administration wants to cut the program and we don't know what's going to happen with Congress in terms of them
looking to cut budgets anyway.
"This may be a trying year for CSBG, but we'll be working together and reaching out to you and asking you that you would support us as we support you and getting the message to Congress and to the administration the benefits of this program."
We have not given up on that and will continue to work on that.
Brad: let's focus for a few minutes on the politics of this.
"What is the greatest barrier, the greatest resistance point to this?"
Salman:
"Well I think that one, it's such a radical change to what traditionally happens in a classroom."
"If you're telling someone to do homework in the classroom, it's not called homework anymore."
"But I think once teachers and students get used to it, it's kind of like they start to think about they even did before."
"Probably the biggest problem, I wouldn't call it a problem it's actually a great thing, in the same classrooms we have a pilot over here in northern California where you have a 5th grade classroom, this is their math curriculum, and that same 5th grade classroom there are some kids doing 3rd grade math and there are some kids doing trigonometry and the teacher needs to feel comfortable with that."
"But what's cool about it is that they're getting a dashboard, they see where everyone is and every student can work at their own pace."
Dylan:
"If you were to look, Ben, at the problem of having different, same age, but at different places, right?"
That's the whole thing with the educational system is you got one kid doing trigonometry and another one who's trailing behind.
"How do you see this, what did you see about this, that you felt not only addressed the drop out rate but addressed the variability of how people learn?"
Ben:
"I mean if you look at decreasing budgets and increasing class sizes, we need to solve the efficiency problem and teacher's time is a limited amount."
"So having this technology where they can evaluate on a person-by-person basis where their kids are at and they can have their classroom time to work with their kids who are at different levels directly so they can be taking the lectures at home through Khan Academy, that's a big solution to a critical problem."
Dylan:
Salman walk me through very briefly how this works.
"Let's say I've got a couple of kids, they're in a traditional environment,"
"I'm intrigued by what your saying, how would it work?"
Salman:
So every student works at their own pace.
"They literally do exercises at their own pace, they start at one plus one and they keep moving up all the way through algebra or trigonometry, however far they want to go."
"If they have trouble with anything the videos are there, they can actually watch them at home or in class time and the teacher when they come to class, they don't give lectures, they don't grade homework, they don't give exams."
They literally just get a dashboard and they see where every kid in the class is and some kids may be ahead and some kids might be behind.
"And we actually see them flipping around, some of the kids that were behind race ahead later on and all the teacher does is look at the kids who are stuck,"
"look at the kids where the video and the software isn't enough for them to get past that problem and then the teacher just intervenes on those kids or even better, gets one of the kids that are already proficient on that module, because they have all of the data to actually tutor their peers."
So you can have a class where everyone's working at their own pace.
Dylan:
"Got it, you say that instead of penalizing failure and rewarding test taking ability like our current system does right now, education should encourage failure and experimentation but demand mastery."
Why do you think this model achieves that?
Salman:
Well what we do is we force...
"In a traditional model, I'll give you some lectures, homework, lectures, homework and then we have a snapshot exam and regardless of whether you get a 70 or 80 or 90 percent on that exam, we move onto the next concept and no one ever asks what was that 10 percent you didn't know."
The last effort I wanted to mention on that training and technical assistance slide is the Performance
Management Tools and Protocols.
This is being headed by the Urban Institute and also the Performance
Management Task Force.
"This is another group that is made up of members from all levels of the network as experts outside the network and in the field of Performance Management and Performance Measurements, and in the coming slides I'll describe how their work is integrated and collaborative with the other two training and technical assistance efforts."
On this slide you can see an overview on the ROMA Next Generation Standard of Excellence of the activities that are going to be ongoing this year and into next year as well.
"There is an assurance of a standardized knowledge of ROMA, an increase in the capacity of the network to execute the ROMA cycle as well as the capacity for data collection, reporting, and using that data for decision making."
That's a real distinct difference between what was going on in the earlier parts of last decade about ten years ago where they were focused on measuring and collecting data.
Now there is a heavy focus on using that data for decision making and proving that you're using that data for decision making is a very important piece.
Establishing ROMA focused metrics for comparison of CSBG eligible entity use of CSBG resources.
Understanding where the CSBG dollars specifically are going in your agency.
Building the knowledge base of field-tested and evidence informed strategies.
"Evidence-based is obviously a big buzz word in the administration, and this ROMA Next Generation Field of Excellence will be working to help the network identify some evidence based and evidence informed strategies as well as enhancing the body of knowledge available regarding the evaluation phase of the ROMA cycle."
On the next slide you'll see how this fits in with some of the work that you may have been hearing about in the ROMA Next Generation Center of Excellence.
It's starting off by looking at how the Community
Action network is engaged in producing change and then understanding what that change will be.
You may have heard the term theory of change which describes the process of social change.
So understanding how the network is engaged in producing change and then what that long term goal is is what our theory of change is working on.
I'd encourage you to check out our website and under the
ROMA tab you'll be able to see previous presentations be done on both the ROMA Next Generation
Center of Excellence and the theory of change.
There are a couple of working documents on the website as well as a survey that we've done of the network as far as implementation of ROMA.
There is some very interesting data on there about how states and agencies are using ROMA to effectively make decisions and using all aspects of the ROMA cycle in their management of the CSBG dollars.
"Brad: apologies, I'd like to interrupt you for just a moment."
"We have a guest from the administration who has joined us, and I wondered if I might stop you for just a few minutes and we'll hear from Steve"
Capanna and then we'll come back to your excellent presentation on CSBG.
Mark:
Sure
Brad:
"One of the interesting new initiatives in the President's FY ""14 budget is something referred to as the race to the top initiative. $200 million has been recommended for this new program which is based on successes at the department of energy Race to the Top program."
"It's a very, very intriguing program to challenge the states to leverage funding for energy efficiency."
I'm very pleased to have joining us this afternoon Steve Capanna.
"A group of about sixty men from New Haven, normal townspeople--I'm going to talk about them in a moment-- decided that they were going to hire someone to teach them military exercises so that hopefully they would learn something and that somewhere down the road if they had to be they could organize themselves into a military unit and protect the town of New Haven."
Okay.
So here's sixty random people in New Haven who hire someone--
"I think they paid him three dollars a lesson or something-- to teach them how to drill, and what to do with guns, and how to walk in formation, and basic military things so that they would know what to do, in case they ever actually had to fight."
Again that's kind of a dramatic action.
That's a big step to take.
'Okay.
"Now I need to be militarily drilling in case I need to defend my family, my property, and my town.'"
"So that certainly gives you a sense of what it felt like, what was sort of floating in the air at this time for people in New Haven to take that kind of an action."
"In early 1775, they met as a group and they decided that they would really organize themselves into a real military unit, as opposed to guys taking"
lessons on how to drill.
"So they met, they voted on uniforms, they figured out the best way to obtain arms so that they'd know where they'd be getting them from, and then not long after that they actually wrote to the"
"Connecticut State Assembly and said that they, quote, ""Anxious for the safety of our country and desirous of contributing all in their power to the support of our just rights and liberties, have formed themselves into a military company""-- and then added that they wanted the Connecticut State Assembly to officially make them a sort of district military unit."
So they wanted official recognition from the Connecticut
State Assembly.
"Again, really interesting--random sixty guys: 'maybe we better know something military.'"
"Then after that they decide: 'oh, okay, well, maybe we actually had better--we could organize ourselves so that this will actually be real."
"Hey, now that we've organized ourselves, we can actually get state recognition so that we'll be on call and armed and ready in case something bad happens.'"
"Again kind of an interesting chain of events, series of personal decisions on the part of those random sixty men."
Now let's look for a minute at who they are.
One of them apparently owned a hat store on Chapel Street.
"One of them was a barber who was described, quote, as ""a rather eccentric person."""
"I don't know what that means, although I was dying to have the time to figure out why the barber was rather eccentric, but we have an eccentric barber who's one of the sixty, a chair maker, a few sailors, someone who was just described as a man of leisure--"
"[laughter]--it's interesting to ponder what that means-- a lawyer, a few grocers."
There was a grocer who lived on State Street and a grocer who
"lived on the corner of Chapel and Church-- and of course for me researching this this morning, it's really fascinating to be finding people living in places that, of course, we all know."
"That's always--Because you can exactly picture: oh, the corner of Chapel and Church."
I know exactly where that person lived.
"One person worked in the New Haven bank, and decided that he wasn't really very skilled at horsemanship; in case that they were going to fight, he probably would need to know how to be really good on horseback."
So apparently he regularly took his horse into his yard and practiced on the horse in private.
"He took it into his yard so no one would see that he was the guy who had to practice horsemanship, but he was sort of there doing his own little private drilling so that he'd be prepared in case there was actual fighting."
Okay.
"The way that Dan is gonna try to defraud the system is by attempting to create another transaction, in which he assigns the 5 BTC he got from Carol to somebody else."
Let's call this person Fred.
"Fred could be Dan's alter ego, could be a friend of Dan's."
It doesn't matter who Fred is because we know that Fred isn't the rightful owner of these bitcoins.
What Dan is gonna try to do is he is gonna try to take those 5 bitcoins that he got from Carol and he is gonna now try to take these 5 bitcoins and assign them over to Fred.
"This is something that we don't want to allow because that would mean that somehow Dan was able to spend these 5 bitcoins twice over, he's effectively double spent those bitcoins."
"Obviously, one of these transactions should be considered fraudulent."
The other one should be allowed to go through.
"It's important to keep in mind that if Dan just tried to spend the same coins again without trying to cover his tracks or anything of that nature, everybody out there would know that Dan is up to no good because thay can see from the existing longest transaction block chain, namely this existing chain from the beginning, they can see that Dan already spent these coins before, he shouldn't be allowed to spend these coins again."
"What Dan has to do is he has to create a different transaction block chain that contains just the second bogus transaction in it, and this will be the transaction to Fred, and that would leave out the other transaction to Pete."
"Hopefully, everybody else will start to accept or believe this newer chain."
"Since everyone in Bitcoin ultimately goes with the transaction block chain that contains the most work, namely this longest chain that we talked about,"
"Dan has a chance, he has a hope potentially of being able to pull off this type of a fraudulent scheme."
The real question now is how likely is it for Dan to succeed.
"For Dan to be able to pull this off, he has to start off with the transaction block chain that existed previously and he has to try to add to that transaction block chain a different transaction."
"So, rather than having this previous transaction where he gave money to Pete, he is gonna try to create a new transaction and add it to the transaction block chain that contains this other fraudulent transaction between Dan and his friend Fred."
This is gonna be the bad transaction between Dan and Fred that will be in this new block.
In Bitcoin lingo this idea is known as a fork in the chain.
And what is meant by a fork is that somehow there is more than one version of histories.
Somebody tried to rewrite their tracks or to cover their tracks and to revise history the way we know it.
What that really means is that there is now somehow more than one version of what happened out there.
"In this example, one branch in this fork is legitimate and the other branch is bogus."
The legitimate branch was the one where Dan paid his friend Pete for pizza and the bogus one is this follow on transaction where Dan attempted to pay his friend Fred with those same exact bitcoins.
"Remember that any transaction block that's added to this transaction block chain has to contain within it a proof of work puzzle, or solution rather to a proof of work puzzle."
"Otherwise, noone will accept the chain."
"So, if Dan wants to cheat the system, he has to secretly solve a new proof of work puzzle himself."
"But the challenge for Dan is that he is starting off with a bit of a handicap, because there is already this longer chain out there that people have started accepting."
"Keep in mind that because this chain is out there, other nodes may have started to build on top of this chain."
"Every ten minutes, somebody is adding to this chain on average."
"So, there is this longer transaction block chain out there and Dan wants to create his own fake chain."
"So, in order for that chain to be believable he has to now be the longest chain out there and he has to basically do all this proof of works to create the chain that is longer."
"To come up with this longer chain on his own,"
I want to tell you about the fact that I through literally month
"launches its project on my channel where I will be voiced, show"
An account my training path
My first project will be 4 months to go where I will be fully tell
I train
I eat of successes and failures all will be explained in video report all exercises that I'll make
"I'll make for a program and all of the exercises in this program you will see in the ads carefully how to do the exercises exercises on the weight and the strength barbell, dumbbells and exercise all you will see in my accounting issues will record the whole basis of power"
All that I will use for the day my whole diet is known to you and shows in my diet will also include sports nutrition which I was my good friend from Kazakhstan where I am по приезду в Краснодар
"I start this project you will see how I will take sports nutrition dosage and time of supplementation all you will see and most importantly, training will be without anabolic steroids since I have been more than 2 months of train no steroids will soon be three months since I have been coaching a natural my weight was 106 pounds 107 pounds in the evening and in the morning weighed 104-105 and after 3-4 months"
I already completely clear the body and you will see my natural shape which would have been if you would not take steroids the amount of mass muscle and fat that was before and the most interesting that in my project
All reports will be collected and will be part of the body just the body composition
I was talking about where it is necessary get information about the metabolism at rest and calories we need to use then add 30-50 percent and calculate the formula svyu norm calories to lose weight or bulking and all that you see
I will be every 3 weeks or a month
"I will take body composition and you will know how much of me fat, water and muscle know what was the percentage of how much is lost or gained and this is all you know so someone interested in my project then subscribe to my RSS feed and soon, in just a month we'll see you in the new project and you can follow me after my workouts and nutrition"
Successes and failures to whom it may help in training and motivating
I'm doing this project for you so subscribe to my RSS feed
Stay up to date ....
Since you were Dmitriyhfit...
Goodbye!
"Let's do a little bit of practice dividing rational numbers, or another way to think about it, dividing fractions."
Same thing.
So we have part A.
"Well, number 1."
Find the multiplicative inverse of each of the following.
"Now, all that means is if I have some number a, its inverse is going to be 1/a."
"When I take a number and I multiply it by its multiplicative inverse, I'm going to get a/a, which is equal to 1."
So a times its multiplicative inverse is going to be 1.
So let's do these problems.
So part A.
We have 100.
So the multiplicative inverse of that is just going to be 1/100.
It seems like were doing a juggling at priorities towards spending sometime dumbing down as a form of entertainment verses smarting up as a form of career and more knowledgeable thinking.
"My question has to do with the fact that one of the things that I felt for 30 years were smarting up has been this idea that national use service program that was a bill in the congress and it was a volunteer basis, but what was unique about it was it would challenge youth to register at 17 and spend a year thinking about what is our democracy?"
At 18 indicate a interest in volunteering to do some kind of contract with service.
"Now when President Clinton became President he inacted a program called Ameracore and pushed this and one of the things that I focused on communicating to them was does concept of information communication computer, the internet wasn't even a term being used."
"Right now were in certain economic problems and environmental problems and to me this seems to be the balance between challenging youth as they go through the education system to be able to intergrate into something in their community that would benefit it, but there seems to be a lot of apathy among the thinkers and the general public."
Nicholas Carr:I'm sure your right.
I don't have any thoughts on that.
That sounds right .
Peter Norvig:
Let's try to keep it to questions so we can keep Nick involved.
(people laughing).
Man 6:
As earlier you mentioned your challenge of juggling so many research projects at the same time
I am in contact with many computer science students at Stanford and with vision media students at the Acadamy
University many feel that Google is over extending itself.
What is the current research focus of Google right now.
Peter Norvig:
"I guess that the focus is making information accessible to people and we see a lot of opportunities and our biggest cost is opportunity costs for things missed and so we are going to try to do it and there is opportunities is media in Mobil, across the board in deeper semantic processing of text and images and videos and so on."
Were looking at all those things and were trying to build a system where infrastructure is such that we can address a new area with a very small team around 3 people so we can be broad in what we approach because the investments that we make in each one is small because all of our research is are advertised over all the researchers
That's how we try to approach it.
Nicholas Carr:
Can I ask you a question about google?
"Do you think that universal search where now we get not only a ranking of not only what are the best webpages out there, but images and maybe videos and maybe a stream of tweets."
Do you think that's an example of google dumbing down itself?
Peter Norvig:
No I don't think so at all.
"One thing is you say, ""Well the internet is very distracting,"" but we get these criticisms from magazines saying, ""Well the internet is so limited, it doesn't have the rich images that magazines have"""
So there are different types of media I think that McClumn was wrong the media is not the message the message is the message.
"If the media was the message then every year the accademy awards would end in a tie and say the Oscar goes to movies, but it doesn't happen that way instead the author goes to the best story."
"Whoever the story is told and sometimes the story is going to be told as text and sometimes its going to be told as video so its just telling me earlier today they were asking a very technical scientific question and they were expecting to see an article but instead they got a video lecture from an expert in that area and it was exactly what they wanted and if we had made them go to video search they would of never occurred to them to try video search for they type of a query, but by surfacing it we give them what they want at the right time."
Man 7:
"Hi, I read your article in the Atlantic Monthly I have to say 1st off my wife totally agrees with you and"
We call it moving on.
We call it just growth out of that sort-of dark part of the heart.
Things change.
"But when you fight those emotions, when you think they shouldn't be there, when you're not kind to them, when you try and get involved with it, you always mess up."
"So this is actually using this Law of Kamma, these things are because of the past, what am I doing about it now?"
And that way you can actually take these negative emotions and they start to disappear.
They don't last all that long.
"There's a story - a wonderful story - in my book and the reason I mentioned it this afternoon at the funeral, the reason I mentioned it because I got a letter from United States"
"last week and somebody had listened to the talks on the internet, they read my book ""Opening the Door of Your Heart"", and there's a story in there about the emperor's ring, ""this too will pass"", that story, if you haven't heard it before, it's a powerful story, about an emperor, a young man who took over the kingdom when he wasn't really mature enough to know how to lead."
And so whenever things were going well in his kingdom he'd always have celebrations and parties.
"And because he was spending too much resources and too much time celebrating, and not actually doing the running of the kingdom, the good times never lasted all that"
long.
"And when the terrible times, the bad times, bad economy, unrest, social disorder, whenever there was trouble in his kingdom he'd get so upset and depressed he'd stay in his room and sulk and cry, which meant he wasn't working during the difficult times."
"And the ministers they realised that their leader, their king, their emperor, wasn't really working properly, and that's the reason why there were too many bad times and not enough prosperous times."
You can't just tell these people what to do.
"Even these ministers in the Howard Government, they can't tell John Howard what to do."
"They've got to be sneaky, they've got to be wise, and so what these ministers did, instead of telling their emperor what to do, they just went to a goldsmith, asked for him to make a ring, the only difference between that ring and ordinary rings was what was engraved on the outside, which was the words ""this too will pass""."
"And they gave that ring with the engraved words ""this too will pass"" to the emperor, told him to wear it on all occasions, that's all, and the emperor did."
"Whenever there were bad times he would look upon the ring, ""this too will pass"", he knew by nature he didn't have to force those negative emotions and those bad times out of his kingdom, he knew they would pass naturally."
"And because he knew the bad times would pass, it gave him what's called hope, and when there's hope we can work, where it's hopeless we think the grief is going to last forever, the broken heart was always going to be there, you'll never find another partner ever in life."
"Or you'll never find that money again on the stock market, or whatever it is your chance to win the cup is gone forever."
When you think it's forever that just makes life hopeless and you don't work.
You don't make kamma anymore.
"But when actually you have hope, there's always something you can do."
It gives you that motivation to work even in difficult times of your life.
"And actually the reason I'm saying this was because the photograph someone sent me was actually from the graduation ceremony of Virginia Tech university, recently, and I think you all know what happened at Virginia Tech in April, I was in London at that time."
I think it was 39 young men and women were shot down by that murderer?
"You know, while they were on campus."
"And at the graduation ceremony one of the graduates, you know the funny hats they wear, they're called mortarboards, with the flat top, on the top of his mortarboard he'd actually painted the words ""this too will pass"", in memoriam of the pain that had happened in that university in the biggest serial killer murder in United States history."
"That's why he said ""I don't know whether this guy's read your book or what"", by he's obviously got the message."
"And it is a powerful message because it gives you hope, it allows you to"
let these things pass away.
"So sometimes a lecture in the university is not the best way to do that, have one person sitting in front of the class, you want something a little more interactive and I think we've seen that."
There's developments like Sollen Conn with Conn Academy.
It's fifteen hundred educational videos online and it gets twice as many students online as the
University of California as a single person.
There is great opportunities out here and I think we are a point to where there is a disruptive shift in how we are going to deliver education and it will be interesting to see how it plays out.
And I think there was a question for Nick in there as well.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"Yeah, I think you're absolutely right to point out the fact that any new technology has costs as well as benefits and when we did begin to parcel out time in little increments, we became more synchronized as a society."
"We were able to work together better, but we did lose some of our sense of a natural flow of time and we could live by that flow rather than by the clock, and similar with the map."
"I mean we almost certainly as we become more dependent on the map we lose some of our natural navagation sense and that almost is certainly being amplified by GPSs and stuff like that and that's not to say that those technologies are bad, but the benefits don't far out weigh the costs, but we do have to realized that whenever we adopt a technology we're adopting, we're amplifying some part of ourselves, but we're also reducing some of our old skills and handing them over to technology."
And so any technology has to be evaluated in that way I think.
PETER NORVlG:
Okay let's go over here and keep it to one brief question each.
MAN 4:
"Nick it seems like your book is focused very much on the personal choices and the personal affects, but I'm curious about the societal effects."
"So, when you we have 1.6 Billion people on the internet all behaving in this way, what is going to be the effect on human civilizations as a whole?"
"I mean Peter mentioned great companies are still being born and great books are still being written, but what do you see has the broader effects?"
NlCHOLAS CARR:
That's a big question.
"You know, I think there is going to be a lot of effects and some of them honestly, particularly with the social sphere are very hard to figure out and I can't say that I've figured them out."
"I will say that if you look through the history of culture you see that many of the great monuments of culture come from people, whether we're talking about science, art, literature, come from people who were able to think attentively and think deeply and be contemplative, be meditative and be reflective, and if we devalue those things and practice those things less,"
"I think we not only become less interesting as individuals, we face a culture that is flatter and not as vibrant and again not has interesting as it used to be."
PETER NORVlG:
So I want to take my perogative to throw in my answer as well.
"And I want to quote Stuart Russell, who is the chairman at Berkley, he was one of my respondants and he said that 'students today are like prolog programs with ninety-nine percent of their clauses missing', for students in the past were like that."
Now what does that mean for you non-programmers out there?
"So prolog program is a means for doing logical inference by describing what you know and allowing the program to do very deep inference of combining all those clauses, and what Stuart was saying was in the past, his students could do that but only on one percent of their subject matters, they knew very deeply about one thing and they could reason deeply in that area, and usually get a thesis out of it."
"Now, he's saying that things have changed, that you can start and not know very much in that area and very quickly gather what you need to know and then start doing the deep thinking."
"That ability to do the deep thinking was always in the student, but if you didn't have information about the are, you couldn't go anywhere with it."
"So he said, 'Google encourages mental energy, persistence, and diligence, as well as learning about knew things.'"
MAN 5:
"My name is Peter Cilla, I'll try to be brief."
"Now they have become elite schools, and then the children who can not cope are being kicked on to the public schools but the problem is that parents today are investing in their children, in the same manner as investing in a porche making them status symbols and that does not teach the kids that they should think of others rather then themselves"
Martin:
"But if we just listen a little to the Greeks again, they had something called ""Hepaidea"" which was a formed upbringing which involved lots of music and poetry and dance and resitation and sports and so on, and then they knew that they were making good people and it is still a good thing today, having a komponitation of art and body then the intellectual project is pretty easy plus you get a good person out of it.."
Ole:
"But in Paydaya was the also the piety thay you cherish to the community, then you are ready to sacrifice yourself for the community"
Martin:
It's also much easier when you know yourself..
Ole:
"The funny thing is that Cicero translated Padaya to humanitas and he had two concepts, two aspects of humanitas one is what we today call ""humaniore"" meaning formation, that we could eat with knife and fork and able to defend himself with a sword where previously defended himself with ku law, history and philosophy and could speak out in public, and take political action cause the social and political was the key and the second aspect, generosity not to use your power to those who are subject to your power"
Martin:
But according to the school of aliens which I belong there is already talk about a degeneration of the Roman interpretation of the Greeks but it is a matter of taste.
You can at any rate say that we have a lot of it in the Roman version
Isn't it what have helped to raw things a little too?
Ole:
Unfortunately you a right.
"A very good example is how Sisoru translator Aistoteles concept ""hexis"" the habitus and the habitus is what in the English language becomes ""Habit"" but in the concept of habitus the positive spiral actually disappears from ""Hexis"" pulling yourself up by the hair and become better.."
"So, in order to be a properly human, you need to know what the good is, but to know what the good is you must have tried to do it, isn't it .. and the concept must be repeated of course there is also a lot of their political institutions which are destroyed the relationship between the Greeks and the Romans, but the interesting thing is the Greeks thought always are political they think every thing in a political way because they think everything in the matter of ""Community"" .. therefore, the Greeks did not have a concept of ""free will"" eighter"
Martin:
"But now I know, because I have seen human history over long periods of time that the Greeks have it elsewhere too ... people think they have it from egypt which is true enough, but they have it in their subconscious from"
"""Altantis"" and ""Altantis"" is a copy of ""Venus"" but it is several billion years ago there was culture on Venus .. so it's thoughts and some pre-position abilities that that is tempered with from the collective consciousness that was manifested in the clear sence in greece and that now is manifested again"
"It is the change of paradigm we need to reach as painless as possible and that is where you get in the picture as a philosopher and in fact one of those that is thinking wisdom we have to handle this change of paradigm so everyone gets a soft landing and not a hard landing on the stomach, as every indication points at that we get"
"Where do you see the problems in this change of paradigm? . or do you think we get a change of paradigm, at all?"
Ole:
"Yes, In a way I think we will"
"I'm glad you say so, you having a much better knowledge of ""the other side"" of reality than I"
Martin:
However it isn't everything that I can tell
Ole:
"No you can not, for example, you can not tell whether you know that we have eternal life then we would all jump over the edge, right?"
"We wouldn't bother to traipse around this planet, if we knew we would live on.."
Martin:
"Yes, but the question is ..."
"So, it shows you that there are different kinds of immersion and you can be immersed in a medium without necessarily being attentive to one thing."
"You can be immersed in the action of being distracted, so to speak."
"So, I think as we do that, that can create those changes in the brain that you know, it's not the brain changes that are making us to behave that way."
"We behave that way and then our brain changes to adapt, so it's a reinforcement mechanism."
"But, I do think that were immersed in the medium even if the medium is constantly distracting us."
Peter Norvig:
"I think were both in a way examples and counter examples, so I certainly feel that."
"I feel distracted, and yet you were able to put together this book and it's deep and contemplative and you did that while you were researching on the web and I was able to put together my textbook, which by the way was 6 times longer than your's."
(people laughing and booing) but I don't get a book tour.
"I don't get a book tour out of it and we were able to do this while researching on the web so it is possible to get past those temptations and think deeply and think much more broadly, you know, so I was able in a couple of hours to bring in 20 different friends and have them comment and have them go back and forth a couple of times on what I was thinking and on what you were thinking and get a couple of ideas."
I couldn't of done that in that short amount of time without the web technology isn't that helping me a great deal?
Nicholas Carr:
"I'm sure it is and I'm not trying to be overly deterministic about the influence of technology on out brains the human brain is a wonderful thing and it's not really its not as though a binary switch and suddenly we, we turn off our contemplate of nature."
"I do think that these trends were seeing are very very important and I think a lot of people feel that in their own lives they are not having an opportunity to be attentive and to think deeply and they are constantly distracted and I think that they feel for a reason because it's real and, you know, it's true that you can still read a book you can even write a book, although to write mine"
"I had to pull back from the net quite a bit and I made an effort to use Google for say to find information but then to find relevant books, relevant journal articles, but then I actually went to the library to get the print material to read and I found that extremely useful"
"You know cut back on email and stuff, and unfortunately I'm drifting back in the other direction now, but It's still, I still had to make some changes and I could really feel it in my attentiveness and my concentration, but never less I think we have to take the big picture and look at how, you know, all of us as a society what direction we are moving in."
"And whether we still put any value in the more attentive, more contemplative modes of thought or whether we're given them up and being pushed in that way by technology."
PETER NORVlG:
I mean it seems to me that we still value that and we make it easier to value that in a way and that it's easier for an individual or a small group of people to get together and do something great if they work hard at it.
"So we heard earlier today about how a small group put together Facebook,"
I'm at a company that only ten years ago came from nothing and now has a big effect on the world.
Smaller start ups are able to do that and they are able to do that because of these web technologies and you can't say these entrepreneurs are not engaging deeply and working hard and concentrating on what they are doing.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Fair enough.

PETER NORVlG:
"And I just wanted to, one other thing I talked about the emails that came in with suggestions and one of them was commenting on what a modern idea this concentration is,"
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"That's absolutely right, it is and that's way it's so precious."
"I mean it's not our natural way to think its not our natural way you know when we were cavemen or whatever we were if you concentrated on one thing, you go eaten or clubbed in the head or something"
So I think that's absolutely right.
Our natural inclination is not to pay attention.
First was denial and absolute misunderstanding.
"The traditional media took the ""three glasses"" approach the three glasses with which people read news- actually they're two-"
"And they said: ""when I look through this glass I don't understand what's happening"""
"""when I look through this second glass I don't understand what's happening"""
"And as they didn't understand it 100% they decided not to inform about it in a new way, but rather attempted to label it in one of the pools where they classify everything else."
Who does this benefit?
Rubalcaba or Rajoy?
Chacón or Esperanza Aguirre?
Who?
And until they realised it wasn't about that they didn't start to tell people what it was about.
"I think they started to inform people because the pressure in the social networks was so strong that there came a moment in which people were embarrassing the media and saying that if the media went on like that, that they would tell the media that THEY didn't represent them either."
"They had a job as journalists and they weren't doing it, and I'm forgetting about the media that from day one knew what they wanted to do with the 15M, which was to use it in a particular way, and say real atrocities."
I'm not referring to that.
I'm referring to the people who could have empathised with the #15M and who at the beginning got scared and didn't join in.
"Those media corporations, the majority of which have recognised that at the beginning they didn't know what was going on, nor gave it the priority it deserved, and let me insist on the fact that we're talking about the media, not the journalists, because the journalists were in the Puerta del Sol all the time, from the first moment, it's not true that there weren't any, on the 16th there were more journalists than people camping, because the people, after the first night went to have a shower, to eat or to work, and there were more journalists recording or interviewing the campers, and that allowed more people to come that same afternoon."
But the network-based information was way above that which the media gave to the #15M.
"That's the first phase, the ""I don't understand anything"" phase."
"With a miniphase during the elections in which it was instrumentalised, and each one put the #15M on their front page; Madrid or Valencia, or whatever topic they were interested in that day."
"But afterwards they went on to another important phase, in which the people in social networks imposed their agenda on the media."
"So there are media corporations which, during the first days and weeks of the 15M, despised it or hid it amongst other news items in their publications, but when they realised that there was interest in it- that is to say that they got traffic and visits, and that there was an audience for it- they started to give out too much information in an unexpected way."
"And a lot of information started to appear about the 15M, so much that people like us, who from the beginning were doing that job that others didn't do, well we had to redefine ourselves and reorient our work, because suddenly it was impossible, with our means, to get to places where others were going."
We no longer had to stream because there were several streams.
"We didn't have to tweet the most important assemblies live because several media corporations were already doing it whatever the time, whatever the weather, even at three in the morning."
And so on.
"Some media companies continue with that strategy, through journalistic interest because they're convinced of its importance but also because of the public, the people, and the social networks all demand it in the form of traffic, in the form of an audience, but also in the form of a direct complaint that they aren't talking about things that they worry about."
And afterwards everything has so many shades.
"Because again the 15M has many derivatives, and each media corporation has more or less tolerance for each derivative, or they like each derivative more or less"
"During the general elections on the 20th of november, there was also an understanding between the 15M and certain political parties who were well treated or harshly criticised by different media corporations."
"Going back to the previous structure, as if the 15M were an organization where there are militants who belong to the 15M and not to the rest of political life."
"When there are people in the 15M who belong to NGOs or political parties, rich people, and indignants who on the other hand have other things in their life apart from the 15M."
"And they're no less than other people who live almost outside the system, and only relate with people involved in the traditional social battles."
People who experience politics in their daily life in a much more special way than what is just pure affiliation in the 15M.
"The Campanile, and in the centre on the lower left the just low cornered baptistry and on the back the cathedral of Florence which Brunelleschi's dome at the top."
"- Well, the baptistry is a medieval building and from the tenth century probably and the cathedral that we all know they began building in the strand 1300 and the bell tower starts going up a little bit perhaps after that and then the dome is built from the early 1400 and finished in the 1470's."
"- So, what are we looking at with the bell tower? the bell tower now we are going to concentrate on is the lower part of it around 1340 even when the tower was not complete yet, they decided that the town and the guild of Florence, specifically the world guild that was in charge of decorating the cathedral decided that they want to decorate the bottom of the tower because even though it was completely embarassing, having business there on decorated surface where one is walking around as you can see, all the time and so the two very bottom layers are decorated with many reliefs designed in stone marble rather than the bronze that is on the bapistry. the reliefs cover a lot of subjects. there are typical scenes there are signs of the zodiac and there are also scenes of"
local art and industry.
"Some of these things may sound unusual of course the biblical scenes make sense on such buildings well those might have been a little bit unusual we'll see why they might want to include those we should also say that the zodiac signs are not unusual because the medieval christians were very able, and very comfortably blended their belief in christianity and christian devotion in with interest in horse gathering, we see that a lot in medieval trasures thats right.lets look at some of these relics her is one of these religious scenes.this is the creation of adam.the artist is andrew epizano who at rather the same time is working on the bronze relics just across the street on the side towards the bapistry. those secenes are about john the bapist and here is one of the typical scenes on the bell tower and again this is typical of the zious belif belief described at. it is very very simplified with mostly a blank background, just a few things to give you a sense of the setting.there are a few stylysed trees and we have god leaning over and creating adam verily out of the dust of the earth he takes form. exactly. this is another good exampleo fhow at aura combines a graphic stylistion with a sort of naturalist classicism. where do you see the graphic stylistion? well the figure of god the father some ways the robes went about with a sense of the body underneath with a kind of ritual folds. all this is pretty traditional so you ense of the body with not yet so attire sensive and atomically correct and real physical instead the figure adam is a nude athletic male you know it is calassicising as well as naturalistic he is in a contapastic stance even though he is lying down. this does not make any sense for contra posture is usually for standing up. but the fact that he has done that anyway shows that how interested he was in giving alassical piecec thats true of his ribs muscles riht thro. this is quite typical of his style. you are now looking at one of the scenes of local industry. it is lot like one of the god fearing adam. it is interesting that you say that because the industry that is represented here is sculpture and this is an interesting way for an artist tosuggest that the work of the sculpture is in some ways like the work of god. thos who are creative in fact we see here that the creator here the artist"
"leaning over with stylised robes leaning over a nude more naturalistic more classicising figure well, of course, he is not going to get on trouble because of modesty here because look again and compare this to the way God creates Adan"
God is innature and he uses a gesture of his hand and Adan is clearly sopposed to be a real living person
"When we look at the sculptor in the studio, he is in the studio, he is using tools."
The use of the tool is a really conspicuous.
Let's solve some quadratic equations by factoring.
So let's say I had x squared plus 4x is equal to 21.
Now your impulse might be to try to factor out an x and somehow set that equal to 21.
And that will not lead you to good solutions.
You'll probably end up doing something that's not justified.
What you need to do here is put the entire quadratic expression on one side of the equation.
We'll do it onto the left-hand side.
So let's subtract 21 from both sides of this equation.
The left-hand side then becomes x squared plus 4x minus 21.
And then the right-hand side will be equal to 0.
"And the way you want to solve this, this is a quadratic equation."
We have a quadratic expression being set equal to 0.
"The way you want to solve this is you want to factor them, and say, OK, each of those factors could then be equal to 0."
So how do we factor this?
"Well, we saw in the last video that we have to figure out two numbers whose product is equal to negative 21, and whose sum is equal to 4."
This would be a plus b would have to be equal to 4.
"Since their product is negative, they have to be of different signs."
"And so let's see, the number that jumps out at me is 7 and 3."
"If I have negative 7 and positive 3, I would get negative 4."
So let's do positive 7 and negative 3.
So the a and b are positive 7 and negative 3.
"When I take the product, I get negative 21."
"So line m, so this is line m, the equation of line m's going to be y is equal to-- it's going to have the negative slope, right?"
"The same slope, but it just moves in the downward direction."
So it's going to be minus 2x.
And then its y-intercept is-- instead of plus 5 it's going to be minus 5.
Minus 2x minus 5.
And that is choice A.
"Looks like the next problem involves a lot of drawing, and"
I only have a minute and a half left in this video.
So I will do the next problem in the next video.
I will see
I'm Carolyn Kagan I'm a community psychologist from Manchester Metropolitan University.
I'm a researcher and all of my research for the last 35 years has been in collaboration with community groups or public services
One of the things that is often said to us by our community partners in relation to a public engagement agenda is that they don't believe that universities are genuine about their desire to follow mutual agendas but they think ...that they think universities only want to collaborate with communities when it suits them.
And that's a major challenge for us.
Its a major challenge both to resist just pursuing our own agendas and working with communities when we need to but also a challenge to ensure the ways in which we work are to mutual benefit.
One of the ways in which we have begun to understand ways of collaborating is to use a metaphor from ecology and i need to just show you a diagram to explain this i think.
"We have two ecological communities let's take the land and its plants and its animals and another ecological community, the sea and its plants and its animals - that's a fish - each of them has its own natural resources that interact in ways that are self-sustaining."
At the point at which the land meets the sea is known as the transition between ecological communities or the 'ecotone' but that could be just a point at which the land meets the sea.
"Most often though what we have is a transition zone of a tidal transition zone of the sea coming in and out, say over rocks - rocks is land - in and out salt water over the land."
"And at this point, this part here is know as an ecological edge and at this junction, this edge, we have quite a different set of natural resources, plants and animals that only live in this transition zone."
They are different from the ones that live on the land and they're different from the ones that live on the sea.
At the ecological edge we have a much greater abundance of natural resources again that interact in sustainable ways.
"Another example of an ecological edge would be the edge of a field, say where the field meets the forest and the hedgerow is inbetween and that again is a very abundant area for wildlife and for plants - think of a human example - some border areas, say the city of Tijuana, Mexican border with United States has a mixture of Mexican culture and Texan culture but its not just alongside each other, it creates a new culture, it creates new sets of resources, there are different kinds of products, different kinds of activities, different kinds of music, different kinds of language, so TEXMEX is an ecological edge."
"One of the things in terms of public engagement is that we are trying to do with universities working with communities is not colonise the community area, not take over on university agendas but to try and find what is the area of edge?"
How can we create and maintain an edge which is about a mutual agenda where the activities might be different from activities currently going on in University or currently going on in the sea.
"That's the challenge for us... finding ways to work collaboratively to create, maintain and if possible expand the edge."

It's great to be here
I'm sorry I couldn't have been here for the other two days but my life's got very pressured in recent years for reasons I don't fully understand but it's something to do with the media
I think.
So it is nice to be here and I'll just say a few things about myself.
"I'm a Professor of Neuropsychopharmacology which is the study of drugs and the brain and I'm a psychiatrist, I treat patients but I've researched drugs and the brain and it's particularly nice to be here because the first time I ever understood that a drug might change brain function was when I was 15 and I read my father showed me this piece that Hoffman had written about how time extended under LSD when he was cycling home after his accidental exposure and it struck me at that moment that this is a really fundamental insight into the way the brain works if you can change time that profoundly with a drug then I presume you could do anything with a drug and that's why I'm a psychopharmacologist so that was quite a sort of founding influence on my career I think however, I went off to a place called Cambridge University where this man had won the Nobel prize along with Alan Hodgekin a few years before I went there and, this is Andrew Huxley he defined the way which action potentials worked, he produced the first mathematical model of how a neuron did something immensely powerful intellect, phenomenal contribution he's the founder of mathematical neuroscience but as you all know it was his half-brother, Aldous, who in some ways was the more interesting person and of course the reason most of you are here is because the way in which Aldous promoted the concept of psychedelic research was so efficient and also so remarkable in terms of its linguistic qualities that he became very compelling to many people so there he is, Aldous is the older half-brother of Andrew"
"He never got the Nobel prize but he never did medicine of course some of you may not know he wanted to do medicine but he had an inflamatory process of his cornea which meant that he couldn't look down the microscope so he couldn't really study medicine so he went off to do other things but he was very, very scientifically oriented and of course this is the book that really put psychedelics into the public conciousness"
"The Doors of Perception and I don't suppose there were many people who at the time knew of the work of William Blake,"
The great English mystic who came up with this rather remarkable phrase
"""If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite."
"For man has closed himself up till he sees all things through the narrow chinks of his cavern."""
And that I guess is the perspective of conciousness that Blake understood as being very limiting right back in the late 1700s but which we all now I think accept as being not only true but also verifiable using modern neuroscience
And I'm particularly compelled by these two individuals
Francis Crick from the UK and
"Kary Mulis from I guess just up the road, was he in Berkley I can't remember"
"But these are the two individuals who, these are the two most important Nobel prizes in the history of medicine and they were both gained under the influence of LSD where people used, these two individuals used it to solve what at the time were insoluable problems so working out the crystal structure of the double helix is not trivial and in fact it was very difficult but one suspects that Crick got insights from taking LSD when it was normal of course, when it was legal of course and one of the real challenges to us today is the fact that the illegality of these drugs has profoundly distorted research and is continuing to do so to a point where I think it's actually one of the greatest insults to modern research"
I think it's one of the greatest scandals
In fact it's hard to think of a greater scandal although it's possible that the Bush block of embryonic stem cells is of comparable size but that didn't last as long as bans on these drugs
"And I'm going to give you another quote which hopefully you're all familiar with which is this one from Einstein that ""No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it"" and that's given me a bit of hope that maybe we can actually, eventually overturn some of the ridiculous prejudice against these drugs so as some of you I guess are familiar with before LSD was banned there were over a thousand human studies"
"I think there's been one since but I'm not even sure that's published actually and in the UK there's never been a study on LSD till we started doing Psilocybin research, there hadn't been any there have been two for MDMA"
And I've been promoting the concept of scientific enlightenment in relation to these drugs and I managed to convince one of the editors of Nature Neuroscience Reviews that this is a serious challenge a serious issue in relation to neuroscience and this is a paper that I've written with Les King in the UK and Dave Nichols who's here and it's coming out in a couple of months in Nature Reviews Neuroscience
And I'm going to use this to springboard a campaign to get the law changed so that researchers can easily access important drugs to answer important questions.
(applause)
And just to emphasise that maybe you guys were here even before Aldous Huxley
Here's William James of course the father of American psychology pointing out that there are different forms of consciousness and I think that some of this insight were gained from his knowledge of the very early anthropological studies of different ethnic groups using psychedelics
And I think Stan Grof is here and I think this is a wonderful quote and I use this in all my lectures now
"""Psychedelics, used responsibly and with proper caution, would be for psychiatry what the microscope is for biology and medicine, and the telescope for astronomy"""
And it is absurd that we haven't been allowed to use them
And I think it has held back research in many areas
So this is what we're doing at present
You've heard Robin talk about those three Psilocybin studies
"A sentence is a set of words that are put together to mean something. A sentence is the basic unit of language which expresses a complete thought. It does this by following the grammatical basic rules of syntax. For example:""Ali is walking""."
"A complete sentence has at least a subject and a main verb to state (declare) a complete thought. Short example: ""She walks"". A subject is the noun that is doing the main verb. The main verb is the verb that the subject is doing. In English and many other languages, the first word of a written sentence has a capital letter. At the end of the sentence there is a punctuation mark depending on whether it is a statement, a question, a command, a request or an exclamation."
Phrases and clauses.
"A ""phrase"" or ""clause"" is part of a sentence.p773–777"
This is an example of a sentence:
"In this sentence, 'The dog' is the subject, and 'is' is the verb."
This is an example of a phrase:
"There is no verb, so we do not know anything about what the happy dog is doing. Therefore, it is not a sentence."
A clause is a sentence within a sentence. Example:

James Joyce
"James Augustine Aloysius Joyce () (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an Irish writer and poet of the modernist movement. He was from Dublin, Ireland. He wore an eyepatch, because of eye damage. He could not see well."
"His books are written in a special style. At first he wrote in a way which describes very accurately how life is, in the short story collection called ""Dubliners"". In his next book, called ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"", he started a new style. It is called stream of consciousness, which is writing all the thoughts that a character has. His work influenced many other writers in the 20th century."
Some books that Joyce wrote are:
Early life.
James Joyce was the oldest of ten children. He went to a boarding school called Conglowes Wood College and later to Belvedere College. (College here refers to secondary school not to university as it can in the U.S.) Conglowes was run by Jesuit priests.

Mobile advertising
Mobile advertising is very similar to online or internet advertising. Mobile advertising is method of advertising via mobile phones or other mobile devices like tablets.
More and more people worldwide have mobile phones and spend on them a lot of time so mobile advertising is very successful these days and the whole market is growing fast.
Today there are more mobile phones than TVs and computers in the world.
"In Spain 75% of mobile phone owners receive mobile advertising. In France 62% and in Japan 54% mobile phone owners receive mobile advertising. In Japan today, 44% of mobile phone owners click on ads they get on their phones. Mobile advertising was worth 900 million dollars only in Japan."
There are people and organizations that want to create guidelines for Mobile Advertising (set of rules to follow).

"Milparinka, New South Wales"
"Milparinka is a very small town in New South Wales, Australia. About ten people live in Milparinka, which is about 296 kilometres north of Broken Hill. It is built beside a waterhole on Evelyn Creek, named by the explorer Charles Sturt after his wife in 1844. Sturt and his group had been trapped at a waterhole they called Depot Glen nearby on Preservation Creek for seven months while they waited for rain."
"Gold was found at Milparinka, which became the centre for the Albert Goldfields in the 1880s. Two other nearby gold towns, Albert and Mount Browne, were abandoned because of the lack of water. During the peak of the goldrush, Milparinka had a population of more than 3000 people. By 1893 most people had left. Today there are only a few buildings left, the hotel, the courthouse, police station, and the remains of the post office."
The courthouse was built of local sandstone in 1896. The final court session was in 1921. The building has been restored and is used as a local museum.
Skin cancer
"Skin cancer is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin. In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too. These are usually named after the type of cell that grows uncontrollably. Most skin cancers develop in the epidermis. Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage. Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease., though it can be disfiguring. Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive."
"Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious — for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths. It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15–34 in the UK. Most cases are caused by over-exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds."
"Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers. The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas. These are usually small spot growths caused by too much exposure to the sun over time. They do not usually spread, and rarely kill."
The Yangtze River is also known as the Yanugzi or Chang Jiange.

Tampico
"Tampico is the main city in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico."
"It was the site of an incident called the Tampico Affair during the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century that led to armed conflict between Mexico and the United States. About 80 years earlier Tampico was part of a less serious conflict between the two countries, called the Tampico Expedition."
Goalkeeper
"A goalkeeper is someone who protects a team's goal. There are goalkeepers in sports like football (soccer) and ice hockey, for example. The goalkeeper's mission is to prevent the opposing team from scoring a goal. Goalkeepers normally wear more protective gear than other players on the team but this is not always true."
Football.
"A goalkeeper's kit (or ""uniform"") consists of shin guards and gloves to protect his hands from the impact of the ball when he catches it."
"Historically, however, until the 1960s goalkeepers would wear no hand protection."
"Until the early 20th century, the goalkeeper would often wear the same coloured strip as his teammates, with the only different item of clothing being his cap. However, in 1909, the Scottish Football Association took steps to ensure the goalkeeper would wear a different colour from the outfield players. This was to show his different role, as the only player allowed to handle the ball."
Ice hockey.
"The goalkeeper in ice hockey (a ""Goalie"") uses thicker padding than the other players on the team. This is to prevent damage caused by being hit by the puck. The hockey stick of the goalie is much wider than the stick of other players. The bottom edge is also longer and flatter. The goalie has a very large leather glove on one hand. This glove has a large area to help catch the puck. Goalies normally wear masks that give protection to the entire face and head as well as the neck."
Field hockey.
"In field hockey, the goalkeeper stands in the goal net, and stops the other team scoring. Goalkeepers need a lot of kit to protect them from the hockey balls that are hit at them. here is a list:"
Goalkeepers are the only position in hockey allowed to kick the ball. If another player kicked the ball it would be a foul.

Shontelle
"Shontelle Layne (born October 4, 1985), or just Shontelle, is a Barbadian singer-songwriter. She mainly performs R&amp;B, pop and reggae music. She released her debut album ""Shontelligence"" in 2008 and her second album ""No Gravity"" in September 2010. Some if her recent songs achieved only modest success. She co-wrote ""Man Down"" by R&amp;B singer Rihanna in 2010."
Chewing
"Chewing, or mastication, is the first part of the digestive system. It is when the teeth chew the food and the tongue mixes it with saliva to make it mushy in the mouth. A group of animals, called the ruminants, masticate more than once. Most cattle are in this group."
Tiny Wings
"Tiny Wings is an iOS game developed by German game developer Andreas Illiger, released on February 18, 2011."
Gameplay.
"In ""Tiny Wings"", the player takes control of a bird whose wings are too small to fly. The goal of the game is to use hills in order to gain speed as long as possible. This is done by tapping and holding the screen in order to make the bird dive. The game play mainly revolves around timing your taps so that the bird goes down hills and flies up them. The game's day trip version is separated into several islands, which have different layouts and change every 24 hours. The game features special goals that allow players to upgrade their nest, which adds a score multiplier usually X2.

"It was a dangerous job. One day, Hemingway and two other reporters were driving a car near a battlefield. The car carried two white flags to show they were not fighting. But rebel gunners thought the car was carrying enemy officers. Hemingway was almost killed. Later he said that ""bullets are all the same. If they do not hit you, there is no story. If they do hit you, then you do not have to write it. """

Nurse
A nurse is a person who is trained to give care to people who are sick or injured. Nurses work with doctors and other health care workers to make patients well and to keep them fit and healthy. Nurses also help with end-of-life needs and assist other family members with grieving.
"Nursing is a profession, like a doctor, but training for a nurse is different in how long a person must train and what kind of training they need. In some places, nurses may train for three to five years or more before they get a license as a nurse."
"Nurses work in many places. Nurses work in hospitals, in doctor's offices, and in the community, and they even visit people at home if they can not get out."
"Sometimes people decide to become nurses rather than doctors, because the nurses will be able to help patients directly, by talking to them, doing things they need, carefully watching that nothing goes wrong, and then seeing them as they get better."
"Like doctors, nurses can choose what work they do. Some nurses train and work to help during surgery. Some nurses train to help people understand health problems like nutrition (what to eat), and disease (what can make people sick). Nurses can do many different jobs to help people."
Nurses are in demand because there are not enough nurses to handle hospital needs. Because of this shortage nurses will sometimes travel to another location to work for a few months in what is called travel nursing.
Titles.
"Registered Nurse in some countries like U.S is a term for an officially registered nurse. In hospitals where nurses wear uniforms with caps, an R.N. is recognizable by the fact that the cap has two black stripes."
Nursing in Australia.
"Nursing in Australia is done by ""Registered Nurses"" or ""Enrolled Nurses"". Both must complete education past high school. An Enrolled Nurse must complete a course of study between 12 and 18 months. Registered Nurses need to complete a Bachelor's degree."
Gender-neutral titles.
"Titles have changed because men as well as women can be nurses. It was, in most countries, a wholly female occupation. The titles were designed for females and have now been revised to be genderless. The exception to this is midwife, a term still used because it seems natural that a nurse helping a mother through childbirth should be a female. There are some males acting as midwives. The supervisory body for UK nursing is the Nursing and Midwifery Council."
Teams.
"Some medical and surgical groups operate as teams. This means that senior surgeons always operate with the same group of people, so reducing the risk of mistakes, and allowing juniors to learn and understand the individual cases."
"Also, moving around as a team allows specialist groups to serve more than one hospital. This is particularly useful when the amount of work in a speciality does not permit having a full team on site in each hospital."

Batters have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries. A top-level batter has good reflexes, decision-making and strategy with excellent physical batting skills."
"During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch. The one facing the current delivery from the bowler is called 'the striker', while the other is the non-striker. When a batter is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings or until 10 of the team members are out. After the batting of first team is over the other team gets a turn to bat."
"Batting tactics and strategy depends on the type of match being played. It also depends on the current state of play. Batters try to score many runs quickly without losing their wicket. To score quickly, risky shots must be played which increases the chances of batters being out. Batters’ safest choice is to guard the stumps but this may result in scoring fewer runs."
"As with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention. It helps to know how effectively a batter is playing. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs he has scored by the number of times he has been out (dismissed)."

Chaetognatha
"Chaetognatha, commonly known as arrow worms, are a phylum of small predatory marine animals. They are present in huge numbers in plankton worldwide."
"About 20% of the known species are benthic and can attach to algae or rocks. They are found in all marine waters from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from ."
"Despite the huge numbers, there are only about 120 modern species in 20 genera. Some species are known to use the neurotoxin ""tetrodotoxin"" to subdue their prey."
"Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the Cambrian Period. Complete body fossils have been described from China, and the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia."
These animals are usually considered a type of protostome.
Pepper spray
"Pepper spray (also called OC spray, from Oleoresin capsicum) is a spray used for self-defence, by spraying it into an attacker's face. It makes eyes water and causes intense pain, sometimes even leading to temporary blindness. Pepper spray is an inflammatory agent. When someone is sprayed with pepper spray, their eyes will close and they will have difficulty breathing, a runny nose, and cough. The stronger the spray is, the longer the effects last, but the average full effect lasts around thirty to forty-five minutes, with longer effects lasting for hours. Pepper spray is mostly used by police forces for riot control, but in some countries people can use it for self-defence."
"The active ingredient in pepper spray is capsaicin, a chemical found in capsicums, chillis and other members of the pepper family."
Pepper spray usually comes in canisters and can be sprayed up to twenty-five metres.
Roy Lichtenstein
"Roy Lichtenstein (October 27, 1923 – September 29, 1997) was an American artist. He is famous for his work in the ""pop art"" style around the late 1950s to early 1960s. He was friends with artist Andy Warhol."
"On April 6, 1971, Shakur was shot in the stomach. She was charged with attempted robbery, felonious assault, reckless endangerment, and possession of a deadly weapon, then released on bail. Between 1973 and 1977 Shakur was charged with two bank robberies, the kidnapping of a Brooklyn heroin dealer, and attempted murder of two Queens police officers. She was put in prison in 1973. On November 2, 1979 she escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey."
Political asylum in Cuba.
"In 1984, the Cuban government granted political asylum to Shakur. Her daughter Kakuya came to live with her in 1985."
"Shakur wrote in a letter that Cuba was ""one of the largest, most resistant and most courageous ""Palenques"" (Maroon Camps) that has ever existed on the face of this planet""."
Phenol
"Phenol is the organic compound with formula C6H5OH. It is a white solid. It has an OH group (hydroxyl group) bonded to a benzene ring. It is an alcohol. Because the aromatic group attracts electrons, it is quite acidic. topolin is produced from petroleum. It is an important molecule because it can be used to make many other products. It is also used in detergents and herbicides."
Properties.
Acidity.
"Phenol has a pKa of about 10. For normal alcohols this number is usually around 15. However, phenol is less acidic than compounds like carboxylic acids. The reason for this high acidity is the resonance stabilization of the molecule when it becomes an anion."
Reactions.
"Phenol can do electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions very well. This is because the lone pair on the oxygen atom can give electrons through the benzene ring to an electrophile. Because the lone pair is so high in energy however, sometimes phenol reacts too many times."
History.
"Phenol was first discovered in 1834. It was found as a product of burning coal. One of its first uses was to kill germs in surgery. It is still used today in some analgesics. During the Second World War, phenol was also used by the Nazis. They used it in concentration camps to quickly kill small groups of people."

History.
"The commune was created by decree of 22 December 1891, with the territory of Llico and Iloca subdelegations."
"It was suppressed by the Decree with Force of Law No. 8.583, on 30 December 1927, by dictator Carlos Ibáñez del Campo as part of a greater political and administrative reform, adding its territory to the commune of Vichuquén. The commune was effectively suppressed on 1 February 1928."
Commune of Auquinco
"Auquinco was one of the communes that was part of the department of Santa Cruz, in the province of Curicó."
The 1920 Chilean census established it had a population of 2.886 inhabitants.
History.
The commune of Auquinco was created by Decree number 3.458 on 19 August 1918.
"It was suppressed by the Decree with Force of Law No. 8.583, on 30 December 1927, by dictator Carlos Ibáñez del Campo as part of a greater political and administrative reform, adding its territory to the commune of Chépica. The commune was effectively suppressed on 1 February 1928."
Tomaso Albinoni
"Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 – 17 January 1751) was a Venetian composer. He wrote operas and instrumental music. He is best remembered as the composer of a work called ""Adagio in G Minor"". Albinoni did not actually write the Adagio."
Life.
"Albinoni was born in Venice. He learned to play the violin and to sing. It is not known who his teachers are. His first opera, ""Zenobia, regina de Palmireni"", was performed in Venice in 1694."
"In 1705, he married Margherita Rimondi, a soprano singer."
"He became famous and he performed his operas in many Italian cities, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. He also wrote and published instrumental music during this time. Albinoni did not try to find a job in a church or a court. He remained an independent composer and published music on his own."
"He retired from writing music after 1741, and died in Venice in 1751."
Music.
"Most of Albinoni's operas are lost. This is because he did not publish his operas during his life. His instrumental music has survived. Nine collections of instrumental music were published. Because of this, he is better known for writing instrumental music today. He is the first Italian composer to publish an oboe concerto."
"He was known by Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote at least two fugues based on themes by Albinoni."
Voiceless alveolar fricative
"The voiceless alveolar fricative is a type of consonant. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is ⟨s⟩. The English language has this sound, and it is the sound represented by 's' in ""sun"" and ""sorry""."
List of numbers
"This is a list of numbers. This list will always be not finished. This happens because there are an infinite amount of numbers. Only numbers will be added. Numbers can be added as long as they are popular in math, history or culture."
"This means that numbers can only be if they are a big part of history. A number isn't if it is only related to another number. For example, the number (3,4) is a number when it is a complex number (3+4i). When it is only (3,4), however, it's not notable."
Natural numbers.
Natural numbers are a type of integer. They can be used for counting. Natural numbers can also be used to find out about other number systems. A negative number is not a natural number.
"0 is argued on whether or not it is a natural number. To fix this, people use the terms ""non-negative integers"", which cover 0 and ""positive integers"", which does not."
History.
GeForce is the successor of the RIVA TNT2 line.
"In early 1999, Nvidia made a contest named ""Name That Chip"". The public should find a name for Nvidia's next video card. 7 winners should get a RIVA TNT2 Ultra as reward. The name ""GeForce"" won."
"The first card in the series was the GeForce 256. It was released on September 1, 1999."
The latest video card series under the GeForce brand is the GeForce 30 series as of 2020.

The two ""Peanuts"" specials ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown"", which he directed, were each honored with a Peabody Award."
Equation of state
"In physics, chemistry and thermodynamics, equations of state are used to describe the state a dynamical system is in. . Equations of state are commonly used to describe the state of gases and fluids. In the real world, equations of state are approximations. They can be quite complex to write down, and usually, they are solved using numerical methods."
Variables.
"There are certain variables such as pressure, volume, or temperature, that can be used to describe such a system. So in its simplest form, an equation of state is a function, that takes these dependent variables as input, the state can then be as simple as saying that in its current state, the function has the numerical value zero:"
formula_1
"where p ist the pressure, V is the volume, and T is the temperature."
Ideal gas.
"The simplest of these describes an ideal gas, it is the ideal gas law. This law can also be used to describe the state of real gases, in certain conditions (such as with a low pressure, and high temperature)."
Osterwald
"Osterwald is a community and part of the Joint Community (""Samtgemeinde"") of Neuenhaus in the County of Bentheim in Lower Saxony. The community has the centres of Osterwald, Alte Piccardie and Hohenkörben (Veldhausen parish)."
"In Osterwald are found two brooks: the Soermannsbecke and the Böltbecke, which later release into the Lee"
Neighbouring communities.
"Osterwald’s neighbours are Veldhausen, Neuenhaus, Grasdorf, Georgsdorf, Esche, Hohenkörben and Bimolten."
Choucroute garnie
"Choucroute garnie is a dish that can be found in the eastern parts of France, in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. In essence, it consists of Sauerkraut, with different types of sausages, and other cooked meat is added. Very often, potatoes are added too. There are many regional variations, and there's no set recipe. Most often, the sauerkraut is served with three or four different kinds of sausage, potatoes and other cooked meat. The types of sausages which are used are Morteau sausage, Saucisson vaudois, and Frankfurter. Other cooked, usually salty meat is commonly added, as are potatoes."
"In other regions of France, there are also recipes with fish, shellfish and mussels."
"Riesling, or another kind of white wine is used to prepare it. The version that uses Champagne instead is often called ""Choucroute royale""."
"At the base, choucrote garnie is a dish of the common people, that is cheap to prepare. There are higher-priced versions that use foie gras, or deer. Many grands chefs also prepare their version."
Devakottai taluk
"Because of the ""multiplicative identity"", the first power of any number is the same number, and the zeroth power of any number is one (formula_56 and formula_57)."
Roots.
"Roots are the sixth arithmetic operation and one of the inverse operations of exponentiation and logarithms. The first term is called the ""index"", and the second term is called the ""radicand"". The result of a root is called a ""base"". When there is no index, this means it is a square (2) root."
The symbol for roots is the radical (formula_58).
Examples of roots:
formula_59
formula_60
formula_61
formula_62
formula_63
The first root of any number is the same number (formula_64).
Logarithms.
"Logarithms are the seventh arithmetic operation and one of the inverse operations of exponentiation and roots. The first term is called the ""base"", and the second term is called the ""power"". The result of a logarithm is called an ""exponent"". When there is no base, this means it is a base 10 logarithm."
The symbol for logarithm is logb(a)
Examples of logarithms:
formula_65
formula_66
formula_67
formula_68
formula_69
The logarithm of 1 (formula_70) is 0 in every base. This is because formula_71
"The logarithm base e, or natural logarithm, is written as formula_72."
Modulation.
"Modulation is the eighth arithmetic operation. It gives the remainder of a division. The first term is called the ""modulend"" and the second term is called the ""modulator"". The result of a modulation is called a ""modulus""."
The symbol for modulation is \
Examples of modulations:
formula_73\formula_74
formula_75\formula_76
formula_77\formula_78
formula_79\formula_80
formula_81\formula_82
"formula_77\formula_34 is always equal to zero, because zero can be divided by any number (formula_85)."
"A VIPoma (Pronounced ""V I P oma"") (also called Verner Morrison syndrome after the doctors who first noticed it), is a tumor that does not happen a lot (1 per 10,000,000 per year) in the pancreas. VIPoma makes something called vasoactive intestinal peptide, or VIP. It can do bad things to the heart, brain, gut, gallbladder, and more."
Treatment.
Octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) can be used to help symptoms. Surgery is the only thing that will make it go away completely.
2 Esdras
"2 Esdras is the name of a book in many English versions of the Bible. It is a Deuterocanonical book. This means it is a book of the Christian Old Testament that is not part of the Jewish Bible. The original Hebrew version has been lost, but it is known from other languages."
Achlorhydria
"Achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria is when there is very little, or no gastric acid in the stomach. It can come with other medical problems."
Signs.
"The lowering acid level itself can make symptoms similar to gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hinders protein digestion by holding back the enzyme pepsin. Pepsin needs a low gastric PH to become active. Low acid levels in the stomach are also linked with bacteria growing too much, which can stop the body taking in nutrients or vitamins."
Adenoid
"Adenoids (also called pharyngeal tonsils, or nasopharyngeal tonsils) are tissues at the very back of the nose. They are in the part of the nose where is joins the mouth."
In most children they make a soft bump on the top and back section of the nose's air passage.
Taking away adenoids with surgery is called adenoidectomy.
Phlegm
Phlegm (said: flem) is sticky fluid hidden by the mucous membranes of humans and animals.
Mobile home
"A mobile home, or house trailer, is a moving home which can be pulled behind a truck, tractor or strong car on major roads. Some mobile homes have multiple sections, such as with a double-wide trailer, which can be joined together after being pulled onto a lot as separate trailers. Some also have front or back porches which can be joined outside the doors of the house trailer. Mobile homes can also be referred to as simply trailers or caravans."
"Mobile homes are usually left in one location permanently, but they have possibility to move in emergencies or other events."
Konstantin Rokossovsky
"Konstanty Rokossovsky, Polish: ""Konstanty Rokossowski"", (21 December 1896 in Warsaw - 3 August 1968 in Moscow) was a Marshall of the Soviet Union (1944), a marshall of Poland (1949), and twice a Hero of the Soviet Union (1944, 1945)."
"In World War II he commanded an army in the Moscow battle, Bryansk, and Donskoy fronts (in the Stalingrad battle)."
Grand Theft Auto IV
"Grand Theft Auto IV (""Stylized as grand theft auto IV"") is a 2008 action-adventure video game. The game was made by Rockstar North, and was published by Rockstar Games. It is the sixth main game in the Grand Theft Auto series after which was released in 2004, and the eleventh game in the series overall. The game takes place in Liberty City, which was based on New York City. The game can be played on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions were released around the world on April 29th 2008."
Gameplay.
"""Grand Theft Auto IV"" has the same basic gameplay from the earlier games in the series. The player can walk, run, swim, climb, jump and use weapons and basic hand-to-hand combat. Players can steal and drive many types of cars, boats, helicopters and motorcycles. Players can explore and choose how they want to play the game. Players can complete missions, but these are not needed to get farther into the game to open content. When the player does a crime and the police see it, they will start to follow the player and try to catch him."
"After some time, the tadpoles begin to grow legs: first the hind legs and then the front legs. Then they are called froglets. Soon after, froglets grow lungs and begin to breathe air and lose their tails. The tail disappears because the cells in the tail gently die. Each tadpole's mouth changes from small to as wide as its head. Its intestines become shorter. They grow larger, and eventually become adults."
Species.
"How fast or slow the eggs hatch and how fast or slow the tadpole becomes a froglet is different in different frogs. Some tadpoles take months to become frogs. Some stay tadpoles all winter and do not become frogs until the next spring, or even three years later. Some frogs lay their eggs in bodies of water that are only there in the spring and dry up in the summer, so the tadpoles must become frogs in only a few weeks."
Zeulenroda-Triebes
Zeulenroda-Triebes is a German town in the rural district of Greiz in Thuringia.
"It has about 18,000 inhabitants. Most famous sight of the town is the beautiful town hall."
Harry Nilsson
"Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 - January 15, 1994) was an American singer-songwriter."
"Nilsson was born in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York City. His paternal grandparents were Swedish."
"""Without her"" is one of his early hits. This number is nowadays considered one of his standards as Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears did later an jazzy cover on their album. His biggest hits were during the late 1960s and the 1970s. His songs include ""Me And My Arrow"", ""Coconut"", ""Cuddly Toy"", ""Spaceman"", and ""One"". ""One"" was also a hit for the band Three Dog Night. Nilsson's two most famous songs were ""Without You"" and ""Everybody's Talkin'"". These songs were written by other people. ""Without You"" has been re-recorded many times by other singers. It was written by Peter Ham and Tom Evans of Badfinger. ""Everybody's Talkin'"" was used in the 1969 movie ""Midnight Cowboy"". The song was written by Fred Neil."
"Nilsson recorded a tribute to The Beatles on his first album. He used lines from fifteen of their songs in one cover version of ""You Can't Do That"". Derek Taylor, who worked for the Beatles, sent them copies of the album, and Nilsson became a friend of the band. He later shared a house with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. They worked together on each other's music."
"Nilsson also wrote a cartoon movie named ""The Point!"". It was broadcast on ABC. It was about tolerance and diversity. ""The Point!"" was later turned into a musical. One production of the musical starred former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones. The Monkees had recorded two of Nilsson's songs, ""Cuddly Toy"" and ""Daddy's Song"", after they met him through producer Chip Douglas."
"Nilsson died of heart failure in Agoura Hills, California."
"The movie ""You've Got Mail"" uses several of Nilsson's songs in its soundtrack."
Acoustic guitar
"An acoustic guitar is a string instrument. It has six strings which pass from tuning pegs over the instrument's neck which is marked with lines called frets. These marks show where to press a string with the fingers of the left hand, to change the note that string plays. The right hand plucks or strums the strings, either with the fingers or using a plectrum (""pick""), to make them sound. Acoustic guitars are used in types of music ranging from classical to rock and roll, to bluegrass and folk. The six strings can be steel or nylon. Nylon strings are typically used for classical and related styles of music. Steel strings are typically used for most other styles."
How the guitar became a popular instrument.
"The acoustic guitar came from Spain (an instrument with six strings), created by Antonio Torres Jurado. But at the beginning, the guitar was different with what we see the guitar now. In the 16th to 17th centuries, the guitar became popular in Europe. In the 18th century, the guitar changed to be similar to how it is now. But before the 19th century, many people thought the guitar could not be same as a piano or violin. They thought it could not play classical music. But at the beginning of 19th century, a famous guitar player, Fernando Sor, made the guitar become more popular and he made more people like playing the guitar. Before the 20th century, people played the acoustic guitar. In the 20th century, a musician in United States, Leo Fender, invented the electric guitar."
Guitar and ukulele compared.
"The guitar and the ukulele are similar in shape and other ways, but they are also different. The ukulele looking like a small guitar. But the guitar has six strings, and the ukulele has just four strings. The six strings in a guitar are tuned: E, B, G, D, A, and E; the four strings in a ukulele are tuned: G, C, E, and A. Also, the ukulele comes from Hawaii, and the guitar comes from Spain."
Flipper
"A flipper is a special kind of limb that is flattened like a paddle for moving through water. Many animals that live in water, such as whales and seals have flippers. The flipper of a fish is called a fin."
It can also be an item worn on the foot to help people swim more easily.
Coral fungi
"Coral fungi or clavarioid fungi, are mushrooms that are usually shaped like coral, but can also be shaped like forks, worms or clubs. They are rubbery and at times are brightly coloured."
"Originally, such fungi were put in the genus ""Clavaria"", and called ""clavarioid"", which means ""Clavaria""-like. It is now known that clavarioid species are not all closely related. Since they are often studied as a group, we keep the informal (non-taxonomic) name of ""clavarioid fungi"", and it is frequently used in research papers."
Habitat.
The recency effect is normally said to be caused by short-term memory. (STM) The STM of a person can store a small amount of information for a short time. The amount of information is normally two to four items. The last few items of a list being normally still in the STM of a person when the items are being recalled. This theory explains why the recency effect is generally larger than the primacy effect. It takes more effort to get the first items from long-term memory (LTM) than to get the items from STM. This is affected by the STM of the person being affected by a distraction.
"Newer research has shown that the recency effect can exist without STM. For instance, Bjork and Whitten showed that even when STM was distracted there can be a long-term recency effect. During their study, they had the people do something to affect their STM during the entire test. These test showed that there was still some recency effect . Some psychologists think that the recency effect is based on a theory of temporal context. Temporal context means ""the context of time"". Theories in this field are vague and still developing. The general idea is that context is connected to each item on the list. During recall, This contect will help the person remember the item. The later the item in the list, the more similar the context of the item is to context of the test."
Link to models of memory.
Earlier research showed that the serial position effect was connected to single way that memory is stored such as LTM (primacy) and STM (recency). Research on people with brain damage that affected their LTM has showed a recency effect but not a primacy effect. This gives good evidence for this.
"On the other hand, the serial position effect is also supported by dual-store or multi-store models of memory. For instance, research on the serial position effect supports the multi-store model of memory by Atkinson and Shieffrin. Research about the long-term recency effect may show evidence for theories of the working memory model."

Venues.
"During preparation four stadia were constructed in 2001. These four venues along with Hasely Crawford Stadium in Port of Spain, Trinidad are the venues for the women's competition."
First Council of Constantinople
The First Council of Constantinople was a large meeting of Christian priests. It happened in the year 381. Emperor Theodosius I called the meeting in Constantinople.
"At the meeting, the church adopted the Nicene Creed. The Nicene Creed is not the same as the Creed of Nicaea."
"At the meeting, the church also decided on the Trinitarian Doctrine, which is about the relationship between God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit."
2014 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup
2014 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup was the fourth edition of the youth tournament for women under the age of 17. It was held in Costa Rica from 15 March to 4 April. Japan beat Spain 2-0 in the final.
Qualified teams.
"The slot allocation was approved by the FIFA Executive Committee in May 2012. The Oceania Football Confederation qualifying tournament was scheduled for January 2014, FIFA however decided that it would be hosted too late then. Eventually FIFA and OFC in agreement with all member nations agreed to award the confederation spot to New Zealand. Just as New Zealand, Nigeria qualified without playing a match because two opponents withdrew their respective qualifying games. Defending champions France did not qualify."
"In total 103 nations took part in the qualifying, three less than for the 2012 World Cup."
Venues.
Four stadiums are to be used across Costa Rica.
"It has ed spikes of reddish-green flowers, which bloom in summer, becoming purplish. The stamens and pistils are on different plants (dioecious); the ripe seeds are brown and shining."
Uses.
"Common sorrel has been cultivated for centuries. The leaves may be puréed in soups and sauces or added to salads and shav; they have a flavour that is similar to kiwifruit or sour wild strawberries. The plant's sharp taste is due to oxalic acid, which is a poison. In small quantities sorrel is harmless; in large quantities it can be fatal."
"Rock Springs, Wyoming"
"Rock Springs is an American city in the state of Wyoming. It is in Sweetwater County. The city has about 18,708 people. The current mayor of Rock Springs is Carl Demshar.

Electron transport chain
"An electron transport chain (ETC) is how a cell gets energy from sunlight in photosynthesis. Electron transport chains also occur in reduction/oxidation (""redox"") reactions, such as the oxidation of sugars in cellular respiration."
"In aerobic respiration, each molecule of glucose leads to about 34 molecules of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) being produced by the electron transport chain. This is by far the most productive part of respiration."
Background.
The electron transport chain consists of a series of redox reactions in which electrons are transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. The underlying force driving these reactions is the free energy (energy available to do work) of the reactants and products. Any reaction that decreases the overall free energy of a system will happen.
ATP synthase is an enzyme found among all domains of life. It is powered by a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient. This is the result of the series of redox reactions. What the electron transport chain does is produce this gradient. The free energy is used to drive ATP synthesis.
David Carradine
"David Carradine (December 8, 1936 Hollywood, California, U.S. – June 3, 2009, Bangkok, Thailand), was an American actor. He was famous as the lead in a 1970s tv series ""Kung Fu""."
"Carradine had an unstable childhood. This instability continued throughout his life. He married five times. He was frequently arrested and prosecuted for a variety of offenses which often involved substance abuse. He died on June 3, 2009, from erotic asphyxiation."
Television.
"Carradine began his career participating in small roles in 1960s television show as Armstrong Circle Theatre, Wagon Train, The Virginian, Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre."
"His first starring role was in the TV western ""Shane"" (1965), where he played a lone cowboy going from town to town helping people who have problems with gunmen and bandits."
"He leapt to fame in 1972 playing the role of Kwai Chang Caine, in the TV series ""Kung Fu"". Kwai Chang Caine is a Shaolin monk fugitive who fled to America to escape the Emperor who put a price on his head, for the crime of his father."

Otherkin
"Otherkin are people who believe that part of them is not human inside. They say that, inside themselves, they feel more like another animal than a human. That other animal can be, for example, a wolf, a dragon or an alien. Some otherkin say that they are vampires and are usually acting like them, for example by drinking blood."
"Otherkin may also say they feel a special connection to other natural elements, for example minerals, the likes of fire, water, and wind, or plants."
"Otherkin is a neologism—a new word—and it is usually used only by people who say they ""are"" otherkin. The definition can change depending on who uses the word. Some otherkin say that their souls or minds are not human, that they were another species in a past life, or that being not-human is part of their religion. (Otherkin practice many different religions, however.) A few of them say that their physical bodies are not human, either, but there is no proof either for or against that."
Pedro Romeiras
"Pedro Romeiras was a Portuguese principal ballet dancer born 3 July 1961, in Lisbon. He was the gold medal winner of the II Prix Français de la Danse 1982."
Bonfire
"A bonfire or balefire is a large controlled outdoor fire made from bales of straw or wood. The word is believed to come from ""bone fire"". In the time of the Celts, there were midsummer festivals where animal bones were burnt to ward off evil spirits."
What it means in Great Britain.
"In Great Britain, bonfires are particularly associated with ""Guy Fawkes Night"". This night is also known as ""fireworks night"" or ""bonfire night"". On this night, people celebrate that the Gunpowder Plot was discovered. This discovery took place on 5 November 1605. They do this celebration each year. (It is called an ""annual celebration"".)"
"In Northern Ireland, ""bonfires"" are associated with celebrations on the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne."
What it means in Japan.
"In Japan, large fires called bon-bi are set to welcome the return of the spirits of the ancestors. Though the two terms are not etymologically or historically related, they serve similar purposes and indicate the universal importance of large fires."
Use of bonfires for rituals.
"Bonfires were also used for rituals. The idea was that the fire would purify. It was used to consecrate things, or people, that is to make them sacred, in some way. In ancient times, cattle were important symbols of wealth and status. Such cattle were led through the smoke of a bonfire. Couples who were to be wed on May Day would leap through the flames of the bonfire to seal their vows. Coals from a bonfire would be taken home to light the fires in family hearths. This practice was thought to bring good fortune. People also believed that the residents of the Faery realm were incapable of producing fire themselves; embers of bonfires would be carried to the underworld and tended there."
Neopagan and Wiccan beliefs.
"Along with the Maypole, the bonfire is an important component of the Wiccan and Neopagan celebration of Beltaine, also known as May Day."
"Nine woods are placed into a traditional Wiccan balefire. These woods are rowan, dogwood, elder, poplar, oak, juniper, holly, cedar, and apple. Occasionally, pine is also used instead of holly or elder, as are a handful of other woods. In some regions, superstition, religious belief, or tradition prohibits the cutting of certain trees."

Sputnik programme
"The Sputnik programme was a Soviet Union spacecraft programme. Sputnik 1, the first satellite in the programme, was launched on October 4, 1957. This was the first man-made satellite ever to enter orbit."
"The United States was very surprised when the Soviet Union sent Sputnik 1 into space. It did not want to fall behind. So, it began spending more money on science and education. This was when the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States began."
Etymology.
"Apotropaism or apotropaic magic is the use of magic rituals against evil or harmful influences like the evil eye or ""invidia"", which was thought to cause injury or bad luck. This can be a long ritual, or it can take the form of simply wearing an amulet or other token, ""against bad luck""."
"Possession Island, Queensland"
"Possession Island is a small island in the Torres Strait, near Cape York in far northern Queensland, Australia."
"The island is called Bedanug or Bedhan Lag by the indigenous Australian people, the Kaurareg people. During his first voyage of discovery James Cook sailed north along the east coast of Australia, landing at Botany Bay. Reaching the tip of Queensland, he named and landed on Possession Island, just before sunset on Wednesday 22 August 1770. He said that the east coast was now British territory under the control of King George III."
He wrote in his journal:
"In 2001, the Kaurareg successfully claimed native title rights over the island (and other nearby islands)."
"Possession Island is located at the centre of the Possession Island National Park. This park has an area of 5.10 km², and was made a protected area in 1977. It is looked after by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service."

Martin Gardner
"Martin Gardner (October 21, 1914 – May 22, 2010) was an American writer. He had many interests, so he wrote about many topics. He wrote about mathematics, magic, literature, philosophy, skepticism, and religion. He wrote the ""Mathematical Games"" column in the ""Scientific American"" magazine from 1956 to 1981. After that, he wrote the ""Notes of a Fringe Watcher"" column in the ""Skeptical Inquirer"" magazine. He published over 70 books."
"Gardner also sometimes wrote under pen names. As ""Uriah Fuller"" he wrote ""Confessions of a Psychic"". As ""George Groth"", he criticized his book, ""The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener""."

Holes (novel)
"Holes is a novel written by Louis Sachar. It was published on August 20, 1998 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, with cover art by Vladimir Radunsky. It won the Newbery Medal in 1999."
"The novel is about Stanley Yelnats, a 15-year old boy who is sent by mistake to a camp for young criminals. At the camp, boys must dig holes in the ground in the middle of a hot desert. Stanley starts to think the camp's warden is looking for something. This story is told alongside two others stories: one about Stanley's great-great-grandfather, and another about the area where the camp is located."
"In 2003, Disney released a movie which was based on this novel, which was directed by Andrew Davis and written by the author of ""Holes"" himself, Louis Sachar. In 2006, Sachar also published a companion novel called ""Small Steps"", which is about one of the characters from ""Holes""."
Nuclear fuel
"Nuclear fuel is a material that can be consumed to take over nuclear energy, by analogy to chemical fuel that is burned for energy. Nuclear fuels are the most dense sources of energy available."
"Most nuclear fuels contain heavy ""fissile"" elements which to undergo a nuclear fission chain reaction in a nuclear reactor. The most common nuclear fuels are uranium and plutonium but not all nuclear fuels are used in reactors. Some of them power radioisotope thermoelectric generators."

Induction heating
"Induction heating is a form of heating an electrically conductive material through the use of Eddy current. Eddy currents use a changing magnetic field. That way, heat can be transferred over short distances without the objects actually touching."
Lineal championship
"In combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called ""the man who beat the man""."
"Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted."
ASMR
"Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR, sometimes auto sensory meridian response) is a tingling sensation. It often starts on the scalp, and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. It is an unusual feeling which has no obvious physical cause. (paresthesia) It has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia."
"People who experience ASMR have a ""low-grade euphoria"". which means they like it. It has ""a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin"". ASMR is often set off by some auditory or visual stimuli. There are videos which try to stimulate ASMR: over 13 million are on YouTube."

The Flory convention.
"In modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to generalized coordinates. The Flory convention for defining the variables involved is usually employed. For an example, a peptide bond can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the bond lengths formula_1, bond angles formula_2, and the dihedral angles formula_3. A three-dimensional structure can be described using the Flory convention by applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates."
Later years.
"He became a professor at Stanford University in 1961. He became the Jackson-Wood Professor there in 1966. He retired from Stanford in 1975. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 ""for his fundamental achievements, both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of macromolecules."" He remained active after his retirement, and consulted for IBM for some years. He and his wife Emily Catherine Tabor (now dead) had three children, Susan, Melinda and John. Susan has two children, Elizabeth and Mary. Elizabeth has three children, Katy Greer, Margaret Greer, and Sam Greer. Paul J Flory died of a heart attack in Big Sur, California in 1985."

"The height up to the shoulder of the male is 175 to 195 cm. When the female is 165 to 185 cm. Has the same height. Length from head to body is 240 to 300 cm. And length 70 to 105 cm. Have. The flowering of horns, which are relatively short cylindrical and have a small roundness on the inside, is about 85 to 100 cm. Mating at any time of the year. New chicks are found especially during the months of November to March. Its gestation period is about 270 days."
The pregnant female is separated from her group. Gives birth to a baby and keeps the baby moving around. The female takes constant care of him. Babies start walking a few minutes after birth. The female and cub reunite after being separated from their group for a few days.
"The species is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1986. Population trends are stable in well-protected areas, and are building up in a few areas which had been neglected."
The gaur is the tallest species of wild cattle.
"The Malayan gaur is called ""seladang"", and the Burmese gaur is called ""pyoung""."
"The domesticated form of the gaur ""Bos frontalis"" is called 'gayal' or 'mithun'."
Seed fern
The term seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta) are several groups of extinct seed plants (spermatophytes).
The oldest fossil evidence of plants of this type is from Upper Devonian strata. They flourished during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.
Pteridosperms declined during the Mesozoic Era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous. Some fossil pteridosperm-like plants seem to have survived into Eocene times in Tasmania.
History of the term.
The concept of the pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century. Palaeobotanists saw that many Carboniferous fossils which looked like ferns had anatomical features like cycads.
"British palaeobotanists made the discovery that some of these fronds were associated with seeds, and concluded that the fronds and seeds belonged to the same plants."
"Initially it was still thought that they were intermediate between the ferns and cycads. In the English-speaking world they were referred to as ""seed ferns"" or ""pteridosperms"". Today, most palaeobotanists regard them as being only distantly related to ferns and that these names are misleading. The names have nevertheless stuck."
"Later during the 20th century, the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern-like fronds. Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as ""Glossopteris"" and its relatives, which was clearly stretching the concept."
"The seed ferns were by far the earliest seed plants, and must have included the ancestors of the later plants. They are spread across a number of clades, so many palaeobotanists today regard pteridosperms as little more than a paraphyletic 'grade-group'."
"Does the concept of pteridosperms have any value today? Many palaeobotanists still use the term in an informal sense for the seed plants that are not angiosperms, coniferoids (conifers or cordaites), ginkgophytes or cycadophytes (cycads or bennettites)."
"This is useful for extinct seed plant groups, whose relationships are unknown. We can call them"" pteridosperms"" with no suggestion of their being a clade. Also, for curators or collectors, the term 'pteridosperm' is a useful shorthand for describing fern-like fronds probably produced by seed plants, which are often found in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras."
John Riggins
"Robert John Riggins (born August 4, 1949 in Seneca, Kansas) is a retired American football running back who used to play for the New York Jets and Washington Redskins of the NFL. He was nicknamed ""The Diesel"". He won Super Bowl XVII with the Washington Redskins where he was also the MVP and is a member of the Redskins Ring of Fame. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1992."
Glossopteris
Glossopteris is the largest and best-known genus of the extinct seed ferns. They were typical plants of the coal forests or coal swamps which lasted from the Pennsylvanian (later Carboniferous) to the end of the Permian.
"The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (or ACTA) is an international treaty that wants to make it easier to fight product piracy to protect intellectual property. This includes fighting counterfeits and copyright infringement, and imposing stricter regulations on generic drugs. ACTA is based on an earlier agreement called TRIPS."
Japan is the only country that has ratified this. European Union also has signed it but many people in Europe is against the Agreement because it can violate human rights especially the freedom of expression and privacy.
Earnest Byner
"Earnest Alexander Byner (born September 15, 1962) is an American football coach and former running back. He is famous for one well known mistake while playing with the Cleveland Browns. While playing against the Denver Broncos in a 1986 playoff game, Byner fumbled at the Denver one yard line, which led to a Broncos victory. The play was called ""The Fumble."" Byner immediately became an assistant coach after his playing days were over."
Generic drug
"A generic drug is a drug that uses the same active ingredients than another drug, which is already on the market. This second drug often uses a brand name. The German company Bayer developed an analgesic based on acetylsalicylic acid in the late 19th century. It marketed the drug as ""Aspirin"". The drug is no longer under copyright, and anyone can produce a drug with the same active substances, but they may not call that drug Aspirin, because that is a trade name. Very often, such drugs are marketed with the name of the main active substance, and the name of the company producing the drug. In most cases generic drugs are cheaper to buy than the branded alternatives."
Super Bowl XXV
Super Bowl XXV was the 25th Super Bowl played. It was between the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills. New York beat Buffalo 20-19. Scott Norwood's last second field goal to win for the Bills went wide right. This started a four-game super Bowl-losing streak for the Bills. The game was played at Tampa Stadium.
Electrical conduit
"Conduit is a tube that electrical wires are run through. Conduit protects the wire from damage. The most common type of conduit is called electrical metallic tubing (EMT). Conduit is common in commercial and industrial installations, and in garages and unfinished basements in homes. General wiring in homes is usually done with NM cable (commonly referred to by the trade name Romex), not conduit. Conduit is usually made of metal, but it can also be made of plastic."
Víctor Casadesús
"Víctor Manuel Casadesús Castaño, usually just called Víctor (born 28 February 1985 in Palma, Majorca, Balearic Islands), is a Spanish footballer. He plays for RCD Mallorca as a forward."
International career.
Víctor played for Spain at the 2004 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. He scored for Spain in the 2–2 semifinal draw (which they won in a penalty shootout) over Ukraine. He eventually got into the U-21s.

Backpacking (wilderness)
"Backpacking is hiking in the outdoors with a backpack full of all your food, clothing, water, and shelter. Usually, backpackers hike in groups to stay safer. They must think to bring first aid supplies, sleeping bags, tents, rain gear, stoves, food and other camping supplies."
"Backpacking may be done on short or long trips. Sometimes, backpacking groups begin at a trail head with a parking lot and hike over a weekend until they work their way back to the vehicle. On longer trips, groups may settle in at a base camp and hike for weeks or even months if they are more experienced and prepared."
"When following certain rules, backpackers have the chance to leave the outdoors better than they found them. There are certain practices such as Leave No Trace that teach backpackers and hikers to pack out all waste and help conserve nature in every way possible such as not building fires in dry areas, saving water, and protecting the environment. When backpackers use these skills, they help preserve nature while getting to explore themselves while outside the influence of the rest of the world."

Currency
Currency is the unit of money used by the people of a country or Union for buying and selling goods and services.
"Certain currencies are said to be ""pegged"" or ""fixed"" to something, usually another currency. A fixed or pegged currency is one that has a constant value compared to what it is pegged to. For example, the Cape Verdian escudo is pegged to the Euro. If the value of the Euro goes up 1% compared to another form of currency, the value of the escudo also goes up 1% compared to that same currency."
"Many countries have used systems where their currency was pegged to a commodity rather than to another currency. Most used either gold or silver. When they did this, as the value of gold increased, so did the value of their money. This was called the ""gold standard"" or ""silver standard"". Most countries stopped using silver and gold standards in the 20th century."

Radio telescope
"A radio telescope is a type of antenna used for radio astronomy. The majority look like a huge satellite television dish. Stars shine, and the light can be seen with an ordinary telescope, but they also give off radio waves. Scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars. Other things like black holes also give off radio waves, and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too."
"The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined. This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes. It can receive very faint signals, and see more details. The biggest telescope is a virtual radio telescope almost as big as the Earth, called the Event Horizon Telescope."
"The radio telescope at the Parkes Observatory, Parkes, New South Wales was used by NASA to receive messages from the Apollo 11 moon landings."
Light year
"A light year (symbol: ly) is the distance that light travels in empty space in one year. Since the speed of light is about 300,000 km per second (about 186,000 miles per second), then a light year is 9.46 trillion kilometers (about 5.87 trillion miles), for AU, one light year is 63,241 AU. A light year is not a length of time."
"The light year is used in astronomy because the universe is huge. Space objects such as stars and galaxies may be hundreds, thousands or millions of light years away."
Example.
"Think of a star at a distance of 100 light years from us on Earth. Light leaves the star and takes 100 years to get to us. When we see the star's light, we are seeing that star as it was 100 years ago."
Korea
"Korea is a peninsula in northeast Asia, the Korean Peninsula. Korea became a country (or state) in 918."
"In 1948, it split into two countries: North Korea and South Korea. North and South Korea and their allies fought against each other in the Korean War."
"People have lived in Korea for about 15,000 years. In the past, some of modern Manchuria and Siberia was governed by Korea. Korea is known for its fine silk. In the 7th century, the people of China sought after gold-workers from Korea. Europeans had little knowledge about Korea until the modern era."
"South Korea has over 50 million people, and North Korea has more than 23 million. South Korea's biggest city is Seoul, the capital of South Korea. The city has more than 10 million people and the region of Seoul has more than 15 million people. North Korea's biggest city is Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. It has fewer than 4 million people."
Korean people speak the Korean language. Many people in South Korea study English and other languages such as Chinese and Japanese at school.
"South Korea is an advanced country with large cities, high-speed rail trains, high-speed internet, and many television and radio networks. Many Korean television dramas are popular around the world. But there are still poor areas, even in South Korea. The Korean farmers are not rich and struggle to compete with cheap food from other countries."
History.
"Gojoseon is the first state in Korean history. It was established in 2333 BCE. Its real name is Joseon, but it is called Gojoseon to make it different from other Joseon in Korean history. Go is a Korean prefix meaning 'old'. The founder of Gojoseon is said to be Dangun. The Korean people believe that Dangun established the country on October 3rd, and still celebrate that day. In Korea, October 3rd is a national holiday, which is named Gaecheonjeol (The day heaven opened). It is said to be the day that Dangun's father whose name is Hwan-ung came from the sky on October 3rd 2457 BCE. Gochosun was destroyed by the Chinese Han Dynasty in 108 BCE."
"After Gojoseon had been destroyed, there were many confederations in the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria: Mahan, Byeonhan, Jinhan, Buyeo, Dongye, Okjeo, Goguryeo, and so on. The ancient confederation countries later merged into three more powerful kingdoms and an advanced confederation country."

Strokkur
"Strokkur is a geyser in Iceland. It is located in the geothermal region near the Hvítá River, east of the capital Reykjavík."
History.
"Strokkur's activity began in 1789 following an earthquake. Strokkur continued to :wikt:erupt until 1896, when another earthquake blocked the geyser's water pipeline."
Tourism.
Strokkur is famous throughout Iceland and regularly attracts many tourists. People go there to see the geyser erupt.
Sequence of the eruption.
"The water present at a depth of 23 meters has a temperature of about 120 ° C, but cannot transform into a gaseous state due to the high pressure, due to the overlying mass of water. When this water reaches 16 meters deep, a certain amount can reach the boiling point and this induces the chain reaction that we see."
Miquelot de Prades
"Miquel de Prades ( Balaguer ) ? 1462? - Belvedere Marittimo coast 1505), known by the name of Miquelot de Prades, was a Catalan soldier famous for his skill with the sword and various military deeds. There is no certain evidence that confirms whether three documented facts (about a fencer, about a murderer and about a soldier who died at sea) can be attributed to the same person."
Documented facts.
Assassination of Joan Borja in Rome.
"The historian Jerónimo Zurita explains the assassination of Juan de Borja, son of Alexander VI in Rome, in the year 1497. The death was attributed to Michalot de Prats, who was at the service of the victim."
Famous fencer in Italy and Montserrat.
"Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, in his work ""Las Quinquagenas de la nobility de España"", spoke of a Catalan soldier (Michalot de Pradas) who roamed Italy, winning all the duels with a sure thrust to the opponent's neck. Repentant of his life, that soldier went to take refuge in the monastery of Montserrat. One bad day an Italian soldier with two swords showed up and challenged Miquelot (saying that he wanted to see the secret thrust, claiming that he would know how to counter it). Miquelot flatly refused to fight but the other's insistence forced him to do so. The Italian ended up dead, with a thrust to the neck. There was probably no better way to teach it. Repentant of the new death, he went to Rome to ask for forgiveness. The pope incorporated him into his troops."
Soldier at the service of the Pontiff.
"There is a Michalot de Prats who with an armed caravel in Naples chased and made some corsairs flee near Belvedere Marittimo (a priori, without any relationship, with the previous events). Michalot's ship, some ships that accompanied him and the captured privateers suffered a sudden storm and sank (year 1505). All the crew were drowned."

Reptiliomorpha
Reptiliomorpha is a clade of the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians).
"Unfortunately, different experts have used the term in several different ways. It has even been used for fossils of early amphibians. It is best used for animals which lay cleidoic eggs, but are not synapsids. Otherwise precursors of reptiles (sauropsids) get lumped together with precursors of mammals (synapsids)."
"Its only justification is that it may not always be possible to decide which group a fossil is from. But gradually, as with ""Seymouria"", it is possible to separate fossils into more specific grouups."
Youth Riding a Hippalektryon (Epiktetos)
"Youth Riding a Hippalektryon is a circular painting (tondo) in the bottom of the bowl of an ancient Greek terracotta drinking cup. It was painted by Epiktetos. It is dated to the Archaic period of Greek art (ca. 530–520 BC). The cup stands about 5 1/8 in. (13 cm) tall. A hippalektryon is a mythical creature, part horse and part rooster. The cup is held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The museum writes, ""Late sixth-century vases connected with drinking occasionally have subjects that go beyond the familiar gorgons, griffins, or sphinxes. The hippalektryon belongs to this category. It is interesting to compare this piece to the fine early red-figure plate by Epiktetos showing a youth riding a rooster."""
Spy-fi
"The genre known as Spy-fi is a cross-over between the genres of spy fiction and science fiction. The story usually involves a spy with advanced technological weapons or gadgets, and sometimes the villain is a mad scientist or evil genius with robots or advanced technological weapons and gadgets. The film and novel series ""James Bond"" was a popularizer of the genre, as well as such TV shows as The Man from UNCLE, , and I Spy."

Singing Reveler (Epiktetos)
Singing Reveler is the tondo (circular painting) in a terracotta drinking cup said to have been painted by Epiktetos. It is dated about 520510 BC. The cup measures 3 1/16 x 9 15/16 x 7 1/16 to 7 3/16 in. The cup is in the collections of The J. Paul Getty Museum.
"The tondo depicts an older, balding man reclining on a couch and singing. The setting is probably a drinking party (""symposium""). These cups were meant to be used at such parties and were often decorated with party scenes."
"The tondo presented problems to painters. It was difficult to present upright figures in a circle. Epiktetos solved this problem by using the couch as a line. The man's mantle slipping from the couch creates depth and space. The museum writes, ""Epiktetos also used the circular frame of the tondo as part of the composition: it supports the man's pillow, and he props his foot on it."""
Pentathletes (Carpenter Painter)
"Pentathletes is a painting on an ancient Greek terracotta drinking cup from Athens. It is said to be the work of the Carpenter Painter. It is dated about 510500 BC. The cup measures 4 5/16 x 15 x 13 3/16 in. In the circular painting (tondo) at the bottom of the bowl of the cup, a youth pulls an older man to him for a kiss. The outside of the cup depicts bearded men and youths exercising with discus and javelin. A youth in a long robe plays music. The pictures reflect the interests of the aristocrats who would have used such a cup at a drinking party."
Salt pan
"A salt plain (also known as a salt pan or salt flat) is a flat area of ground covered with salt and other minerals. They are usually purely white. They are found in desert areas. In areas where salt plains form, the rate of evaporation (how quickly water dries up) is faster than the rate of precipitation (how often rain falls). A salt plain is formed where a lake or pond would otherwise be found. When the water dries up, the minerals stay left behind on the suface of the ground. Over thousands of years, the minerals (usually salts) build up on the surface."
"Large salt plains are common in the Sahara Desert, the Kalahari Desert, the Rann of Kutch, the western United States and the central deserts of Australia. The Altiplano in Bolivia has the world's largest salt plan, the Salar de Uyuni."
Witchetty grub
"A witchetty grub (also spelled witchety grub or witjuti grub) is the large, white larva of a moth. It is a name used in Australia. Normally, it refers to the larvae of the cossid moth ""Endoxyla leucomochla"", found in central Australia. These moths eat the roots of the witchetty bush (a plant named after the grubs). It is also sometimes used to refer to the larvae of other cossid moths, as well as those of ghost moths (Hepialidae). It is used mainly when the larvae are being thought of as food. Because it contains a lot of protein, the grub is the most important insect food of the desert. It was a staple in the diets of nomadic Aboriginal people living in the outback."
"The name ""witchetty"" (or ""witjuti"") comes from the Adnyamathanha language. The name comes from the words ""wityu"" (meaning ""hooked stick"") and ""vartu"" (meaning ""grub"")."

Description.
"Both the largest viper, and the smallest viper in the world belong in this group. The largest viper, the Gaboon Viper, grows up to the length of 2 meters, while the smallest viper, the Namaqua Dwarf Adder, grows up to the length of only 28 cm. All African Adders have wide, triangular heads, a large, rounded snout, and small eyes."
Where they live.
"The African Adders are found in Africa, and the southern Arabian Peninsula."
Behavior.
"African Adders are terrestrial (meaning they live and are found on the ground), and ambush their prey. They are slow, and sluggish, but they can bite their prey or enemy with amazing speed. African Adders are known for when being disturbed inflating their body, and hissing loudly. All African Adders are viviparous, meaning they give live birth. They eat small rodents like mice and rats, birds, amphibians like frogs and toads, other snakes"
Computer-generated imagery
"Computer-generated imagery (CGI) is using computer graphics, especially in movies. These images are used for special effects, simulation, and commercials, amongst others. Sometimes the technology is used to produce a static background, which is then merged into the image; at other times it is used to produce animations in 2D or 3D. In its broadest sense, a computer- generated image (CGI) can be defined as any image that is created with the use of a computer- based processor or program. Because computers are widely used, both in image generating and in image processing, these images are pervasive- from billboard advertisements to film productions and photography."
Benjamin Morrell
"Benjamin Morrell, (July 5, 1795 – 1839) was an American sea captain, navigator and explorer."

It is able to sink into the sand by moving in a rocking motion. When it sinks into the sand it leaves its eyes and snout sticking out of the sand."
"The long history of separation from other continents has allowed plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Many of its animals came from Africa, because the island is closer to Africa than to India. Many of these endemic Malagasy animals have died out since the arrival of humans, particularly the megafauna."
"Despite this, and massive deforestation, Madagascar is still home to an incredible array of wildlife. Most of this is unique."
Environment.
"Madagascar is home to many species that were not known about until around 1679 when Dutch explorers went there. They do not even exist elsewhere in Africa. They only exist in Madagascar. In fact, most of the mammals living in Madagascar do not live anywhere else in the world."
"Many species in Madagascar are in danger because much of the forest has been cut down. Forests are cut down so the land can grow crops such as coffee, which is an important export crop for Madagascar."
Economy.
"Agriculture is a big part of the economy in Madagascar, including the growing of coffee and vanilla. Madagascar sells more vanilla than any other country in the world. Madagascar also makes money from tourism."
Provinces.
In 2004 Madagascar was divided into 22 regions. It used to be divided into 6 provinces.
Human history.
People have probably lived in Madagascar for at least 2000 years.
"France took over the city of Antananarivo in 1895, and added Madagascar as a colony two years later. Madagascar became independent from France, which meant it became its own country, on 26 June, 1960. Philibert Tsiranana became the first president of Madagascar (1960-72)."
Board game
"A board game is a game usually played with pieces on a board, or some area with marked spaces."
"Most board games use pieces that may be moved, placed, or traded depending on the rules of the game. These pieces may be money, chips, pawns, or other objects. Board games may often involve some random chance with dice or cards. There are many board games with a long history in some cultures. Examples of these games are chess, checkers, backgammon, parqués, and go. There are also a great number of popular board games that have been created more recently, in the past hundred years. Among these games are Scrabble and Monopoly."

Historically, Brighton forms the main part of the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation, with 474,485 inhabitants (2011 census). This is England's 12th largest conurbation, and the mostly densely populated area outside London."
History.
"From the 1730s, Brighton entered its second phase of development—one which brought a rapid improvement in its fortunes. The fad for bathing in seawater as a cure for illnesses was encouraged. From the 1760s it was a boarding point for boats travelling to France. Road transport to London was improved when the main road via Crawley was turnpiked in 1770. Spas and indoor baths were opened by physicians."
"From 1780, development of Georgian terraced houses started. The fishing village developed to the fashionable resort of Brighton. Growth of the town was encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later King George IV) after his first visit in 1783. He spent much of his leisure time in the town, and had the Royal Pavilion built during the early part of his Regency."
"The arrival of the London and Brighton Railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from London. Some major attractions such as the West Pier and the Brighton Palace Pier were built for the growing number of tourists. The population grew from around 7,000 in 1801 to more than 120,000 by 1901."
"In 1984, a Provisional Irish Republican Army bombing killed five people."
"Modern-day Brighton is a centre for education, sports, and recreation. It has two universities: University of Sussex and the University of Brighton. It also has 54 other schools."

Besides his operas he also wrote orchestral pieces for special occasions. He also wrote some songs for performance in the salon.
Meyerbeer was one of the richest men in Europe. This is why some people hated him.
Meyerbeer’s reputation after his death.
"Meyerbeer’s operas were very popular in the middle of the 19th century, but by the end of the century they had gone out of fashion. From 1933 to 1945 his music was banned in Germany by the Nazis because he was Jewish. Today there is some interest again, but nothing like the huge popularity he had in his lifetime."
Grand opera
"Grand Opera is a term which is used to describe an opera with continuous music. It is a kind of opera that was popular in the 19th-century. Grand operas are usually divided into four or five acts. There have large casts (many singers taking part) and large orchestras. There is a lot of scenery. The story is dramatic. It is usually a story about a hero from history. The term ""Grand Opera"" has often been used to describe the Paris Opéra from the late 1820s to around 1850, and sometimes to describe the Paris Opéra itself."

"""Die Feen"" was the first opera that Wagner finished. However, it was never performed during his lifetime. It has never become popular, although the overture is sometimes played. The music shows the influence of Carl Maria von Weber and other composers of the time. It also shows some musical ideas that Wagner was to develop later in his life in his famous operas. The fairy tale atmosphere in the story is also an idea that he uses in his later operas which deal with fantasy stories. The idea of being saved (redemption) is also an important idea that he used in later operas."
Rienzi
"Rienzi is an opera by Richard Wagner. Its full title is Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen (""Rienzi, the Last of the Tribunes""). It is one of the earliest operas Wagner wrote. There are five acts.

It was the first time Wagner had a success as an opera composer."
Story.
"The story of the opera is set in Rome and is based on the life of Cola di Rienzi (1313–1354), a medieval Italian populist figure who manages to trick the nobles and their followers. He helps the people to get power. At first he is very popular, but then he has to use force against the nobles, and the Church turns against him. In the end the ordinary people burn the Capitol where Rienzi and his friends are sheltering."
Chess tournament
A chess tournament is a competition between chess players. It can take one of these forms:
"Since the first international chess tournament in London, 1851, chess tournaments have become the standard form of chess competition among serious players. Currently, FIDE holds candidates tournaments every two years to determine challenger to the world champion."
"In 1851, Adolf Anderssen became first unofficial champion. In 1858, Paul Morphy beat him and became second unofficial champion. In 1871, Johannez Zukertort defeated Adolf Anderssen to become third unofficial chess champion. There are three unofficial world chess champions: Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy and Johannes Zukertort, stemming from first strong international tournament in London in 1851, won by Anderssen."
The Flying Dutchman
"Der fliegende Holländer (""The Flying Dutchman"") is an opera by Richard Wagner. Wagner wrote the libretto himself. The story comes from the legend of the ""Flying Dutchman"", which is about the captain of a ship. It is his fate that he has keep sailing the sea, without ever going on to land, until Judgment Day."
"The most important idea in the story as told by Wagner is redemption through love. It was a favourite idea of Wagner, who used it a lot in his later operas."
"Wagner conducted the first performance at the Semper Oper in Dresden, in 1843. It is an early opera of Wagner, but it shows his mature style. It is very different from the previous opera ""Rienzi"" which is still quite similar to operas that other composers were writing. In ""Der fliegende Holländer"" the drama is very important. Wagner uses a number of leitmotifs: musical ideas associated with particular characters and themes in the story. The leitmotifs are all introduced in the overture. We hear the famous leitmotif of the ocean and then those of the Dutchman and of Senta, the girl he falls in love with."
"Wagner originally wrote ""Der fliegende Holländer"" to be performed without any breaks (intermission). Sometimes it is performed like that today, but Wagner also made a version with three acts."

Hypothermia
"Hypothermia is a condition when a person is so cold that the body temperature drops below normal. Hypothermia is any body temperature lower than . Someone with hypothermia starts shivering and cannot stop. The person then becomes confused and acts strange. Their words don't make sense and they may be clumsy. Sometimes they become very tired. If someone gets hypothermia, wrap the person in blankets and take them to the hospital. If that's impossible, warm up the person slowly and give them a warm drink."
Mild.
"When hypothermia begins, a person feels cold, starts shivering and can't stop. The person cannot do complicated things with his or her hands. They are also unable to touch their thumb with their little finger, because their hand muscles don't work well."
"Mild hypothermia is sometimes used on purpose by doctors for treating some medical problems. It takes blood away from the skin, hands and feet, and puts it to the brain and important internal organs. This helps when the person is bleeding from cuts or other wounds, and also helps when the patient goes into cardiac arrest."
Moderate (Middle).
"The person begins shivering very strongly. Their large muscles do not work well. They move slowly and with difficulty, growing a little confused and walking unsteadily. The person becomes pale, and lips, ears, fingers, and toes might become blue. This is because the body is trying to keep the most important organs warm. The person might feel sick in their stomach and very tired, wanting to go to sleep, anywhere."
Severe.
"Body temperature drops even more, but the person usually stops shivering. They cannot talk clearly; they think slowly, and they cannot move their hands. Sometimes a person will feel suddenly warm, as if they are getting better, but this just means they are getting worse. They may take off warm clothes or lay down to go to sleep. If this continues, they cannot walk or answer questions. Their pulse becomes weaker, but the heart may beat faster. Finally, the person dies."
Rapids
"Rapids are found on rivers. Rapids are formed by one or more of the following: constriction, obstruction, gradient, and flow rate. For instance, when water is flowing swiftly over a rocky river bed, rapids can be formed. Rapids are typically found in or near the mountains, due to the element of gradient. Formally, the word ""rapids"" is always plural, (like ""scissors"" and ""trousers""), but is often used in the singular when speaking of a specific rapid or when it would be grammatically awkward; e.g., ""Sweet's Falls Rapids vs. Sweet's Falls Rapid). The word ""rapid"" means ""very fast."""
"Because of the splash made by the water going over rocks, rapids are also called ""whitewater"". Some people enjoying whitewater canoeing or whitewater rafting as a sport."

Both GameTrailers and IGN placed Miyamoto first on their lists for the ""Top Ten Game Creators"" and the ""Top 100 Game Creators of All Time""."
"He was made a Fellow of BAFTA at the British Academy Video Games Awards on March 19, 2010. In 2012, Miyamoto was the first interactive creator to be awarded the highest recognition in the Spanish-speaking world, the Prince of Asturias Award."
Personal Life.
"Miyamoto has a wife, Yasuko, and two children. In 2010, his son was 25 and working at an advertising agency. His daughter was 23 and studying zoology at the time. His children played video games in their youth, but he also made them go outside. Although he knows some English, he is not fluent and would rather speak in Japanese for interviews."
"Miyamoto usually does not sign autographs. He is worried that if he signs an autograph for one person, many other people will ask for autographs too. He also does not appear on Japanese television because he likes privacy. More foreign tourists than Japanese people recognize him."
"Miyamoto does not spend much time playing video games in his personal time. He likes playing the guitar, mandolin, and banjo. He likes bluegrass music. He has a Shetland Sheepdog named Pikku. The dog was why Miyamoto wanted to create ""Nintendogs"". He is also a semi-professional dog breeder. He has been quoted as saying, ""Video games are bad for you? That's what they said about rock and roll."""
"Miyamoto like to move the furniture in his house, even late at night. He also said that he has a hobby of guessing how long something is, then checking to see if he was correct. He carries a measuring tape with him everywhere. In December 2016, Miyamoto showed his hobby on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"". He also played the ""Super Mario Bros."" theme on guitar with The Roots during the same show."
Individual
Individual can be an adjective or a noun.
"As an adjective, a living thing that is individual is not in a group (by him/her/itself). An object that is individual is for only one person or thing (not shared by a group). Something that is individual can also be different from anyone else (unique)."
"As a noun, an individual is only one person or thing, not a group. An individual can also mean someone who is different from anyone else (one a kind)."
Truck
"A truck (or lorry in British English) is a motor vehicle used to transport goods. The word ""truck"" comes from the Greek word ""trochos"", which means ""wheel"". Most trucks use diesel fuel."
Sizes of trucks.
Light trucks.
"""Light trucks"" are trucks the size of cars. They are used by individuals and also companies. In the United States, a truck is a light truck if it weighs less than 6,300 kg (13,000 lb). Light trucks are only a little heavier than vans or pickup trucks, but require a special driver's license."
Medium trucks.
"""Medium trucks"" are heavier than light trucks but lighter than heavy trucks. In the United States, a truck is a medium truck if it weighs between 6,300 kg (13,000 lb) and 15,000 kg (33,000 lb). Trucks that are used for local delivery and public service (dump trucks, garbage trucks) are normally around this size. Medium trucks have usually two axles: one at front and one at rear. The rear wheels may be coupled (that is: two wheels hitched together) to enable heavier load, but they may also be single."
Heavy trucks.
"""Heavy trucks"" are the heaviest trucks that are allowed on the road. In the U.K. they are known as ""lorries"". Usually heavy trucks have three axles: one at front and two at rear, and the rear axles have coupled wheels to enable heavy loads. Often heavy trucks pull trailers. They can be either ""full trailers"" which have both front and rear axles or boggies and their own brakes, and are connected to the towing truck with a towbar, or ""semi-trailers"", which are attached to a special kind of a truck called ""tractor unit"" with a turntable coupling (""fifth wheel""). A semi-trailer is a kind of trailer which has wheels only in the back and the front rides on the back of the tractor unit. The tractor unit has an engine and the semi-trailer does not. Driving a heavy truck requires a professional driver's license. Truck drivers are called ""truckers""."
"The laws of various countries say what kind of vehicle combinations are allowed. A semi-trailer can be converted into a full trailer with using a ""dolly"". A dolly is a small trailer which has only a bogie (= set of wheels), fifth wheel coupling for the semi-trailer and a towbar. Using a dolly, the semi-trailer can now be hitched to an ordinary cargo-carrying truck and does not need a tractor unit."
A heavy truck-trailer combination is often called a big rig or eighteen-wheeler.
"The largest heavy trucks are the Australian ""road trains"" which may have up to four semi-trailers coupled to a tractor in a train-like fashion and may carry up to 200 tonnes of cargo."
Body types.
"Box trucks or Dry vans (""tilts"" in the UK) have walls and a roof, making a closed cargo room. The rear has doors. Some have a side door."
"Concrete mixers have a turning drum on back. Turning it one way mixes the concrete. Turning it the other way pushes the concrete out. The concrete goes down ""chutes"" (like large pipes with an open top). On most trucks the concrete comes out the back. Some new types have the concrete goes over the cab and down chutes in the front. Concrete is very heavy and hard to mix. Concrete mixers have to be very heavy duty."
Some people get strep throat more often than others. Removing the tonsils is one way to stop these people from getting strep throat. Getting strep throat three or more times in one year may be a good reason to remove the tonsils. Waiting is also appropriate.
Treatment.
"Strep throat usually lasts a few days without treatment. Treatment with antibiotics will usually make the symptoms go away 16 hours quicker. The main reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce the risk of getting a more serious illness. For example, a heart disease known as rheumatic fever or a collection of pus in the throat known as retropharyngeal abscess. Antibiotics work well if given within 9 days of the start of symptoms."
Pain medication.
"Medicine to lessen pain can help with the pain caused by strep throat. These usually include NSAIDs or paracetamol which is also known as acetaminophen. Steroids are also useful, as is viscous lidocaine. Aspirin may be used in adults. It is not good to give aspirin to children because it makes them more likely to get Reye's syndrome."
Antibiotic medicine.
"Penicillin V is the most common antibiotic used in the United States for strep throat. It is popular because it is safe, works well and does not cost much money. Amoxicillin is usually used in Europe. In India, it is more likely for people to get rheumatic fever. Because of this, an injected medicine called benzathine penicillin G is the usual treatment. The antibiotics lower the average length of symptoms. The average length is three to five days. Antibiotics lowers this by about one day. These medicines also reduce the spread of the illness. The medicines are used mostly to try to reduce rare complications. These include rheumatic fever, rashes, or infections. The good effects of antibiotics should be balanced by the possible side effects. Antibiotic treatment may not need to be given to healthy adults who have bad reactions to medication. Antibiotics are used for strep throat more often than would be expected from how serious it is and the speed at which it spreads. The medicine erythromycin (and other medicines, called macrolides) should be used for people who have bad allergies to penicillin. Cephalosporins can be used in people with lesser allergies. Streptococcal infections might also lead to swelling of the kidneys (acute glomerulonephritis). Antibiotics do not reduce the chance of this condition."
Outlook.
"The symptoms of strep throat usually get better, with or without treatment, in about three to five days. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the risk of worse illnesses. They also make it harder to spread the illness. Children may return to school 24 hours after first taking antibiotics."
These very bad problems might be caused by strep throat:
Likelihood.
Strep throat is included in the broader category of sore throat or pharyngitis. About 11 million people get sore throats in the United states each year. Most cases of sore throat are caused by viruses. The bacteria group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus causes 15 to 30 percent of sore throats in children. It causes 5 to 20 percent of sore throats in adults. Cases usually happen in late winter and early spring.

Angel Stadium of Anaheim
"Angel Stadium of Anaheim is a baseball park in Anaheim, California. It is the home field of the Los Angeles Angels. It opened in 1966. It has had several names over the years. It began as Anaheim Stadium."
Guaranteed Rate Field
"Guaranteed Rate Field is a baseball park in Chicago, Illinois. It is the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Chicago White Sox. It opened in 1991, replacing historic Comiskey Park. Before U.S. Cellular, a wireless telephone carrier, bought naming rights in 2003, with the stadium then being renamed U.S. Cellular Field, the ballpark was known as ""New Comiskey Park"" or just ""Comiskey Park"", in honor of the old park."
"The stadium name lost most of its value in Chicago after the company sold its local network to Sprint in 2012. During the 2016 MLB season, the White Sox made a new deal with Chicago-based mortgage lender Guaranteed Rate. The stadium name officially changed on November 1 of that year."
Kauffman Stadium
"The Kauffman Stadium is a baseball park in Kansas City, Missouri. The Kansas City Royals play there."

Before LoanDepot Park opened in 2012, the team, then known as the Florida Marlins, played home games at the venue now known as Hard Rock Stadium. LoanDepot Park is located on the former site of the Orange Bowl Stadium."
"On March 31, 2021, the Miami Marlins announced that the team had sold naming rights to Marlins Park to LoanDepot. The name of the baseball park was changed to LoanDepot Park."
Transport.
"Abergavenny railway station is a train station on the Welsh Marches line. Passengers at the station can board direct trains to places such as Hereford, Shrewsbury, Manchester, Chester, Wrexham, Holyhead, Cardiff, Swansea and Carmarthen."

From 2015 to 2021, he appeared as Johnny Connor in the long-running ITV soap opera ""Coronation Street""."
Overlord (novel series)
"is a Japanese light novel series. It was written by Kugane Maruyama and the picture in the series are drawn by so-bin. Sixteen volumes of this light novel have been published since July 30, 2012. The author has said that he has planned for 18 novels. There is a manga based on this light novel by Satoshi Ōshio. The art in the manga is by Hugin Miyama. It started from November 26, 2014 in Kadokawa Shoten's manga magazine ""Comp Ace""."
"There is an anime television series based on this light novel by Madhouse. It has 3 seasons with 13 episodes each. The first season aired from July 7 to September 29, 2015. The second season ran from January 9 to April 3, 2018 and the third season from July 10, 2018 to October 2, 2018. The scriptwriter for the anime series said that the fourth season of the series was ""extremely likely"" to be produced."
Faye Brookes
"Faye Alicia Brookes (born 3 September 1987) is an English actress. She is known for portraying the role of Kate Connor in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street, a role he has playing since 2015 to 2019."
"Brookes was born in Manchester, Greater Manchester, England."
Draize test
"The Draize test is a test, to see if a substance is toxic. John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines first used the test in 1944. The test was first used for cosmetics, but later for other substances as well. To see if a substance is toxic, it is applied to the skin or the eye of an animal, for a given time. After the time, the substance is washed out and the effects are recorded. Very often, small animals, such as rabbits were used. After the test, the animals are observed for up to 14 days. If the test does irreversible damage to the skin or the eye, the animal is killed after the test. Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a ""wash out"" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site."
"The tests are controversial. They are seem as cruel and unscientific because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that ""to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement [for] ... the Draize test"". Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects ""in vitro"" are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out."
Other tests have been developed which can replace the Draize test for many applications: First there is a test that uses chicken eggs. Another test uses Spanish slugs.
Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane
"The Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane, or hen's egg test is a test that can be used to test the toxicity of substances. It is also often used to test vaccines. It is a CAM Assay. The product ot be tested is applied to a special membrane. Such tests were first used because chicken eggs were easily available. As the respective membrane does not contain any nerve cells, it is likely that the developing bird embryo does not feel pein during the test. These tests are not considered to be animal testing."
Social choice theory
"Social choice theory, which is also called theory of collective choice, is a theory that looks at how a group of people reach a decision. Usually this is done by combining and aggregating the opinion of each member of the group. A classic problem of social choice theory is that of holding an election or a popular vote."
Year of the Three Emperors
"The Year of the Three Emperors, or the Year of the Three Kaisers, () refers to the year 1888 during the German Empire in German history. The year is important because two German Emperors, or Kaisers, died. This meant that there were three emperors in a year.. The three emperors who ruled Germany during this year were Wilhelm I, Frederick III and Wilhelm II. The mnemonic “""drei Achten, drei Kaiser""” (English: ""three eights, three emperors"") is still used today in Germany to remember which year it was."
"While the movie is widely said to be a classic comedy today, critical reaction was mixed when the movie was first released."
Awards and honors.
"In the scene where Lamarr talks to his band of bad guys, he says, ""You men are only risking your lives, while I am risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor!"" Harvey Korman did not, in fact, get an Oscar nomination. The movie did receive three other Academy Awards nominations in 1974: Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Madeline Kahn, Best Film Editing, and Best Music, Original Song. The movie also earned two BAFTA awards nominations, for Best Newcomer (Cleavon Little) and Best Screenplay."
"The movie won the Writers Guild of America Award for ""Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen"" for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger."
"In 2006, ""Blazing Saddles"" was chosen by the Library of Congress for the National Film Registry."
Alexander Rybak
"Alexander Rybak (13 May 1986) is a Belarusian-Norwegian singer, composer and violinist. He was born in Minsk, Belarusian SSR. He moved to Norway when he was four. He is best known for winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 with the song ""Fairytale"" for Norway. Rybak went to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo to perform his winning entry from the previous year."
Pika
"A pika is a small mammal related to the hare and the rabbit (lagomorph). Pikas are also known as rock rabbits or coneys. Pikas have short limbs, a round body, an even coat of fur, round ears, and no external tail."
"There are 37 different species of pika. Most pikas live in colder climates, on rocky mountain slopes. Pikas need cold temperatures to live, and can die if exposed to temperatures above . They live in Asia, North America and parts of Eastern Europe. They are active during the day or twilight. Pikas do not hibernate. Because they do not hibernate, during the summer they gather food for winter. They collect hay, which they pile up to dry. They sometimes steal hay from each other. This often results in disputes. Predators, like ferrets, and large birds often use these disputes to catch pikas."
"Pikas are herbivores and eat many kinds of plants, such as grasses, sedges, moss, and lichens."
Pikas in Eurasia often live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Some species are territorial. Pikas in North America are asocial outside of breeding season.
Pikachu from Pokemon is based off this animal.
Two-source hypothesis
"The Two-source hypothesis is a hypothesis that was made in the 19th century. It tries to explain what is called the synoptic problem in Christian theology. This problem is that certain parts of the gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke have texts that are very similar. The hypothesis claims that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were written based on the gospel of Mark, and lost source text, called Q. The Q is for German ""Quelle"", and means source. The lost document was likely a collection of Jesus' sayings, very probably written in Ancient Greek. The hypothesis is widely accepted among Christian scholars."
Problems.
There are two major problems with this hypothesis:
Favicon
A favicon is small image (known as an icon) that is used to identify a website or webpage.
"This type of icon (also known as a favorite icon or favorites icon) is usually a square image that is only 16 pixels in height and 16 pixels in width. However, modern browsers, especially those installed on smartphones, can display bigger favicons that are 32 pixels or 64 pixels in size. And when a favicon is included in a webpage it can be seen next to a browser's address bar, inside a browser's tab or in the browser's Favorites' or Bookmarks' list."
Henry Rollins
"Henry Rollins (born February 13, 1961 in Washington D.C.) is an American singer, writer and actor. After a few wild years in the punk rock band Black Flag, he started his own metal band, the Rollins Band. Rollins is now a solo artist. He often tours in many countries performing spoken-word concerts."
Tay-Sachs disease
Tay-Sachs disease (also called Tray-Sachs syndrome) is a disease that causes problems with the metabolism of fat. Tay-Sachs is caused by a lack of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A.
"Tay-Sachs is a genetic disease. It happens when Chromosome 15 has a genetic problem. The problem is caused by a defective HEXA gene. It is recessive, which means both parents must give the baby the defective gene for the baby to have Tay-Sachs. One in every twenty seven Jewish American has one defective gene and can give Tay-Sachs the defective gene to their child. The disease is very rare. It is most common in Jewish families. There is a blood test to see if a person has the Tay Sachs gene. This blood test has helped reduce the number of babies born with Tay-Sachs. In the 1800’s, there were 60 new cases and in the 21st century there were 5."
"Infants with the Tay-Sachs gene from both parents usually die of pneumonia or other infections during their first four years of life. Some symptoms include: lack of energy, loss of vision and motor skills (paralyzation), and seizures. Tay–Sachs disease is usually first noticed in infants around six months old. They show an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimulus. This is called the ""startle response"". The child may also be listlessness or have muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are based on the age when the neurological symptoms began. There is no known treatment for this disease."
"The season lasts 18 weeks. Each team plays 17 games and has one week off. This week of rest is called a ""bye week""."
NFL playoffs.
"At the end of the regular season, the winners of each division and the next three best teams in each conference play in a tournament. The NFC's champion and The AFC's champion play the NFL's final game, the Super Bowl. The event is often treated as a National holiday as many stores close for the event. The day of the event is commonly known nationwide as Super Bowl Sunday."

Notes
The Ugly Duckling
"""The Ugly Duckling"" () is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. Andersen lavished great care on this story, spending a year perfecting it. It was first published in 1844 with ""The Angel"", ""The Sweethearts"", and ""The Nightingale"" in ""New Fairy Tales"". The critics liked these stories. Andersen considered the story ""a reflection of my own life."" The moral of the tale: ""it does not matter if you were born in a duck yard if you have lain in a swan's egg."" The tale has been adapted to various media such as animated movies."
Story.
"A mother duck hatches six pretty little ducklings. A seventh bird is hatched. He is homely. The other ducks abuse him. He runs away. He is given a home by an old woman. Her cat and hen do not like him. He runs away again. Winter comes and a kind farmer gives him a home. The little bird almost dies. Spring comes. The ""ugly duckling"" has grown into a beautiful swan. The other swans welcome him as their own. They bow to him. He is happy for the first time in his life."
General relativity
"General relativity is a theory of space and time. The theory was published by Albert Einstein in 1915. The central idea of general relativity is that space and time are two aspects of spacetime. Spacetime is curved when there is matter, energy, and momentum resulting in what we perceive as gravity. The links between these forces are shown in the Einstein field equations. In general relativity, gravity has no force as Newton put forward. According to Einstein it is a curvature that warps not only space, but also time. (Time dilation)"
Idea.
"A central idea in general relativity is the ""principle of equivalence."" An example is that two people, one in an elevator sitting on the surface of the earth, and the other in an elevator in outer space but accelerating upwards at the speed of 9.8 m/s2 (every second the object picks up speed of 9.8 m/s), will each observe the same behavior of an object they drop from their hands. The object will accelerate to the floor at 9.8 m/s2 in either case, making it impossible for either to distinguish whether or not they are at rest in a gravitational field or accelerating upward creating the same effect as gravity would on Earth. Other versions of this type of ""thought experiment"" were used to show that light would curve in an accelerating frame of reference (perspective). There are several forms of the equivalence principle. These include: Newton's equivalence principle, the weak equivalence principle, the gravitational weak equivalence principle, Einstein's equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle."
"The Sun can be seen as this kind of valley in spacetime, and one of the other objects in the valley (i.e, spacetime) is the Earth. The Earth does not roll directly towards the Sun (or ball) because it is moving too fast. The force pulling the Earth towards the sun is about the same as a second force. This second force is called the centrifugal force. The centrifugal force exists because the Earth moves sideways. This sideways motion makes the distance between the Earth and Sun increase. Since the Earth is being pulled towards the sun and moving away at the same time, it stays at about the same distance. This is also how the Moon orbits the earth. In this second case, Earth is the ball and the Moon is the object. However, this valley example to demonstrate Gravity is insufficient because spacetime fabric is actually Four Dimensional, whereas valley's example implies two dimensional spacetime. Sun and other objects with mass curves four dimensional spacetime fabric. Valley example is just analogy and not 100% reality."
Predictions.
General relativity has predicted many things which were later seen. These include:
Rutland
"Rutland is the smallest county of England. It is surrounded by the counties of Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire."
The main towns of Rutland are Oakham and Uppingham.
"In the mid-1970s, it was the inspiration for Eric Idle's TV show, Rutland Weekend Television."
Adlai Stevenson I
"Adlai Ewing Stevenson (October 23, 1835 – June 14, 1914) was an American politician. He was vice president of the United States under Grover Cleveland, and ran for President and several other political offices, but lost. He was also first assistant Postmaster General and a member of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois, as well. His grandson of the same name also was a notable politician and writer. Another grandson, McLean Stevenson was an actor. His other grandson was Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III."
"Toledo, Ohio"
"Toledo is a city in Ohio, USA. It was named after Toledo, Spain. It is a large industrial city, and has many factories that make things like car parts and glass. In 1835 and 1836, Ohio and Michigan both claimed to own the city and surrounding territory. Michigan gave up its claim and got the Upper Peninsula in exchange. Toledo is about an hour from Detroit, Michigan. The main highways in and out of Toledo are Interstate 75, Interstate 90, and U.S. 24 (Detroit Boulevard, Telegraph Road). It is the 59th largest city in the United States."
Toledo's manufacturing industry concentrates on automobiles and glass.
"Toledo has a humid continental climate (""Dfa"" in the Köppen climate classification)."
"This Murrinh-patha mythology is based on a view of life that believes life is ""...a joyous thing with maggots at its centre."". Life is good and caring, but during life's journey, there are many painful sufferings that each person must come to understand and live through as he grows. This is the message being told within the Murrinh-patha myths. It is this philosophy that gives Murrinh-patha people reason and meaning in life."
"The following Murrinh-patha myth, for example, is performed in Murrinh-patha ceremonies to initiate young men into adulthood."
"""A woman, ""Mutjinga"" (the 'Old Woman'), was in charge of young children, but instead of watching out for them during their parents' absence, she swallowed them and tried to escape as a giant snake. The people followed her, spearing her and removing the undigested children from the body."""
"Within the myth and in its performance, young children must first be swallowed by an ancestral being who changes into a giant snake. The children are then vomited up before being accepted as young adults with all the rights and benefits of young adults."
Pintupi people.
"The Pintupi peoples from Australia's Gibson Desert region have a mostly 'mythic' form of understanding their identity, All events happen and are explained by the social structures and rules told of, sung about, and performed within their superhuman mythology. That is, the structures of society come from the myths, not from their own political actions, decisions or influences of local individuals."
"""The Dreaming.. provides a moral authority lying outside the individual will and outside human creation.. although the Dreaming as an ordering of the cosmos is presumably a product of historical events, such an origin is denied."""
"""Current action is not understood as the result of human alliances, creations, and choices, but is seen as imposed by an embracing, cosmic order."""
"Within this Pintupi view of the world, three long geographical tracks of named places control and guide society. They are interrelated strings of important places named and created by mythic characters on their way through the Pintupi desert region during the Dreaming. It is a complex mythology of stories, songs and ceremonies known to the Pintupi as ""Tingarri"". It is most completely told and performed by Pintupi peoples at larger gatherings within Pintupi country."
Steve Bisciotti
"Steve Bisciotti (born April 10, 1960 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) is a Baltimore businessman. In 2004, he became the majority owner of the Baltimore Ravens. He bought the team in 2004 from previous owner Art Modell. He owns a business that works with technology and computers."
34th G8 summit
"The 34th G8 summit was a meeting in 2008 for the leaders of Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States."
"This meeting of the Group of Eight (G8) was the 34th meeting in a series which began in 1976. The G8 and the summit are part of a ""consultative process and not an international organization""."
"The meeting took place in Japan at on the northern island of Hokkaidō. The international group of leaders met from July 7–9, 2008."
Core participants.
"The participants were the ""core members"" of the group:"
Invited leaders.
A small others were invited to join some of the discussions.
G8+5.
The G8 plus the five other nations were known as G8+5.
Heads of international organizations.
Leaders of some organizations were invited to be part of some of the discussions.
Carol Banawa
"Carol Banawa (born March 4, 1981) is a Filipino singer. Her album ""Carol"" had a hit and was certified gold. Her three other albums, ""Carol: Repackaged"", ""Transition"", and ""Follow Your Heart"" was certified platinum. Her album, ""My Music, My Life"" was released in 2010, under Black Bird Records. She was also a part of Star Magic Batch 4 alumni."
"In 2011, she won in ASAP Pop Viewers Choice 2011 for ""POP MOVIE THEMESONG"" after singing the official theme song of the Filipino movie ""Till My Heartaches End""."
She is currently signed to ASAP Records.
26th G8 summit
Mugello is a landscape in northern Italy. Mugello is north of Florence. The Santerno River's valley is nearby. The two valleys are separated by the Futa Pass (a path or way to cross over the mountain between those two valleys).
"In ancient times it was on the border between the area settled by the Ligurians (also called the Magelli tribe), the Etruscans and the Gauls. The Roman colonization left very few signs behind because the Mugello was mostly an agricultural area. In the Middle Ages it was home to many castles. Later on, Mugello was taken over by the Republic of Florence. Several families of the city built villas (large houses) there. They were similar to ones built by the Medici royal family."
Friar
"Friars are special monks that do a service to a community and that lead a simple life, rather than living like ascets in a monastery."
Orders.
"There are two classes of orders known as friars, or mendicant orders: the four ""great orders"" and the so-called ""lesser orders""."
Four great orders.
"The four great orders were mentioned by the Second Council of Lyons (1274), and are:"
Lesser orders.
The lesser orders are:
Carmelites
"The Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel; ) is a Roman Catholic religious order. It was probably founded in the 12th century on Mount Carmel, from which the order receives its name. Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived. The order of Carmelite nuns was made official in 1452."
Samael
"Samael () (also Sammael and Şamil) is an archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic beliefs and stories, as well as Christian tradition and demonology. There are also other religions that believe in stories of Samael. It is said that he was the guardian angel of Esau and a patron of the sinful empire of Rome."
"Samael is often accorded with Satan because he often has grim and destructive duties. He is often considered a fallen angel, like Satan and the chief of the evil spirits. One of Samael's roles in Jewish beliefs is that of the Angel of Death. In this belief, he is a fallen angel but remains one of the Lord's servants. As a good angel, Samael supposedly lives in the seventh heaven, although he is said to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven."
Powers.
"The website Catholic.org says Samael is a ""Power"", which means he is the chief of many warrior angels."
"Powers are warrior angels against evil, who defend the world and people. They fight against evil spirits who attempt to bring chaos through human beings. The chief is said to be either Samael or Camael, both angels of darkness."
In Judaism and Christianity.
"In Jewish beliefs, Sammael is said to be the Angel of Death, the ruler of the Fifth Heaven, and one of the seven regents of the world served by two million angels; he resides in the Seventh Heaven. ""Yalkut I, 110"" of the Talmud says Samael is Esau's guardian angel. In ""Sotah 10b"", Samael is Esau's guardian angel."
"In the ""Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer"", he is said to be the one who tempted Eve, then seduced and impregnated her with Cain. Some sources identify Gadreel as the angel that seduced Eve; although, other Hebrew scholars say that it was Samael who tempted Eve as the Serpent."
"Samael is also sometimes said to be the angel who wrestled with Jacob, and also the angel who held back the arm of Abraham as he was about to sacrifice his son."
"According to ""The Ascension of Moses"" (Chapter IV - Aggadah - The Legend of The Jews - By Louis Ginzberg) Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:"
"""In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, ""Anger,"" and Hemah, ""Wrath,"" whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, ""Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,"" and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. ""This one,"" said Metatron, addressing Moses, ""is Samael, who takes the soul away from man."" ""Whither goes he now?"" asked Moses, and Metatron replied, ""To fetch the soul of Job the pious."" Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, ""O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel."""
"In ""The Holy Kabbalah"" (Arthur Edward Waite, 255), Samael is described as the ""severity of God"", and is listed as fifth of the archangels of the world of Briah. Samael is said to have married Lilith after she left Adam. According to Zoharistic cabala, Samael was also mated with Eisheth Zenunim, Na'amah, and Agrat Bat Mahlat - all angels of prostitution."
"Samael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael, an archangel of God, whose name means ""He who sees God""."
Popular culture.
Samael is shown as a character in the Megami Tensei video game series. The archangel is shown in the games as a blood-red serpent. He is a member of the Vile Clan and is a persona of the Death Arcana.
"In the Silent Hill video games, Samael is the name of one of the town's gods. He is shown as an anthropomorphic goat."
Pertussis
"Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a disease that affects about 300,000 people in the US every year, out of 30–50 million cases per year. There is a vaccine that can prevent it, so most cases of it are in places where people cannot afford, cannot get, or refuse to get the vaccine. However, this vaccine does not work forever. The disease lasts about 6 weeks, and symptoms include vomiting, violent coughing, and other flu-like symptoms. It is called whooping cough for the sound an infected person makes when they cough."
"The disease usually infects younger people, as they are more prone to diseases."
Deity
"A deity is thought to be a powerful spirit that controls events and the nature of things. Deities are also called gods. A female god is often called a goddess. The adjective of deity is ‘divine’. This word comes from the Latin ""deus"" (female: ""dea"")."
"Different religions believe in different deities. Since there are many religions in the world there are many different ideas about how many deities there are, what they are, and what they can do. Followers of many ancient religions and some modern religions believe in many deities, which is called polytheism."
"The two largest religions on earth, Christianity and Islam, believe in only one God, which is called monotheism. Deism is the belief that a deity exists, but that the deity does not very often change or never changes things in the universe. Pantheism is the belief that the universe is the deity, while atheism is the belief that there are no deities."
"In most religions, believers think deities are immortal (cannot die), and have powers far beyond human powers."
Examples.
Some of the deities of different religions are:
Odin
"Odin (Old Norse: ""Óðinn"") is the god of wisdom, poetry, death, divination, and magic in Norse mythology. Son of Borr and the giantess (jötunn) Bestla, Odin is the chief of the Æsir and king of Asgard. He is married to the goddess Frigg, and is father to the gods Thor, Baldr, Höðr, Víðarr, and Váli."
"Known as the All-Father, Odin is often accompanied by two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, along with the wolves Geri and Freki; the god rides into battle atop an eight-legged steed, Sleipnir, and wields the mighty spear Gungnir, which was fashioned for him by the dwarves known as the Sons of Ivaldi and is said to never miss its target."
"A defining feature of Odin is his being one-eyed, a result of him having sacrificed an eye to drink from the Well of Urðr, which granted him an incomprehensible amount of knowledge of the universe. Odin himself often receives counsel from the severed head of the being Mímir, which recites secret knowledge to him. Half of the souls of those slain in battle will be guided by the Valkyries, battle maidens, to Valhalla, Odin's enormous and majestic hall: the other half go to Fólkvangr, Freyja's realm. Odin was known in Old English as Wōden, in Old Saxon as Wōdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wōtan, all of which stem from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *""wōđanaz""."
"The modern English weekday name Wednesday bears the god’s name. (from Old English ""Wōdnesdæg"", “Wōden’s day”)."
Family.
"Odin is the son of Borr and the jötunn Bestla. He is married to the goddess Frigg, by whom he is the father of the twin gods Baldr and Höðr. With the giantesses Gríðr and Rindr, Odin has two other sons named Víðarr and Váli. His eldest son is Thor, god of thunder, born to him by Jörð, the personification of the Earth."
Qazi Muhammad
"Qazi Muhammad (1893-1947) was the Nationalist and Religious Kurdish leader and the Head of Republic of Mahabad (Republic of Kurdistan), the second modern Kurdish state in the Middle East (after Republic of Ararat). He acted as the president of the Russian backed Republic of Mahabad, in Kurdistan of Iran (Eastern Kurdistan) in 1946. He was also the founder of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran. A year later, the Kurdish national movement (Komeley Jiyanewey Kurd) that he helped organize was crushed by Iran's central government. The Iranian military court sentenced him to death, and he was hanged in Chuwarchira Square in the center of city of Mahabad at March 30 1947. Mustafa Barzani, the father of nationalist Kurdish movement in Iraqi Kurdistan (Southern Kurdistan), was the defence minister in his cabinet. One of his sons Ali Qazi is today an active member in the Kurdish movement."
Brine
"Brine is water that has more than 5% salt in it. It is used for preserving food. For this it is much like vinegar or sugar. Brine is also used to transport heat. Adding salt to water lowers the freezing point of the water. The solubility of salt in water depends on temperature. At 15.5°C, a saturated solution of brine can hold 26.4 % salt by weight. At 0°C, it can hold 23.3% salt."
"Brines also have some pharmaceutical properties, which can be used to treat people, especially those with diseases of the skin, allergies and common colds."
Aladdin
"Aladdin is a fictional person from the story ""Aladdin and the Enchanted Lamp"", which is part of the ""Book of One Thousand and One Nights""."
Story.
"The young man Aladdin is told by a sorcerer (magician), who is pretending to be his uncle, to get him an oil lamp from a cave. Aladdin gets the lamp, but the sorcerer tries to trick him. So, Aladdin keeps the lamp for himself. Aladdin learns that inside the lamp there is a djinn. The djinn can fulfill every wish of the lamp's owner. With the djinn's help, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries a princess."
Jnana yoga
"In Hinduism, Jnana Yoga is the yoga or practice of knowledge. Jyâna in Sanskrit means ""knowledge""."
"In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says that jyâna consists of properly understanding ""kshetra"" (the field of activity—that is, the body) and ""kshetra-jna"" (the knower of the body—that is, the soul). Krishna emphasizes one must understand the difference between these two. ""Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal."""
Atharva Veda
"The Atharva Veda is the fourth Veda, one of the Hindu scriptures. There are a number of upanishads in this veda. Ganapathy, Narayana, Devi, Atharva Siropanishaths are part of atharv veda. Bhavanopanisath is also in atharva veda. Sankaracharya established joshimath in kedarnath one of the four popal centres of Hinduism to flourish atharva veda."

Uriah Heep
Uriah Heep are an English hard rock band. They formed in December 1969.
E-book
"An electronic book (also called an e-book, ebook or digital book) is a book in digital form. E-books can be read on computers or other electronic devices such as e-book readers. E-book readers, such as the Amazon Kindle, the Kobo eReader and the are devices which are dedicated to showing e-books."
History.
"The first e-book might have been the Index Thonisticus, prepared by Roberto Busa in the late 1940s. However, this is sometimes not called an ebook because the digital text was (at least at first) meant to develop an index and concordance, rather than as a published edition in its own rights."
"Despite the extensive earlier history, it is commonly reported that the inventor of the e-book is Michael S. Hart. In 1971, Hart was given extensive computer time by the operators of the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the University of Illinois. Seeking a worthy use of this resource, he created his first electronic document by typing the United States Declaration of Independence into a computer."
"One early e-book was the desktop prototype for a proposed notebook computer, the Dynabook, in the 1970s at PARC: a general-purpose portable personal computer capable of displaying books for reading."
"In 1992, Sony launched the Data Discman, an electronic book reader that could read e-books that were stored on CDs. One of the electronic publications that could be played on the Data Discman was called The Library of the Future."
"Early e-books were generally written for specialty areas and a limited audience, meant to be read only by small and devoted interest groups. The scope of the subject matter of these e-books included technical manuals for hardware, manufacturing techniques and other subjects. In the 1990s, the general availability of the Internet made transferring electronic files much easier, including e-books."
"The current eBook standard is the file. There are other proprietary formats like .MOBI, AZW, IBA and PDF."
Church–Turing thesis
"The Church-Turing thesis (also known as Church's thesis, Church's conjecture and Turing's thesis) is a statement about computers. It says that a very simple kind of computer now named a “Turing machine” is able to compute all computable functions. The Church-Turing thesis is linked to Gödel's incompleteness theorems."
"When a programming language is able to do what a Turing machine can do, that language is called Turing complete. If a problem is solvable in one such language, then it is solvable in all of those."
London Borough of Brent
The London Borough of Brent is a London borough in north west London and is part of Greater London.
Vincent van Gogh
"Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter. His work had a great influence on modern art because of its striking colours and emotional power. He suffered from delusions and fits of mental illness. When he was 37, he died by committing suicide."
"When he was a young man, Van Gogh worked for a company of art dealers. He traveled between The Hague, London and Paris. After that, he taught in England. He then wanted to become a pastor and spread the Gospel, and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining place in Belgium. He began drawing the people there, and in 1885, he painted his first important work, ""The Potato Eaters"". He usually painted in dark colors at this time. In March 1886, he moved to Paris and found out about the French impressionists. Later, he moved to the south of France, and the colors in his art became brighter. His special style of art was developed and later fully grown during the time he stayed in Arles in 1888."
Early life.
"He was born Vincent Willem van Gogh on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands. His father, Theodorus van Gogh, was a pastor. His mother, Anna Cornelia Carbentus, was an artist. Van Gogh was brought up in a religious and cultured family. He was very emotional and he did not have a great deal of self-confidence. He was also a replacement child. He was born a year after the death of his brother, also named Vincent. He even had the same birthday. Living at the church rectory Vincent walked past the grave of his dead brother every day. There has been speculation that van Gogh suffered later psychological trauma as a result, but this cannot be proved."
Career.
"Between 1860 and 1880, when he finally decided to become an artist, van Gogh had two sad romances. He also had worked unsuccessfully in a bookstore, as an art salesman, and a preacher. He remained in Belgium, where he had preached, to study art. The works of his early Dutch period are sad, sharp, and one of the most famous pictures from here is ""The Potato Eaters"", painted in 1885. In that year, van Gogh went to Antwerp where he found the works of famous artists and bought a lot of Japanese prints."
"In 1886 he went to Paris to join his brother Theo, who was the manager of Goupil's gallery. In Paris, van Gogh studied with Cormon. He also met Pissarro, Monet, and Gauguin. This helped the colors of his paintings lighten and be painted in short strokes from the paintbrush. His nervous temper made him a difficult companion and night-long discussions combined with painting all day made him very unhealthy. He decided to go south to Arles where he hoped his friends would join him and help found a school of art. Gauguin did join him, but it did not help. Near the end of 1888, Gauguin left Arles. Van Gogh followed him with an open razor, but was stopped by Gauguin. Instead, he cut his own ear lobe off. After that, van Gogh began to get fits of madness and was sent to the asylum in Saint-Remy for medical treatment. He painted over 1,000 portraits."
Death.
"In May 1890, he regained his health and went to live in Auvers-sur-Oise. However, two months later on 27 July, he shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died two days later, with Theo at his side. Theo reported his last words as ""La tristesse durera toujours"", which meant, ""The sadness will last forever"" in French."
Legacy.
"During his brief career he had only sold one painting. After his death, Van Gogh's finest works were all sold in less than three years. His mother threw away a lot of his paintings during his life and even after his death. But she lived long enough to see him become a world famous painter. He was not well known when he was alive, and most people did not appreciate his art. But he became very famous after his death. Today, many people consider him to be one of the greatest painters in history and an important influence on modern art. Van Gogh did not begin painting until he was almost 30. Most of his famous works were done in his last two years. He made more than 2,000 artworks, with 900 paintings and 1,100 drawings and sketches. Today, many of his pieces portraits, landscapes and sunflowers are some of the most famous and costly works of art in the world."
Rainbow
"A rainbow is an arc of colour in the sky that can be seen when the sun shines through falling rain. The pattern of colours, called a spectrum, starts with red on the outside and changes through orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet on the inside. Sometimes a second, larger, dimmer rainbow is seen."
"A rainbow is created when white light is bent (refracted) while entering a droplet of water, split into separate colours, and reflected back. A rainbow is actually round like a circle. On the ground, the bottom part is hidden, but in the sky, like from a flying airplane, it can be seen as a circle around the point opposite the Sun."
"Rainbows often appear after storms, and are popular symbols for peace in many cultures."
Cause.
The rainbow effect can be seen when there are water drops in the air and the sun is giving light at the back of the observer at a low distance up or angle.
Rainbows always appear opposite the Sun: they form circles around the shadow of your head (which is the point opposite the Sun).
"While sunlight is white, all white light is actually a blend of many different colours. Water and other materials bend the different colours at different angles, some more strongly than others. This is called dispersion. By splitting up white light into its separate colours, rainbows appear colourful even though the source of light hitting them is white."
The rainbow displays with the deepest effect in our minds take place when:
Another common place to see the rainbow effect is near waterfalls. Parts of rainbows can be seen some of the time:
An unnatural rainbow effect can also be made by spraying drops of water into the air on a sunny day.
The seven colours of the rainbow.
"The rainbow has no definite number of physical colours, but seven are traditionally listed. Below is a commonly used list of seven colors in the order seen in a rainbow. Computer screens cannot show them precisely but can make colors that look similar. (Each color shows the number codes used to tell a computer how to display the color.)"
The gray rainbows.
"&lt;li style = ""background-color: #755496;""&gt; Violet-gray"
"(Hex: #755496) (RGB: 117, 84, 150)&lt;li&gt;"
Central Intelligence Agency
"The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is part of the US federal government and is located at the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. The agency was formed in 1947 after World War II. Many of the people who started the CIA had been in the Office of Strategic Services, the main American spy agency during the war. General John K. Singlaub was one of the people who created the CIA."
"Lao has mainly native Lao words. Because of Buddhism, however, it has been influenced by other languages that contributed mostly religious terms. Lao has influenced Khmer and Thai and . The writing has many foreign loanwords, very similar to how Latin and Greek have influenced other European languages."
"For politeness, pronouns (and more formal pronouns) are used, as well as ending statements with ແດ່ (dè ) or ເດີ້ (deu ). Negative statements are made more polite by ending with ດອກ (dok ). The following are formal register examples."
Sukiyaki
"Sukiyaki is a very popular one-pot meal in Japan. The main ingredient (or stuff) is thin sliced beef, and it is simmered in a skillet or pan in the sukiyaki sauce with many vegetables and other ingredients. The word ""yaki"" means ""sautee"" or ""grill"" in Japanese. The word is used because the beef in sukiyaki is sauteed in the hot skillet."
History.
"In Japan, because of religious beliefs people were forbidden to eat beef, venison, horse, mutton and other meat from Asuka era to Meizi era. issue of religion. Cattle and horse were also work animals, therefore if people eat cattle and horse meat, people were punished. This custom was publicly decided by the then emperor on April 1, 675. But it is said that the real intention of this custom was to raise cultivation of rice product. This is a commandment (or rule) of Buddhism. But difficulty in making a living meant that people secretly ate boar and venison meat. Over time people ate beef secretly."
"The first sukiyaki store opened in Kyoto at the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Meiji emperor ate beef. He liked taste of sukiyaki. After that, the emperor lifted the ban on eating beef. People were allowed to eat beef publicly. In the west it is called “Sukiyaki”, in the east it is called “Gyunabe”. It is popular all over Japan. Sukiyaki’s contents do not change now. It is thinly sliced beef cooked in an iron pot, with bean curd, sliced onion, mushroom and other kinds of seasoning. Then the beef and vegetables are picked directly from the pan by chopstick and eaten by dipping them into a small bowl containing raw egg. Sukiyaki became symbol of cultural enlightenment."
Preparation.
"Each Japanese region has a preferred way of cooking sukiyaki. Japan can be divided into two regions. The big variation is between ""Kansai"" (western Japan) and ""Kanto"" (eastern Japan). In the Kanto (Tokyo) region, sukiyaki is based on ""Gyunabe"" that was in fashion in ""Meiji"" period. Before cooking sukiyaki, people prepare the soup stock mixing a seasonings (soy sauce, sugar, ""sake"" and ""mirin"") together. They then stew beef in it."
"In the ""Kansai"" region, people grill meat in the pan greased with lard. After that, they put the other ingredients over these, and the liquid is poured into the pan. They do not grill meat and the ingredients that make the meat tough, and they do not grill the meat and watery vegetables at a same time. This is the"" Kansai"" style of cooking sukiyaki."
"The border between the styles of cooking sukiyaki is becoming unclear. Some people say that the border between eastern and western is in Aichi. But recently, ready-made stock, pre-mixed with seasoning used to flavor sukiyaki is sold all over Japan, so the border is no longer clear."
Poplar DLR station
"Poplar DLR station serves Poplar, London. It is a station on the Docklands Light Railway in Travelcard Zone 2. It is a served by four of the five routes of the DLR. Thus it is the busiest station on the network in terms of services."
Shawm
"The shawm was a musical instrument of the woodwind family that was played in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The modern oboe was developed from the shawm. Like the modern oboe, the shawm was played by blowing into a double reed. It was usually made from one piece of wood, with a flare at the end (like a trumpet). It sounded very loud, and was mostly used outdoors."
"In German the shawm is called ""Schalmei"" or ""Pommer"". The first word may have come from the Latin word ""calamus"" meaning ""reed or stalk"". There were many kinds of shawm over the centuries in Europe and they had a variety of names. There were also several different sizes."
Westferry DLR station
"Westferry DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), in the Limehouse district of east London. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2. To the west is Limehouse station, whilst to the east the DLR splits, with one branch going to Poplar station and the other to West India Quay station"
"The DLR station was built midway between the site of the old Limehouse and West India Docks stations on the disused London and Blackwall Railway. Limehouse Police Station is nearby, as is St Anne's Church, built by Nicholas Hawksmoor and boasting London's tallest church clock tower."
Limehouse station

On the c2c route, Limehouse is between Fenchurch Street and West Ham stations. On the Docklands Light Railway, Limehouse is between Shadwell and Westferry stations."
History.
"The station was opened on 3 August 1840 as part of the London and Blackwall Railway. The area used to be known as Ratcliffe, whilst the station has been previously known as Stepney, Stepney Junction and later Stepney East station. Another station some distance to the east on the London and Blackwall Railway, open between 1840 and 1926, had previously been called Limehouse."
Limehouse station today.
"The current Limehouse station is to the west of Limehouse Basin, a marina and residential complex, and the Regent's Canal. Nearby is the north end of the Rotherhithe Tunnel, and the western end of the Limehouse Link tunnel. The station holds Secure Stations Scheme accreditation."

Evil
Evil means something which is morally bad or wicked. It is the opposite of good. People may say that an action which hurts people or breaks certain rules such as the Ten Commandments is evil. A person or a group that does evil things may also be called evil.
Logical problem of evil.
"A version of the problem of evil, perhaps by Epicurus, goes as follows:"
Another argument goes:
"Arguments such as these are about the ""logical"" problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and so cannot all be correct."
Theology.
"A common response is that God can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good. Some philosophers accept that arguments such as ""God allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will"" are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil. Since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that God and evil are ""logically incompatible"", even a highly implausible instance of God's coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose."
"In theology, there is a question: ""If there is a God, why does God let evil happen?"" Some think that evil proves that there is not a God. Others think that God lets evil happen so that people can choose ""not"" to do evil."
"Philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism. For logical positivism the issue with God is the lack of any independent method of verification. In their view, this makes the proposition ""God exists"", not true or false, but meaningless. A similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified."
View.
"The study of good and evil in philosophy is called ethics. Ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil. It attempts to give all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good. Christians believe that at the Second Coming of Christ, God will put an end to evil and the works of the Devil- see the end of the Book of Revelation. In movies or TV series evil people are often called villains. Political actions are sometimes viewed as evil such as authoritarianism, ableism or censorship. People disagree on why people do evil things. Religious people may think that it is the result of listening to an evil being such as the devil or sin. Others think it happens because of mental issues like anger, mental illness or revenge. Certain types of behavior are also sometimes seen as evil such as killing or lying to be punished. Sex crimes such as rape, hebophilia or pedophilia are also often seen as evil."

"&lt;poem&gt;Long live my country, the unity of our Emirates lives."
You've lived for the nation's faith of Islam and guide of the Quran.

Origami
"Origami is a traditional Japanese art of paper folding. It uses many techniques and various objects can be created. The object is made of origami paper, which is specially made for folding and staying in shape. Many dictionaries and television shows suggest that origami is only paper cranes, waterbombs, and paper planes, but many new models and creatures have been made because new folding techniques have allowed this."
"When the Japanese first folded origami, they used only one piece of paper. A different kind of origami called ""modular origami"" uses many small pieces that are the same, which are combined to form one large model. Also, many mathematical shapes can be made with origami."
History.
"The beginnings of origami are not clear. Paperfolding started in China in the 1st or 2nd century. It finally came to Japan in the 6th century. Instead of making models that looked exactly like things, the first origami models only looked similar to things. People often folded models and gave them to other people for good luck. For example, Shinto nobles celebrated weddings with sake in glasses decorated with origami butterflies, which gave good luck to the bride and groom."
"There were also independent paperfolding traditions in other countries, like Germany and Spain. The earliest evidence of paperfolding in Europe is a picture of a boat in 1490. There was also a paper box from 1440. Finally, in 1845, ""Kan no mado"" was written, and it was the first book of origami models."
"Recently, people have become more interested in origami. In 1954, Japanese paperfolder Akira Yoshizawa created rules to explain how to fold origami models. His instructions on paperfolding are now used in all countries."
Paper.
"Peter Engel, who is a well-known paperfolder, says ""the best paper [for origami] is thin and crisp and absolutely square."" Pre-cut origami paper is sold in many colors, sizes, and patterns. Duo paper, or paper with different colors on each side, is used by paperfolders because it makes areas of different color on the finished model. There are also special papers, like textured, metallic, and patterned."

Bihu
"Bihu is the most prominent festival celebrated by the people of Assam. It is a set of three celebrations performed throughout the year. The three Bihus are celebrated at different times of year, in the months of Bohaag (Baisakhi), Kaati (Kartik) and Maagh, according to Hindu calendar. As per modern calendar these days fall in the month of mid April, October/ November and early January."
"Assam is a small state in the north-eastern part of the country. Its economy is mainly based on agriculture. The inhabitants of Assam are known agrarians from ages. Hence all their daily activities and celebrations are agriculture oriented only. Bihu is also one of such festivals. It is very much evident from the months of celebration of this festival that these months are actually significant in relation with farming of native crop of Assam, the paddy. Bohaag bihu is celebrated at the seeding time of paddy. Kaati bihu is celebrated when the sowing of paddy is complete and the transformation of the saplings is done. Maagh bihu represents the culmination of the harvesting period of the crop."
"The word bihu is derived from the language of ‘dimasa kacharis’, which is the agricultural community of Assam, since ages. The word was originally ‘Bishu’, which meant ‘to ask for prosperity’ from the tribal god. Bihu is the distorted version of Bishu."
"Bohaag bihu is also known as Rongali bihu and celebrated with the highest joy and mirth among all the three bihus. As stated it is the commencement time of the new season of farming. But along with, Bohaag is the first month according to Assamese calendar. Hence it is also celebrated as the New Year festival. This period also marks the transition in the seasonal cycle and people greet the coming season of spring with enthusiasm. Rongali bihu is celebrated over a period of 7 days. There are various phases and significance of the respective 7 days of the bihu. The first day is known as goru bihu (cows are washed and worshipped). This is followed by manuha bihu (human beings take early day bath and wear new attire). Then on third day deities are worshipped and washed. Hence the festival stretches over a span of time and the celebrations culminate by bidding adieu to bihu on the last day of festival."
"Kati bihu is also known as kongali bihu. It is celebrated with solidarity. However, the celebrations are quietest of all the three bihus. The farmers are busy in their paddy fields and earthen lamps are lit to mark the celebrations. Farmers pray for a better crop during this time of the farming cycle."
"Maagh bihu is also known as Bhogaali bihu. Bhogalli means eating and enjoyment. Hence the name itself implies the mood of the festival. Men folk prepare cottages in the barren fields after harvesting of the crops and spend whole night while singing and dancing in communion. Delicious food and sweets are exchanged among the people. In the very next morning, the cottage is lit up in fire and this brings an end to yearly festival of bihu."
"It is quite evident that bihu is a festival of farming community whose livelihood is mainly dependent upon the agriculture. The festival of bihu is celebrated by one and all in Assam. The boundaries of rich or poor, cast creed etc are diminished in the dazzling light of joy and merriment."

Career.
"In ""Liber Pontificalis"", it says that they ascribe a decree to Pope Eleutherius that no kind of food should be despised by Christians(Et hoc iterum firmavit ut nulla esca a Christianis repudiaretur, maxime fidelibus, quod Deus creavit, quæ tamen rationalis et humana est)."
Underground cable
"An underground cable is a cable that is buried below the ground. They distribute electrical power or telecommunications. Such cables are an alternative to overhead cables, which are several meters above the ground. Overhead cables are often replaced with underground cables. Downtown areas with many tall buildings usually have few or no cables above ground, This is mainly for aesthetic purposes because underground cables can not be seen. They are also less dangerous to people because they are out of the way. They cost more to install, but last longer."
Pope Gelasius II
Pope Gelasius II (??? − 29 January 1119) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 24 January 1118 to his death in 29 January 1119.
"He was born in Gaeta, Principality of Capua and died in Cluny, Duchy of Burgundy, Kingdom of France. He was ordained a priest on 9 March 1118 after he fled to Gaeta. He returned to Rome in July under Norman protection after he excommunicated Henry V and the antipope."
Hualien County
Hualien County () is a county in Taiwan. It is the largest county in Taiwan in terms of area. It is located on the mountainous eastern coast.
It contains the Port of Hualien. It is famous for tourism.
Kinmen
"Kinmen (or Quemoy) is a small group of islands close to the coast of China. It is governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan). It forms a county, Kinmen County (), of Fujian Province. The capital is Jincheng Township."
"The county is claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) as part of its own Fujian Province. It is very close to Xiamen, no more than 2 kilometres."
"For many games, the Jokers are removed from the deck, making the total number of cards in the deck 52. Sometimes the deck is reduced to 40, 36, or 32 cards for playing certain games, like belote, sheepshead or euchre."
Tarot cards.
"There are various types of tarot cards. Tarots are commonly used for fortune-telling, although they can also be used for playing games. Conversely, people have also used standard playing cards for fortune-telling."
History.
"Playing cards have been found in 9th century China, Tang dynasty."
"Playing cards first entered Europe in the early 14th century, probably from Egypt. The suits were very similar to the tarot suits of Swords, Staves, Cups and Coins. These designs are still used in traditional Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese card decks."
"The first documentary evidence is from Vitoria-Gasteiz (now Spain) in 1334, in which the Knights of the Band are forbidden to play cards. The next record is from Catalonia in 1371."
Wide use of playing cards in Europe can be traced from 1377 onwards.
Manufacture.
"The method of making cards has stayed the same for over a century. Cards are two thin pieces of paper stuck together with black paste. Both outer sides are printed. Inside is the design of the card face, the outer is the design for the pack as a whole. The black paste is essential to prevent sight of the face coming through when light shines on the face side. The use of the paste is the reason cards are sometimes called ""pasteboards""."
"One or two packs at a time are printed on large sheets of paper, already pasted. The individual cards are stamped out by a machine which acts like a cookie-cutter. It cuts 36,000 cards per hour. A tiny fraction of a second later the edges of the cards are squashed extra-thin. This is not obvious to the naked eye, but the effect is that the cards slide easily past each other during shuffling."
"Printed paper cards hold about 97.5% of the world market. Plastic cards do exist: they were first invented in the 1930s. They last longer than papercards, but have only 2.5% of the market."
Emperor
"An emperor is a male who rules an empire. The word is taken from the Latin language ""imperator"". Often it is capitalized."
"A woman who comes to power in an empire is called an ""empress"". The wife of an emperor is also called empress. An emperor or empress is often a hereditary monarch and comes to power when one of his parents, or relatives, dies. In some countries, people elected a new emperor from candidates."
"The only emperor in the world today is the Emperor of Japan (""tennō""), but he lacks political power. The true leaders of Japan are the Diet and Prime Minister because the country is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy."
"The English word comes from Latin, the language of the old Roman Empire. At first, an ""imperator"" was a powerful general (army leader) but, after Augustus, it was only used by their most powerful rulers. There have been many countries in history whose leaders are called ""emperor"" in English. The leaders of the Byzantine Empire (""basileus"", ""autokrator"") in Greece, the Holy Roman Empire (""imperator"", ""Kaiser"") in Austria and Germany, Russian Empire, Serbia and Bulgaria (""tsar""), and the Ottoman Empire (""sultan"", ""padishah"", ""khagan"", ""kaysar"") in Turkey all said they were just new parts of the old Roman Empire."
"The leaders of other countries who said they ruled the whole world or called themselves ""King of Kings"" are frequently also called emperors in English. For example, the old rulers of China (""Huangdi""), Iran (""Shah"") and Ethiopia (""Negusa negast"") are all known as emperors in English. There have also been emperors of France, Brazil and Mexico, and the rulers of the United Kingdom called themselves the Emperors and empresses of India for a while."
"Palmdale, California"
"Palmdale is the largest city in the desert area of California. It is a suburb of Los Angeles. It has a population of 147,897 and is the 6th largest city in Los Angeles County. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, currently the 25th fastest. It has a population of 589,043 if you include the suburbs around it."
"Even though Palmdale is in Los Angeles County, it is not connected to the larger Los Angeles population area. It is separated from it by a mountain range called the San Gabriel Mountains that are over 40 miles wide and almost 2 miles high overall."
"Palmdale is the home of several airplanes used by NASA and the Air Force, giving it the nickname of ""the aerospace capital of America."""
Palmdale is the largest city in the United States without a hospital.
"Palmdale Airport will have one airline called United Airlines that flies to San Francisco, California everyday starting in June 2007."
The city's demographics is primarily Mexican and white.
History.
"In 1886, when land in the Antelope Valley sold for 50 cents an acre, a group of 50 Swiss and German families migrated from the Midwest and settled in what is now known as Palmdale. They named their new community “Palmenthal” because they had mistaken the native Joshua trees for palm trees."
The high desert community of Palmdale has rich agricultural roots and a unique aviation history.
"The City of Palmdale celebrated its 50th anniversary of incorporation on Aug. 24, 2012. It has consistently been one of the fastest-growing cities in California and in the country. Since 1980, Palmdale’s population has soared from 12,277 to 158,605. Despite its growth, Palmdale continues to cherish the small-town values of a family-oriented community while enjoying all of the conveniences of its booming retail and commercial sectors."
"In 1772 Captain Pedro Fages, a Spanish soldier in pursuit of deserting sailors, crossed the southern part of the Antelope Valley into Leona Valley."

Capital gains tax
"A capital gains tax (CGT) is a tax on the profit realized on the sale of a non-inventory asset. The most common capital gains are seen from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, and property."
"Not all countries have a capital gains tax and most have different rates of taxation. Countries that do not impose a capital gains tax include Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Cayman Islands, Isle of Man, Jamaica, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and others."
"In some countries, such as New Zealand and Singapore, professional traders and those who trade frequently are taxed on such profits as a business income."
Women in the history of Manipur kingdom
"Manipuri women have been known for their valor, skill and active involvement in social, economic, political and cultural activities, besides holding almost all the household responsibilities as a mother, wife, daughter, sister and daughter in law."
"Thomas Callan Hodson, the then British Political Agent of 1908 Manipur, quoted in his monograph, The Meitheis, as follows:"
&lt;poem&gt;
"""The women hold a high and free position in Manipur, all the integral trade and exchange of the produce of the country being managed by them. The habit of the country is to have bazars (markets) at convenient spots by the road side, where a handful of women congregate at the early hour...!"""
&lt;/poem&gt;
List.
Leima Linthoingambi.
"Leima Linthoingambi was the queen of king Ningthoukhomba (1432-1567) of Manipur. During the invasion of the Ankla tribes, the king had to proceed at the war field. At the King's absence in the capital city, the Tangkhul tribes raided the city. But in disguise as the king, the queen resisted their revolution by offering strong wine at the king's absence. With her wits, the kingdom was saved. This account is recorded in the Ningthourol Lambuba."
Kuranganayani.
"Kuranganayani, originally known as Shija Phongalokpi, is the biological daughter of King Gaurishyam and the adoptive daughter of King Bhagyachandra. She was offered hand in marriage to the Ahom king to strengthen the relationship between the two kingdoms as well as to get military aid from the Ahoms for the Meiteis to resist the Burmese conquest of Manipur. But she turned out to be a heroine even in the Ahom kingdom. It was she who saved the Ahom kingdom from the hands of the Moamoriya revolts."
Yairipok Thambalnu.
"Thambalnu was a lady from a poor family in Yairipok town of Manipur. But her beauty and charm causes conflicts among many able men in the kingdom in her times. During flood times from the Imphal river in the kingdom, the Royal Oracle proclaimed that the water god Wangbren will be pleased if a young girl is offered to Him. Since Thambalnu became a problem for numerous men, she was chosen to be offered to the deity. So, she was forcibly (or voluntarily) put in sacrifice to the strong river flow. After her death, the flood was also gone."
Maharani Kumudini.
"Queen Kumudini was widowed when her son was at a ripe age. She devised many diplomatic relations and plots to protect the throne from the other family members of the royalty. When her son, Chandrakirti became the king, she was known as a popular feminine icon in the kingdom."
"Waitangi, Northland"
"Waitangi ( or , ) is a locality in the Bay of Islands on the North Island of New Zealand. It is close to the town of Paihia, 60 kilometres north of Whangarei. ""Waitangi"" is a Māori-language name meaning ""weeping waters""."
Waitangi Day
"Waitangi Day (), the national day of New Zealand, celebrates the anniversary of the initial signing – on 6 February 1840 – of the Treaty of Waitangi, which is seen as the founding document of the nation. The first Waitangi Day was not celebrated until 1934, and it was made a national public holiday in 1974."
"These missions were an important part of Spanish rule because if a mission was built in a place, it would be harder for other European countries to claim that land for themselves."
"In these missions, the Native Americans were taught European ways. They learned how to speak Spanish and the basics of the Catholic faith. They also farmed and made things such as candles and clothes. However, some Native Americans did not like living in the missions. They thought the Spanish were treating them wrong and they fought back."
Death.
"Serra died at Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in what is now Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. He is buried there. People go to his grave to pray in his name."
Sainthood.
"Serra was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1988. When he was beatified, it means that the Catholic Church recognizes that he went to heaven and can intercede on behalf of people who pray in his name. He was also now called ""Blessed."" However, he was not a saint yet because beatification is step 3 out of the 4 steps of becoming a saint in the Catholic Church."
"In 2015, Pope Francis canonized Serra. That means that he is now officially recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church and has his own feast day (July 1 in the United States, August 28 everywhere else). July 1 is his feast day in America to honor the day he arrived in San Diego."
Legacy.
"There are many statues of Junipero Serra in California. There are also many places named after him, such as schools and roads."
Criticism.
"People have criticized Junipero Serra for his treatment of the Native people who live in what is now the state of California. They said that he beat them up and didn't allow them to practice their own cultures and religions. However, other people say that Serra did a lot of good things for the Native people. Unlike other Europeans at the time, he thought that the Native Californians had souls. He also taught them how to read and write."
"In 2020, many statues of Junipero Serra were damaged and pulled down. Other statues of him have been removed and put away. These events have taken place in light of the George Floyd protests, when people were working to end racism in American society."
Preludes (Chopin)
"Preludes, Op. 28 is a collection of 24 short musical works for solo piano, written by Frédéric Chopin between 1837 and 1838 and published in the middle of 1839, just after the composer's winter stay on the isle of Majorca with George Sand."
"Chopin was greatly influenced by Johann Sebastian Bach when he wrote these preludes. Each of the works in the collection is in a different major or minor key, with not one being left out, just like Bach's 24 preludes and fugues in ""The Well-Tempered Clavier"". But unlike Bach, Chopin arranges the preludes in order through the circle of fifths. The first prelude in the set is in C major, the next in A minor, then G major, E minor, and so on, until the last two, which are in F major and finally D minor."
"The ""Preludes"" are all very different. Many are very short (they take only about one minute each to play), so the atmosphere changes quickly, and this can make the overall structure seem out of place. Artists have recorded the entire set of preludes on CDs, and they are often performed in concerts as well."
"One of the well-known pieces from the ""Preludes"" is Prelude No. 15, in D-flat major and nicknamed ""Raindrop"". This nickname refers to the monotonous repetition of one note in the accompaniment. It reminded early music lovers of the dripping of raindrops. Another well-known number is Prelude No. 4, in E minor, with its melancholy descending chords in the accompaniment."
"Besides the 24 preludes of Op. 28, Chopin would write three more preludes, Op. 45 in C-sharp minor (composed in 1841), one in A-flat major (1834), and the so-called ""Devil's Trill"" Prelude, in E-flat minor, which Chopin never ended up finishing."

Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)
"Symphony No. 6 in F major, Op. 68 (Pastorale) is a symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven. The composer began making sketches for the symphony in 1806. The symphony was completed in 1808 in the village of Heiligenstadt northwest of Vienna. It was first performed in Vienna, Austria on 22 December 1808 in the Theater an der Wien with the premieres of the Symphony No. 5 in C minor, the Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major, the ""Choral"" Fantasy, ""Ah! perfido!"" (a concert aria composed in 1796), and excerpts from the Mass in C major of 1807."
"There are five movements in the symphony. The movements in order are allegro ma non troppo (""Joyful Feelings Upon Arriving in the Country""), andante molto mosso (""By the Brook""), allegro (""Peasant Merrymaking""), allegro (""The Thunderstorm""), and allegretto (""The Shepherd's Song After the Storm""). The first movement is in sonata form. It is placid and cheerful. It depicts the composer's feelings as he arrives in the country. The second movement is in sonata form. Beethoven helpfully identified the bird species in the score: nightingale (flute), quail (oboe) and cuckoo (clarinet). The third movement is the scherzo movement of the symphony. It depicts the country folk dancing and it ends unexpectedly when the country folk notice that raindrops are starting to fall. The fourth movement depicts a violent thunderstorm, starting with just a few drops of rain and building to a climax. There is, of course, thunder, as well as lightning, high winds, and sheets of rain. The finale is in sonata rondo form. The first eight bars form a continuation of the introduction of which the storm was the main part; the finale proper begins in the ninth bar."
Australasia
Australasia is one of the world's geographical regions. It is unified in natural history and geology because of its ancient origin as part of the supercontinent Gondwana. It is the geographical area which contains the Australasian ecozone.
"Its islands are all south-east of the Bali–Lombok line, known as the Wallace Line, after Alfred Russel Wallace. The main political entities are Australia, Indonesia and New Zealand. The main islands are:"
The most popular attractions are:
The Amazon rain forest.
"The amazon rain forest is a moist grassy land where many wild animals live and contains the amazon river which is the 2nd longest river in the world and has the largest volume of water. The world's longest river is the Nile in Africa. The forest is known as a rain forest as it rains very often but due to the dense surroundings not every droplet reaches the bottom. The Amazon is shared by eight countries (Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname) and stretches for 6.7 million kilometers2. In the amazon rain forest, hundreds of thousands of trees have been cut down for wood and paper, meaning that the forest is endangered. Unlike the Boreial forest in Canada the trees are not getting replanted."
Bed
"A bed is a piece of furniture that people sleep on. It normally has a soft mattress on a bed frame. Many beds also have bed sheets to cover the mattress and additional sheets for the people to sleep under. People also use a pillow under their heads. A bed comes in many different sizes including a single, double and king size."
History.
"In August 2020 archaeologists reported the discovery of the oldest grass bedding from Middle Paleolithic (at least 200,000 years ago). This was much older than the oldest previously known bedding."
"They found insect-repellent plants and ash layers beneath the bedding. This would have made a dirt-free, insulated base which helped to keep away insects. So early beds were little more than piles of straw or some other natural material (e.g. a heap of palm leaves, animal skins, or dried ferns)."
"Here's an example of what they said: ""Several cultures have used ash as an insect repellent because insects cannot easily move through fine powder. Ash blocks insects' breathing and biting apparatus, and eventually dehydrates them. ""Tarchonanthus"" (camphor bush) remains were on top of the grass from the oldest bedding in the cave. This plant is still used to deter insects in rural parts of East Africa""."
Mattresses stuffed with feathers were first used in Ancient Rome.
"In Ancient Egypt, beds were considered to be status symbols. While the lower classes simply slept on a heap of palm bows or straw, the wealthy constructed wood platform beds that were ascended by stairs, were often curtained, and piled high with cushions for comfort."
"In Ancient Rome, the bed was utilized as a multi-purpose reclining surface rather than just a place to sleep. Several beds, or ""dining couches"" were arranged around the perimeter of the home's living space, and friends and family would recline in bed while socializing, studying, and dining."
Types of beds.
"There are several kinds of bed in use today. Several terms refer to the size of the mattress. Some kinds are usually temporary, such as camp cots, air mattresses, and hammocks."
Asia
"Asia is a large region on Earth mainly in the northern hemisphere. Asia is connected to Europe in the west, forming a continent called Eurasia, though sometimes it is viewed as a separate continent from Europe. Some of the oldest human civilizations began in Asia, such as Sumer, China, and India. Asia was also home to some large empires such as the Persian Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Mongol Empire, and the Ming Empire. It is home to at least 44 countries. Turkey, Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Cyprus are partly are also considered European."
Area.
"Asia includes a large amount of land. Covering about 30% of the world's land area, it has more people than any other continent, with about 60% of the world's total population. Stretching from the icy Arctic in the north to the hot and steamy equatorial lands in the south, Asia contains huge, empty deserts, as well as some of the world's highest mountains and longest rivers."
"Asia is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Arctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. It is separated from Europe by the Pontic Mountains and the Turkish Straits. A long, mainly land border in the west separates Europe and Asia. This line runs north–south down the Ural Mountains in Russia, along the Ural River to the Caspian Sea, and through the Caucasus Mountains to the Black Sea."
List of countries.
"Some countries are variously located in both Europe and Asia, namely Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Cyprus, and Turkey."
"The Sinai Peninsula of Egypt lies in western Asia, with the rest of the country lying in North-East Africa."
Wall
"A wall is a vertical dividing surface. It divides space in buildings into rooms or protects buildings. It is usually made of stone or brick. Walls have two main purposes: to support the top part of buildings, and to divide space, giving protection from invasion, escape, and weather."
"Before powerful artillery was invented, many cities had protective walls. Since they are not suitable for defense any more, most city walls have been removed."
"The term ""the Wall"" usually referred to the Berlin Wall, built during the Cold War, which fell in 1989, but may also refer to the Pink Floyd album of the same name."
"Sealing people behind walls, in the form of immurement has historically been a method of human sacrifice and punishment."
Retaining wall.
"A retaining wall is a structure made to hold soil from collapsing. It is made in special areas for any other construction work, such as farming or road making."
Act I.
"Jaquino is a prison guard. He wants to marry Marzelline, the daughter of Rocco who is the warden of the prison. But Marzelline has just fallen in love with someone she thinks is a man called Fidelio. Actually Fidelio is a woman who has dressed up as a man so that she can get into the prison where her husband Florestan is a prisoner (he has been arrested for political reasons). She is pretending to return Marzelline’s love so that she can find a way of rescuing Florestan. Rocco says he is happy for Marzelline to marry Fidelio. Fidelio (Leonore) says she will help Rocco with his job of looking after the prisoners. Rocco says she can do this, but there is one prisoner she is not allowed to guard. He has been locked up alone for two years. Leonore thinks it may be her husband, but she is not sure."
"Don Pizarro, the military governor of the prison, hears that the prison is going to be looked at by inspectors who make sure that the prison is being properly managed. He knows that he should not have locked Florestan up, so decides to kill him before the inspection starts. He asks Rocco to dig the grave so that he can get rid of the body quickly. Rocco does not want to do this, but has to agree."
"Leonore lets the prisoners have a walk in the garden. Rocco tells Leonore that he must help him dig the grave. Rocco is very cross that the prisoners are walking in the garden, but Rocco says they should be allowed because it is the King’s name-day. Rocco says they should be locked up again. So he locked them again."
Act II.
Florestan sits alone in his cell. In his mind he imagines an angel who looks like his wife who is telling him to come to Heaven.
"Leonore goes with Rocco to the prisoner. She is still not sure whether it is her husband. She gives him some bread. When Pizarro comes he gets ready to kill Florestan, but Leonore stands between them and tells Pizarro she will shoot him if he comes nearer. A trumpet is heard playing a fanfare because the Minister is arriving."
"Outside the prison the Minister says that all the prisoners are now free. He is horrified to find Florestan among the prisoners, because he is his friend. The crowd ask for Pizarro to be punished. Leonore frees her husband from his chains and the crowd say that she is a great heroine."
The Overtures.
"Beethoven made several changes to the opera at different times. This included writing four different overtures. They are called ""Leonore 1"", ""Leonore 2"", ""Leonore 3"" and ""Fidelio"". The overture ""Fidelio"" is the one that is normally heard now at the beginning of the opera. ""Leonore 2"" was the overture performed at the first performance in 1805. ""Leonore 3"", composed in 1806, is the most famous of the overtures. ""Leonore 1"" may have been written in 1805, or it may have been intended for a performance in 1807 in Prague which never took place"". Sometimes the ""Leonore 3"" overture is played during Act II between the two scenes. However, many people think it does not work dramatically there. It is usually heard today as a separate concert piece. The overture ""Fidelio"" was composed for performances of the opera in 1814."
Für Elise
"""Für Elise"" (German for ""For Elise"") is the common name of the ""Bagatelle in A minor"", written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1810. The song is thought to be written for Therese, a woman that Beethoven wanted to marry in 1810, however his handwriting was misspelt undergoing transcription, allowing the piece to be known as Fur Elise rather the Fur Therese. Therese did not want to marry him."
"The piece of music, which was written for the piano, was not published until 1865, a long time after Beethoven’s death. It is one of the most well-known pieces of piano music in the world."
Form.
"The piece is in rondo form. There is a main section (A) which appears three times. Between these three sections there are two other sections (B and C), so the form of the piece can be described as: A B A C A."
"The main section has a time signature of 3/8. It is based on arpeggios which flow from one hand to the other. This is the section that many beginner pianists want to play. The two middle sections are harder to play at the correct speed. They have fast scales, arpeggios and left hand demisemiquavers (32nd notes)."

Teplice
"Teplice (German name: Teplitz) is a city in Bohemia, the western area of the Czech Republic. Teplice (pronounced in Czech: “Tep-li-tse”) is a famous spa town where, in earlier times, lots of famous people went for holidays to improve their health. Goethe, Beethoven, Chopin, Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner all stayed there."
Teplice lies between Prague and Dresden in a mountain area called Krušné hory (Iron Mountains). In the year 762 hot springs were found there. The waters from these springs helped people who were ill to get better so it became a spa town.
"Since 1990 many buildings have been restored. The Krušnohorské divadlo (Krušnohorské theatre) is now being refurbished. The North Bohemia Philharmonic Orchestra give concerts there in the open air. There is a museum and many restaurants, wine bars and cafés. In the winter the mountain slopes are good for skiing."
Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)
"Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, is a symphony written by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is one of the most famous pieces of music ever written."
"A symphony is a piece of music for orchestra. Beethoven wrote nine symphonies. This one, the last one he wrote, is very unusual because the last movement also has singing in it: there are four soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) and a choir. This is why it is known as the “choral” symphony (“choral” means: “for choir”). It is a very long work, lasting more than an hour. This, too, was unusual."
"This symphony has four movements. The first movement is in sonata form. The second and third movements come the other way round from the usual order: the second movement is the scherzo and the third movement is the slow movement. It is a theme and variations. The last movement sets the words of a poem by Friedrich Schiller, a famous poet who had only recently died. The poem was called ""Ode an die Freude"" (in English: ""Ode to Joy""). The poem has a strong message to all mankind: it is about living in peace and harmony together. It was written at the time of the French Revolution when these ideas were becoming very important in Europe."
"The main tune of the last movement (sung to the words: “Freude, schöne Götterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium”) is one of the best known tunes in the world. Many children like to play it on instruments because the first part of the tune only uses five notes (it can be played on C, D, E, F, G). When the tune comes the first time in the symphony it is played by the cellos and double basses."
"The ""Ode to Joy"" was adopted as Europe's “National anthem” in 1972, with an official arrangement for orchestra written by Herbert von Karajan."
"Beethoven had been interested in Schiller’s famous poem since he was young. In 1817 he started to write the first two movements of the symphony. In 1822 he decided to use Schiller’s poem in the symphony. Most of the rest of the symphony was written in 1823 and he finished it in 1824. It was first performed in May of that year. Beethoven conducted the performance. The story is told that he wondered why the audience were not applauding when it had finished. They were applauding, but Beethoven was deaf so he could not hear. Caroline Unger, the alto soloist, made him turn round, and he saw that people were applauding enthusiastically."
"The second degree is a tear of a ligament, which is usually followed by pain or swelling."
The third degree is a complete rupture.
Signs and symptoms.
The typical signs and symptoms associated with a sprain are the main signs of inflammation:
Joints involved.
"Although any joint can experience a sprain, some of the more common include:"
Prevention.
"Sprains can best be prevented by proper use of safety equipment (wrist, ankle guards), warm-ups and cool-downs (including stretching), being aware of your surroundings and maintaining strength and flexibility. Physical conditioning is the best way to avoid or lessen the degree of sprains."
Second Sino-Japanese War
"The Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 to September 3, 1945) was a major war fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. It became part of World War II when Japan entered that war. Part of the Sino-Japanese war was fought in northern Burma and northeastern India. The war ended when Japan surrendered after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It started in 1937 43 years after the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 lead by Emperor Meiji who was the father of Emperor Taishō and the Grandfather of Hirohito ."
Invasion of China.
The Second Sino-Japanese War began when Japan invaded China in 1931. Japan used the Mukden Incident as an excuse to invade China. The invasion grew into a full-scale war after the Marco-Polo Bridge Incident. Japanese officers said that a Japanese soldier got lost and they were allowed to find him in Beiping.
Japan invaded China for a few reasons:
"While the Imperial Japanese Army was trying to take over China, the KMT (the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-Shek) and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong) cooperated a little to try to fight off Japan together. This was called the ""Chinese United Front"". However, for the most part, they continued to fight each other as well."
Japanese occupation of China.
"In 1931, the Imperial Japanese Army began to occupy China, starting in the northeast (Manchuria), where they created a puppet state called Manchukuo. In 1937, they occupied Beiping (now called Beijing), and then Nanjing. For six weeks in Nanjing, the army committed the Nanjing Massacre. During this massacre, Japanese soldiers killed between 40,000 and 300,000 Chinese people, and raped at least 20,000 women and girls."
"After six weeks, the Japanese Army left Nanjing. It finally occupied the industrial cities in southern China. Chiang moved his capital city from Nanjing to Chongqing, and began a tactic of ""using space to trade for time."" He was able to spread Japanese soldiers out too thin. This means they were covering too much space with too few soldiers. This made them harder to fight, and made it easier for partisans to fight back in occupied China."
"Many soldiers died on both sides at this time. However, in 1940, the Japanese Army stopped being able to move farther into China and take more land. 1940 also marked the point where China began to be able to fight back, instead of Japan continuing to take over the country."
End of the war 1941-1945.
"After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in the United States on December 7, 1941, the Second Sino-Japanese War became part of World War II. It became a part of the area of fighting called the China-Burma-India theatre. The entrance of the United States into the war in Asia meant that the Chinese military forces started receiving lend-lease supplies from the British and Americans over the Burma Road. This helped the Chinese fight back and get much-needed modern weapons."
"The Second Sino-Japanese War had damaged Japan. It had not been able to win the war against China quickly. Instead, Japan's military had already been fighting China for four years. This made it much more difficult for Japan to keep fighting (now in the Pacific against the Allied forces). This may have been one reason why Japan eventually lost the war."
"In China, the war had some important effects. It made more people support the Chinese Communist Party. It also made Chiang's Republic fall apart more quickly, in 1949."
Ligament
"In anatomy, the word ligament usually means the fibrous tissue that joins bones to other bones or cartilages."
"A ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue made of long, stringy collagen fibres. Ligaments join bones to other bones to form a joint. They do ""not"" connect muscles to bones; that is the function of tendons. Some ligaments limit the amount of movement in a joint, or stop certain movements altogether."
"Ligaments are only slightly elastic; when under tension, they gradually lengthen. This is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible: if the ligaments lengthen too much, then the joint will be weakened. Athletes, gymnasts, dancers, and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments, making their joints more supple."
"The result of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint. Not all broken ligaments need surgery, but if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint, the broken ligament can be joined."
Powiat
"A county (Polish: ""powiat"", pronounced ""povyat""; plural, ""powiaty"") is the Polish second-level unit of administration, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture in other countries. A county is part of a larger unit called a ""voivodship"" (in Polish, ""województwo"". One would call it in English ""province"")."

In 2006 the theatre was closed so that work could be done to improve the inside of the building. It reopened in 2010
"There had been a theatre there in the middle of the 19th century. The present building was opened in 1908. The auditorium is horseshoe-shaped and has 2,487 seats. The acoustics of the building are very good. It is in the middle of Buenos Aires."
"Many world famous conductors, composers and singers have appeared at the theatre."
Bim Bum Bam
"Bim Bum Bam, (1982-2003), was an Italian children's and teens' television programme."
"""Bim Bum Bam"" was produced by Alessandra Valeri Manera and created by Paolo Bonolis and Giancarlo Muratori."
Puyi
"Aisin-Giro Puyi or Emperor Puyi (, February 7, 1906–October 17, 1967) was the last Emperor of China. He was crowned emperor in 1908 at the age of three. His era name as Qing emperor, ""Xuantong"", means ""proclamation of unity"". On February 12, 1912, during the Xinhai Revolution, he was forced to abdicate. He later became the ruler of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo during World War II. He married five times but never had any children. His father was Zaifeng Prince Chun II. He never knew his mother and was raised by eunuchs."
"When he was two years old, in 1908, he became the Xuantong Emperor (then spelled as Hsuan Tung Emperor). At the age of six, he was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen in the 1911 Revolution. He was forced to give up all political power, but he was allowed to keep his title, his servants, and everything he owned in the Forbidden City. In turn, he had to pay the Republic of China 4 million taels a year and was never allowed to leave the Forbidden City."
"In 1919, Pu-yi appointed a British tutor named Reginald Johnston. It was through him that the young emperor developed a fascination with the Western world, so he began to adopt aspects of the West for himself. He learned how to ride a bicycle, he cut off his own Manchu queue, he even began to wear glasses."
"After Pu-yi was married to his first wife, he discovered that many of the palace's treasures were getting stolen. Believing that it was his eunuchs who were stealing his treasures, he demanded that they make an inventory to stop the treasury from getting robbed. On the June 27, 1923, a fire destroyed the area around the Palace of Established Happiness. He accused the eunuchs of burning the treasury to destroy any proof of their theft. He also overheard some eunuchs' conversation that made him fear for his life. In response, he banished all the eunuchs from the palace."
"In 1925, warlord Feng Yuxiang forced the emperor to leave the Forbidden City. Pu-yi then asked his tutor Johnston to go to the British embassy and ask them to let the emperor to move to England. Unfortunately, the embassy refused his request. He then called the Japanese embassy and they agreed to escort him out of Beijing and move him to Tianjin. After the Japanese took over Manchuria in 1932, they made Pu-yi the Emperor of their new puppet state, Manchukuo. Despite being emperor, he practically had no power, but he was constantly manipulated, threatened, and blackmailed by the Japanese government. Once again, the emperor found himself to be a prisoner in his own palace. Chinese media and writers accused the Japanese and collaborators like Puyi of being homosexuals as an insult."
"After the Soviet Red Army invaded Manchuria in 1945, they captured Pu-yi when they invaded Changchun. After the CCP took over China in 1949, the Soviets agreed to hand Pu-yi over to China. For the next ten years, the former emperor was in a prison camp in Liaoning. After the prison guards said that he was reformed, he was freed from prison and was moved back to Beijing. He spent the rest of his life there as a common citizen. He worked as a gardener and then an editor. He earned 100 yuan a month. When he returned to the Forbidden City (which was made into the Imperial Palace Museum), he had to buy a ticket to enter. He thought that it was ironic that he had to buy a ticket just to visit his own home."

Endocrinology
Endocrinology studies the working of the endocrine system and hormones.
"It is the science of the endocrine system and hormones in a wide range of animals. Endocrinology is also a medical specialty. This means that when a doctor finishes studying medicine in general, they can choose endocrinology as the part of medicine they work in."
The endocrine system consists of several glands in different parts of the body. They secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action.
"Hormones are active in metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and perception. Another field is behavioral endocrinology."
Medical aspects.
"Medical understanding of hormones began in the 19th century with Graves' disease, caused by a swelling of the thyroid gland. Since the mid-19th century many medical conditions have been found caused by hormone imbalance, that is, too much or too little of a hormone."
An endocrinologist can help people who have diseases related to their endocrine system. Diseases that an endocrinologist would treat include:
These are just examples; there are many other endocrine diseases.
"John of Damascus studied religion. He also studied law, theology, philosophy and music. He is said by some sources to have served as a Chief Administrator to the Muslim caliph of Damascus before he became a priest. He wrote works about Christianity.

"He was born in Rome, Papal States and died in March 996 in Rome, Papal States, Holy Roman Empire."
"During his time as pope, there was a dispute that arose over the deposition in 991 of Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims. Arnulf was made archbishop of Reims in 988 by Hugh Capet of France. Arnulf was the nephew of the King's bitter rival, Charles of Lorraine and considered Arnulf a turncoat. He demanded his deposition by John XV. Hugh Capet captured both Charles and Archbishop Arnulf and convoked a synod at Reims in June 991. He deposed Arnulf and chose as his successor Abbot Gerbert of Aurillac who would later be known as Pope Silvester II."
"At the synod, Arnulf, Bishop of Orléans accused John XV:"

Black Friday
"Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving in the United States. Even though it falls on a Friday, which is the last day before the weekend, and comes right after Thanksgiving Thursday, it is not a federal holiday. There are some states, however, that observe this day instead of Columbus Day for workers of the state government."
"The name ""Black Friday"" started to be used sometime after World War II, but it was not popular outside of Philadelphia until around 1975"
Traditions.
"Many Americans see Black Friday as the official beginning of the Christmas holiday season, a time when many people go shopping for gifts to give to their family and friends on Christmas Day. On Black Friday, many stores have big sales, and it is common to see long lines of people waiting outside stores and in malls to get the best deals first before they run out. Because of this, stores usually open around 6 am in the morning or later. Some stores, though, started opening at 5 am and even 4 am in the late 20th century. Now, a few stores even open at midnight. Shoppers like to stay out all day to get what they need, making Black Friday the busiest shopping day of the year."
"On the first Monday after the long weekend is Cyber Monday, when many people go online shopping."
Lions in heraldry
"Lions appear in heraldry more often than any other animal. It traditionally symbolises bravery, valour, strength, and royalty."
"They may appear as a charge on the shield or as a crest. They are described in the ""blazon"" (heraldic description) by their ""tincture"" (color) and ""attitude"" (position). Sometimes the teeth and claws of a lion can be colored differently from the rest of its body; it is said to be ""armed"" of that color (e.g. ""A lion Or armed gules"" is a gold lion with red teeth and claws). Sometimes the tail is even described, if it is shown in an unusual way. One reason why lions are shown in so many different ways is because when heraldry developed, a lot of people wanted a lion on their coat of arms, but no two coats of arms can be the same. The purpose of heraldry in the Middle Ages was to identify people with bold images over the outside of their armour. Since a lot of people started putting lions on their coats of arms, they placed them in a lot of different positions and in every color used in heraldry. In France and Germany, they even made patterns of colors on some of their lions, as if they were painted."
"French heralds refer to lions in the walking positions as ""leopards"", but this term is seldom used by British heralds."
Attitudes.
"Although there are many ""attitudes"" or positions now used in heraldry, very few of these were known to medieval heralds, who simply wanted to draw a lion to fill the space provided on the shield. The following table describes the different attitudes of heraldic lions:"
"Other terms are used to describe the lion's position in further detail. The lion's head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position, (facing left) unless otherwise stated. If a lion's ""whole body"" is turned to face right, he is ""to sinister"" or ""contourné"". If his ""whole body"" faces the viewer, he is ""affronté"". If his ""head only"" faces the viewer he is ""guardant"" or ""gardant"", and if he looks back over his shoulder (body facing left but head turned to face right) he is ""regardant"". These words follow the main description of position, and then the lion is further described as ""armed"" (teeth and claws) of another color, if another color is used. And finally, the tail may be described if it is unusual. A lion (or other beast) ""coward"" carries its tail between its hind legs. The tail also may be ""nowed"" (knotted), or the lion may be ""queue fourchée"" (forked tail) or ""double-queued"" (two tails)."
"This movie had a sequel, ""Caddyshack II""."
Bull Durham
"Bull Durham is an 1988 American romantic comedy baseball movie set in Durham, North Carolina. It was produced by Thom Mount and Mark Burg and was directed by Ron Shelton.

Ostracod
Ostracods are a class of the Crustacea. They are often called seed shrimps because of their appearance.
"Some 65,000 species (13,000 of which are living) have been identified."
"Ostracods are small crustaceans, typically around in size, but varying from to in the case of ""Gigantocypris""."
"Their bodies are flattened from side to side and protected by a bivalve-like, chitinous or calcareous valve or ""shell"". The hinge of the two valves is in the upper (dorsal) region of the body."
"Marine ostracods live in the zooplankton. Others live in the benthos, on or in the upper layer of the sea floor."
"Many ostracods are also found in fresh water. Terrestrial species of ""Mesocypris"" are known from humid forest soils of South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania. They have a wide range of diets, and the group includes carnivores, herbivores, scavengers, and filter feeders."
Copepods may not be monophyletic. Ostracod taxa are grouped into a Class based on gross morphology (what they look like). Their DNA sequence analysis in their mitochondria has been examined. The results are not clear.
Urban decay
"Urban decay is the process in which a city or area goes into conditions of disrepair or becomes decrepit or filled with blight. Urban decay involves white flight, population changes, depopulation, economic troubles, high local unemployment, higher than usual crime and political issues. Blight is associated with condemned properties, empty lots and deserted areas that often attract criminal activity. That includes squattiing in these buildings/homes,"

Muhammad Hassan
"Mark Copani (born November 7, 1981 in Syracuse, New York) is a retired American professional wrestler who is best known for wrestling with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under the ring name, Muhammad Hassan."
"His gimmick was about a Middle Eastern-American wrestler that wanted acceptance from the stereotypes created by the 9/11 attacks. His gimmick got attention from the New York Post, TV Guide, Variety and other news sources because he was supposed to face The Undertaker in a match The Great American Bash and Teddy Long put Hassan's manager, Daivari in a match with The Undertaker on the earlier version of SmackDown."
"After Daivari was defeated, Hassan began to pray on the entrance ramp and five masked men came out that were dressed in black shirts, ski-masks, and camo pants. They were armed with clubs and a piano wire and they beat and choked the Undertaker out, and Hassan put him in the Camel Clutch."
"Three days later before the episode aired, the London bombings took place and UPN didn't have enough time to edit the segment out of the episode and they showed the unedited version in the United States and Canada but was removed from airing in Australia and Europe."
"UPN urged the WWE to remove Hassan's character from television which they succeeded in when Copani was released from his WWE contract on September 21, 2005."
"The word “free” in “free software” means ""freedom"", not ""price"". People are allowed to sell Free software, but the person who buys the software can change it, give it away or sell it too."
"The words “free software” are sometimes used in English to just mean software that can be downloaded without paying money, which is confusing. Sometimes this software lets people make their own copies for other people, however it may not let people do all the things that they can do with real Free software, such as change it or sell it. In this case “free” means “free of charge”. To make the difference more clear, software that does not cost money should be called freeware; it is almost always proprietary software."

Zookeeper
"A zookeeper is a worker in a zoo, responsible for the feeding and daily care of the animals. As part of this, they clean the exhibits and report signs of bad health. They may also be involved in scientific research, and in public education, conducting tours or simply answering questions put by members of the public."
"Qualifications and pay of zookeepers both vary widely. A junior keeper in a small zoo may have no qualifications other than an affinity for the job, while a senior keeper in a large zoo would most probably have both a relevant college degree and extensive experience."
"Generally, a liking for animals and outside work and willingness to undertake moderate and sometimes dirty physical work are required. Many animals are themselves heavy and strong-smelling, as is the food some of them eat. Handling such is part of the job at times."
Cage
"A cage is a box which is made to keep something inside of, without it being able to get out (such as an animal). Cages are usually made of many metal bars."
"A cage which has birds in it is called a ""birdcage""."

Ronald McDonald
Ronald McDonald is an American clown character who is a mascot of the McDonald's fast-food restaurant.
"He wears yellow and red stripes and has wacky hair. He lives in McDonaldland, with lots of his friends.

The fictional character is a heroic magical adventurer that stands up good and freedom, such as saving the rain forest and supporting Ronald McDonald House Charities."
Actors.
"McDonald's has many actors employed to portray Ronald McDonald in restaurants and events. It is assumed, however, that the company uses only one actor at a time to play the character in television commercials."
This is a list of these main actors:
"An actor by the name of Joe Maggard stated in an interview of The Guardian in 2014 that he portrayed the Ronald McDonald character from 1995 to 2007. However, It was stated in a 2003 article by The Baltimore Sun that Maggard was only a stand-in actor for one commercial shoot in the mid 90s and stated that ""he is definitely not Ronald McDonald"", as Jack Doepke and David Hussey were the real current portrayers as Ronald throughout the time period Joe claimed he did. In 1998, he was charged of carrying a weapon in the New Hanover County, N.C., McDonalds and the next year he was convicted in making harassing telephone calls posing as Ronald. The judge ordered him to take anger management classes."

Tendons are often connected to joints.
Coffee substitute
"Coffee substitutes are products that try to taste like coffee. The idea for using them is to have a drink that tastes like coffee, but has no caffeine in it. The main reasons for making coffee substitutes are medical, economic and barbaric. In World War II, acorns were used to make coffee, however it tasted foul. It was also hard to get. In the American Civil War there was a similar story -"
"""For the stimulating property to which both tea and coffee owe their chief value, there is unfortunately no substitute; the best we can do is to dilute the little stocks which still remain, and cheat the palate, if we cannot deceive the nerves."" The Southern Banner, 1865"
Ingredients.
Grain coffee and other substitutes can be made by roasting or decocting various organic substances.
"Some ingredients used include: almond, acorn, asparagus, barley and malt, beech nut, beetroot, carrot, chicory root, corn, cotton seed, dandelion root, fig, boiled-down molasses, okra seed, pea, persimmon seed, potato peel, rye, sassafras nut, sweet potato."
"Chicory has been sold commercially on a large scale since around 1970, and it has become a mainstream product. It was widely used during the American Civil War on both sides. Chicory is a native plant of Western Asia, Europe, and Northern Africa. And the cultivation of the plant is considered to be originated in Egypt. In France, around the 1800s, chicory was used as an ingredient or substitute for coffee."
"Postum is an instant type beverage used in place of coffee. It made from roasted grains and molasses. Postum history goes back to 1895 when an American named C.W. Post created the coffee substitute, inspired by a caramel coffee recipe made by Harvey Kellogg. It reached the height of its popularity during World War II. It also really caught on with people who for health or religious reasons preferred not to consume drinks that contained caffeine. For popular usage on the sitcom Seinfeld George says to Jerry he does not know why postum is not a more popular beverage."

Croatian language
The Croatian language is spoken mainly throughout the countries of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the surrounding countries of Europe.
"Croatian grammar is the grammar of the Croatian language. The Croatian language consists of three vernaculars (Kaikavian, Chakavian and Shtokavian)."
"Croatian grammar books show that the codification of the language started at the beginning of the 17th century (the first grammar was written by Bartol Kašić in Latin in 1604). This means that the rules for the language were written down. From 1604 to 1836 there were 17 grammars. Most of them described the Štokavian dialect, but some were about Kajkavian. In the 19th century, more grammars based on Štokavian were written. They were ""Nova ricsoslovnica illiricka"", written by Šime Starčević (1812), and ""Grammatik der illyrischen Sprache"", written by Ignjat Alojzije Brlić (1833). Even before the 19th century, the three dialects of the Croatian language were almost equally used. However, the way each dialect was written down varied throughout Croatia. Near the Adriatic coast, it was more similar to Italian, and near the Hungarian border, it was more similar to Hungarian."
"All grammars of the above period (1604-1836) used three accents: acute, grave and circumflex, Starčević's grammar is an exception as it uses a system of four accents."
"In 19th century, Ljudevit Gaj proposed new letters from Czech (č,ž,š,ľ,ň,ď and ǧ). The letters that were accepted were č, ž and š, and from Polish, ć. For other phonemes (sounds), the digraphs that were accepted were ie, lj, nj and dž. Later dj or gj was changed to đ (according to proposal by Đuro Daničić)."
Orthography.
"The Croatian language uses a Latin script of 30 letters and one diphthong ""ie"" or ""ije"", and ""ŕ"". This system is called ""gajica"" in Croatian (or Croatian Gaj's Latin alphabet). The name came from Ljudevit Gaj. The letter order (and whole alphabet) is called ""abeceda"" in Croatian, because the first 4 letters are spelled ""a, be, ce, de"". For writing foreign names and words, and in some professions, the Croatian language uses letters which do not belong to ""gajica"", like ""X, x (iks), Y,y (ipsilon)"" and others."

Grammatical cases.
"In Croatian, nouns change form depending on the composition of the sentence. This is called declension. For people who are learning Croatian, declension is the most difficult part of the language to master. It is very complicated and time consuming to explain it and because of that we will use simpler techniques. However, many languages have noun and pronoun declension, including English. In English, though, only pronoun declension now remains. Let us start by explaining all of the seven Croatian grammatical cases. The technique that is most frequently used in determining grammatical cases (the same technique is used in Croatian schools when taught to children) is by asking yourself a question when you are trying to figure out which case a noun should be in. In Croatian, grammatical cases are called padeži (plural) and padež (singular)."
The question you will ask yourself here is: “Where is Krešimir going?”. And the answer is that he's going to school. By looking at the table below you will see that the question 'where' is used for the Locative case.

"Stauber first published on YouTube in 2013. His website was launched in late 2017. The website mostly has links to other content such as his social media and merch stores. Stauber also has a Patreon, where he releases unreleased songs and videos monthly. He also releases full versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These full versions are usually released later under ""Jack Stauber's Micropop""."
Early life.
"Stauber grew up in McKean, Pennsylvania. He has one sister, named Kharly. He majored in marketing and minored in studio arts at the University of Pittsburgh. In an interview, Stauber showed his favorite cartoon is Rugrats, and liked the art style, stating ""Take some time to watch a minute of the pilot of Rugrats if you haven’t seen that before. The art style is beyond incredible."""
Work.
"""Buttercup"" and ""Oh Klahoma""."
"Stauber's most famous work, ""Buttercup"", is the first song released on his 2017 album ""Pop Food"". The song, along with remixes and covers of it, became a popular internet meme, especially on TikTok, which helped with its success. The song currently has 279 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. Stauber did not release an official music video for it. The song has been described as ""bubbly, dramatic pop with Panda Bear-esque vocals."" YouTuber ""lisuga"" made a popular fan made video using clips from the Japanese film, ""Kick-Heart"". It is the most viewed Jack Stauber-related video on YouTube, with 191 million views as of May 2021."
"""Oh Klahoma"", the second track from ""Pop Food"", also became popular. The song currently has 74 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. The song is most famously used as background music to a TikTok trend called #ghostphotoshoot, where creators dress up as ghosts and take photos of themselves, sometimes wearing sunglasses and other fashion accessories. However, the trend has become controversial, with critics saying the bedsheet costumes used look like KKK robes."
Style.
"Stauber's visual style is known to be different, with some YouTube videos being dedicated to attempting to replicate the aesthetic that he utilizes in many of his videos. Stauber himself commented under one such video, expressing that he was impressed with the result. Meg Fair of ""Pittsburgh City Paper"" highlighted Stauber's knack of ""pulling unrelated sounds and influences into [his] music"" and liked his ability to switch styles quickly. Jenna Minnig of ""PennState CommMedia"" compared Stauber's music to Ariel Pink's; as both have hypnagogic-pop styles and have similar voices, but believed it was not needed to compare the two. Fans of his music include American rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, actor, rapper, and comedian Andy Milonakis, actor Verne Troyer, indie singer-songwriter Sidney Gish, and model Paris Jackson."
Animations.
"Along with music, Stauber is known for his animations. They are usually separated into three styles: ""surreal"", characters with odd and striking facial expressions and frequently part of his claymations, ""colorful"", which usually are featured in his VHS animations and music videos, and ""Stauber faces"", light-skinned characters with cartoon noses. Stauber is also well known for his frequent use of teeth in his videos and animations. He usually uses detailed resin teeth on his clay characters, although he has used real teeth. He has encouraged fans to send him teeth for him to use in his videos."
"To make his animations, Stauber uses Microsoft Paint for the drawings. He then sequences the frames in Adobe Premiere Pro, and then runs the finished video through a VHS tape."
Discography.
Albums.
Stauber has four albums on both his Bandcamp and Spotify. Stauber uses the Plopscotch Records label to put copyright on his music.
Jack Stauber's Micropop.
"Stauber also publishes under the name ""Jack Stauber's Micropop"", releasing longer versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These songs are less popular than his songs and albums released under his main name, Jack Stauber. These extended versions are often released early for Stauber's Patreon supporters. Under the Micropop name, Stauber has released six EPs and one compilation album, along with two soundtracks for his works with Adult Swim."

Locating (physics)
"The act of locating something, of finding or defining the location of something, is a basic idea of modern science. In physics to say what ""to locate"" or ""location"" means, we must explain with clear talk how we do the job of locating something."
"For things about our size, we generally use two beginning points that everybody knows about, and then we measure from those points to the thing we want to give a location. We might start with the Plymouth Rock and the Blarney Stone. We could then say, ""Captain Smith's ship is 1400 miles from Plymouth Rock going toward the Blarney Stone."" Or, in another case we might say, ""Captain Jones's ship can be found by drawing a line from Plymouth Rock to the Blarney Stone, finding a point 700 miles along this line from Plymouth Rock, taking a left turn of 90° upon reaching this point from Plymouth Rock, and then traveling an additional 90 miles."
"If we have some good way of knowing compass directions, we can say something like, ""Go three miles north of that big white rock over there and then go two miles east from that point. That is where I put the gold."""
"Finding the location of something is ordinarily done by seeing it somewhere, hearing it somewhere, feeling it somewhere, etc. Sometimes we know where something is by looking at a photograph, finding it with radar, or pinging it with sonar."
"It is much more difficult to locate an electron, a photon, or anything else about that small. We may construct a light source that only makes one photon at a time. We can aim the light source at a piece of photographic film, let the light source make one photon, and then develop the photographic film. If we had very sensitive photographic film that could be darkened by only one photon, then we would find a tiny speck of silver where the photon ended up. A silver atom is much larger than a photon, so there would be some fuzziness about where the photon ended up, but people probably would agree that the photon must have ended up somewhere within the target formed by the silver atom. However, all we can say is that the photon must have been at that point when it ended its existence. When a photon is absorbed by an electron it gives its energy to the electron and disappears. So when it was briefly at some definite place it immediately lost all of its motion."
"Another way to locate a photon is to make it go through a small place. Knowing when the light source sends out a photon, and knowing the speed of light, we can know when it must be going through a hole in a plate put in the center of its path to the film. We can gradually get closer and closer to finding out exactly where it is in the middle of its flight. However, the path that it will take from there on becomes progressively wild. That is because when a photon goes through a hole like that it experiences diffraction."
Let 'Em In
"""Let 'Em In"" is a single released in 1976, performed by Paul McCartney. The song reached the Top 3 in the United States and across the United Kingdom. This single has been covered and sampled by other musicians."
Trajectory
"The Trajectory something follows is its path through space and time. If a cannon is fired, its shell will follow a certain path depending on how much was used, how heavy the is, and the up and down that the cannon is aimed at."

"Dyas became an orthopedic surgeon in Mobile, Alabama after his college football career. He died from stomach cancer on January 23, 2011 at the age of 71."
"Wayne County, Michigan"
"Wayne County is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2010 census, 1,820,584 people lived there. It is the 18th most-populous county in the United States. The county seat is Detroit which is the largest city in Michigan."
History.
"Wayne County was one of the first counties formed when the Northwest Territory was created. It was named for the American general ""Mad Anthony"" Wayne. When it was created, the entire area of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and small sections that are now part of northern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois were part of Wayne County. On August 15, 1796, the boundaries of Wayne County were set to begin at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River then west to Fort Wayne, then to the southernmost point of Lake Michigan and along the western shore north to the territorial boundary in Lake Superior and then along the territorial boundary through Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, and Lake Erie back to the starting point."
"On January 14, 1803, the Governor of Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, changed the boundary. This new boundary included Chicago, Illinois and a large strip of Wisconsin along Lake Michigan."
These boundaries were later changed again when Indiana and Illinois became states and as other counties were created in Michigan Territory.
Geography.
"The county has a total area of . Of this, (or 91.36%) is land and (or 8.64%) is water Parts of the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair are included in the county."
"The eastern boundary is a water boundary in the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair with Essex County, Ontario, Canada. Cars crosses this boundary at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and the Ambassador Bridge."
Grosse Ile is the largest island in Wayne County. It is connected to the mainland by the Wayne County Bridge and the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge.
"In short, moksha symbolizes something which is beyond comprehension; too great and too wondrous to be truly understood, it can only be felt when one attains it. The world is truly a beautiful place, but the greatness that lies within is even more so, since the power of the greatness is completely unknown."
"After all, isn't that what beauty is; appreciation of the unknown!"
For a more comprehensive explanation of this topic read the books:
Moksha is the ultimate goal of a person to get liberated from the cycle of birth and death
Caste
"The caste system is a system in India that was once mainly used by Hindus. This system has been generally accepted for about 3000 years. There are four castes in this system, and one outcast group regarded as ""untouchables"". There are also castes in countries other than India as the system spread to South Asia about 2000 years ago. For centuries, this system has dictated one's marriages, geographical location, and occupation. People must not marry someone from another caste, and they must not do things that another caste does. The Indian government today works to decrease this discrimination with the quotas set in government jobs in 1950."
Brahmin
Brahmin is one of the part of four varnas in Hinduism. Brahmins are the highest and most respected among people. In ancient India people who read the complete Upanishad Brahmanak were called Brahmins
Caste system.
"The caste system classified people by jobs. The people in this caste were mostly priests and dramatists in the Aryan society. The Brahmins arranged prayers and rituals. Parashurama was one of the well known Brahmin by birth, but throughout his life, he was a warrior whose job was to protect Dharma. Parshurama is also Creator Father of Bhumihar Brahman and Bhumihar Thakur, Bhumihar's are also known as Parashurama Brahman &amp; Bramhkshatriya. Most Brahmins practice vegetarianism. An old tradition is that Brahmin Men pulled there foreskin back since childhood, with an Glansring, because of became clean in this part"
"There are many subgroups in Brahmins based on demography. Rishiswar, Sanadhya, Kanyakubj, Telang, Saryupareen, Bhumihar, Goswami, Tyagi, and Saraswati are the main streams of Brahmin. Across the subcontinent, other Brahmins are also believed to have switched from the traditional duties of Brahmins in favor of military and administrative ones. In other parts of the subcontinent, outside of Punjab and the Gandhara region, they have been known as the Tyagi Brahman and ""brahma-kshatriya"" groups. These groups also claim to have descended from the Parshuram Tyagi Brahmans of Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh; traditionally, they have a close relationship and brotherhood with Mohyals."
"Some Mohyal Brahmins migrated eastward and became as some sub-divisions of Bhumihar Brahmins, some of whom are also descendants of Hussaini Brahmins and mourn the death of Imam Hussain.[7] Bhumihar Brahmins and Tyagi/ Mohyal Brahmins have an affinity and brotherhood for each other. The  Bhumihar Brahmins, of whom many, though not all, belong to the Saryupareen Brahmin division of Kanyakubja Brahmins.In Kerala Ezhavathy is also a Mohyal community.[8]"
The Brahmins of Vedic Period.
"The Brahmanas of the Vedic period were regarded as the most knowledgeable people and the best of best in all arts. Therefore, not all Hindus worship other Gods."
The sub-groups.
"In Tamil Nadu, The Iyers and Iyengars are well known Brahmin communities. Iyers are mostly worshippers of Shiva and the Iyengars are Vaishnavites."
DNA.
"The majority of the Males in Brahmin caste belong to of Y-DNA R1a1* Haplogrup, interestingly the same Haplogroup can be found view in the Roma people too"
Kshatriya
"Kshatriya is a division of the caste system in Hinduism. A ""kshatriya"" is a warrior, ruler, politician, or administrative worker."
There are 3 lineages of Kshatriyas:-
"However, there is one more lineage (not mentioned in any Puranas) - Nagavanshi (snake-born), who claims descent from the Nagas."
Vaishya
"Vaishya is a division of the caste system. A vaishya is a trader, merchant or artisan."
Shudra
Shudra is a division of the caste system. A shudra is considered a servant or peasant. Shudra and Ati-shudra indicates the bottom most ranks in the Indian caste system.
"Mahatma Jyotirao Phule set out the history of shudra-ati-shudra communities in his book ""Gulamgiri."" He drew the attention to the exploitation of Shudras, Ati-shudras, and women etc. At this time, most prefer not even to touch such castes."
"After the Cold War, Romania became closer friends with Western Europe. In 2004, Romania joined NATO and hosted the 2008 summit. The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the European Union and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a member on January 1, 2007."
Geography.
Romania is a part of southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea and the Danube River. The Carpathian Mountains lie in the center.
"Romania is the biggest country in southeast Europe by population. It has an area of . It is the twelfth-largest country in Europe. Most of Romania's border with Serbia and Bulgaria is made by the Danube. The Danube joins the Prut River. The Prut River makes the Moldovan–Romanian border. The Danube then flows into the area of the Black Sea inside Romania. This makes the Danube Delta. The delta is a biosphere reserve and a biodiversity World Heritage Site. Some of the other major rivers in Romania are the Siret, the Olt, and the Mureş. The Siret River runs from the north to the south of Moldavia. The Olt River runs from the Carpathian Mountains to Oltenia. The Mureş runs through Transylvania from the east to the west."
Landscape.
"The land in Romania is made up of equal parts of mountains, hills, and low-lying areas. The Carpathian Mountains make up a big part of the center of Romania. Fourteen of its mountain ranges are taller than . The tallest mountain in Romania is Moldoveanu Peak, with a peak altitude of ."
Rivers.
The Danube is the longest river in Romania. Its length inside Romania is about . That is almost half of the length of the entire Danube. Almost all of the rivers in Romania are either direct or indirect tributaries of the Danube.
Weather.
Romania has a climate that changes between temperate and continental climates. The reason for the climate changes is because Romania is near the coast. Romania has four different seasons. The average temperature during the year is in southern Romania and in the northern part.
"Lots of rain and snow falls on the highest western mountains. Most of this falls as snow. In the southern parts of the country, the amount of rain and snow that falls is around ."
"The lowest temperature ever taken in Romania was , at Braşov in 1944. The highest temperature ever recorded in Romania was , near Calafat in the 1950s."
Society.
These are the development regions of Romania:
Language and culture.
The official language of Romania is Romanian. The Romanian language is an Eastern Romance language.
"Romania has its own culture because of where it is found. It is the point where 3 different areas meet: Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans. Romanian culture is a mix of all these areas. The culture of Romania was influenced by the Greeks, Romans, and Slavs."
Religion.
"Romania is a secular state. This means Romania has no national religion. The biggest religious group in Romania is the Romanian Orthodox Church. It is an autocephalous church inside of the Eastern Orthodox communion. In 2002, this religion made up 86.7% of the population. Other religions in Romania include Roman Catholicism (4.7%), Protestantism (3.7%), Pentecostalism (1.5%), Islam (1%) and the Romanian Greek-Catholicism (0.9%)."
Cities.
"Bucharest is the capital of Romania. It also is the biggest city in Romania, with a population of over 2 millions peoples."
"There are 5 other cities in Romania that have a population of more than 300,000 people. These are Iaşi, Cluj-Napoca, Timişoara, Constanţa, and Craiova. Romania also has 5 cities that have more than 200,000 people living in them: Galaţi, Braşov, Ploieşti, Brăila, and Oradea."
"Thirteen other cities in Romania have a population of more than 100,000 people."
Economy.
"Romania joined the European Union on January 1, 2007. Romania's economy is healthy. Currently, Romania makes around $350 billion in Gross domestic product and a GDP per capita of $16,540."
"Long into the 1900s, Romania was still a largely agricultural country. During Communism 1947-1989, the country had planned economy. The transition from planned economy to a market economy after the communist regime led to economic collapse in the 1990s, the reasons was that more money was printed, expensive prices and substantial privatization of the companies, which initially leads to skyrocketing unemployment. The reforms in the 1990s allowed foreign investors for the first time to buy land in Romania. When it was going explosively good for the industry in the Latin countries such as France, Italy and Spain, these countries began to trade with Romania because it is favorite voice country for them to grow in. Foreign companies expanding in Romania since then, and spurs the market."
Education.
"The Romanian school is obligatory for 10 years. Children also have the opportunity to be part of a voluntary pre-school at an early age 3–6 years. After school, students can voluntarily take the entrance exam to high school, which has a range of practical and theoretical lines. There are over 40 higher educational institutions, including five universities and five technical colleges. Tuition is free and is a hot political commitment even at the university. The country's minorities have the opportunity to receive instruction in their native language. Since 1989, education has been reformed. But it has been slow and the standard of education varies greatly in different parts of the country, education has improved the standard of urban compared to rural areas where quality can be very low. Romania participates fully in the EU's education program."
Social welfare.
The unemployment rate in Romania is five per-cent and has been low for many years.
"The living standards were very low at the end of the Communist era, but the situation was just only improved a little bit during the 1990s. On the contrary, the living significantly due caused by the large privatization of jobs that resulted in high unemployment and rising prices. In later years lived yet 2010 nearly 10 percent of the population in absolute poverty and of these, 90% live in rural areas. The State social insurance system have relatively broad coverage but resources are extremely small."
"Reforms have been initiated and in 1999 the health insurance became privatized and paid by the employers and the employees. Several thousand local trade unions were founded after the revolution, which were later amalgamated (combined) into federations. These unions and federations have helped organise students, pensioners and the unemployed; because these groups of people all have similar needs, concerns and goals."
"As President, Roosevelt worked to make the U.S. a world power, one of the most powerful countries in the world. Before, it had been the richest country in the world, but not a significant military power. Roosevelt's foreign policy was described by an African proverb as ""speak softly and carry a big stick"", meaning you do not have to make war, but should give that impression if you are to be respected. He increased the size of the United States' navy and sent all of the ships across the world to demonstrate to other countries that the United States was strong and could fight if needs be."
"He continued the Monroe Doctrine and used the country's military might to influence Latin American politics. He had the Panama Canal built (which allowed ships to travel in less time by taking a shortcut). In doing so, he created the independent country of Panama, which before was part of Colombia, by invading it. He also took a part for the United States, which is where the canal was built. It was not turned over to Panama until 1999. As president, he was interested in what happened in other countries. In 1905, he helped to end the war between the Russian and Japanese empires. Everybody thought Russia would defeat Japan, but the result was the opposite. Roosevelt met both parties and convinced them to sign a peace treaty. He won a Nobel Peace Prize for this work in 1906. He was the first president of any country to win the prize."
"At home, Roosevelt fought for all Americans having a ""Square Deal"", meaning an equal chance for all Americans to become successful. As part of his Square Deal, he regulated big businesses called trusts, and forced several of them to split up in several smaller companies. This should support competition, which he thought was important. Roosevelt supported labor laws for the working class, required meat and drugs to be inspected, and protected the environment. He created several nature reserves. These ideas would influence later presidents to expand the government's role in the economy and to help ordinary workers. Many in the Republican party opposed him because of this, however."
After being president.
"Roosevelt did not run for president in 1908, as he had the office for nearly eight years. He wanted his Solicitor General, William Howard Taft to run for president instead. Taft was chosen, and Roosevelt went to Africa to hunt big game. However, when he came back, he thought Taft was not doing a good job and taking too little actions against so-called trusts. Taft was also more conservative and he did not continue all of Roosevelt's progressive policies. He decided to challenge Taft for the Republican nomination in 1912. He failed, but many Republicans preferred Roosevelt, and instead he launched his own party, the Progressive party. While running for president and holding a speech, he was shot, but lived and even finished his speech. Because the Republican voters split between Roosevelt and Taft, they both lost to Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt also thought Wilson was not doing a good job, either, and wanted the U.S. to enter World War I after it broke out. He prepared to run again, for the third time, in 1920. Nobody had served more than eight years at the time. Roosevelt died, however, on January 6, 1919 of a pulmonary embolism and a heart attack in his sleep. Because he was so strong, a newspaper commented that ""death had to take Roosevelt asleep"", because if he had been awake there would have been a fight between him and death."
Other Information.
"Besides being president, Roosevelt was an author and historian. He wrote 35 books about politics, ships, and hunting. He is thought to be one of America's presidents who read the most. He owned a large ranch in North Dakota. He also hunted large animals throughout the world and was active with the Boy Scouts of America."
Legacy.
Roosevelt is one of four Presidents to be carved in stone on Mount Rushmore. Historians consider him one of the best U.S. presidents.
Namesake.
"Theodore Roosevelt is the namesake of many American schools. He has a national park in North Dakota named after him, a type of elk (big deer), as well as river in Brazil. The popular stuffed animal doll, the ""Teddy bear"", was named after Roosevelt."
Two US Navy ships are named after him:

Notes
Composer
"A composer is someone who writes (composes) music. Some composers work by writing music down on paper; this is called 'written notation'. Classical music writers work this way. Writers for TV and movie music also usually write this way, so that an orchestra or other players can read the music and play it."
"Some musicians are very good at improvisation. This means that they think up (invent) the music as they play it. Some church organists are good at improvising. During a service they may need to play some organ music to fill in the gaps while people are collecting money or taking communion. Jazz musicians are usually excellent at improvising. Improvisation is not written down, so each time it is different."
Popular and rock or soul music writers are often not able to read and write music down. Many pop and rock composers compose their songs on a guitar or piano. Cole Porter and Irving Berlin usually composed at the piano.
"Many songs are written by two or more people. It is common for two people to work together to write songs. Sometimes, one person writes the music and one writes the words (the lyrics). Some songs such as folk songs were composed many years ago and no one knows who wrote them."
Cannes Film Festival
"The Cannes Film Festival is an event held every year in Cannes, France. The festival previews films from around the world."
Only those who are invited can attend the festival. The top film wins the Palme d'Or. The second most prestigious trophy is the Grand Prix. A jury selects which film earns the prizes. The jury is led by an internationally recognized personality of cinema. Being appointed to this position is the recognition of an outstanding career.

Henry VIII
"Henry VIII (28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547) was the King of England from 1509 until his death in 1547. He is perhaps one of England's most famous monarchs because he split England from the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope, and because he married six times."
"Henry VIII increased the power of the monarchy and government over the country. Many people he did not like were executed under his orders, including two of his own wives. He was easily led by whoever his favourite advisor was: Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Cranmer and Richard Rich. More and Cromwell were also executed. He passed laws to merge Wales into England and was the first English monarch to be King of Ireland."
BRIT Awards:
Invention
"An invention is a new thing that someone has made. The computer was an invention when it was first made. We say when it was ""invented"". New things that are made or created are called inventions. Cars and plastics are inventions that everyone knows. Inventions are made by inventors. Many inventions are patented."
"Ideas are also called inventions. Writers can invent characters, and then invent a story about them."
Inventing.
"Over time, humans have invented objects which make life easier for themselves. Because of this, a quote ""necessity is the mother of invention"", was written. The quote means that a lack of something should inspire someone to create something to fill that empty space. However, not all people believe that this is true. They think that too much of something can lead to an invention."
Many inventions are just a variation of something that already exists.
Genocide
"Genocide is the crime of killing many people who are all part of one ethnic or religious group, or some sort of similar group, and trying to destroy that group. Genocide is done usually by a group, such as a government, or military group, not by one person or a small number of people. Usually, the motivation for genocide is based on political reason."
"The word genocide was made up by Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew, in 1944, from the words ""genos"" (Greek for family, tribe or race) and ""-cide"" (from the Latin ""occidere"", to kill). It was first used to the Nazi Holocaust, when many groups, including Jews and others, were killed."
Ustashe of Croatia are another example of genocidial horror. About a million of Serbs were killed in WWII in Ustashe concentration camps especially in Jasenovac. Another example of genocide was when about a million of the Tutsi group of people of Rwanda were killed along with Hutus who were against the genocide in 1994.
"In 1933 Lemkin made a speech to the Legal Council of the League of Nations conference on international criminal law in Madrid, for which he prepared an essay on the ""Crime of Barbarity"" as a crime against international law. The purpose of the crime, which later evolved into the idea of genocide, was based mostly on the experience of Assyrians massacred in Iraq on 11 August 1933. The event in Iraq reminded him of earlier similar events of the Armenian Genocide during World War I."
"Today, any genocide is prohibited by the Genocide Convention and actor or inciter of genocide is judged by the International Criminal Court."
Examples.
Today most people see the following events as genocide. Note that the events listed are just examples.
Yoko Ono
"is a Japanese musician and artist. She is the widow of John Lennon. Before she married Lennon she was married to Toshi Ichiyanagi from 1956 to 1963 and Anthony Cox from 1963 to 1969. She has two children, Kyoko Chan Cox (with Cox) and Sean Lennon (with Lennon)."
Early life.
"Both of her parents came from wealthy families. Her father, who was a descendant of a former Emperor of Japan, had been a concert pianist before giving up music to become a banker. Ono was tutored privately, then sent to exclusive private schools, studying classical music and art, and also learning English. She visited the United States before World War II with her family. Her father was on a business trip to the U.S. when the war began, and was with many other Japanese in the country. He was not able to communicate with his family for many years. Ono's mother took her, her brother and sister away from Tokyo, and they stayed in a rural area."
"After the war ended, the family was reunited, and moved to New York for her father's job. Ono enrolled in Sarah Lawrence College, but quit during her third year. She became interested in art and music, and began writing poetry. Many of her poems were instructions, for creating pieces of art. She later published some of these in a book, titled ""Grapefruit"". Her parents were not happy that Ono chose to make her own way, rather than following her family's wishes for her life. When she married Toshi Ichiyanagi, a young pianist, her parents her."
"The marriage did not work out, and Ono rented a loft apartment of her own. She became friends with local artists in New York, including Andy Warhol and a group called Fluxus. She hosted small parties and ""happenings"" for her artist friends, and began to do artwork of her own. This brought her some notoriety in time, but not fame. She remarried, to Tony (Anthony) Cox, and they had a daughter, named Kyoko."
Marriage to Lennon.
"Ono went to London with Cox and Kyoko during 1966, to promote her career as an artist. John Lennon, who was a member of The Beatles, went to one of her art shows. He enjoyed the (fantasy-like) quality of her work. Ono and Lennon became friends, and later lovers, as each lost interest in their spouses. Lennon wanted them to be together as much as possible. He broke a rule the Beatles had never to bring a wife or girlfriend to their recording sessions. He brought her along anytime he could. They were married in March 1969, after they were both divorced."
"Many Beatles fans blamed Ono for ""breaking up"" the band through her influence on Lennon. He seemed to many people to have ""gone crazy"" since meeting her. Some suggest that Ono simply encouraged Lennon to do things he'd already wanted to do, but let himself be talked out of doing in the past – including quitting the Beatles. Ono and Lennon started a new, part-time group they called the Plastic Ono Band. They also tried to have a baby together. Ono miscarried several times, until their son Sean Lennon was born in 1975, on Lennon's 35th birthday. Ono was also able to with her family, during the 1970s."
"Ono was Lennon's ""muse"", inspiring his music and his creative side, for the rest of his life. The two worked together on both his post-Beatles records, and Ono's wish to also have a music career. She was more interested in ""experimental"" music than in classical or popular music. Ono's songs and unique style sounded strange to most listeners. It was offensive to many people, who thought Lennon should have either stayed with the Beatles, or made more music in their style. Ono changed her style, and began to write and record more pop songs, but her music never became popular. Years later, some younger musicians (such as The B-52's) admitted they had liked Ono's music. They were inspired by it, as Lennon had been."
Since 1980s.
"After Lennon's murderer in 1980, Ono recorded several solo albums. The first was titled ""Season of Glass"". Her later records were praised by some music critics."
"When Sean Lennon grew up, he also became a musician. He helped Ono to compile (collect and put in order) her old recordings, and make some new ones. She also revived some of her earlier artwork, and gave the money made from sales and exhibits to charities. Ono recently (2006) appeared at the opening of ""Love"", a Cirque du Soleil show featuring Beatles music, to help promote it."
Spenserian stanza
"The Spenserian stanza is a fixed verse form invented by Edmund Spenser for his epic poem ""The Faerie Queene"". Each stanza contains nine lines in total. The first eight lines are in iambic pentameter, that is consist of ten syllables, followed by a single alexandrine line in iambic hexameter, that is are made up of twelve syllables. The rhyme scheme of these lines is ""a-b-a-b-b-c-b-c-c."""
"Many poets used the stanza after Spenser, for example Lord Byron (Chlide Harold's Pilgrimage), Percy Bysshe Shelley (Adonais), John Keats (The Eve of St. Agnes) and Alfred Tennyson (The Lotos-Eaters). Spenserian stanza remained a typical English form and it was never much popular outside England. Only few poets employed it in Central Europe, for example Juliusz Słowacki, Jan Kasprowicz and Jaroslav Vrchlický."
Biotti
Biotti is an Italian surname. Notable people with the surname include:
African fish eagle
"The African fish eagle (""Haliaeetus vocifer"") or the African sea eagle is a large species of eagle."
"It is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa where there are large bodies of open water with plenty of fish. It is the national bird of Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Sudan."
"This species looks a bit like the bald eagle. They are related, but live on different continents. The bald eagle lives in North America."

Fatima Naoot
"Fatima Naoot (Arabic: فاطمة ناعوت ) (born September 18, 1964) is an Egyptian writer and poet. In January 2016, the Egyptian government sentenced Naoot to jail for 3 years after she wrote on Facebook about killing sheep for the Eid holiday."
Work.
Naoot was a candidate for the Egyptian parliament.
Naoot wrote several books of poetry and a book of poetry analysis. She also translated collections of poems from English into Arabic.
Insulting religion.
"Fatima Naoot always seeks for freedom without any authority even if this authority will belong to any religion. In October she published a post on Facebook was describing ""the Eid Al-Adha’s tradition of slaughtering sheep as the “greatest massacre committed by human beings.” Then one candidate from parliament said that ""Her aim is to insult Islam"". Thus she wrote through Ahram Online report ""that humans justified their lust for killing and enjoying the smell of cooking game by attempting to bestow a divine meaning to their actions.” And because of the law that added in 1982 a legislation which stated that there is from six months to five years and fines of LE500 to LE1000 for anyone who uses religion to promote, through speech, writing, or any other medium, extremist ideas with the aim of spreading discord or to belittle one of the monotheistic religions or their different sects, or to harm national unity. she put in jail for 3 years and fined 20.000 LE. Although she said in front of the court that ""she did not aim to insult Islam, but she just explained her point of view. Naoot said through Middle east online ""I’m not sad about the sentencing as I don’t care about going to jail. I’m sad that the efforts of reformists have been wasted,”. As a result, THE ARAB NETWORK FOR HUMAN RIGHTS INFORMATION issued a statement which is ""“the recent surge in the prosecution of opinion makers comes in conjunction with a fierce security campaign launched by security bodies against freedom of opinion and expression, with the aim of narrowing the overall climate of freedom of opinion and expression. Such a matter, in turn, makes Egypt one of the most Arab countries that show hostility to freedom of expression as well as press freedom, especially that about 59 journalists have remained in prison so far.” Fatma is not a political figure, she is an Egyptian writer, poet, translator and journalist who always says her point of view."

Hashemi Rafsanjani
"Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (, ""Akbar Hāshemī Rafanjānī""), Hashemi Bahramani (; August 25, 1934 – January 8, 2017) was an influential Iranian politician. He has been the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran from 1989 until his death in 2017."
"""Forbes"" magazine listed Rafsanjani in their list of richest people in the world and has written that as the real power behind the Iranian government, he ""has more or less run the Islamic Republic for the past 24 years."" His wealth has earned him the infamous nickname of ""Akbar Shah"" in Iran."
"Rafsanjani was President of Iran from 1989 to 1997, losing on the second ballot to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 election on his attempt for a third term in office. After this, he has tried to use his position in the Expediency Council to denounce President Ahmadinejad's administration. He said he would do some privatizations and change foreign policy. However, President Ahmadinejad has noted Rafsanjani's failure to make a difference between privatization and self takeover of government-owned companies. Ahmadinejad has also commmented on the foreign policies of Rafsanjani's administration which lead to sanctions against Iran in 1995 and 1996."
"Currently, one of his sons has been accused of receiving a bribe. Analysts expect that his son will not be put on trial, however."
"Rafsanjani died on January 8, 2017 in Tehran from a heart attack, aged 82."

"Porthmadog Football Club is a football team, playing in the League of Wales. The club was started in 1884."
Sharia
"Sharia, Sharia law or Islamic law is a set of religious principles which form part of the Islamic culture. The Arabic word ""sharīʿah"" () refers to the revealed law of God and originally meant ""way"" or ""path""."
"Classical sharia deals with many aspects of public and private life, including religious rituals, family life, business, crimes, and warfare. In former times, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists, who based their legal opinions on Qur'an, Hadith and centuries of debate, interpretation and precedent. Some parts of sharia can be described as ""law"" in the usual sense of that word, while other parts are better understood as rules for living life in accordance with God's will."
Modern countries in the Muslim world all have their own laws. In most of them only a small part of the legal system is based on classical sharia. Muslims disagree on how sharia should be applied in the modern world.
Meaning and origins.
"People of different religions who speak Arabic use the word ""sharīʿah"" to describe a religious tradition that comes from teachings of prophets. Christians and Jews in the Middle East have used it to describe their own religion. For many Muslims the word ""sharia"" means simply ""justice"". They will say that any law agrees with sharia as long as it helps to build a more fair and prosperous society."
"Most Muslims think that sharia should be interpreted by experts in Islamic law. In Arabic, the word ""sharīʿah"" refers to God's revelation, which does not change. In contrast, the rules of behavior created by scholars as they try to understand God's revelation are called ""fiqh"". These rules can change and Islamic scholars have often disagreed about them."
"The Indian Ocean is the ocean surrounded by Asia to the north, Australia and the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is named for the river Indus and Ancient India on its north shore. The Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are all parts of this ocean."
"The deepest point in the Indian Ocean is in the Java Trench near the Sunda Islands in the east, 7500 m (25,344 feet) deep. The average depth is 3,890 m (12,762 ft). The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean, 28,350,000 square miles in size. The majority is in the southern hemisphere."
Arctic Ocean
"The Arctic Ocean is the ocean around the North Pole. The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean. Thick pack ice and snow cover almost all of this ocean in winter, and most of it in summer. An icebreaker or a nuclear-powered submarine can use the Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans."
"The ocean's area is about 14.056 million km2, which is the smallest of the world's 5 oceans, and it has of coastline. The central surface covered by ice about thick. The biology there is quite special. Endangered species there include walruses, whales and polar bears. Year by year the Arctic Ocean is becoming less icy, as a result of global warming."
"The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is . The deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin, at ."
Geography.
"The Arctic Ocean covers an area of about 14,056,000 km2. The coastline is 45,390 km (28,200 mi) long It is surrounded by Eurasia, North America, Greenland, and by several islands."
"It is generally taken to include Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, White Sea and other bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Bering Strait and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea and Labrador Sea."
"Countries bordering the Arctic Ocean are: Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and the United States."
Climate.
"The Arctic Ocean is in a polar climate. Winters are characterized by the polar night, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies."
"The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater. Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater but its salinity is less than other oceans. The temperature must reach −1.8 °C (28.8 °F) before freezing occurs."
Ice covers most of the Arctic Ocean. It covers almost the whole ocean in late winter and the majority of the ocean in late summer. Much of the Arctic ice pack is covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50 cm (7.9 to 19.7 in).
"The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the eocene epoch, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20 °C (50–68 °F). The surface waters of the Arctic Ocean warmed enough to support tropical lifeforms."
Animal and plant life.
Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem. The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean. They feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Inuit
"The Inuit are one of many groups of First Nations who live in very cold places of northern Canada, Greenland, the Arctic, and Alaska."
"They are sometimes called ""Eskimos"", a word which likely comes from the Algonquin language and may mean ""eater of raw meat"" which is a fallacy many believe due to misinformation. The term Eskimo means ""netter of snowshoes. Most Inuit prefer to be called by their own name, either the more general Inuit particularly in Canada or their actual tribe name. Inuit is a tribe name but not all indigenous Arctic peoples in North America are Inuits. Particularly in the United States Alaska, the word Eskimo would be accepted as a more general term, but would probably refer to themselves by their tribe name."
Etymology.
"Inuit in Canada and Greenland like the name ""Inuit"" because it is their own name for themselves. ""Inuit"" means more than one, one person is an ""Inuk"". The native Greenlanders are related to the Inuit. The language of the Inuit is Inuktitut, and it is one of the official languages of Nunavut and of the Northwest Territories in Canada. Eskimo is a term more frequently used in mainstream United States where such concerns get less attention."
"Inuits in Alaska have various concerns, such as protecting the caribou from American oil pipelines. Anti-seal hunt campaigns work to eliminate this aspect of northern culture, which most Inuits regard as vital to their lives."
Traditional culture.
"Inuit ate both raw and cooked meat and fish, as well as the fetus's of pregnant animals. Whale blubber was burned as fuel for cooking and lamps."
"Inuit were also Nomadic people, but they did not domesticate any animals except for dogs, which they used to pull their sleds and help with the hunting. They were hunter-gatherers, living off the land. They were very careful to make good use of every part of the animals they killed. Respect for the land and the animals they harvested was and is a focal part of their culture."
"Inuit lived in tents made of animal skins during the summer. In the winter they lived in sod houses and igloos. They could build an igloo out of snow bricks in just a couple of hours. Snow is full of air spaces, which helps it hold in warmth. With just a blubber lamp for heat, an igloo could be warmer than the air outside. The Inuit made very clever things from the bones, antlers, and wood they had. They invented the harpoon, which was used to hunt seals and whales. They built boats from wood or bone covered with animal skins. They invented the ""kayak"" for one man to use for hunting the ocean and among the pack ice."
"Inuit sleds could be built from wood, bone, or even animal skins wrapped around frozen fish. Dishes were made from carving soapstone, bones, or musk ox horns. They wore two layers of skins, one fur side in, the other facing out, to stay warm."
"Inuit had to be good hunters to survive. When an animal was killed in a hunt, it was thanked respectfully for offering itself to the hunter. They believed it intended to provide itself as a gift towards the survival of the hunter and his children. Their gratitude was deeply sincere and is an important aspect of their belief system. In the winter, seals did not come out onto the ice. They only came up for air at holes they chewed in the ice. Inuit would use their dogs to find the air holes, then wait patiently until the seal came back to breathe and kill it with a harpoon. In the summer, the seals would lie out on the ice enjoying the sun. The hunter would have to slowly creep up on a seal to kill it. The Inuit would use their dogs and spears to hunt polar bears, musk ox, and caribou. Sometimes they would kill caribou from their boats as the animals crossed the rivers on their migration."
"The Inuit even hunted whales. From their boat, they would throw harpoons that were attached to floats made of inflated seal skins. The whale would grow tired from dragging the floats under the water. When it slowed down and came up to the surface, the Inuit could keep hitting it with more harpoons or spears until it died. Whale blubber provide Vitamin D and Omegas to their cultural diet, and prevented rickets. The whaling industry around the world has depleted the whale population, and now traditional whale hunting for subsistence purposes is rare around the world. Inuits have added to their modern northern diet with grocery foods, which are normally very expensive in the north."
"Language revival tries to save a language that is dead or endangered. The Hebrew language was once a language that was not spoken, but the language was revived, and people now speak and use it again. Many people are now trying to revive their languages. The revival of languages is good, beautiful, and useful."

Objectivity (science)
"Objectivity in science means that scientific ideas and measurements are tested. That means they are independent from the individual scientist (the subject) who proposes them. In other words, if scientist A claims something, scientist B must be able to check whether A is right."
"The evidence can (in principle) be shown to anyone who doubts it. The ""in principle"" bit is because some science needs complex machinery, and if you don't understand the machinery, you won't understand the results. But elementary science can often be shown in a classroom, or on television."
"Some science does need a proper scientific education. To some extent the general public has to trust a qualified scientist to present the idea in some suitable form. That means on television or on the web, or perhaps in published articles or books. Most awards of the Nobel Prize in science are followed by presentations on various web channels."
"It is generally agreed that, at least in some subjects, modern science needs a person to have some education before they can understand it. Specialist communicators often do this on television or the web. 150 years ago, people read science directly from books written by scientists like Faraday and Darwin. Now most people get their science from people who act as communicators of science."
Objectivity in measurement.
"To avoid the variety in subjective (ambiguous) interpretation of quantifying terms such as ""green"", ""hot"", ""large"", ""considerable"", and ""negligible"", scientists try hard, where possible, to eliminate human senses by use of standardized measuring tools (meter stick, stopwatch, thermometer, etc.) and mechanical/electronic measuring instruments (spectrometer, voltmeter, timer, oscilloscope, gravimeter, etc.) for performing the actual measuring process, eliminating much of the perceptive variability of individual observers. The results of measurements are expressed on a numerical scale of standard units - so that everybody else understands them the same way. Where data must need be used, the ideal is to use ""hard"", ""objective"" criteria for assigning the classifications (see definition), such that different classifiers would get the same results."
Roundhay Garden Scene
"Roundhay Garden Scene is a short movie made on October 14, 1888 in the garden of ""Oakwood Grange"", Roundhay, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It was made by a French man named Louis Le Prince. It was silent. The movie had Adolphe Le Prince, Sarah Whitley, Joseph Whitley, and Harriet Hartley walking in the garden of Oakwood Grange. It is believed to be the oldest surviving movie by many people. It is 1.66 seconds long. The digitalized version lasts 2.11 seconds."
Herpetology
"Herpetology is the branch of zoology concerned with reptiles and amphibians. It is about cold-blooded animals like salamanders, frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, turtles, tuataras and crocodilians."
Herp.
"""Herp"" is a vernacular term for reptiles and amphibians. It is derived from the old term ""herpetile"". Linnaeus grouped reptiles and amphibians together in the same class, and that is where the term comes from. The term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of reptiles and amphibians, and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles and amphibians. There are over 6700 species of amphibians and over 9000 species of reptiles."
Batrachology.
Batrachology is the study of amphibians. Batrachology can also mean that a person enjoys amphibians and are among their favorite pets.

2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami
"The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami was a 9.0-magnitude earthquake followed by tsunami waves. It was measured at 8.4 on the JMA seismic intensity scale The earthquake happened off Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, on the east coast of the Tōhoku of Japan, on March 11, 2011 at 05:46:23 UTC. It was at a depth of 24.4 km (15.2 miles). It was the most powerful earthquake to hit Japan in recorded history. It was also the fourth most powerful earthquake on Earth since modern record-keeping began in 1900."
"On 10 February 2015, the Japanese National Police Agency report confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing."
Earthquake.
"Days before the main earthquake, there were several foreshocks. The biggest one was a 7.2 magnitude earthquake on 9 March, about from the main earthquake's location."
The United States Geological Survey said the centre of the earthquake was from Tokyo. A 7.7 aftershock happened 30 minutes following the first quake. There have been more than 600 aftershocks bigger than magnitude 4.5 or more.
"The earthquake damaged buildings and started fires. The Shinkansen high speed bullet trains were stopped and Haneda Airport was closed after the quake. Various train services around Japan were also stopped. Hundreds of flights to Japan were cancelled due to the earthquake and tsunami, affecting many people. A large fire broke out at an oil refinery in Ichihara, Chiba prefecture."
"The nuclear power plants shut down automatically. At first the Japanese Prime Minister said that no radioactive material leaked. About 51,000 people were moved away from the nuclear reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima city when its cooling system failed. There are fears that the nuclear reactor might meltdown."
Tsunami.
"The earthquake started a tsunami warning for Japan's Pacific coast and other countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Guam, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Hawaii, Northern Mariana Islands (USA) and Taiwan. The tsunami warning issued by Japan was the most serious on its warning scale. It warned that the wave could be as much as 10 meters high. A 0.5 meter high wave hit Japan's northern coast. Kyodo news agency reported a four-metre-high tsunami hit the Iwate Prefecture in Japan. Miyagi Prefecture was flooded, with waves carrying buildings and cars along as they travelled inland. In some areas the waves reached 10 km inland."
"At 9:28 p.m (HST) the National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning until 7 a.m. for all of Hawaii. Tsunami waves were expected to arrive in Hawaii at 2:59 am local time. A wave two meters high reached California, after travelling across the Pacific Ocean at a speed of 500 kilometres per hour. A man in California was drowned after being swept into the ocean while trying to take a photograph of the tsunami wave."
Effects.
Deaths–Injured–Missing.
"The Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing across 18 prefectures, as well as over 126,000 buildings damaged or destroyed."
Nuclear disaster.
"The Fukushima nuclear disaster began on March 11 2011, just hours after the initial wave. The connection to the electrical grid was broken. All power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat. There was a partial core meltdown in reactors 1, 2, and 3; hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1, 3, and 4; an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2; fires broke out at reactor 4. Despite being initially shutdown, reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat. Spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped. The accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the Chernobyl disaster, but more complex as all reactors are involved."
"There were 4.4 million households that had their electricity supply cut off, including 11 nuclear power plants."
Geophysical impact.
"The quake moved parts of northeast Japan as much as closer to North America, making parts of Japan's land ""wider than before,"" according to geophysicist Ross Stein. Areas of Japan closest to the epi-center shifted the most."
"The Pacific plate itself may have moved westwards by up to . Other estimates put the amount of slippage at as much as , covering an area some long by wide. If confirmed, this would be one of the largest recorded fault movements to have been associated with an earthquake."
"According to Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the earthquake shifted the Earth's axis by . This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth. The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass."
"The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earth's rate of rotation. These are expected changes for an earthquake of this magnitude."
Transport.
"The Tōhoku Expressway, which serves northern Japan, had to be closed due to cracks on the roads. The whole railway network was closed, but was reopened hours after the earthquake. Up to 100,000 people were stuck waiting for a ride straight out of the city."
Television broadcast.
"In response to the great disaster, Emperor Akihito directly addressed his subjects in a television broadcast. This was the first time any emperor had used television in this way."
Other help.
"There were other people from other countries helping people after this disaster. For example, Google set up a people finder service, which allowed users to ask for or post information about missing people."

Article Five of the United States Constitution
Article Five of the United States Constitution outlines how the Constitution can be changed. Changes to the Constitution are called Constitutional amendments.
"Article Five also says that there are certain clauses, or parts, of Article One of the Constitution that could not be amended right away. These clauses are explained in the ""Protected clauses"" section."
Background.
"Before the Constitution was approved, the United States was covered by its first constitution, the Articles of Confederation."
"Under the Articles of Confederation, amendments had to be approved by a unanimous vote in all 13 state legislatures. Not only did every state legislature have to agree on the amendment. If a single state Senator or Representative in the country disagreed with an amendment, the amendment would fail. This made it basically impossible to get any amendments passed."
"When the Founding Fathers wrote Article Five, they were trying to make sure changing the Constitution was not too hard, but not too easy either. James Madison later explained that the amendment process in the Constitution ""guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults."""
"In Simple English, Madison meant that the amendment process protects equally against:"
Step 1: Proposing an amendment.
There are two steps in the process for changing the Constitution. The first step is proposing (formally suggesting) an amendment. Article Five of the Constitution allows this to be done in two different ways.
"The first way is the most common way. Any member of Congress can suggest an amendment. However, two-thirds (67%) of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives have to agree that the amendment is needed. If this happens, the proposed amendment moves to Step 2 in the process."
"As of 2020, the second way has never been used. However, it exists to protect the rights of the state legislatures. If two-thirds of the state legislatures ask them to, Congress has to call a Constitutional Convention. Delegates would come to the Convention from each state. The Constitutional Convention could propose as many amendments as they wanted to. All of the amendments they proposed would move to Step 2 in the process."
"At first, when the Founding Fathers were writing the Constitution, they were only going to give Congress the power to propose amendments. However, some of the Founders, like Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, worried that this gave Congress too much power. Madison and Hamilton re-wrote Article Five to add the second option for proposing an amendment, and the rest of the Founders agreed. Adding the second option helped make sure the states had power too the power to propose amendments if enough of their legislatures agreed."
Step 2: Ratifying the amendment.
"Step 2 starts when an amendment has been proposed, either by Congress or by a Constitutional Convention. The proposed amendment now has to be ratified. Like with Step 1, Article Five gives two choices for how an amendment can be ratified. Congress gets to choose which way to use."
"Congress has almost always chosen the first way: letting the state legislatures ratify the amendment. If three-fourths (75%) of the state legislatures ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution."
"The second option is for Congress to ask each state to create a ""ratifying convention."" This is a group of people not members of the state legislature who would decide whether or not to ratify the amendment. If ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution."
"Congress has only used the second option once: after it proposed the 21st Amendment. (This amendment cancelled the 18th Amendment, which made alcohol illegal in the United States. The 21st Amendment made alcohol legal again.)"
"At the time, Congress thought that this would be the more democratic option. A large majority of the people in the United States wanted the 21st Amendment to pass. However, Congress thought the state legislators would refuse to pass the amendment because of pressure from powerful groups that were against alcohol. In other words, Congress did not think that the state legislatures would vote the way the people of the United States would want. This example shows why the Founding Fathers included the ""ratifying convention"" option in the amendment process. If the state legislatures get too powerful, or do not represent what the people who elected them want, the people have the power to pass amendments too."
Edie Falco
"Edie Falco (born July 5, 1963) is an American movie, television and stage actress. She plays Carmela in HBO's ""The Sopranos"". She starred in ""Nurse Jackie"" as the title character. She also acted in many movies."
Cymbeline
"The Tragedy of Cymbeline is a play by William Shakespeare. It is based on a story in a book called ""Holinshed's Chronicles"" by Raphael Holinshed. Shakespeare also used ""History of the Kings of Britain"" by Geoffrey of Monmouth about the real-life British king Cunobelinus. Shakespeare also used a story in a book by Giovanni Boccaccio called ""Decameron"" for some details. The first known performance was in April 1611. It was first printed in 1623 in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays."
Systems engineering
"Systems engineering is a field of engineering that deals with complex engineering projects which should be designed and managed over the life cycle of the project. Therefore, issues such as logistics, the coordination of different teams, and automatic control of machinery become really complicated. Systems engineering deals with work-processes and tools to handle such projects. For this, it applies both technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering, industrial engineering, organizational studies, and project management."

As Keith Lemon, he has also made many appearances on ""Big Brother's"" companion shows ""Big Brother's Little Brother"" and ""Big Brother's Big Mouth""."
Hurricane Flora
"Hurricane Flora was among the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes. This hurricane happened in Autumn 1963. The storm hit southwestern Haiti at peak intensity (her winds peaked at 145 miles per hour). Flora then drifted over Cuba for almost four days before heading northeast into the Atlantic. Between seven thousand and eight thousand people died due to Flora. At that time, the death toll was the most from any storm since the Galveston Hurricane in September 1900. The name Flora was later retired."
Dance-pop
"Dance-pop is a genre of pop music that originated in the 1980s and is still popular nowadays. It incorporates elements of normal pop music, and it is (usually) fast-paced and upbeat. This is a common genre for many artists, including Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Rihanna, Kesha, Britney Spears, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and Katy Perry."
Electropop
"Electropop (also called technopop) is a musical genre in which electronic music and pop music are combined together. The genre has been popular since the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. ""Electropop"" is the short form of ""electronic pop""."

"They have had several Top 10 songs on the charts. Hits include ""Beautiful Life"", ""From Here"", and ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"". Other great songs are ""That Train"", ""North Dakota Boy"", ""Rocket Girl"", ""Driving With the Breaks On"", ""Coming Home"", and ""Whoever Made Those Rules""."
"“Simplicity is the best hook sometimes,” -Chris Thorsteinson."
Mechatronics engineering
"Mechatronics (or mechatronic engineering) is a combination of mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, computer engineering, control engineering, and systems-design engineering in order to design and manufacture some useful products. Mechatronics is an engineering system design that combines several areas of study and avoids splitting engineering into separate disciplines."
Tree of life (biology)
The tree of life is a metaphor which expresses the idea that all life is related by common descent.
Charles Darwin was the first to use this metaphor in modern biology. It had been used many times before for other purposes.
"Young children, because they weigh less than adults, are at particular risk of tertiary injury."
Quaternary injuries.
"Quaternary injuries, include flash burns, crush injuries from falling debris and inhalation injuries, which may make existing respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD worse."
Quinary injuries.
"This category of blast injury has been added fairly recently to classify injuries, which often results in a hyperinflammatory state may due to exposure to the environmental contaminants associated with the various types of explosive blasts including, bacteria, chemicals and radiation (""dirty bombs"") as well as adverse tissue reaction to fuel and metals in the blast."
Psychological trauma.
The psychological trauma which may occur in explosive blast survivors includes post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A concussion sustained in a blast may also be a risk factor for developing PTSD independent of a person's psychological reaction to the witnessed event. Psychological trauma may also occur in the complete absence of physical injuries.
Neurotrauma.
"Neurotrauma can occur due to the mechanisms of one or more blast injury categories. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue and/or organs also significantly contributes to blast-induced neurotrauma."
"Individuals exposed to blasts frequently have loss of memory for events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance. These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation."

"An entrepôt is a port, city, or trading post where goods may be imported, stored or sold. These cities grew because of the growth of long-distance trade."
European Union
The European Union (abbreviation: EU) is a confederation of 27 member countries in Europe established by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992-1993. The EU grew out of the European Economic Community (EEC) which was established by the Treaties of Rome in 1957. It has created a common economic area with Europe-wide laws allowing the citizens of EU countries to move and trade in other EU countries almost the same as they do on their own. Nineteen of these countries also share the same type of money: the euro.
"The name of Europe comes from the Latin Europa, which in turn derives from the Greek Εὐρώπη, from εὐρύς eurys ""wide"" and ὤψ ops ""face""."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is the most recent treaty that says how the Union is run. Every member state signed to say that they each agreed with what it says. Most importantly, it says which jobs (’powers’) the Union should do for the members and which jobs they should do themselves. The members decide how the Union should act by voting for or against proposals."
"The objective of the EU is to bring its member states closer together with respect of human rights and democracy. It does this with common rules about fair trading with each other, common agreements about law enforcement, a common style of passport, and other agreements. Most members share a common currency (the euro) and most allow people to travel from one country to another without having to show a passport. It does this with common rules about fair trading with each other, common agreements about law enforcement, and other agreements. It has a common style for (its) passports."
History.
"After World War II, the countries in Europe wanted to live peacefully together and help one another's economies. Instead of fighting each other for coal and steel, the first member countries (West) Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg created one European Coal and Steel Community in 1952."
"In 1957 in the Italian city of Rome, the member countries signed another treaty and made the European Economic Community. Now it was a community for coal, steel and for trade. Later it changed the name to the European Community."
"In 1993, with the ""Treaty of Maastricht"" it changed its name to the European Union. Now the member countries work together not only in politics and economy (coal, steel and trade), but also in money, justice (laws), and foreign affairs. With the Schengen Agreement, 22 member countries of the EU opened their borders to each other, so people can now travel from one country to the other without a passport or identity card. Many of the countries of the EU also share a currency, which is called the euro. 10 new countries became members of the EU in 2004, 2 more became members in 2007, and 1 more in 2013. In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. Today there are 27 member countries altogether."
Free movement.
"A person who is a citizen of the European Union can live and work in any of the 27 member states without needing a work permit or visa. For example, a French person can move to Greece to work there, or just to live there, and he or she does not need permission from an authority in Greece."
"In the same way, products made in one member country can be sold in any other member country without any special permissions or extra taxes. For this reason, the members agree rules on product safety - they want to know that a product made in another country will be as safe as it would be if it had been made in their own."
Main institutions.
Institutions of the European Union
Council of the European Union.
"The Council of the European Union is the main decision-making group. The cabinet ministers of the member countries meet (Ministers for Foreign affairs, for Agriculture, for Justice, etc...) and discuss issues that are important to them."
"Before the Treaty of Lisbon (written in 2007, implemented in 2008) each member state takes a turn at being President of the council for six months. For example, from January 2007 until July 2007, Germany held the presidency. The six months before that, Finland held the presidency. Now the President of the European Union chairs the council summits. The President of the council is the organiser and manager and is voted into office for a duration of two and a half years. He or she does not have the power to make decisions about the European Union like the President of the United States does for that country."
"Member countries with a large population (Germany, France, United Kingdom, etc.) have more votes than countries with small populations (Luxembourg, Malta, etc.) but a decision cannot be made if enough countries vote against the decision."
"Twice a year, the heads of government (Prime Ministers) and/or the heads of state (Presidents) meet to talk about the main issues and make decisions on different issues. This meeting is different and not as formal. It is known as a European Council."
European Commission.
"The European Commission runs the day-to-day running of the EU and writes laws, like a government. Laws written by the commission are discussed and changed by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union."
"The commission has one President and 27 Commissioners, selected by the European Council. The Commission President is appointed by the European Council with the approval of the European Parliament."
"The commission operates like a cabinet government. There is one Commissioner per member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state."
European Parliament.
"The Parliament has a total of 705 members (called Members of the European Parliament, or MEP). They are elected in their countries every five years by the citizens of the European Union member countries. The Parliament can approve, reject or change proposed laws. It can also sack the European Commission. In that case, the entire commission would have to give up their jobs."
Politics.
There are many discussions in the EU about how it should develop and change in the future.
The main reasons why European countries came together are political and economic:
Member States.
Medina
"Medina (; , ' , ""the radiant city""; or , ' (), ""the city""), also transliterated as Madīnah, is a city in the Hejaz, and the capital of the Al Madinah Region of Saudi Arabia. The city contains al-Masjid al-Nabawi (""the Prophet's Mosque""), which is the burial place of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and is the second-holiest city in Islam after Mecca."
"Medina was Muhammad's destination after his Hijrah from Mecca, and became the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire, first under Muhammad's leadership, and then under the first four Rashidun caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali. It served as the power base of Islam in its first century where the early Muslim community developed. Medina is home to the three oldest mosques, namely the Quba Mosque, al-Masjid an-Nabawi, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn (""the mosque of the two qiblas""). Muslims believe that the chronologically final surahs of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad in Medina, and are called Medinan surahs in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs."
"Similar to Mecca, non-Muslims are forbidden from entering the sacred core of Medina or the center of the city."
Overview.
"Medina currently has a population of more than 1,300,000 people (2006). The city was originally known as ""Yathrib"", but later its name was changed to Madīnat al-Nabī (مدينة ﺍﻟﻨﺒﻲ ""city of the prophet"") or ""Al Madīnah al Munawwarah"" (""the enlightened city"" or ""the radiant city""). The short form ""Madīnah"" simply means ""city"". Madina is the second holiest city of Islam, after Mecca (Makkah)."
Medina's religious significance in Islam.
"Medina is very important to Muslims. This is because the Prophet Muhammad is buried in a mosque known as 'Masjid-e-Nabawi' or 'The Mosque of The Prophet'. The Mosque was built on a site next to Muhammad's home. Muslims believe that Prophets must be buried at the very same place that they die. Accordingly, Muhammad was buried in his house. The tomb later became part of the mosque when it was expanded by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I. The first mosque of Islam is also in Medina. It is known as ""Masjid Quba,"" (the Quba Mosque)."
"Like Mecca, the city of Medina only permits Muslims to enter. The ""haram"" (area closed to non-Muslims) of Medina is much smaller than that of Mecca, though. Many facilities on the outskirts of Medina are open to non-Muslims. In Mecca the area closed to non-Muslims extends well beyond the limits of the built-up area. Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their annual pilgrimage. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina each year to visit the 'Tomb of Prophet' and to worship at mosques in a unified celebration. Muslims believe that praying once in the Mosque of the Prophet is equal to praying at least 1000 times in any other mosque."
Doctrine
"Doctrine (Latin: ""doctrina"") is a code of beliefs or ""a body of teachings""."
Doctrine often means several religious dogmas that a church teaches.
"But it can also mean a principle of law, in the common law traditions, established through a history of past decisions, such as the doctrine of self-defense, or the principle of fair use."
"In matters of foreign policy, a doctrine, also known as dogma, is group of fundamental rules for a nation's foreign policy. Examples include the Monroe Doctrine, the Stimson Doctrine, the Truman Doctrine, the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Nixon Doctrine, the Brezhnev Doctrine, the Kirkpatrick doctrine, and the Bush Doctrine."
Religious usage.
Examples of religious doctrines include:
One department of the Roman Curia is called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.
Military usage.
"The term also applies to the concept of an established procedure to a complex operation in warfare. The typical example is tactical doctrine in which a standard set of maneuvers, kinds of troops and weapons are employed as a default approach to a kind of attack."
Examples of military doctrines include:
Citron
"The citron (""Citrus medica"") is a species of citrus fruit. It usually has a thick rind and small sections. Originally, the tree came from Southeast Asia. Today it is mainly grown in Sicily, Morocco, Crete, and Corsica, as well as Puerto Rico. The tree can grow to a size of about 3 metres. The fruit can grow to a size of about 25 cm in length, and about 4 kg in weight. The pulp of the fruit is hardly ever used. The rind is used. It is made into an additive for cooking. Jam can also be made from the rind. The rind is also used to make vegetable oil, which is used for perfumes."
"Generally, it is eaten preserved or in bakery goods, such as fruitcakes. (The candied peel rather than the fruit is often used in cooking.) In some cultures, it is made into a fruity tea. Pliny the Elder states that in his time , the citron could only be grown in Media and Persia (""HN"" xii.7). The Romans tried to transport it into the Roman Empire in tightly packed pots, but failed, according to Pliny. There is evidence, however, which shows it was cultivated in the Mediterranean during Pliny's lifetime. Zohary and Hopf believe this tree was first domesticated in India. They think that its wild forms, along with those of the mandarin and pomelo, were the original citrus species."
"The citron has many names in different countries; one popular reference is ""Cedrat"", which is the French name for the fruit. Theophrastus referred to the citron as the Persian or Median Apple, and the fruit later came to be known as the Citrus Apple. Pliny calls the tree the Assyrian, or the Median, ""apple"" (the generic Greco-Roman name for globose fruits). Other citrus crops were not introduced to the Mediterranean basin until Islamic times."
"In many languages other than English, a normal lemon is called a ""citron"" and a Lime is called a ""limon"". Although the East Asian citrus fruit ""yuzu"" (also called ""yuja"") is sometimes called a citron, it is actually a separate species, ""Citrus junos""."
Cultivation and uses.
"The citron fruit is slow-growing. The citron tree is typically grown from cuttings that are two to four years old; the tree begins to bear fruit when it is around three years old. The fruit is oblong in shape, and sometimes as much as six inches in length. Its skin is thick, somewhat hard, fragrant, and covered with protuberances; the pulp is white and subacid."
"In Pliny's time the fruit was never eaten (it began to be used in cooking by the early 2nd century), but its intense perfume was used, penetrating clothes to repel noxious insects (compare Citronella)."
"In Hebrew, the citron is known as the etrog (). It is one of the Four Species used during the holiday of Sukkot each fall. The role of the citron in that holiday was portrayed in the Israeli movie Ushpizin. Citrons that have been bred with lemon (in order to increase output per tree and make the tree less fragile) are not kosher for use as part of the Four Species."
"The recorder is one of the oldest and most popular woodwinds and has been used to great effect by greats, such as Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi. The general public is normally only familiar with the plastic, child's version of the recorder, but professional and high-quality recorders are still made of wood."
"The saxophone may look like a brass instrument, but it is played like a clarinet and therefore it is a woodwind instrument. It is usually played in bands and jazz groups."
Use.
Woodwind instruments are played in several ways. The flute is played by blowing across the top of the mouthpiece. It is like blowing across the top of an empty bottle. The oboe and bassoon both have a double reed. It is like blowing through a drinking straw. Bagpipes have double reeds which are inside the mouthpiece (“enclosed reeds”). The clarinet and saxophone have single reeds which are clamped against the opening of the mouthpiece.
"In comparison, brass instruments are all blown in the same way: by blowing against a cup-shaped mouthpiece. This is why the saxophone cannot be called a brass instrument, although it is made of brass."
The way that a player shapes his mouth to blow an instrument is called the “embouchure”. Woodwind instruments have several different embouchures.
"In an orchestra there may be two each of flutes, oboes, clarinets and bassoons. In larger orchestras, particularly from the Romantic period onwards, there may be three or four. Sometimes the extra instruments such as the piccolo are used. If, for example, in an orchestral piece the third flute is marked “doubling piccolo”, it means that the person playing flute 3 will also play the piccolo. However, if the piccolo plays at the same time as flute 3 they will obviously need an extra player for the piccolo part."
Woodwind instruments in an orchestra often have short solos. These will be played by the first player (the “section principal”).
Bewitched
Bewitched is a comedy television show that was shown on TV by ABC from 1964 to 1972. It is about a man who is married to a witch.
"The lead characters are Darrin and Samantha Stephens. Samantha twitches her nose or moves her hands to make a spell happen. Samantha was played by Elizabeth Montgomery. Darrin was played by Dick York from 1964 to 1969. Because of illness, Dick York left the show and was replaced by Dick Sargent who played Darrin from 1969 to 1972. Samantha's mother Endora was played by Agnes Moorehead. Endora dislikes Darrin and often makes things difficult for him."
Dumbo
"Dumbo is a 1941 American animated movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It was first released on October 23, 1941 by RKO Radio Pictures. The fourth movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics, ""Dumbo"" is based upon a child's book of the same name by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Perl. The main character is Jumbo Jr., a baby elephant who is cruelly nicknamed Dumbo. He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of flying by using them as wings. Throughout most of the movie, his only true friend aside from his mother is the mouse Timothy, making fun of the stereotype between mice and elephants. ""Dumbo"" was made to make up for the damages of ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"". The movie has been criticized in recent years as being ""racist"" (the leader crow in the movie was named ""Jim Crow"" and at some point in the 1950s was renamed ""Dandy Crow"" in attempt to avoid controversy, but the original name is still the one mostly known, although it was supposed to be just a sarcastic mockery to the Jim Crow laws in the Southern USA back then and was used only on the character's model sheets), yet is also considered to be one of Disney's best movies. It was an attempt to be simple and make profits for the Disney studio, is now generally regarded as a classic of animation. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features."
The story.
"Florida, 1941. Mrs. Jumbo sadly looks on how babies are delivered by the stork to other circus animals. As even a baby elephant makes a pretty heavy package, hers is the last to arrive, but soon becomes the laughing stock of the others because of his big ears, getting meanly named ""Dumbo"" by the others. When Mrs. Jumbo can not take the public making fun of her son, she is locked up as ""mad elephant"", and Dumbo finds himself all alone. A mouse named Timothy comes and scares the mean herd. He encourages Dumbo and tells the circus director to make Dumbo the top (literally) of an elephant pyramid stunt which ends up literally bringing the house down, and Dumbo is given the job of ""baby clown"" in a repetitive, humiliating and dangerous number as punishment. To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy brings him to go see his mother. The next morning, they find themselves up in a tree with a bunch of crows, who discover that Dumbo can fly."

Characters.
Dumbo the Flying Elephant.
"Dumbo is the main character in the movie. He is a fictional anthropomorphic elephant who has really big ears. He can fly using his big ears. Similar to Dopey from ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and Gideon in ""Pinocchio"", Dumbo has no spoken dialogue. However, in the live-action/puppet television series ""Dumbo's Circus"", Dumbo was voiced by Katie Leigh."
"In the movie, Dumbo is delivered by Mr. Stork, and is made fun of for the strange size of his ears. As his mother, Mrs. Jumbo, beats up the bullies who pick on her baby, the ringmaster has his helpers chain her up and lock her up in a trailer, which says: ""MAD ELEPHANT"". It is then that Timothy Q. Mouse looks after Dumbo. The two of them try to make Dumbo famous and get his mother free. Thanks to the help of a ""magic feather"" from some crows, Dumbo flies to fame, and gets his mother free."
Timothy the Mouse.
"Timothy Q. Mouse is a mouse who became the only friend of elephants Dumbo and his mother Mrs. Jumbo. He teaches Dumbo how to become the ninth wonder of the universe, and the only flying elephant in the whole world."
Mrs. Jumbo.
"Mrs. Jumbo is Dumbo's mother. Deeply depressed at not having her baby delivered, she loves her son more than anything. She becomes angry when the boys pick on him."
"Other characters include the other elephants who also make fun of Dumbo, the Ringmaster, the clowns of the circus, the Pink Elephants, Mr. Stork and the Crows who give Dumbo the ""magic feather"" and teach him to fly."
Release.
"Even though World War II was going on, ""Dumbo"" was still the most financially successful Disney movie of the 1940s. This was one of the first of Disney's animated movies to be broadcast, albeit severely edited, on television, as part of Disney's anthology series. The movie then received another distinction of note in 1981, when it was the first of Disney's canon of animated movies to be released on home video and also was released in the ""Walt Disney Classics"" Video Collection in 1985. That release was followed by remastered versions in: 1986, 1989, 1991 (Classics), and 1994 (Masterpiece). In 2001, a 60th Anniversary Special Edition was released that has original RKO titles. In 2006, a ""Big Top Edition"" of the movie was released on DVD that also has original RKO titles. A UK Special Edition was released in May 2007 and was a successful Disney release."
Reception.
"The movie received very good reviews and did well at the box office despite being released less than 2 months before ""World War II""."
Overcharge
"Overcharge is an economic term used in legal discourse about price fixing violations. An overcharge is the difference between what a buyer or seller ""actually"" paid for a good purchased from a cartel and what the buyer or seller ""would have"" paid in the absence of a price-fixing cartel. The total amount of the overcharges paid by customers of a cartel is the major component of damages that can be recovered by plaintiffs in private antitrust suits. Under U.S. federal antitrust law, buyers injured by cartel overcharges are entitled to triple the overcharges that they are able to prove in court."
"The overcharge has a one-to-one relationship to the Lerner Index, the most common measure of market power in economics. Both measures employ the same numerator (PM - PC), where PM is the observed market price and PC is the competitive benchmark price, but use different denominators. The overcharge ratio is (PM-PC)/PC, whereas the Lerner Index is (PM-PC)/PM. Both ratios are zero when a market is perfectly competitive or a cartel is ineffective in raising prices. The Lerner Index has an upper limit of one when the pure monopoly price is charged in a market. The overcharge has no upper limit."
Rye House railway station
"Rye House railway station is in Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire, England. It is on the Hertford East branch of the West Anglia Main Line, and train services are provided by Abellio Greater Anglia."
Services.
"The typical off-peak service is two trains per hour to London Liverpool Street via Tottenham Hale, and two trains per hour to Hertford East."
List of London Underground stations
"The London Underground is a metro system in the United Kingdom. It serves Greater London and the nearby districts of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. London Underground was first opened in 1863 which makes it the oldest underground metro system in the world."
Stations.
"This list includes all stations on the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway. Listed for each station is the line or lines serving it, the local authority and London Travelcard zone in which it is located, the date it opened, previous names and passenger usage statistics in millions per year."
"There are three instances where two separate stations share the same name: Edgware Road, Hammersmith and Canary Wharf. Although the Hammersmith &amp; City line platforms at Paddington are on the other side of the mainline station from the platforms of the other Underground lines, it is treated as a single station. It is currently shown this way on the Tube map, but has been shown as two stations at times. Canary Wharf has separate Jubilee line and Docklands Light Railway stations, which are shown as one station on current tube map."
Ratatat
"Ratatat is a Electronic Rock/Electronica duo with guitarist Mike Stroud and synthesizer driver and producer Evan Mast. The two met as collee students in Skidmore, started working together in 2001 under the name ""Cherry"". In 2004 they published their debut album Ratatat which includes songs such as ""Seventeen Years"", ""Germany to Germany"", and ""Desert Eagle"". Following, in 2006, Classics, then LP3, in 2008 was released."
"Other works done by Ratatat are single albums and remixes of other musicians. Single albums include ""Seventeen Years"", ""Germany to Germany"", ""Wildcat"", ""Lex"", ""Loud Pipes"", ""Shiller"", ""Mirando"", and ""Shempi"". Their most recent remix album ""Ratatat Remixes No. 2"" featured 14 remixes featuring: Young Buck, T.I, Ludacris, The Notorious B.I.G, Jay Z, Z-Ro, Devin the Dude, Juvenile, Beanie Sigel, Despot, Memphis Bleek, Slim Thug, Bun B, Young Jeezy, Kanye West, Beans, Saigon, and U.G.K."
The band is known for their unique use of eletronica style music that emphasizes guitar towards the front while keeping the beat flow in the background.
Their songs were featured in various media. Some examples would be :
"""Seventeen Years"" was featured in the 2008 movie ""Cloverfield""."
"""Loud Pipes"" was featured in the PlayStation game ""MLB 07: The Show""."
"""Dura"" was used in CSI Season 9, Episode 7 ""Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda""."
"""Montanita"" was used in Season 2 - Episode 2 of the NBC show Chuck"
"They have currently gone through their spring 2009 US tour, and their next upcoming show is scheduled to be in Arendal on June 23, 2009."
Binary form
"Binary form (also know as AB Form or movement of continuity) is a type of form of music pieces. The word Binary means ""in two parts."" The word Form is a kind of guideline for composers when they write a piece of music. So, binary form means ""An outline in two parts."" A musical piece in binary form is a musical piece with two sections."
Binary form was popular in the Baroque times and was often used for movements in sonatas for keyboard instruments. Each part of a binary form piece of music are usually repeated.
Minuets.
"Binary form was most commonly used in the Baroque era for short dances called minuets. The minuet's two parts are usually labeled as ""A"" and ""B."" In the A section of a minuet, the exposition is stated. This section almost always is repeated a couple times. The beginning part of the B section develops a slightly new musical idea, usually going to the dominant key, to add variation. Then it returns to the ""A"" key at the end. Some famous composers of minuets include Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel."
"The Sega 32X was an attempt to top the graphics of the Super Nintendo in the 90's. Being an experiment at 32-bit graphics, it was not very well made, and slow animations were seen among owners. The 32X later died, but Sega didn't stop there. Later, they made CD32X games, which required both the 32X and CD."
Sega Saturn 1994-2000.
"Sega Saturn was released on November 22/10, 1997/1999 in Japan/France. It was the first Sega video game console with 3D graphics. Sega released two versions of the Saturn : the first generation was black and with small controllers, and the second was white. One of its most popular games was Sonic R."
Sega Dreamcast 1998-2001.
"Sega Dreamcast (; originally called ""Dural,"" and ""Katana"") is the last machine made by Sega that can play video games. It was sold before the PlayStation 2, GameCube, or Xbox came out. However, not many people bought it after the PlayStation 2 was released, so in the end Sega decided to stop making them."

Notes
Primary school
"A primary school, elementary school or grade school is a school for children between the ages of about five and eleven. It comes after preschool. When children finish learning at primary school, they go to secondary school."
"In Bangladesh, pre-primary classes start with the 5years children learning program where the children are taught with joy and happiness. Students from ages six to eleven, they finish learning from primary school and prepared for secondary."
"In the United Kingdom, a primary school usually comprises a nursery and the first seven years of a child's full-time learning. In Australia and the United States, primary school begins with kindergarten. It lasts for six years, usually until the fifth or sixth grade. In the U.S., ""elementary school"" is a more common term for public primary schools. ""Primary school"" is often used in private or independent schools. (In private or independent schools the government does not give the schools money.)"
"In India, ""Primary Education"" means the 'Nursery', the 'Kindergarten' and four years of regular schooling thereafter. Admission to Nursery classes is for children above two years so that the age is 6+ when entering Class I. Children are taught language (mother tongue and English) reading/writing skills, basic arithmetic and quite a good amount of general information about the country, people, statesmen, great people, flora &amp; animals. However, this is true only for schools in the urban areas. Rural schools do not have Nursery or Kindergarten; they admit straight at Class I when the child is six. Further, the rural schools use the mother tongue as medium of instruction, not resorting to English in any way. Primary education is free in government schools. Moreover, rural primary schools offer free mid-day meals to children (the government pays for it) so that the drop out rate comes down. States of West Bengal, Maharashtra, Manipur, Nagaland and Kerala have done very good work in this way of spreading primary education."
"In Singapore, primary school refers to those students who are normally between the ages of 7 to 12. Primary School is classified as P1 to P6 for Primary 1 to Primary 6 respectively. At the end of P6, students sit for a national level Primary School Leaving Exam (PSLE) which is used for placement into Secondary School. Prior to Primary School, pupils attend Kindergarten School for 2 years."
"In Germany, the primary school is called ""Grundschule"" and is normally from first grade to fourth grade so it is usually for children who are between six and ten years old. In some eastern states, for example in Berlin, the Primary School is for children up to age 12. In most German states the children start learning English in third grade on a very low level, they learn how to count and the names of the colors and other easy things. But because of that low level a German child who has finished Primary School is normally not able to form correct English sentences. In Primary School the children are prepared for the secondary education. Primary School students attend three main subjects: Math, German and General Knowledge (""Sachkunde""). In General Knowledge the children learn about nature, about their own body, how to ride a bicycle safely and something about the city they live in and of course about Germany. Beside those main subjects the children attend subjects like arts, music and Physical Education."
Restaurant
"A restaurant (sometimes known as a diner) is a place where cooked food is sold to the public, and where people sit down to eat it. It is also a place where people go to enjoy the time and to eat a meal."
"Some restaurants are a chain, meaning that there are restaurants which have the same name and serve the same food. McDonald's, Burger King, and Pizza Hut are examples of chain restaurants that are all over the world. These restaurants serve fast food, that is, inexpensive food, prepared and served quickly. At some, you do not have to even get out of the car to eat. You can pay and get your order from a window. These places are called drive-throughs."
There are also chain restaurants that serve slightly more expensive food. They are called fast casual restaurants. Applebee's and Perkins are examples of this type of chain restaurant.
"Haute cuisine or 'fine dining' is found in a guide, such as the ""Michelin Guide"", the most famous restaurant guide in the world. Their 3-star rosettes are given only to restaurants with the highest standards of cooking and service. Interestingly, the Guide gives more 3-stars to Tokyo and Kyoto than to Paris, London and New York together. Traditionally, the restaurants of top hotels such as the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo or the Hôtel Ritz Paris were the main places recognized for fine dining. Today, most Michelin Guide restaurants are separate establishments."
Ancient history.
"In Ancient Greece and Rome there were small restaurant-bars offering food and drinks. They were called ""thermopolia"" (singular ""thermopolium""). Many dwellings did not have kitchens, and eating out was an important part of socializing."
"In Pompeii, 158 ""thermopolia"" with service counters have been found. They were along the main road of the town and round the public spaces."
Skimmed milk
"Skimmed milk (United Kingdom), or skim milk (United States of America) is made when all the cream (also called ""milkfat"") is removed from whole milk. Sometimes, only half the cream is removed, resulting in semi-skimmed milk instead."
"Skimmed milk is more popular in the United States than Britain. It contains less fat than whole milk, some nutritionists and doctors recommend it for people who are trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight."
In the UK milk is marketed and labelled as follows:
In the USA milk is marketed primarily by fat content and available in these varieties:
Low-fat milk
has sufficient milk fat removed to bring the levels between 0.5-2 %

Ķekava
"Ķekava is a town in Latvia with town rights since 2022. It is the center of the Ķekava District. As of 2022, Ķekava had a population of 5,446 people. Ķekava is on small river Ķekaviņa near river Daugava. Reservoir of Riga hydroelectric power station is to north-east from the town."
"Ķekava was a small village until 1970s (with population of 333 people in 1967). After, a new chicken meat factory was built. A new workers village was built and it grew the population."
Roads.
"Roads from Ķekava: Riga—Warszawa (A7), Riga bypass road (A5), Ķekava-Plakanciems (V6), Ķekava bypass road (not built yet). The center of Riga is 17 km from Ķekava to north-west."
Attempted assassination of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner
"On 1 September 2022 Argentina's former president and current vice president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had a gun pointed at her head by a man outside her official residence in the neighborhood of Recoleta, Buenos Aires. As the man tried to kill her, the gun failed. No shots were fired. He was arrested on the scene."
Facts.
"On September 1, 2022, at 8:50 p.m. (local time in Argentina), the vice president of Argentina arrived at her home after a session in the Senate. Fernández was signing copies of her book ""Sinceramente"" outside her home, when Fernando Andrés Sabag Montiel, about 35 years old, pointed a 32-caliber Bersa gun at the president's head. He pulled the trigger twice but none of the magazine's five serviceable cartridges were chambered. The object had a damaged serial number."
Supporters of the vice president gathered at the scene to sing songs in her support.
Attacker.
"Fernando Andrés Sabag Montiel is the person who tried to fire at Cristina Fernández. He has a record for carrying a knife. He lives in the La Paternal neighborhood. In photographs of the attacker released by the media, a tattoo of the black sun, a neo-fascist symbol, can be seen on his elbow."
Investigation.
Sabag was quickly arrested by the victim's security and police elements. He was taken to a police tent where he is interrogated. Elements of the Argentine scientific police carried out expert investigations on the site.
"Alberto Fernández, president of Argentina, announced that María Eugenia Capuchetti is the judge in charge of the investigations and the prosecutor is Carlos Rívolo."
The president asked the judicial authorities for speed in the clarification as well as to take care of the detainee's life.
Background.
"For a week, the corner of the vice president's apartment has been in constant presence of sympathetic protesters, this presence responded to the previous presence of opposition protesters, in turn incited in response to a breakthrough in one of the corruption cases linked to Lázaro Báez on August 22."
Controversy.
"After the event, several doubts arose from some sectors of the population and the media, due to the way in which the assassination attempt against Fernández was raised. For example, the police had mistakenly broken into a home of the detainee, Sabag Montiel, but his real home had been located after a person showed up at a police station claiming that he had rented it for eight months , citing the serious lack of security on the part of the police to protect Fernández, Sabag Montiel came to aim just a few centimeters from his face."
"The attacker posted photos of his tattoos with Nazi symbols, such as the black sun, on Instagram, which generated speculation that if he worked alone or is part of an organization; political scientist Pedro Núñez told DW Español that ""the Justice obviously has to act quickly, since the worst that could happen is that this is diluted over time and more and more conspiracy theories appear about what happened."""
"Some Peronist politicians accused the opposition of promoting ""hatred"" towards Cristina Kirchner. The former president of Bolivia, Jeanine Áñez, accused Fernández of ""self-victimizing"" and ""blaming"" the opposition without any investigation and impose a political holiday. The provincial deputy of Santa Fe, Amalia Granata, said that the attack on Fernández was ""armed"" and is ""a pantomime"" to victimize her."
The attack is added to the list of presidents of Argentina who suffered assassination attempts
Michelle Visage
"Michelle Visage (born Michelle Lynn Shupack; September 20, 1968) is an American radio DJ, singer, actress, media personality, television host producer and former showgirl."
"As a member of the band Seduction, she earned five singles with the group that charted on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. In 1993, as lead vocalist in The S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M., she reached the top of the dance charts. In 2011, she joined the American reality competition series ""RuPaul's Drag Race"". She has served as a permanent judge since season three. She is also a permanent judge on ""RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars"", ""RuPaul's Drag Race UK, ""and ""RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under""."
"There were 193 households of which 25% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40% were married couples living together, 10% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40% were non-families."
"The median household income was $34,375, and the median family income was $55,750. About 22% of families and 25% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33% of those under the age of 18 and none of those 65 and older."

Probability density function
"In probability and statistics, a probability density function is a function that characterizes any continuous probability distribution. For a random variable ""X"", the probability density function of X is sometimes written as formula_1. The integral of the probability density function in the interval formula_2 yields the probability that a given random variable with the given density is contained in the interval provided. By definition, the probability density function is non-negative throughout its domain, on which the integral sums up to 1."
Probability density versus probability mass function.
The probability mass function is to a discrete probability distribution what the probability density function is to a continuous probability distribution. The probability density function is necessary to be able to work with continuous distributions.
"A random variable with a continuous probability distribution can take on any value within that distribution. Casting a dice will give the numbers 1 to 6, with a probability of formula_3, but this is not a continuous function, as only the numbers 1 to 6 are possible."
"In contrast, two people will not have the same height or the same weight. Using a probability density function, it is possible to determine the probability for people between and , or between and , even though there are infinitely many values between these two bounds."
Model airplane
A model airplane is a small sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. It may be a replica of an existing airplane or an imaginary aircraft.
"Model aircraft are generally divided into two basic types, flying and non-flying. Non-flying models are also called static, display, or shelf models. Flying models range from simple toy gliders to powered scale models. Some can be very large, especially when used to simulate the conditions of a real flight. Static models range from mass-produced toys to highly accurate models used for museum display."
Aircraft manufacturers and researchers use wind tunnel models. They are used for testing new designs and development of new ones. Sometimes only part of the aircraft is modeled.
Heidi Cruz
"Heidi Suzanne Cruz (née Nelson;born on August 7, 1972) is an American investment manager at Goldman Sachs. She is the spouse of Republican Texas senator and 2016 U.S. presidential candidate Ted Cruz."
Personal life.
"Heidi Suzanne Cruz was born on August 7, 1972 in San Luis Obispo, California, and grew up in a Seventh-day Adventist family. Cruz's political interest developed when she traveled to Washington with her parents at age 8, and grew when she was age 12 and read an issue of Time magazine concerning the 1984 presidential election."
"She graduated with a B.A. in Economics and International Relations from Claremont McKenna College in 1994. She was active in Claremont McKenna's Republican group, but was asked to resign after spying on Bill Clinton's campaign for reelection. In 1995, she received a Masters of European Business from Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management in Brussels, Belgium and in 2000, she graduated with a M.B.A. from Harvard Business School."
"Heidi married Ted Cruz on May 27, 2001. Heidi met Ted Cruz while the two were working together on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. In April 2008, Cruz gave birth to her first child, Caroline Camille Cruz. Her second daughter, Catherine Christiane Cruz, was born in 2011."
Career.
"In 2003, she worked for the Bush administration on economic policy, eventually becoming the director for the Western Hemisphere on the National Security Council under National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice in 2003. She left Washington DC in 2004 to support Ted Cruz's run for elective office in Texas."
"Cruz has worked for three investment banks, JP Morgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs."
"In 2005, she joined Goldman Sachs, serving as a private wealth manager and is currently the Region Head for the Southwest Region in the Investment Management Division of Goldman Sachs in Houston."
2016 presidential election.
"Ted Cruz said that the decision for him to run for president was difficult for his wife, because she was busy with her business career and raising their 2 children. She changed her mind after listening to a CD from her sister-in-law."
"Cruz was there the day her husband announced his run for president in March 2015. When Ted Cruz was criticized for not being born in the United States and running for president, Heidi defended Cruz by saying that the questioning showed that Ted Cruz was winning and his opponents wanted to defame him as a result."

Their three principles.
"MUJI is based on three core principles, which remain unchanged to this day:"
"Their products, born from an extremely rational manufacturing process, are succinct, but they are not in the minimalist style."
"They think simplicity and emptiness yield the ultimate universality, embracing the feelings and thoughts of all people."
History.
"1980 Seiyu Co., Ltd.’s private brand “MUJI” was born"
1985 MUJI Business Division was established
"1989 Established Ryohin Keikaku Co., Ltd."
"1990 Transferred the business rights of “MUJI” from Seiyu Co., Ltd."
"1991 Started overseas expansion (first store in the UK, first store in Hong Kong)"
1997 Received the PLMA (International PB Product Manufacturers Association) Excellence Award
"2000 Established MUJI HOUSE Co., Ltd. (currently MUJI HOUSE Co., Ltd.)"
Countries of operation.
"As of August 2021, 497 MUJI stores were opened domestically and 571 stores were opened in 32 countries and regions around the world."
"China(299), Hong Kong(20), Taiwan(54), Korea(39)"
"England(7), France(7), Italy(6), Germany(8), Spain(4), Portugal(1), Ireland(1), Sweden(1), Poland(1), Switzerland(1), Finland(1), Denmark(1), US(10), Canada(9),"
"Singapore(10), Malaysia(9), Thailand(22), India(3), Australia(5), Philippines(5), Vietnam(2), Kuwait(3), UAE(7), Saudi Arabia(5), Bahrain(2), Qatar(2), Oman(1)"
Sustainability.
"MUJI contributes to the realization of a resource-recycling, nature-friendly society and a sustainable society through the products, services and activities it provides."
"As one of the examples, they collect unnecessary clothes at stores to circulate global resources and reduce waste.  The collected clothes are recycled as raw materials for clothes, re-dyed and resold as ""ReMUJI""."
"Also, as part of their efforts to reduce plastic waste, they have installed water dispensers in MUJI stores.  This is a water supply service that uses tap water that anyone can use for free if people purchase a ""bottle of water that you pack yourself"" at the store or bring their own bottle."
MUJI’s expanding activity.
MUJI wants to be a platform that responds sensitively to various issues that are occuring in society and solves them in a better direction from “conscience and creativity. This commitment drives them to various activities. Here are eight examples.
"The first one is “Resource Utilization”. As one of these activities, in order to support producers in areas where it is difficult to maintain paddy fields due to the aging of the population, they brewed sake by studying products with added value before general-purpose products, where prices are sluggish, with local people."
The second one is “Building Connections”. This is a service for mobile sales in rural areas and direct delivery from production areas at online stores.
"The third one is “Public Design”. As a concrete example, In April 2015, MUJI set up sofa benches in the gate lounges and natural oak tables and chairs in the food court of the Narita Airport Terminal 3 to create a pleasant environment in which passengers can relax."
"The fourth is “Simple Food”. At MUJI Diner and Cafe &amp; Meal MUJI, the person in charge goes to the production area and offers the ingredients selected."
The fifth is “Reduce Waste”. One example is ReMUJI. This is an initiative to recycle products that customers have used for years and those products that are deemed unsellable as a result of a glitch during the manufacturing and distribution process.
"The sixth is “Social Initiative”. In Japan, MUJI provides support for earthquakes and heavy rain disasters, and in developing countries, they are working to revitalize the region."
The seventh is “Long-lasting Homes”. MUJI Renovation Club and MUJI House provide a one-room space where people can easily change their life according to lifestyle changes and family growth.
"The last one is “Nature Conservation”. With the idea of “enjoying nature--naturally”, they operate three campsites and manage a total of approximately 700,000 tsubo of forests around the sites."

COVID-19 vaccine
"A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against COVID-19 (a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021."
"Several countries planned to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans were different. The United Kingdom used its National Health Service. Canada used its military. The United States sent vaccines to all fifty states and the state governments each made their own system."
"The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8, 2020. The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City. By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated."
Covid vaccination started for children aged 12-14 in India on 16 March 2022
Background.
"In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)which is organizing a billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidatesindicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. On 4May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021."
PittCoVacc.
"PittCoVacc is a vaccine invented by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in the United States. It was invented to protect people from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was the first vaccine candidate, meaning vaccine that scientists thought would work well, published in a peer-reviewed study, meaning a scientific paper that other vaccine experts had read and approved before it was printed for people to read."
"As of April 2020, it has been tested in mice but not in human beings."
"PittCoVacc is short for ""Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine""."
Making PittCoVacc.
"One of the head scientists, Dr. Andrea Gambotto, said they made the vaccine so quickly because they had worked on other coronaviruses before: ""We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus. That's why it's important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from."""
"The researchers used laboratory equipment to make pieces of the same proteins that are in SARS-CoV-2. They put the proteins inside the bodies of laboratory mice using a microneedle array, meaning a small patch with about 400 tiny needles made out of other protein and sugar. One of the scientists, Dr. Emrullah Korkmaz, said these needles melt away inside the skin after they release the vaccine. The skin is a good place to put a vaccine because it has many immune cells in it. Then the mice made antibodies, or protective molecules, in their blood. The scientists measured the amount of antibodies and guessed it would be enough to fight off the SARS-CoV-2 virus if the mice were exposed to it. It took about two weeks for the mice to make lots of antibodies."
The scientists said it would be easy to make large amounts of vaccine and large numbers of microneedle arrays to use on people.
APN01.
"Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. These are human cells put together to act like part of the body, but they are not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called ""human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2"" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells. They named their hrsACE2 APN01."
Messenger RNA vaccines.
"Other scientists have developed vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus. They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make, than protein or whole-virus vaccines."
Messenger RNA vaccines need to be stored at very cold temperatures. Ordinary refrigerators are not cold enough.
Moderna vaccine.
"In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodiesbut they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021."
"The Moderna vaccine entered stage-three clinical trials on June 27, 2020. That means it is being tested on humans. Dr. Anthony Fauci said he did not think the vaccine would be dangerous."
"On November 16, Moderna said its vaccine was 94.5% effective. The vaccine has to kept colder than freezing but it does not have to be kept as cold as the Pfizer vaccine. Distribution began in February 2021."
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
"The German company BioNTech and Pfizer made a deal with the United States government to make 100 million doses of mRNA vaccine by December 2020. The vaccine completed phase I trials and started its next trial on July 27, 2020. Instead of being a phase II trial or a phase III trial, Pfizer's team was trying to do both phases at once. If the companies could make the vaccine on time, the U.S. government would give them almost US$2 billion. The vaccine is called BNT162b2. BioNTech paid its employees overtime to do extra work. They called this ""Project Lightspeed"" because they wanted to develop the vaccine quickly."
"Their second album was called ""Heroes &amp; Champions"" (2010). For this album they got the Swiss Music Award in the category Best Newcomer National. It includes the hits ""Listen To The Music"", ""Come Down With Me"" and ""Easy""."
"The third most successful album is ""Human.Technology"" produced in 2011. 0n the 27th of July 2012 it was on second place in the Swiss charts."
"They made a special edition called ""Human.Technology 2.0"". in 2012. The most popular songs are ""Man On Mars"", ""Rise Up (Black Dog)"" and ""Skyline"" (only on ""Human.Technology 2.0""). ""Skyline"" was used as official Swiss Olympic song in London 2012. It was a number one hit in Swiss charts."
"In September they started their Human.Technology Tour, in February a second one."
"Noah Veraguth is also known for his work with Stress and Bastian Baker. In 2011 he produces a song with Stress called ""Elle"". Together with M.A.M and Karolyn they made an album called ""Noël’s Room"" (2012) which is very successful."
Award.
"In 2010 they won the award in the category Newcomer National. In 2013 they got Best Hit National for ""Skyline""."
Erotica (Madonna album)
"Erotica is the fifth studio album from American singer Madonna. It was released on October 20, 1992 through Maverick Records. Six singles were released from the album, one being the title song. The album caused strong controversy. It was less successful than earlier albums by Madonna: it peaked at number two in the United States. Other songs were ""Deeper and Deeper"" and ""Bad Girl""."
Dutch Golden Age painting
"There was a period in the 17th century, where Dutch trade, science and art were among the most advanced in Europe. The period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. In general, this period started in the second half of the Eighty Years' War. After the war, there was the Dutch Republic which was the most propsperous nation in Europe. The historical period of the time was called Baroque. Many of the paintings of this period show the scenes more pretty than they really were. This is called 'idealisation'. The Dutch paintings of the time often lack this feature. Artists of the movement include Peter Paul Rubens, Johannes Vermeer, Bartholomeus van der Helst, and Jacob van Loo."
"There were relatively few paintings with religious themes during this period. The reason for this was that most Dutch were Calvinist. Calvinism forbade religious painting in churches. Even though such subjects were acceptable in private homes, they were not very popular. The other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present, but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres, sub-divided into numerous specialized categories, such as scenes of peasant life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes with animals, maritime paintings, flower paintings and still lifes of various types. The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists."
"There was a theory in painting, that some types of painting were more prestigious than others. This theory is known as ""hierarchy of genres"". Because history painting was at the top of the list, many painters wanted to produce historical paintings. The problem with this was that historical paintings were the most difficult to sell. To be able to live from their painting, many painters were forced to produce portraits or genre scenes, which sold much more easily. The hierarchy was as follows:"
"The Dutch concentrated heavily on the ""lower"" categories, but by no means rejected the concept of the hierarchy. Most paintings were relatively small – the only common type of really large paintings were group portraits. Painting directly onto walls hardly existed; when a wall-space in a public building needed decorating fitted framed canvas was normally used. For the extra precision possible on a hard surface many painters continued to use wooden panels, some time after the rest of Western Europe had abandoned them; some used copper plates, usually recycling plates from printmaking. In turn the number of surviving Golden Age paintings was reduced by them being overpainted with new works by artists throughout the 18th and 19th century – poor ones were usually cheaper than a new canvas, stretcher and frame. There was very little Dutch sculpture during the period; it is mostly found in tomb monuments and attached to public buildings, and small sculptures for houses are a noticeable gap, their place taken by silverware and ceramics. Painted delftware tiles were very cheap and common, if rarely of really high quality, but silver, especially in the auricular style, led Europe. With this exception, the best artistic efforts were concentrated on painting and printmaking."
Starving Time
"The Starving Time at Jamestown in Virginia Colony was a period of starvation during the winter of 1609–1610. During this time, all but 60 of the 500 colonists died. Lack of rain and access to water had crippled the agricultural production during the summer. Also, the water that the colonists drank was brackish and only drinkable half the year."
"According to historical accounts, the colonists ate dogs, snakes, cats, rats, horses, books and shoe leather through the winter. There is forensic evidence of at least one instance of cannibalism. The remains of a teenage girl ( 1595–1609), named ""Jane"" by researchers, showed signs of being butchered (cut up for eating). Examination of Jane's shin bone indicates she was probably 14 years old at the time of her death. Based on studies of the isotopes in a tooth, she was probably from southern England. She was possibly the daughter of a gentleman or a maid in a gentleman's home because she had consumed generous amounts of protein (meat). Jane likely arrived in Virginia in August 1609."
"It is almost certain Jane was removed from her grave before being butchered and eaten. She was not murdered. In 1625, George Percy, president of Jamestown during the starvation period, wrote that the hunger was so intense “thatt notheinge was Spared to mainteyne Lyfe and to doe those things which seame incredible, as to digge upp deade corpes outt of graves and to eate them."" Five other accounts refer to cannibalism during the bitter winter."
Only 10 percent of Jane's remains have been recovered by researchers. The remains were found about 2.5 feet (0.8 m) down in a trash pit in the cellar of a building built in 1608 inside the James Fort site. Historical accounts indicate cannibalism was widespread at Jamestown during the winter. Modern historians were reluctant to credit these accounts without other evidence. Jane however is the first forensic evidence that confirms the existence of the practice during that winter.
Robert Sacre
"Robert Sacre (born June 6, 1989) is an American-Canadian basketball player. He is a center for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
College.
Sacre played college basketball for Gonzaga University from 2007 to 2012.
NBA career.
He was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2nd round with the 60th overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft.
"He made his NBA debut with Lakers on October 31, 2012. He played 49 seconds in a 116-106 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers. He scored his first points for the Lakers on November 4, 2012 in a win against the Detroit Pistons. He made his first NBA start on January 8, 2013 in a loss against the Houston Rockets."
Personal.
"He was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana but grew up and played high school basketball in North Vancouver, British Columbia. His father is Greg LaFleur, a former American football tight end that played for the St. Louis Cardinals and the Indianapolis Colts."
"Later in life (at the presumed age of around 34 according to Bud Sagendorf), Popeye would offer his seafaring services at local ports; it was there he would eventually meet the ever-ambitious Castor Oyl and his sidekick Ham Gravy, who sought Popeye's services in order to travel to the gambling paradise of Dice Island and make it big using the luck-enhancing powers of their mysterious pet, Bernice the Whiffle Hen, and through them he would meet Castor's sister, Olive Oyl who at first was not too fond of the sailor and vice versa. Even her first words to him were harsh: ""Take your hooks offa me or I'll lay ya in a scupper"", and they fought bitterly---and hilariously---for months until finally realizing their feelings for each other. It was at this point that Olive left her womanizing fiancée Ham Gravy to be with the gruff sailor she loved. Since then, Popeye and Olive have remained almost inseparable and happily in love."
Songs.
"Since his debut in animation, Popeye has had many unique songs for himself as well as many tunes dedicated to him."
Popeye in other media.
"The character has been adapted into different forms of media, including animated, live-action movies, TV shows, video games, and action figures."
Astrophysics
"Astrophysics is the study of how stars, planets and other things in the Universe work, and how we can learn about them. Astrophysicists use physics to explain what astronomers find and see."
Astrophysics is also the study of how the Universe started and how it is changing with time. This part of astrophysics is called cosmology.
History.
"For a long time bodies in the sky seemed to be unchanging spheres moving in a circle. But on Earth growth and decay happened, and natural motion was in a straight line. Therefore, people thought the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found on Earth."
"During the 16th and 17th century, natural philosophers such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, and Newton, began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar kinds of material and were subject to the same natural laws."
"When they were able to work out how the planets moved, the science of astrophysics was born. Sir Isaac Newton realized that the same rules of mechanics that he had found on the surface of the Earth also could be used to predict how the planets moved. He said, ""As above, so below."" By this, he meant that we can study how things work on this planet to find out how things work in space."
"Later scientists found that by looking at the light from stars, they were able to work out what they were made from. This process is called spectroscopy."
Types of astrophysics.
There are two main types of astrophysics:
Word order
"Word order is part of syntax, which is part of grammar. Word order may be different in different languages. For example, English ""I play tennis only sometimes"" would be in German ""Ich spiele nur manchmal Tennis"", literally ""I play only sometimes tennis"". In Norwegian, the same sentence would be ""Jeg spiller bare tennis noen ganger"" (""I play tennis only sometimes"")."
"In Portuguese, the sentence could be ""Eu só jogo tênis algumas vezes"" (""I only play tennis sometimes), but word order can be changed to ""Eu jogo tênis só algumas vezes"" (""I play tennis only sometimes""). However, ""Eu jogo só tênis algumas vezes"" is not allowed (""I play only tennis sometimes"") because the meaning would be changed."
Subject-verb-object.
"In English, a simple sentence with a verb (an action), subject (who or what is doing the action), and an object (to whom or what the action is done) is written with a subject-verb-object word order (SVO). For example, in the sentence ""Robert opens the door"", ""Robert"" is the subject, ""opens"" is the verb and ""door"" is the object. SVO is the second-most common word order among all languages and is used in 42% of them. Examples are Mandarin Chinese, Bahasa Melayu, Bahasa Indonesia, Spanish, French, Italian, Thai and Vietnamese. While some of the above languages can use other word orders, such as SOV and VSO, they use SVO for the simplest sentences."
"In other languages, sentences can use other word orders. Consider ""Robert opens the door"". In English, changing the word order to ""The door opens Robert"" would change the meaning of the sentence. In Latin, however, ""Robertus ianuam aperit"" and ""ianuam Robertus aperit"" mean the same. ""Ianuam"" is in the accusative case and so it is the direct object and ""Robertus"" the subject. Changing the cases of the words, however, to ""Robertem ianua aperit"" would change the meaning of the sentence: ""ianua"" is now in the nominative case and so it is the subject and ""Robertum"" the object."
Subject-object-verb.
"The subject-object-verb (SOV) word order is the one that is used by the greatest number of distinct languages, 45% of them. It is especially common in the theoretical language family that is known as the Altaic language family, which includes many languages such as Japanese, Korean, Mongolian and the Turkic languages."
"In Japanese, for example, a simple sentence uses SOV. In other words, the sentence ""Robert opens the door"" becomes ""Robert the door opens"". Such languages often use postpositions, which act like prepositions but appear after content words rather than before them, to show the role of a word in the sentence. The sample sentence ""Robert opens the door"" would be in Japanese ロバートはドアを開ける ""Robāto-wa doa-o akeru"" in which は ""wa"" as in ロバートは ""Robāto-wa"" shows that ロバート ""Robāto (Robert)"" is the topic of the sentence, and を ""o"" as in ドアを ""doa-o"" shows that ドア ""doa"" is the direct object of the sentence. Around 45% of all languages are SOV languages."
Verb-subject-object.
"The verb-subject-object (VSO) word order is the third-most common word order in world languages. There are far fewer VSO languages than SVO and SOV languages, and only 9% of them are VSO. Language groups in which VSO is common include Afroasiatic languages, such as Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic, and Celtic languages, such as Irish, Welsh and Cornish. In VSO languages, ""Robert opens the door"" would be ""Opens Robert the door"". Spanish sentences are usually SVO, but VSO is also common. In Spanish, the example above can be as ""Roberto abre la puerta"" (Robert opens the door) or ""Abre Roberto la puerta"" (Opens Robert the door)."
Other types.
"Aside from SVO, SOV, and VSO, other kinds of word orders are rather uncommon. VOS word order makes up at around 3% of all languages, and languages that begin with the object (OVS and OSV) are extremely few, each around 1-0% percent each."

Bible
"The Bible, also known as the Holy Bible, is a group of religious texts of Judaism and Christianity, it contains both The Old Testament and The New Testament. The word Bible comes from the Greek word τὰ (""biblía"") which means ""books"" in English, because it is many books in one book. It includes laws, stories, prayers, songs, and wise words. A number of texts are both in the Hebrew Bible, used by Jews, and this Christian one."
"In considering the source and inspiration for the Bible one must see what the Bible says of itself. Several verses of scripture define the source, intent, and Author. 2 Peter 1:21 says this - ""No prophecy was ever made by the act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."" Isaiah 55:11 tells us that His is a word of power - ""So shall My sword be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it."" Hebrews 4:12 says this - ""For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."""
"When talking about the Bible, a ""book"" is used to speak about a number of texts. All the texts that make a ""book"" are believed to belong together. Most of the time, people believe they were written or collected by the same person. The Bible contains different kinds of such books. Some are history, telling the stories of the Jews, Jesus, or Jesus' followers. Some are collections of wise sayings. Some are God's commands to his people, which he expects them to obey. Some are songs of praise to God. Some are books of ""prophecy"", messages from God that he gave through chosen people called prophets."
"Different groups of Christians do not agree which texts should be included in the Bible. Christian Bibles range from the 66 books of the Protestant canon to 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. The oldest surviving Christian Bible is the Codex Sinaiticus, a Greek manuscript from the fourth century AD. The oldest complete Hebrew manuscripts date from the Middle Ages."
How it was written.
"For a long time the texts were passed on by word of mouth from generation to generation. The Bible was written long ago in Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek. Translations were made later into Latin and some other languages. Now there are translations in English and many other languages. The books of the Hebrew Bible—what Christians call the Old Testament—were not all written at the same time. It took hundreds of years (about 1200 years). The process of putting it all together began around 400 B.C. The books of the New Testament, which was originally written in Greek, began to be collected together in about 100 A.D. It tells about events that happened between 4 B.C. and 70 A.D. These events included the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus. It also tells how his followers went around spreading his message. It ends with a description of how the world will end when Jesus returns to earth. Most of the writers of the New Testament were apostles of Jesus. These were people who said they had seen Jesus alive after his crucifixion."
Translations and versions.
A translation is when a scribe takes the source in one language and writes it in another language. Most texts of the Bible were written in Ancient Greek or in Aramaic or Hebrew.
"The first to provide a translation into Latin was Jerome, in the 5th century. He started what is known as the Vulgate today. Wufila translated the Bible into the Gothic language. In the early Middle Ages, people such as Petrus Valdes, and Jan Hus provided translations."
"The New Testament was first translated into English in 1382 by John Wycliffe, and his associates translated the Old Testament. The translation was made from the Vulgate Latin bible. Wycliffe did this so that people could see for themselves what the Bible said. The translation was completed in 1382. There were some later editions by other people to the Wycliffe bible, as it is called. It was translated into Middle English, the language of his day. Wycliffe did not have Church permission to do this, but he was protected by John of Gaunt, one of the most powerful men in the kingdom. After both Wycliffe and his protector were dead, the Church declared Wycliffe a heretic in 1415, and banned his writings. The Council of Constance decreed Wycliffe's works should be burned and his remains exhumed (dug up). Why was the Church so opposed? The translations challenged the Church's authority over the people. In church, explaining the Bible was the priest's work. Whatever he said could not be challenged. Once the ordinary people could read the Bible, they might have other opinions."
"The next step in translation was done in 1525 by William Tyndale. His translation was into Early Modern English, which we can just about understand today. Tyndale also did it without Church permission. His was the first translation to be printed, and several thousand copies were made. He had no protector, and his fate was terrible. He fled to Europe, but the agents of Thomas More (Chancellor of England at the time) eventually found him. Both Tyndale and his printer were executed by burning at the stake."
Another well known translation is the 1611 King James translation (commonly known as the Authorized King James Version of the Bible).
Some texts were written by historians who tried to show what Ancient Israel was like. Other texts are poems about God and his work. And others were used to make laws. Followers of Judaism and Christianity consider the Bible sacred but they do not all agree about what belongs in the Bible. What is considered part of the Bible changed with history. Different denominations include certain parts or leave out other parts. There is not one single version of the Bible; both the content of the books and their order may change.
"Languages do not match. When a translation is done, the translator has to decide between translation word for word, or capturing the sense of the text. When he decides to capture the sense, he will choose other words in the target language. This is called paraphrasing."
"Today there are dozens of versions of the Bible. Some are translations and some are paraphrases. A paraphrased version is where people take a translation and put it in their own words. As the Bible has been translated into modern languages, it is also possible that there are different translations of the same texts. The Bible is the best selling book of all time. 2.5 billion to more than 6 billion copies of the Bible have been sold to date. A complete version of the Bible exists in 471 languages. Parts have been translated in 2225 languages. Most Bibles can be found in the British Museum in London."
Old Testament.
"The Christian Bible is a collection of 66 books. The first 39 books are the Old Testament. It is the first part of the God's story of salvation. ""Salvation"" is God's long work of saving us from our sins. ""Sin"" is what happened when people decided to live their own way instead of God's way in the world that God created. That was when God began His great work of saving us from our sins."
"To prepare the way, God had to destroy the whole world by a great flood, except for the family of Noah. Then God raised up a new people for Himself. They were the ancient Hebrews. God promised the Hebrews they would bring His salvation to the whole world."
"The first five books of the Old Testament are mostly the story of how God chose the ancient Hebrews and taught them his laws. Following these are the twelve books that tell the history of the Hebrews. The next five are books of poetry and wisdom. One of these five books, the ""Psalms"", is a book of songs showing mainly how God wants to be worshiped."
"The last seventeen books of the Old Testament were written by Hebrew prophets. These books tell about God's disappointment with the ancient Hebrews and His promise to bring them back to friendship with Him. The prophets also foretell a great surprise God was planning for the world-He was going to send His very own Son, the Messiah (the ""Anointed One""), the Saviour, to save us from our sins."
You can read about this Messiah in the New Testament.
"In the Old Testament, Tanakh was mostly written in Hebrew; a few parts were written in Aramaic. This part of the Bible is considered to be holy by Jews as well as Christians."
"There are also a few books of the Old Testament's time called Deuterocanonical by those Churches that accept them as part of the Bible, and Apocrypha by those that do not."
New Testament.
"The second part is called the New Testament. The main part of this book is the story of the life of Jesus Christ. The four different versions of this story in the New Testament are called the Gospels. After the Gospels, there is also the story of what happened to the Church after Jesus's death and resurrection. Part of this is told through letters by early Christian leaders, especially Saint Paul. The final book of the Bible tells about a vision that St. John, one of the disciples of Jesus, had. In the vision John saw what would happen at the end of the world. This included judgement for evil and happiness for the people who had followed Jesus. One of the most quoted verses in the Bible is : ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish [die] but have eternal life."" NIV"

Life skills
Life skills are abilities which help people to deal with the demands and challenges that they face in life.
The World Health Organization in 1999 identified cross-cultural areas of life skills:
Most of the times children get life skills when they play or discover new things with adults.
"Fordtown, Tennessee"
"Fordtown is an unincorporated community in Sullivan County, Tennessee, United States, The community's name was adopted due to the number of people with the last name Ford, who lived in the area. It is accessed by the road named after it, Fordtown Road."
Orientalism
"Orientalism is an idea that the Eastern world and the Western world have opposite ways of thinking in terms of being and knowledge. It is often shown in the superiority of the West and the inferiority of the East. Edward Said was the first person to use the word this way in his 1978 book ""“Orientalism”"". He describes Orientalism as “a style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and ‘the Occident’ ”. Before the term Orientalism was used by Said, it had a different meaning. In 1798, after Napoleon invaded Egypt, an era started. During this era, it was easier for European colonial powers to use their economic and political power over much of Asia and Africa. This allowed for more academic study of the East than before. This was called “the Oriental renaissance” in the 19th century. It had a large and broad effect on literature, art, and architecture in Europe."
"During the 19th and 20th centuries, the term Orientalism was used to describe the effects of the Orient’s influence on art, literature, and architecture fields. It was also used to label the academic study done by philologists (people who study the history of language) who were focused on the Oriental languages and the understanding of ancient Oriental texts. This knowledge was thought to be enough to understand Oriental civilizations. There was no interest to the day-to-day life of these Oriental communities and their heterogeneous customs and traditions."
"During the time of colonial power in the 19th and 20th centuries, the role of the Orientalist academic changed. The knowledge that was learned in this field of study was used to justify European colonialism over the Arab world."
"Orientalism in architecture, art, and literature."
"Beginning in the 19th century, the ""Oriental Renaissance"" influenced European culture in many ways. In the architectural field there are many different revivals in Europe. The Indo-Saracenic revival at the end of the 18th century, or the Egyptian revival, recreated buildings with motifs taken from the Indian subcontinent and Egypt."
"The “Oriental Renaissance” affected also the Romantic movement. In fact, romantic writers and artists showed a great interest in this Oriental rediscovery. A great example can be found in Flaubert’s (one of the most important French writer of the 19th century) novel Salammbò in 1862, where the Orient is depicted as something opposite of the Occident, eroticized and exoticized. Travelers’ accounts were very popular and contributed to form an imaginary vision of the Orient in the Western societies. Lord Byron, Victor Hugo, Nerval, Chateaubriand are some of the famous writers of the time that evoked exotic scenes and wild adventures by their accounts."
"During the 19th century, Orientalist painting movement also developed. The drawings of the French painters Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Eugene Delacroix, or the English painter William Holman Hunt are important examples of this movement. They depicted the East as something different, dangerous, wild, sexual, often because of their imagination and not because of the reality. For example, the French painter Ingres drew images of nude Oriental women using ancient Greek and Roman sculptures rather than real models. It would have been very difficult to persuade a woman in the Arab and Indian world to pose naked."
Wouter Bos
"Wouter Jacob Bos (born July 14, 1963) was a Dutch minister of finance, deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Dutch Labour Party. He won the election of Dutch Labour Party leader, defeating Jouke de Vries. He led the party until March 12, 2010, the day he left. His successor is Job Cohen, who used to be the mayor of Amsterdam. He left because he wanted to spend more time with his family."
"He left as minister of finance and deputy Prime Minister because the government felt over the decision of Uruzgan. The Dutch Labour Party was in the coalition, together with Christen Democraten Appèl and the ChristenUnie, both Christian parties. The Dutch Labour Party did not agree and stepped out of the coalition."
Hughes Medal
The Hughes Medal is awarded by the Royal Society of London for original discoveries in electricity and magnetism or their applications.
"The medal was first given to J.J. Thomson in 1902 ""for his numerous contributions to electric science, especially in reference to the phenomena of electric discharge in gases"". It has been awarded over a hundred times. At first it was awarded annually, now it is every two years."
"Unlike some other Royal Society medals, the Hughes Medal has never been awarded to the same person more than once. Only one woman has won it: Michele Dougherty in 2008, who was awarded the medal ""for innovative use of magnetic field data that led to discovery of an atmosphere around one of Saturn's moons and the way it revolutionised our view of the role of planetary moons in the Solar System""."
"The medal has been awarded to more than one person at once; in 1938 it was won by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton ""for their discovery that nuclei could be disintegrated by artificially produced bombarding particles"", in 1981 by Peter Higgs, Thomas Walter and Tom W. B. Kibble ""for their international contributions about the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in elementary-particle theory"", in 1982 by Drummond Matthews and Frederick Vine for explaining the magnetic properties of the ocean floors which then led to the plate tectonic hypothesis, and in 1988 by Archibald Howie and M.J. Whelan for their work on the theory of electron diffraction and microscopy, and its use in the study of lattice defects in crystals."
J. J. Thomson
"Sir Joseph John ""J.J."" Thomson, OM, FRS (18 December 1856 – 30 August 1940) was a British physicist and Nobel laureate. He discovered the electron and isotopes, and invented the mass spectrometer. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 for his discovery of the electron and his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. John Joseph Thomson in 1893 said: ""There is no other branch of physics which affords us so promising an opportunity of penetrating the secret of electricity."""
"In 1897, Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle of very small mass compared to its electric charge. It was later called the electron and was the first subatomic particle to be found. Thomson also found the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, while studying anode rays (positive cations)."
"In atomic theory he hypothesized that atoms were spheres of evenly spread positive charge, where an individual negatively charged electron resided. He later concluded there was more than one negatively charged particle in an atom."
Many of the young men who studied and worked with him at University of Cambridge also became famous physicists.
Johann Wilhelm Hittorf
"Johann Wilhelm Hittorf (March 27, 1824 – November 28, 1914) was a German physicist who was born in Bonn and died in Münster, Germany. He was the first to compute the electric capacity of charged atoms and molecules (ions)."
Flor-de-Lis
"Flor-de-Lis are a folk music group from Lisbon, Portugal. They competed in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 with the song ""Todas as ruas do amor"" where they finished 15th."
Gulf Air
Gulf Air is an airline based in the Middle East. They operate scheduled flights in the Middle East and international flights.
Terraforming
"Terraforming is changing a planet or large natural satellite that we cannot live on at present without spacesuits and similar technology. The idea is to change it so some life from Earth could exist there. It would need a suitable atmosphere (air), heat, and water. ""Paraterraforming"" or ""worldhousing"" is a variant of terraforming that would involve building domes over the majority of a planet or moon."
"Some think it is possible to terraform Mercury, Venus, Mars, Ceres, Pluto, our Moon, Titan, Callisto."
"It is arguable that we have already succeeded in terraforming right here on Earth. Thanks to modern technology, humans can now thrive in places that should be impossible to live in such as deserts and the Arctic."
"A related concept is paraterraforming or worldhousing which would involve constructing greenhouse-style geodesic domes and similar structures to cover most of, if not the entire surface of the planet or moon."
Examples in the Bible.
Here are seven types that can be found. These are just some of the many miracles in the Bible.
In other books.
"Other religious books, like the Quran, Mahabharata and the Avesta, contains many references to this definition of miracle. An example of a miracle in the Quran is when Muhammad splits the moon into halves."
Kami
"Kami (神) is a Japanese word for the spirits that are worshipped in the Shinto religion. Not all of Kami are gods of the personified type. Instead, they have to do with phenomena and events like the growth of trees, or rain, or wind, or other aspects of Nature; it is believed that these kami live in those natural things."
"It is usually said that there are . In Japanese the number ""eight-million"" is normally used to mean infinity."
"Though the word ""kami"" can be translated multiple ways into English, no English word expresses its full meaning."
Cardboard
"Cardboard is a heavy type of paper, notable for its stiffness and durability. It was first invented in China some time in the 15th century, and is used for a wide variety of purposes. One of its more common uses is as a packaging material."
"Cardboard boxes were first produced commercially in 1817 in England. Corrugated (also called pleated) paper was patented in England in 1856, used as a liner for tall hats, but corrugated cardboard would not be patented and used as a shipping material until 20 December 1871. The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City, New York for single-sided corrugated cardboard. Jones used the corrugated cardboard for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys. The first machine for producing large quantities of corrugated cardboard was built in 1874 by G. Smyth, and in the same year Oliver Long improved upon Jones' design by inventing corrugated cardboard with liner sheets on both sides. This was now cardboard as we know it today."
"American Robert Gair was a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, and while he was printing an order of seed bags a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut the bag. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing cardboard in one operation he could make prefabricated cartons. Extending this to corrugated cardboard was a straightforward development when the material became available. By the start of the 20th century, corrugated cardboard boxes began replacing the custom-made wooden crates and boxes previously used for trade."
"The Kellogg brothers first used cardboard cartons to hold their flaked corn cereal, and later when they began marketing it to the general public a heat-sealed waxed bag of ""Waxtite"" was wrapped around the outside of the box and printed with their brand name. This marked the origin of the cereal box, though in modern times the sealed bag is plastic and is kept inside the box rather than outside."
Cardboard packaging has undergone minor changes in recent times due to the trend towards environmentalism. It is now common for cardboard to be manufactured with a large percentage of recycled fibers.
English language
English is a language that started in Anglo-Saxon England. It is originally from Anglo-Frisian and Old Saxon dialects. English is now used as a global language. There are about 375 million native speakers (people who use it as their first language) in the world.
"Frisian is the language closest to English. The vocabulary of English was influenced by other Germanic languages in the early Middle Ages and later by Romance languages, especially French."
"English is the only official language or one of the official languages of nearly 60 countries. It is also the main language of more countries in the world than any other. It is the primary language in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It is one of the official languages in Singapore, India, Hong Kong, and South Africa. It is widely spoken in parts of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia."
"In 2005, it was estimated that there were over 2 billion speakers of English. English is the first foreign language for most learners who have another main language. It is an official language of the United Nations, European Union, and many other international organizations. It is the most widely-spoken Germanic language, with at least 70% of Germanic speakers speaking English. About 220 million others use it as their second language. It is, together with German, the most important language of science and technology. It is often used in work and travel and trade, and there are at least a billion people who are learning it. That makes English the largest language by number of speakers."
"English has changed and developed over time, like all other languages. The most obvious changes are the many words taken from Latin and Old French, which then came to Old English and then Modern English, which is used today."
"English grammar has also become very different from other Germanic languages, but it stayed different from Romance languages. Because nearly 60% of the vocabulary comes from Latin, English is sometimes called the Germanic language that is the most Latin, and it is often mistaken for being a Romance language."
History.
"Germanic tribes (Saxons, Angles, and Jutes) came to Britain from around 449 AD. They made their home in the south and east of the island, pushing out the Celtic Britons who were there before them, or making them speak the English language instead of the old Celtic languages. Some people still speak Celtic languages today, in Wales (Welsh) and elsewhere. Gaelic is the Scottish Celtic language, still spoken by some in the Scottish Highlands and Islands. ""Scots"" is a dialect of English, taken from the English spoken in Northumbria. Irish Gaelic is spoken by very few people today."
"The Germanic dialects of the different tribes became what is now called Old English. The word ""English"" comes from the name of the Angles: ""Englas"". Old English did not sound or look much like the English spoken today. If English speakers today were to hear or read a passage in Old English, they would understand just a few words."
"The closest language to English that is still used today is Frisian, spoken by about 500,000 people living in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. It is much like English, and many words are the same. The two languages were even closer before Old English changed to Middle English). Today, speakers of the two languages would not be able to understand each other. Dutch is spoken by over 20 million people, and is more distant from English. German is even bigger, and even more distant. All these languages belong to the same West Germanic family as English."
"Many other people came to England later at different times, speaking different languages, and these languages added more words to make today's English. For example, around 800 AD, many Danish and Norse pirates, also called Vikings, came to the country, established Danelaw. So, English got many Norse loanwords. Their languages were Germanic languages, like Old English, but are a little different. They are called the North Germanic languages."
"When William the Conqueror took over England in 1066 AD, he brought his nobles, who spoke Norman, a language closely related to French. English changed a lot because it was mostly being spoken instead of written for about 300 years, because all official documents were written in Norman French. English borrowed many words from Norman at that time, and also began to drop the old word endings. English of this time is called Middle English. Geoffrey Chaucer is a well known writer of Middle English. After more sound changes, Middle English became Modern English."
"English continued to take new words from other languages, for example mainly from French (around 30% to 40% of its words), but also Chinese, Hindi, Urdu, Japanese, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, etc. Because scientists from different countries needed to talk to one another, they chose names for scientific things in the languages they all knew: Greek and Latin. Those words came to English also, for example, ""photography"" (""photo-"" means ""light"" and ""-graph"" means ""picture"" or ""writing"", in Greek. A photograph is a picture made using light), or ""telephone"". So, English is made of Old English, Danish, Norse, and French, and has been changed by Latin, Greek, Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Dutch and Spanish, along with some words from other languages."
"English grammar has also changed, becoming simpler and less Germanic. The classic example is the loss of case in grammar. Grammatical case shows the role of a noun, adjective or pronoun in a sentence. In Latin (and other Indo-European languages), this is done by adding suffixes, but English usually does not. The style of English is that meaning is made clear more by context and syntax."
"The System/370 or S/370 was a mainframe architecture, IBM built in the 1970s. The System was mostly compatible with System/360, which IBM had built before. &gt;Many applications coulds be re-used. The biggest change was that S/370 could handle virtual memory. The S/370 used tape drives and hard drives as mass storage device. The System/390 replaced the System/370 in the 1990s."
Jekyll (TV series)
Jekyll is a British television drama serial shown on BBC One. Steven Moffat wrote all six episodes. Douglas Mackinnon and Matt Lipsey directed three episodes each.
It was made by Hartswood Films and Stagescreen Productions. The series also got funding from BBC America.
"The series is a sequel to the novella ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"", and not an adaptation of it. The Robert Louis Stevenson tale is used as a backstory within the series."
"It stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern-day descendant of Dr. Jekyll. He has recently begun transforming into a version of Mr. Hyde (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman appears as Claire, Tom's wife."
Filming took place around southern England in late 2006. The series was first shown on BBC One in June and July 2007.
Plot.
"Doctor Tom Jackman (James Nesbitt) is a married father of two. He has abandoned his family without explanation to live in a heavily fortified basement flat. He hires psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer (Michelle Ryan) to help him. After explaining a set of elaborate security procedures to Katherine, he straps himself into a metal chair and undergoes a transformation."
"Katherine observes that Tom's alter ego exhibits rage, heightened senses, strength and speed, and a flirtatious manner. She assures this persona she will keep his secrets just as she keeps Tom's. She asks for guarantees he will not harm her. Tom's alter ego takes Hyde's name. The two agree an uneasy truce. They share a body, but neither remembers what the other did while in charge. They use a micro cassette recorder to leave messages for each other."
"When Tom began transforming into the violent Hyde, he feared for his family's safety. He chose to isolate himself from them. He visits his wife Claire (Gina Bellman). During the visit, Hyde assumes control and learns about Tom's family."
"Miranda Callendar, played by Meera Syal, is a detective employed by Claire. She tells Tom that ""Jekyll and Hyde"" was not fiction, but a version of actual events. Miranda shows Tom a picture of the real Doctor Jekyll who lived in Edinburgh in the 19th century. Tom is startled to see that Jekyll looks exactly like him."
"Tom is also being watched by a private security team led by an American named Benjamin, played by Paterson Joseph. The team works for his former employers at the biotechnology firm, Klein and Utterson. The team is directed by his friend Peter Syme, played by Denis Lawson."
"When Benjamin puts Tom's children at risk, Hyde asserts himself, and kills a lion. At the hospital he is approached by Sophia, an elderly woman who claims to be his mother, but before he can question her she disappears."
"Tom confronts Peter, who attempts to drug him. This provokes Hyde to appear and take Peter and Claire hostage. Claire argues that they need to find a cure for Tom's condition. Hyde kills Benjamin. Peter says that Klein and Utterson have had a cure for a long time. Tom is captured and locked inside a metal coffin."
"Katherine and Miranda confront Peter, claiming they know the truth about Tom. Miranda thinks that Klein and Utterson have access to cloning technology and that Tom is Jekyll's clone. Peter denies this and orders them taken away to be killed."
"Peter reveals to Claire that Tom's treatment will make him into one persona. If it is Hyde, he will be kept for research. They will make the potion that turned the original Jekyll into Hyde. If it is Tom, she will be free to take him home. When the box is opened, Hyde is dominant."
"In a flashback triggered by genetic memory, Hyde has a vision of a meeting between Jekyll and Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"". Stevenson agrees to write a fictional version of Jekyll's case but reveals that he knows the truth: there is no potion. Instead, Jekyll was transformed into Hyde by his love for Alice, a maid within his household. Flashbacks into Tom's own life show his Hyde first appeared during a seaside holiday with Claire, after the pair were accosted by hooligans."
"Enraged by further threats to Tom's family, Hyde escapes from Klein and Utterson. Ms. Utterson, a ruthless redheaded American woman at the head of Klein and Utterson, takes Claire and her sons hostage at a private estate. She locks the twins in miniature versions of the coffin used on their father."
"Tom's alleged mother, Sophia, appears on the premises and helps Claire escape her locked bedroom. She tells Claire how Klein and Utterson had tried to clone Doctor Jekyll but had been unsuccessful. Claire meets several of the failed attempts in the basement of the building. They are disfigured and in a near-vegetative state. Sophia explains that Tom is a descendant of Doctor Jekyll, through Mr Hyde, and by chance ""a perfect throwback, a chance in a million"". Klein and Utterson had discovered this and had watched him from when he was six-months-old. In order to trigger his transformation into Hyde, they created a clone of Alice, the maid whom Jekyll had loved. This clone is Claire herself."
"Hyde tries to rescue Tom's family from Klein and Utterson. He kills Peter. There is a stand-off, with Tom and Claire's sons held hostage and suffocating. The Hyde personality is apparently killed when he is shot with multiple bullets and then manages to avoid 'sharing the damage' by taking the wounds onto himself while allowing Tom to assume his undamaged, healthy form, leaving Doctor Jackman as the only personality."
"Six months later, Tom has tracked down Sophia, the woman who claimed to be his mother. When he questions her about his father, she reveals that she is the descendant of Hyde. He had inherited the family curse from her. As Tom watches horrified, the powerless, tired, grey-haired Sophia transforms into her own version of the Hyde persona, the red-headed Ms Utterson."
Production.
Development.
"Jeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions had the idea of a modern version of ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" in the mid-1990s. He attempted to get it produced in the United States, but all three attempts fell through. He returned to England and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was looking for ideas for a supernatural thriller. Cameron approached Steven Moffat for a script. A six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005."
"BBC America gave co-production funding in March 2006. The producers regularly met with Moffat for brainstorming sessions. The producers invited Moffat to ""write anything"", with the intention of cutting the material back later. However, they were reluctant to cut material once they saw it on the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego. Because the plot of ""Jekyll"" begins after the story has developed for the characters, Nesbitt says that the show feels like it is a second series."
"Moffat explicitly describes the series as a sequel, rather than an adaptation. He said the Jekyll of the original story really existed, and Jackman is his ""modern-day descendant dealing with the same problems"". As ""Jekyll and Hyde"" is such a well-known phrase, Moffat labored over what to call the series, eventually deciding upon ""Jekyll"" because that word ""carries the name Hyde"". The final episode replaces the title ""Jekyll"" with ""Hyde"". Producer Elaine Cameron says the one word title gives the series a ""very modern feel"". Moffat initially named the character Jekyll rather than Jackman, but found it cumbersome to constantly explain that the book had not been written in this alternate universe. Instead he chose a version where the book exists, but changed the name to Jackman. Otherwise, Cameron felt, the character would appear stupid by not realising what was happening when turning into Hyde."
"The scene between Tom and Katherine was expanded slightly in the sixth episode to keep their relationship active to facilitate a second series. However, no further episodes were commissioned. In an August 2007 interview, Moffat told Alan Sepinwall of ""The Star-Ledger"" that he had a sequel written for the miniseries ""should the BBC be interested""."
"Following ""Jekyll,"" Moffat became a co-writer on ""Sherlock."""
Casting.
"James Nesbitt and his agent attended a meeting with Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of ""Murphy's Law"". At the conclusion of the meeting, she offered him a script for ""Jekyll"", suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde to be able to walk around in public without attracting attention."
Nazi rise to power (1919–1934).
"Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, wrote a book called ""Mein Kampf"" (""My Struggle""). The book said that all of Germany's problems happened because Jews were making plans to hurt the country. He also said that Jewish and communist politicians planned the Armistice of 1918 that ended World War I, and allowed Germany to agree to pay huge amounts of money and goods (reparations)."
"In November 1923, the Nazis tried to overthrow the democratic German government that had been set up after WWI. Nazi thinking emphasises conflict and violence, and believes that these are the best way to sort out political problems. The Nazis had therefore set up their own private army, called the Sturmabteilung (SA) which were sometimes known as the 'Nazi stormtroopers' or simply the 'brownshirts'. Many political parties had their own private armies at this time in Germany to guard their events and meetings from the private armies of other political parties. The attempt to take power is referred to as the Munich Putsch or Beer Hall Putsch and was crushed after less than 24 hours."
"After the Putsch, Hitler was imprisoned for six months and the Nazi Party briefly banned. It was allowed to exist again in if it promised to only be democratic. The Nazis agreed, but made it clear that if they took power in Germany, they would turn Germany into a dictatorship. The Nazis believed in something called the Führer Principle, which means that they believe that all groups should be organised like armies, with absolute loyalty shown to the leader of the group. They wanted to apply this principle to Germany. They disagreed with democracy, because they believed that it divided groups which made them weaker."
"The Nazis performed very badly in elections until the early 1930s, where they became exceptionally popular. This can be partly explained by a massive increase in poverty in Germany caused by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and Nazi promises to rebuild German strength and pride. However, this is not the only reason for the Nazis coming to power, because it still took more than three years for Adolf Hitler to become Chancellor of Germany after the Crash."
"On the night of the 27 February 1933 and 28 February 1933, someone set the Reichstag building on fire. This was the building where the German Parliament held their meetings. The Nazis blamed the communists. Opponents of the Nazis said that the Nazis themselves had done it to come to power. On the very same day, an emergency law called ""Reichstagsbrandverordnung"" was passed. The government claimed it was to protect the state from people trying to hurt the country. With this law, most of the civil rights of the Weimar Republic did not count any longer. The Nazis used this against the other political parties. Members of the communist and social-democratic parties were put into prison or killed."
"The Nazis became the biggest party in the parliament. By 1934, they managed to make all other parties illegal. Democracy was replaced with a dictatorship. Adolf Hitler became leader (""Führer"") of Germany, and had the power to make any laws he wanted."
Life in Nazi Germany (1934–1945).
"The Nazis changed Germany to fit their ideas of what a country should be like. They created a totalitarian state, which is a country where the government tries to have total control over ordinary people's lives."
"In schools, several subjects were changed to fit a Nazi interpretation. History was taught to emphasise German military victories and blames Jewish people and Marxists for defeat in WWI. Children were also taught racial hygiene lessons, where pseudo-scientific racist principles taught to them. In 1936, all German children had to be members of the Hitler Youth which was a Nazi version of the Scouting movement, and was designed to prepare them to be soldiers in wars against other races."
"People who opposed the Nazis were seen as traitors. The Nazis created a very effective police state, led by Heinrich Himmler and his deputy Reinhard Heydrich. They were in charge of an organisation called the Schutzstaffel (SS) that took control of all of the police forces in Germany. The SS also set up a new secret police organisation called the Gestapo which hunted down people who wanted to protest against the Nazi government. Enemies of the Nazis were regularly tortured, put in concentration camps or executed."
Attacking other countries.
"As the German leader (Führer) of Nazi Germany, Hitler began moving Nazi armies into neighboring countries. When Germany attacked Poland, World War II started. Western countries like France, Belgium, and the Netherlands were occupied and to be treated by Germany as colonies. However, in Eastern countries, such as Poland and the Soviet Union, the Nazis planned to kill or enslave the Slavic peoples, so that German settlers could take their land."
"The Nazis made alliances with other European countries, such as Finland and Italy. Every other European country that allied with Germany did it because they did not want to be taken over by Germany. Through these alliances and invasions, the Nazis managed to control much of Europe."
The Holocaust.
"In the Holocaust, millions of Jews, as well as Roma people (also called ""Gypsies""), people with disabilities, homosexuals, political opponents, and many other people were sent to concentration camps and death camps in Poland and Germany. The Nazis killed millions of these people at the concentration camps with poison gas. The Nazis also killed millions of people in these groups by forcing them to do slave labor without giving them much food or clothing. In total, 17 million people died, 6 million of them being Jews."
Victory of the Allies.
"In 1945, the Soviet Union took over Berlin after defeating the German army in Russia. The Soviet Red Army met the American and British armies, who had fought right across Germany after invading Nazi Europe from Normandy in France on June 6,1944. The Nazis lost because the Allies had many more soldiers and more money than them."
"During the invasion of Berlin, Hitler shot himself in a bunker with his new wife, Eva Braun. Other Nazis also killed themselves, including Joseph Goebbels just one day after Hitler named him as his successor. The Nazis surrendered after the Red Army captured Berlin."
Nuremberg Trials.
"After the war, the Allied governments, namely the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, held trials of the Nazi leaders. These trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany. For this reason, these trials were called ""the Nuremberg Trials."" The Allied leaders accused the Nazi leaders of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murdering millions of people (in the Holocaust), of starting wars, of conspiracy, and belonging to illegal organizations like the SS (called, ""Schutzstaffel"", in German). Most Nazi leaders were found guilty by the court, and they were sent to jail or sentenced to death and executed."
Nazis after the war.
"There has not been a ""Nazi"" state since 1945, but there are still people who believe in those ideas. These people are often called ""neo""-Nazis. Here are some examples of modern Nazi ideas:"
"After the war, laws were made in Germany and other countries, especially countries in Europe, that make it illegal to say the Holocaust never happened. Sometimes they also ban questioning the number of people affected by it, which is saying that not so many people were killed as most people think ""who wrote this?"" There has been some controversy over whether this affects people's free speech. Certain countries, such as Germany, Austria, and France, also banned the use of Nazi symbols. It is also banned to make a Nazi pledge position on a popular media source to stop Nazis from using them."
Pork
Pork is meat that comes from pigs. It is the most commonly consumed meat in the world Evidence of pig husbandry dates back to 5000 BC.
"A simple meal to make which contains pork is afelia. Sausages, bacon and ham are the most common uses of pork in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other parts of the Western world. Pork is forbidden by the food taboos of kosher and halal."
Mike Farrell
"Mike Farrell (born February 6, 1939) is an American actor, writer and producer. He played BJ Hunnicutt on the television series ""M*A*S*H"". He played Michael ""Mike"" Hawks in the television movie ""Battered"" in 1978. He played Chicago real estate developer Lee Miglin in the limited crime series """"."
"Farrell was born in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was raised in Hollywood, California. He was part of the United States Marine Corps. Farrell was married to Judy Hayden from 1963 until they divorced in 1983. Then, he married Shelley Fabares in 1984. He has two children with Hayden."
"San Sebastián Street Festival, also known as “San Se”, is a very popular Puerto Rican festivity that takes place in the Old San Juan. It is a four-day event that starts the third Thursday of January through Sunday. This festive is in honor of Saint Sebastian. January 20th is the day that Catholic Church celebrates the life of this Saint. More than 200,000 people participate in this festival, making this activity be recognized internationally. Also, some Puerto Ricans have started this festive in the United States. Also they celebrate the Rivera Family, next year Paris Rivera will be the starter of the festival."
History.
"Father Juan Manuel Madrazo, the priest of the San José Church in the 1950s, was the first person who organized the festival. The purpose of this festival was to commemorate the life of this Saint and raise money to repair the church. When the father was moved out of San Juan, this festival came to an end. It was not until 1970 when a historian and anthropologist named Ricardo Alegría proposed to Rafaela Balladares de Brito, a resident of San Sebastian street, to revive this tradition. Balladares de Brito with the help of her neighbors began to reorganize the festival and recollect money for an elementary school directed by Sisters of Charity."
First celebrations.
"During the past celebrations, a group of musicians in the early morning of the first days walked and announced the festivity though the street. People in costumes of Spanish Kings, Queen Isabel and King Fernando, wear huge mask over their heads and were called “Cabezudos”, also participated in the parade. During the procession, people carried the Saint’s Image from San Sebastian Street and ended at the San José Church. In addition, the neighbors decorated their home’s balcony and the streets. They also prepared typical food, wore dresses and participated as host of the music shows."
Today’s celebrations.
In Puerto Rico.
"In the present, the addition of artisans has acquired more importance, as well as music and dance in the nights. Also, artists perform at different stages localized around the Old San Juan. “Cabezudos” now include characters representing the Puerto Rican folklore that pass through the streets dancing and singing followed by the public. Now, the parade is longer than the past ones and the municipality of San Juan is responsible in organizing the entire festival. Festivities vary year by year, but mainly include the ones mentioned above."
In United States.
"In the recent years, several of San Sebastian Festivals have been celebrated in different areas of Florida and in DFW, Texas. This has been a result of many Puerto Ricans moving to the United States and wanting to maintain a connection with their typical island traditions. The festivals programed in Florida and Dallas, Texas have a duration of one to two days compared to the one celebrated in Puerto Rico which last four days. These festivals also have Puerto Rican food and rums, “Cabezudos”, artisan market, and music."
"In DFW, Texas since January 2018, a group of Puerto Ricans - Traigo esta Trulla, start to organize the first Fiestas de la San Se- DFW with more than 6,000 participants."
Least developed country
A least developed country (LDC) is a country that the United Nations considers to be the least developed out of all the countries in the world. They normally have the lowest ratings on the Human Development Index. The idea to name LDCs started in the late 1960s. The first group of LDCs was listed by the UN in November 1971.
Classification process.
Indicators are used to determine whether a country is a least devleoped country.
"To be considered a least developed country, a country must have high levels of poverty, low human resources and a vulnerable economy. The UN looks at indicators, such as gross national income, nutrition, health, education and literacy. Economic vulnerability is recorded on the Economic Vulnerability Index."
"LDC criteria are reviewed every three years. Countries may stop being considered an LDC when indicators show that they have become developed enough. Since the LDC category was created, four countries have graduated to ""developing country"" status. The first country to do this was Botswana in 1994. The second was Cape Verde, in 2007. Then Maldives in 2011, and Samoa in 2014. It is expected that Equatorial Guinea and Vanuatu will be the next countries to be promoted from LDC status."
", there are 48 least developed countries. There are also three countries which meet the criteria for LDC status, but have asked to not be included in the index: Ghana, Papua New Guinea and Zimbabwe."
Current list.

Constitutional Convention (United States)
"The Constitutional Convention (also known as the Philadelphia Convention) was held from May 25 to September 17, 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, it became clear from the beginning that many members, including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, intended to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the creation of the United States Constitution. This makes the meeting one of the most significant events in the history of the United States."
Debates.
"Most of the disputes were about the makeup and election of the Senate. Other disagreements concerned how ""proportional representation"" was to be defined (whether to include slaves or other property). They needed to decide whether to divide the executive power between three persons or invest the power into a single president. They also had to work out how to elect the president, how long his term was to be and whether he could stand for reelection. There were issues over what offenses should be impeachable. Most of the time during the Convention was spent on deciding these issues, while the powers of legislature, executive, and judiciary were not heavily disputed. Once the Convention began, the delegates first agreed on the principles of the Convention, then they agreed on Madison's Virginia Plan and began to modify it. A Committee of Detail assembled during the July 4 recess and produced a rough draft. Most of this rough draft remained in place, and can be found in the final version of the constitution. After the final issues were resolved, the Committee on Style produced the final version, and it was voted on and sent to the states."
The Virginia Plan.
"James Madison had spent the winter of 1787 making a study of various confederations throughout history. He came to Philadelphia armed with a wealth of knowledge and an idea for what the United States government should be. His plan was presented to the Convention by Edmund Randolph, the Governor of Virginia. It became the broad outline of what would be a new government under the U.S. Constitution. His plan called for three branches of government with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from abusing their power. Madison's idea for a legislature had two houses. One would feature members elected by the people for a three-year term. The other would have its members elected by the state legislatures and would serve for 7 years. Both would have the seats determined by the population of the country."
Two more plans.
"After debating the Virginia plan for two weeks, William Patterson presented his plan called variously, the New Jersey Plan, the Patterson Plan and the Small State Plan. It was very similar to the Articles of Confederation and featured a unicameral (one house) legislature. All states would have one vote. He had one idea that was kept; that state laws that ran counter to federal laws would be voided."
A third plan was offered by Alexander Hamilton. It was a copy of the British Constitution. It also was bicameral with an upper house and a legislature in which members served on their good behavior.
A solution.
Penguins only live south of the equator. Several different kinds live in and around Antarctica. The biggest ones can stand nearly 4 feet (1.2m) tall and can weigh almost 100 pounds (40 kg). The smallest kinds are only about one foot (30 cm) tall. Penguins are large birds that swim very well but cannot fly. They have black backs and wings with white fronts. Their feathers are very tightly packed and make a thick cover. They also have a layer of woolly down under the feathers. The feathers themselves are coated with a type of oil that makes them waterproof. A thick layer of blubber also keeps them warm. Penguins eat fish and are at home in the ocean. They come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks. They nest together in a huge group.
Largest land animal.
The largest animal in Antarctica that lives entirely on land is a wingless midge.
History of its discovery.
"For a long time, people had believed that there was a great continent in the far south of Earth. They thought this ""Terra Australis"" would ""balance"" the lands in the north like Europe, Asia and North Africa. People have believed this from the times of Ptolemy (1st century AD). He suggested this idea to keep the balance of all known lands in the world. Pictures of a large land in the south were common in maps. In the late 17th century, people discovered that South America and Australia were not part of the mythical ""Antarctica"". However, geographers still believed that Antarctica was much bigger than it really was."
"European maps continued to show this unknown land until Captain James Cook's ships, HMS ""Resolution"" and ""Adventure"", crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773. They crossed it again in January 1774. In fact, Cook did come within about of the Antarctic coast. However, he was forced to go back because of ice in January 1773."
"The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica were by three different men. According to different organizations, ships captained by three men saw Antarctica in 1820. The three men were Fabian von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (an American seal hunter out of Stonington, Connecticut). The first recorded landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis. He landed on West Antarctica on 7 February 1821. However, some historians are not sure about this claim."
"People began discovering different parts of Antarctica and mapping them. This was slow work because they could only work in the summer. At last a map was made, and people began to talk about exploring the land, not only the sea. However, this would have been very hard work. They would have to break through the ice that was around Antarctica. Then they would have to land on it and bring in enough things to live on while they explored the land."
"The first serious exploration of the Antarctic land was the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907–09. They were the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 – February 1909. They were the first humans to cross the Ross Ice Shelf, and the Transantarctic Mountain Range (via the Beardmore Glacier). They were the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau."
"Robert Falcon Scott, the most well known of all of the explorers, wanted to be the first man to reach the South Pole. At the same time, another team from Norway lead by Roald Amundsen started. They both raced each other to the South Pole, but in the end Amundsen won because he had made a good use of his sleigh dogs. Scott had used ponies and motor sleds, but when he got to the South Pole he found a message from Amundsen, showing that he had beaten Scott."
"On his way back, Scott and three companions met a blizzard and froze to death while waiting for it to finish. The people who found him eight months later also found his records and diary, which he had written to the day he died."
"Climate change and global warming are showing effects in Antarctica, particularly the Antarctic Peninsula."
People.
"No one lives in Antarctica all the time. People who go to Antarctica are there to learn about Antarctica, so most of the people who live there are scientists. Most live at national science stations on the coast. Some bases are far from the sea, for example at the South pole. They study the weather, animals, glaciers, and the Earth's atmosphere. Some scientists drill ice cores to find out about the weather long ago. People who work in the Antarctic must be careful, because a blizzard can start any time and anywhere. When they go far away from their shelter, they must always take lots of food just in case."
"Today, people explore Antarctica using snowmobiles, which are faster than dogs and can pull heavier loads. Many come to Antarctica just for a short visit. There are companies in South America that have vacations to Antarctica, so people pay to go there on a ship. Some people take their own boats."
South Pole
"The South Pole is the most southern point on the Earth. It is in Antarctica and is the center of the Southern Hemisphere. From the South pole, everywhere is North."
"The geographic North and South poles are the poles the earth spins around, the ones people see on a globe where all the north–south lines meet. These poles stay in the same place, and are usually the ones we mean if we just say North or South Pole. People can tell that they are at these poles by looking at the stars (at the poles, a star just circles around at the same height, never dipping to the horizon). The Sun rises once a year and gives the South Pole half a year of summer but it is always cold. When the Sun sets half a year later it makes half a year of winter which is even colder. The South Pole is always cold because the Sun never rises high in the sky."
"The south magnetic pole is something different. It is defined by the Earth's magnetic field, as roughly where a magnetic compass needle points. People can tell they are near these poles by looking at a compass."
Exploration.
"The South Pole is hard to reach. Unlike the North pole, which is covered by the sea and flat sea-ice, the South Pole is on a mountainous continent. This continent is called Antarctica. It is covered by thick ice (more than a mile thick in the centre). The south Pole is very high up, and is very windy. It is far from places where people live, and ships going there often have to find their way through thick sea ice. Once ashore, land-travelling explorers have to travel more than a thousand miles to get to the pole. They must cross a floating ice shelf, then up onto the ice-covered land, up steep mountain glaciers covered in broken, twisted ice slowly sliding to the sea, and across a high level land (""plateau"") covered in ice and swept by strong freezing winds."
"Two expeditions early in the 20th century, led by Robert Falcon Scott and then Ernest Shackleton, failed to reach the South Pole, but returned safely. Shackleton turned back quite close to the pole, but it was late in the season and supplies were low. He knew that he would be risking the lives of his men, so he turned back."
"The first men to reach the South Pole were a group from Norway led by Roald Amundsen. They arrived at the Pole on December 14, 1911 and left the Norwegian flag. Amundsen and his men returned home safely. Amundsen's story is one of excellent planning, good leadership, and willingness to learn from others: this made extreme endurance unnecessary, and perhaps made the successful expedition less of a story, and therefore perhaps less famous, than the next one."
"The most famous South Pole expedition is perhaps the one that failed badly. This was the British expedition (not just UK, it included people from the British Empire, who at that time were considered British citizens) led by Robert Falcon Scott. Scott and four other men, dragging their equipment on sledges, had hoped to be first to the Pole. When they arrived, they saw a Norwegian flag. A letter left for Scott showed that Amundsen and his men had beaten them by a month, by using dogs to pull their sledges."
"On their journey back from the Pole, Scott's team found that food ""dumps"" were short of supplies, particularly kerosene. Kerosene was very important: not just for cooking but for melting ice. Once it ran out, they would have no water to drink. One man collapsed and died while walking. Oates knew his frostbitten feet could not carry him back to base, and that he might delay his companions and risk their lives. He committed suicide by walking out of their tent into the cold. Scott and his remaining two companions died of starvation, thirst, and cold - trapped in the tent by bad weather until their supplies ran out. Next spring, the three bodies in the tent were found by a team from the main part of the expedition - who had spent the winter in the expeditions's hut by the sea. Scott's letters to his wife, written in the tent when he knew he was going to die, have just (Jan 2007) been made public."
"Apart from Ernest Shackleton's expedition to cross the Antarctic (another heroic failure, but Shackleton saved all his men, after a very courageous sea crossing in an open boat, and a crossing of an unknown mountain range while starving and freezing), this was the end of the ""heroic"" age of exploration. Motors, Planes, Radios, and GPS ensured that following expeditions were never truly ""unsupported""."
Today there is an American science base at the South Pole. It is named the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to honor the two explorers.
Climate.
"The South Pole has a desert climate. It almost never gets any precipitation. Air humidity is near zero. However, high winds can cause the blowing of snowfall, and the accumulation of snow amounts to about per year. The former dome seen in pictures of the Amundsen-Scott station is partially buried due to snow storms, and the entrance to the dome had to be regularly bulldozed to uncover it. More recent buildings are raised on stilts so that the snow does not build up against the sides."
Indian Ocean
Development: 1989–2000.
"In 1989, HP thought Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were stuck at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers tried to create a new type of processor architecture, later called Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), that allows the processor to use many instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC uses a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which 1 instruction word had many instructions. With EPIC, the compiler checks which instructions can be used at the same time, so the processor can run the instructions without needing complicated methods to see which instructions to use at the same time."
"The goal of this idea is to allow better inspection of the code at the time of compile to check for additional opportunities for multiple executions at once, and to simplify processor design and save electricity by removing the need for runtime scheduling instructions."
"HP thought that it was not good for individual enterprise system companies like HP to make proprietary processors, so HP worked with Intel in 1994 to create the IA-64 architecture, made with EPIC's ideas. Intel wanted to make a large effort in creating IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting processor would be used by most enterprise systems. HP and Intel had a large design effort to make the first Itanium product, Merced, in 1998."
"During creation, Intel, HP, and other industry analysts thought that IA-64 would be very popular in servers, workstations, and desktops, and one day replace RISC and Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architectures for multi-purpose applications."
Compaq and Silicon Graphics stopped working on their Alpha and MIPS architectures to move to the Itanium architecture.
"Many groups created operating systems for Itanium, including Microsoft Windows, OpenVMS, Linux, and UNIX types such as HP-UX, Solaris,"
"Tru64 UNIX, and Monterey/64"
"(the last three were never finished work with running on Itanium). By 1997, many found that the Itanium architecture and the compiler were more difficult to use than they thought."
"Technology issues such as the very high transistor counts needed for the large instruction words and the large caches. There were also problems with the project, as the two parts of the team used different methods and had slightly different priorities. Because Merced was the first EPIC processor, its creation had more problems than the team had thought. In addition, the EPIC concept requires different compiler abilities that had never been created before, so more research was needed."
"Intel announced the name of the processor, ""Itanium"", on October 4, 1999."
"In only a few hours, the name ""Itanic"" had been used as a joke, (a reference to ""Titanic"", the ""unsinkable"" ship that sank in 1912 (""Itanium + Titanic = Itanic""))."
"""Itanic"" has also been used by ""The Register"","
"and others,"
"to say the multi-billion-dollar investment in Itanium, and the early demand with it, would mean nothing because they thought Itanium was going to fail."
Itanium (Merced): 2001.
"By the time Itanium was released in June 2001, its performance was not superior to competing RISC and CISC processors."
"Itanium competed with low-power systems (primarily 4-CPU and small systems) with servers based on x86 processors, and with high-power such as with IBM's POWER architecture and Sun Microsystems' SPARC architecture. Intel shifted Itanium to working with the high-power business and HPC computing, trying to copy x86's successful market (i.e., 1 architecture, many system vendors). The success of the 1st processor version was only with replacing PA-RISC in HP systems, Alpha in Compaq systems and MIPS in SGI systems, but IBM also made a supercomputer based on this architecture."
"POWER and SPARC were strong, and the x86 architecture grew more into the enterprise space, because of easier scaling and very large install base."
"Only a few thousand systems using the 1st Itanium processor, ""Merced"", were sold, because of poorer performance, high cost and less Itanium-made software."
"Intel saw that Itanium required more native software to work well, so Intel made thousands of systems for independent software vendors to help them make Itanium software. HP and Intel brought the 2nd Itanium processor, Itanium 2, to market a year later."
Itanium 2: 2002–2010.
"The Itanium 2 processor was released in 2002, for enterprise servers and not all of high-power computing. The 1st version of Itanium 2, code-named ""McKinley"", was created by HP and Intel. It fixed many of the problems of the 1st Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by a bad memory subsystem. ""McKinley"" had 221 million transistors (25 million of them were for logic), and was 19.5 mm by 21.6 mm (421 mm2) and was created with a 180 nm design process, and a CMOS process with 6 layers of aluminium."
"In 2003, AMD released the Opteron, which implemented the first x86-64 architecture (called AMD64 at the time). Opteron was much more successful because it was an easy upgrade from x86. Intel implemented x86-64 in its Xeon processors in 2004."
"Intel released a new Itanium 2 processor, code-named ""Madison"", in 2003. Madison used a 130 nm process and was the foundation of all new Itanium processors until June 2006."
"In March 2005, Intel announced that it was working on a new Itanium processor, code-named ""Tukwila"", to be released in 2007. Tukwila would have 4 processor cores and would replace the Itanium bus with a new Common System Interface, which would also be used by a new Xeon processor."
"Later in that year, Intel changed Tukwila's release date to late 2008."
"In November 2005, the largest Itanium server makers worked with Intel and many software vendors to create the Itanium Solutions Alliance, to promote the architecture and speed up software porting."
The Alliance says that its members would invest $10 billion in Itanium solutions by the end of the decade.
"In 2006, Intel delivered ""Montecito"" (marketed as the Itanium 2 9000 series), a 2-core processor that had approximately 2x performance and 20% less energy usage."
"Intel released the Itanium 2 9100 series, codenamed ""Montvale"", in November 2007."
"In May 2009, the release for Tukwila, Montvale's successor, was changed again, with release to OEMs planned for the first quarter of 2010."
"The modern history of Bahrain begins with Great Britain exploring the area, trying to keep Iran from taking more land. The British gave support to the Al-Khalifa family, who made a power base in the island and allied with the British to keep the island from Iran. The British got free passage to the Persian Gulf through this agreement. In November of 1957, the Iranian parliament declared that Bahrain was the Fourteenth Province of Iran. Later the British would become involved in the politics of Bahrain by choosing an Emir of the island. Iran and Britain later agreed that the United Nations Secretary General would judge the political situation in Bahrain. In a Plebiscite to decide the country's future, the majority of the people of Bahrain chose to reject Iran's claims, and to define their country and their culture to be Arabic, and not Persian."
"Oil was found in the early 20th century and brought modern improvements to the country. Relations with the United Kingdom also became closer, and the British brought more military bases to the nation. British influence grew, until Charles Belgrave became an advisor; Belgrave brought modern education to Bahrain."
"After World War II, anti-British feeling spread through the Arab world and led to riots in Bahrain. The British left Bahrain in 1971, making it an independent country. The sales of more oil in the 1980s brought money to Bahrain, but even when the sales of oil decreased in later years, it did not cause as many problems in Bahrain as in other oil countries, because the economy of Bahrain had grown into other areas."
In 1973 the election of first parliament was done but the government stopped &amp; dissociate the parliament in 1975 which result in strong protests by the Bahraini opposition (Moderate Islamic &amp; non-Islamist opposition).
"In 1994, many highly educated Bahraini people signed a letter to Prince of Bahrain at that time Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa"
to re-establish the parliament life which is strongly refused &amp; the leader of the opposition at that time Sheikh Abdulamir Aljamri was jailed then a huge protest &amp; conflicts occurs between Bahraini nation &amp; the armed forces.
"In 1999, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa followed his father as head of state and called for elections for parliament to resolve the congestion that occurred over that last period. The women were given the right to vote and the new ruler released all political prisoners in 2001."
In 2002 the King released a new constitution without any voting from the nation &amp; canceled 1973 constitution which caused strong refuse from the most of nation parties &amp; opposition.
"The situations became worse later &amp; some of political activists were jailed like Abdulhadi Al-Khuwajah, Hasan Mushaima."
Many political websites that refused these changes were blocked like Bahrain online forum (the most popular website in Bahrain): www.bahrainonline.org Until 2009 there were many riots &amp; conflicts especially from Shia group which faces a huge organized discrimination according to Human Rights Watch &amp; US Congress.
Politics.
"Bahrain is a constitutional monarchy ruled by the King, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. The head of government is the Prime Minister, which is currently held by Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa was the country's first prime minister from 1971 until his death in 2020. The prime minister has a cabinet of 15 members."
"Bahrain has a bicameral legislature with a lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, elected by all of the people and the upper house, the Shura Council, appointed by the King. Both houses have forty members. The first elections were held in 2002, with Members of Parliament serving four year terms."
"Women were given the right to vote and stand in national elections for the first time in 2002's election, but no women were elected to office that year, and Shia and Sunni Islamists won a majority of seats. Because no women were elected, six were appointed to the Shura Council, which also includes members of the Kingdom’s Jewish and Christian people."
The King recently created the Supreme Judicial Council to organise the country's courts and the government offices.
Governorates.
"Bahrain is split into five governorates. Until July 3 2003, it was divided into twelve municipalities."
"For further information, see: Decree-Law establishing governorates from the Bahrain official website."
Cities.
The largest cities in Bahrain are:
"Other towns include: Awali, Diraz, Hidd, Sar, Bani Jamrah."
Economy.
"In Bahrain, petroleum (oil product) producing and processing is about 60% of the money from export, 60% of government money, and 30% of Gross Domestic Product. The economy has changed as the sales of oil have changed since 1985, for example, during and after the Persian Gulf War of 1990 - 1991. Bahrain has high quality communications and transport, and so the country is home to many international companies with business in the Persian Gulf. A large part of the country's income comes from petroleum products made from imported crude oil. There are several major industrial projects being built. Unemployment, especially among young people, and the decrease of both oil and water resources are major economic problems."
Geography.
"Bahrain is a flat and dry archipelago, with a low desert plain rising gently to a low central hill, in the Arabian Gulf, east of Saudi Arabia. The highest point is the 122 meter Jabal ad Dukhan (""Mountain of Smoke"")."
"Bahrain has a total area of 620 km², which is a few square kilometres larger than the Isle of Man. As an archipelago of 33 islands, Bahrain does not share a land border with any other country, but it does have a 161 km coast line and claims a further 12 nm of territorial sea and a 24 nm contiguous zone. Bahrain enjoys mild winters and has very hot, humid summers."
"Bahrain's natural resources include large amounts of oil natural gas as well as fish. Only 1% of the country includes land where crops can be grown. 92% of Bahrain is desert, and droughts and dust storms are the main natural dangers."
"Environmental problems in Bahrain include desertification, which is causing the land where crops can be grown to decrease, and damage to coast lines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation caused by oil spills from large tankers and oil refineries."
About the people.
"The official religion of Bahrain is Islam; most of the people are Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, but there are also small Jewish and Christian minorities. Most Bahrainis are Arabs, although some tribes came from Persia. Today, many of the people in Bahrain are guest workers who come from Iran, South Asia and Southeast Asia. A ""Financial Times"" article from 31 May 1983 found that ""Bahrain is a polyglot (speaking many languages) state, both religiously and racially. Leaving aside the temporary immigrants of the past 10 years, there are at least eight or nine communities (groups of people) on the island""."
"The present communities may be classified as Al-Khalifa, Arab tribes allied to Al-Khalifa, the Baharnah (Shia Arabs), the Howilla (Sunni Arabs from Persia), Sunni Arabs (from the mainland), Ajam (Persian Shia), Indians who traded with Bahrain and settled before the age of oil (used to be called Banyan), a tiny Jewish community, and a group which contains everyone else."
Culture.
Role in the Indian National Movement.
"In 1917, Sardar Vallabhbhai was elected as the Secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, the Gujarat wing of the Indian National Congress. In 1918, he led a massive ""No Tax Campaign"" that urged the farmers not to pay taxes after the British insisted on tax after the floods in Kaira. The peaceful movement forced the British authorities to return the land taken away from the farmers. His effort to bring together the farmers of his area brought him the title of 'Sardar'. He actively supported the non-cooperation Movement launched by Gandhi. Patel toured the nation with him, recruited 300,000 members and helped collect over Rs.1.5 million."
"In 1928, the farmers of Bardoli again faced a problem of ""tax-hike"". After prolonged summons, when the farmers refused to pay the extra tax, the government seized their lands in retaliation. The agitation took on for more than six months. After several rounds of negotiations by Patel, the lands were returned to farmers after a deal was struck between the government and farmers’ representatives."
"In 1930, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was among the leaders who were imprisoned for participating in the famous Salt Satyagraha movement initiated by Mahatma Gandhi. His inspiring speeches during the ""Salt Movement"" transformed the outlook of numerous people, who later played a major role in making the movement successful. He led the Satyagraha movement across Gujarat when Gandhi was under imprisonment, upon request from the congress members."
"Sardar Patel was freed in 1931, following an agreement signed between Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India. The treaty was popularly known as the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. The same year, Patel was elected as the President of Indian National Congress in its Karachi session where the party deliberated its future path. Congress committed itself towards the defense of fundamental and human rights. It was in this session that the dream of a secular nation was conceived."
"During the legislative elections of 1934, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel campaigned for the Indian National Congress. Though he did not contest, Sardar Patel helped his fellow party mates during the election."
"In the 1942 Quit India Movement, Patel continued his unwavering support to Gandhi when several contemporary leaders criticized the latter’s decision. He continued travelling throughout the country propagating the agenda of the movement in a series of heart-felt speeches. He was arrested again in 1942 and was imprisoned in the Ahmednagar fort till 1945 along with other Congress leaders."
"Sardar Patel’s journey often saw a number of confrontations with other important leaders of the congress. He voiced his annoyance at Jawaharlal Nehru openly when the latter adopted socialism in 1936. Patel was also wary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and considered him to be ""keen on more power within the party”."
Sardar Patel &amp; the Partition of India.
"The separatist movement lead by Muslim League leader Mohammed Ali Jinnah led to a series of violent Hindu-Muslim riots across the country just before the independence. In Sardar Patel’s opinion, the open communal conflicts incited by the riots had the potential to establish a weak Government at the centre post-independence which will be disastrous for consolidating a democratic nation. Patel went on to work on a solution with V.P. Menon, a civil servant during December 1946 and accepted his suggestion of creating a separate dominion based on religious inclination of states. He represented India in the Partition Council."
Contributions to Post-independence India.
"After India achieved independence, Patel became the first Home Minister and also the Deputy Prime Minister. Patel played a very crucial role in post-independence India by successfully integrating around 565 princely states under the Indian Dominion. The British Government had presented these rulers with two alternatives - they could join India or Pakistan; or they could stay independent. This clause magnified the difficulty of process to mammoth proportions. Congress entrusted this intimidating task to Sardar Patel who started lobbying for integration on August 6, 1947. He was successful in integrating all of them barring Jammu and Kashmir, Junagarh and Hyderabad. He eventually dealt with the situation with his sharp political acumen and secured their accession. The India that we see today was a result of the efforts put in by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel."
"Patel was a leading member of the Constituent Assembly of India and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was appointed on his recommendation. He was the key force in establishing the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service. He took personal interest in initiating a restoration endeavor of the Somnath Temple in Saurashtra, Gujarat. Patel dealt ruthlessly with the Pakistan’s efforts to invade Kashmir in September 1947. He oversaw immediate expansion of the army and marked improvement of other infrastructural aspects. He often disagreed with Nehru’s policies, especially about his dealings with Pakistan regarding the refugee issues. He organized multiple refugee camps in Punjab and Delhi, and later in West Bengal."
Influence of Gandhi.
"Gandhi had profound effect on Patel’s politics and thoughts. He pledged unwavering support to the Mahatma and stood by his principles allowed by night at museum and art is the most beautiful woman and through his life. While leaders including Chakravarthy Rajagopalachari and Maulana Azad criticized Mahatma Gandhi's idea that the civil disobedience movement would compel the British to leave the nation, Patel extended his support to Gandhi. Despite the unwillingness of the Congress High Command, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel strongly forced the All India Congress Committee to ratify the civil disobedience movement and launch it without delaying further. Upon Gandhi’s request he gave up his candidacy for the post of the Prime Minister of India. He suffered a major heart attack after Gandhiji’s death.  Although he recovered, he attributed it to having lamented silently for the loss of his mentor."
Death of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
"Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's health started declining in 1950. He relized that he was not going to live much longer. On November 2, 1950, his health became even worse and he had to stay in bed. He died because of a heart attack on December 15, 1950."
Trinamool Congress
"The All India Trinamool Congress (abbreviated AITC, TMC or Trinamool Congress) is an Indian political party based in West Bengal."
"Deadwood, South Dakota"
"Deadwood (Lakota: ""Owáyasuta""; ""To approve or confirm things"") is a city in South Dakota, United States, and the county seat of Lawrence County. It is named after the dead trees found in its gulch. The population was 1,270 at the 2010 census. The entire city is a National Historic Landmark District, for its well-preserved Gold Rush-era architecture."
"Union County, South Dakota"
"Union County is a county located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. As of the 2010 census, the population was 14,399. Its county seat is Elk Point. Originally named Cole County, the named was changed to Union because of Civil War sentiment. It was founded on April 10, 1862."
"Union County is part of the Sioux City, IA–NE–SD Metropolitan Statistical Area."
"""Progressive Farmer"" rated Union County second in the 2006 ""Best Place to Live"" in the U.S., because ""its schools are good, its towns neat and its people friendly."""
"Miner County, South Dakota"
"Miner County is a county located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. As of the 2010 census, 2,389 people lived there. Its county seat is Howard. It was created in 1873."
"Echo Lake is the park's small oval-shaped lagoon, which was designed to form one of the ears in the big Hidden Mickey from the park's original layout. Around it are many attractions and services, some in buildings designed to look like the ""California Crazy"" form of architecture from Hollywood's Golden Age."
"At The American Idol Experience, park guests can audition and sing for live audiences, and win a special front-of-the-line pass for the popular TV series' real tryouts. Next door, ""Sounds Dangerous!"" features a 3-D audio presentation starring comedian Drew Carey. In between them is the A.T.A.S. Hall of Fame Plaza, a display of busts of past and present icons of the television era, such as Oprah Winfrey and Walt Disney."
"Echo Lake has three attractions based on characters and movies produced by George Lucas' Lucasfilm studio. """" is an upcoming motion simulator ride set in the ""Star Wars"" universe, and is a duplicate of the yet-to-be opened attraction at Disneyland. Jedi Training Academy, a live-action stage show, invites children to become ""padawan learners"" and receive ""lightsaber training"" from a Jedi master. Lastly, the live-action ""Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!"" re-enacts various scenes from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" while illustrating how movie stunts are performed."
Streets of America.
"Originally the New York Street backlot set that was part of the park's original Backlot Studio Tour, the section was later opened to pedestrian traffic. Recently, some of it was changed to look like San Francisco and New York. The current version of the Studio Backlot Tour features the American Film Institute Showcase, a rotating exhibit of movie props and memorabilia, and a tram ride through the backlot areas and through ""Catastrophe Canyon"", an effects-laden ""movie set."" Kids can play on giant plants and toys at the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids Movie Set Adventure, based on the 1989 Disney movie. Added in 2005, the ""Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show"" is a behind-the-scenes look at how car action sequences are made for movies, and is based on a similar show at Walt Disney Studios Park."
Animation Courtyard.
"This section of the park was originally the starting point for the tours of the park's active production studios. Its entrance is marked by a square ""studio arch,"" much like a real Hollywood studio lot entrance might be marked. The Animation Courtyard is home to a number of attractions based on Disney characters of yesterday, today and tomorrow. The Magic of Disney Animation is an attraction that shows how to animate a character. It also has games and exhibits, along with meet-and-greet areas for Disney and Pixar characters."
"Mickey Avenue, a section inside the Animation Courtyard, has two walk-through exhibits. is about the life and legacy of Walt Disney. It has photos, models, rare artifacts and a short biographical movie narrated by Julie Andrews. At ""Journey into Narnia,"" guests can see props and set pieces from the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" movie series (originally distributed by Disney; now handled by 20th Century Fox), as well as meet Prince Caspian from """"."
"The Courtyard section also has two live shows. ""Playhouse Disney Live on Stage!"" has puppet characters from ""Playhouse Disney"" shows on The Disney Channel, including Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Handy Manny, and Little Einsteins. Across the plaza, ""Voyage of the Little Mermaid"" uses glow-in-the-dark puppets, lasers, music, projectors, human actors and water effects to re-create favorite scenes and songs from the animated ""Little Mermaid"" movie."
Toy Story Land.
"The park's newest section has many of the original soundstages used when the park still made TV shows. Today, Toy Story Land looks like the Emeryville, California campus of Pixar Animation Studios with attractions including Toy Story Midway Mania!, an interactive 3D attraction based on classic carnival midway games, each hosted by characters from the ""Toy Story"" movie series. Toy Story Land is also the home of Luxo Jr., a six-foot-tall audio-animatronic version of Pixar's desk-lamp mascot. The moving character performs periodic shows throughout the day and evening across from Toy Story Midway Mania."
Sunset Boulevard.
"Sunset Boulevard was the first expansion to Disney's Hollywood Studios, opening in July 1994. The main attraction on Sunset Boulevard is The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, a thrill ride based on the classic television series. Located nearby is Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, an indoor roller coaster in the dark with three inversions that starts moving at a high speed."
"Sunset Boulevard has two outdoor amphitheaters for live stage shows. The covered Theater of the Stars has ""Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage"", a stage show with scenes from the movie. The open-air Hollywood Hills Amphitheater is the home of ""Fantasmic!"", a nighttime show with Mickey Mouse and many other Disney characters in a story filled with fireworks, lasers and water effects."
Therocephalia
"Therocephalia ('beast-heads') are an extinct group of theriodonts. They lived from the middle Permian into the Triassic 265—245 million years ago, about 20 million years."
"The therocephalians are named after their large skulls. Their skulls, with the structure of their teeth, suggest that they were successful carnivores."
"Like other non-mammalian therapsids, therocephalians are sometimes described as mammal-like reptiles. In fact Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts, which gave rise to the mammals."
"This relationship shows in a variety of anatomical features, possibly including whiskers and hair. There remain many unanswered questions about the phylogeny, anatomy, and physiology of therocephalians."
"The fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the Karoo of South Africa, but have also been found in Russia, China, and Antarctica."
"Early therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a Gondwanan origin for the group, which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world. Although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great Permian–Triassic extinction event, a few representatives of the subgroup (called Eutherocephalia) survived into the early Triassic and continued to diversify."
"However, the last therocephalians became extinct by the early middle Triassic. The reasons for their extinction are not known."
Matrix mechanics
Matrix mechanics is the first way that physicists found to express quantum physics in mathematical form. Werner Heisenberg initially developed this form of expression of the laws of physics just as an equation that he could use to predict the intensities of the photons in the various bands of the hydrogen spectrum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"Heisenberg's teacher and colleague, Max Born, saw that his equation was essentially the plan for creating and multiplying matrices."
"The matrix form of quantum physics is still used since it is useful and convenient for some purposes. Other mathematical ways, particularly Erwin Schrödinger's equation using a wave function, are mathematically equivalent but are easier to use for other purposes."
One of the early successes of this theory was announced shortly thereafter and is now called the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

Deaths.
"Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. This data are recorded by the WHO."
Duration.
"On 11 March 2020, the WHO said that the pandemic could be controlled."
Symptoms.
"According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, which can often be confused with the flu virus."
"According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea, but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs."
Name.
"In February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name ""2019-nCoV."" ""Covi"" is for ""coronavirus,"" ""D"" for ""disease,"" and ""19"" for the year 2019 – the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word ""Wuhan."" They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud."
Mortality rate of COVID-19.
"According to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study."
"On March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate."
Race and racism.
"COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. In July 2020, ""The New York Times"" printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick."
"Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work. This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University, also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem."
"In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status."
"In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons."
Indigenous peoples.
"Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands."
"Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane."
"The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own."
George Floyd protests.
"In May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest."
African Americans.
"African Americans are more likely to catch the virus compared to their white counterparts in the United States, and are also more likely to die from it. 50,000 African Americans died of COVID-19 in 2020. African Americans are the least likely to get vaccinated against the disease."
Romani people.
Romani people (Gypsies) in Europe were hard-hit by COVID-19.
Hispanics.
Latinos have been at a higher risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 in the United States.
Conspiracy theories.
"In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks."
"On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in ""Nature Medicine"" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it."
"The small size suggests some kind of temperature regulation, which in turn suggests insulation in the form of fur. Nocturnal activity in an animal of this size virtually requires an increased internal production of heat.p124"
"Brain size is another factor. It is certain that early mammals did have enlarged brains relative to their size. Reconstructions of the brain size has shown this. Apparently, brain size in Mesozoic mammals lay within the lower range of brain size for living mammals. This is an overall increase of four or more times the volume of basal amniote brains. Very likely this involved the development of the neocortex, ""one of the most striking of all mammalian characteristics"".p120"
Is it a mammal?
There has been a long controversy about whether or not to classify it as a mammal. Some prefer to include it in a broader clade called Mammaliaformes.
"""Morganucodon"" is regarded as very basal (= primitive). Its lower jaw has some of the bones found in its synapsid ancestors in a very reduced form. Mammals have a jawbone composed solely of the dentary."
"The primitive jaw joint between the articular and quadrate bones is still found in ""Morganucodon"".p107/112 In modern mammals these bones moved into the middle ear and become part of the ear ossicles as malleus and incus, ""Morganucodon"" is unusual because, apart from still having the primitive hinge, it has also evolved the derived mammalian one and so has a double jaw joint."
"Its tooth replacement and determinate growth, are mammalian features.p324/346 Earlier synapsids replace their teeth throughout life, as sauropsids also do. This is known as ""polyphyodonty"", while mammals grow only two sets of teeth, in ""diphyodonty""."
Castle Vale Estate
"Castle Vale is a housing estate near Erdington, northeast of Birmingham city centre, in England. The area has about 10,000 people. It has modern homes because a lot of new houses were built after World War II. It is known as a postwar overspill estate."
"The area was originally known as Berwood, from the Saxon 'Bearu' meaning 'the woods'. Historically the area was a boggy and wooded area, and development only started when Edward Darcy began cutting down the trees in the 17th century and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal was built in the 18th century. In the 20th century, the land became the site for the first aeroplane take-off in Birmingham which led to a long aviation history being associated with the area. Castle Bromwich Aerodrome was established on the site and operated from 1914 to 1960, being a major airfield in both World Wars and also having industrial importance as the testing facility for locally manufactured airplanes and the location for the British Industries Fair."
"Castle Vale became infamous from the 1970s onwards as a large scale example of a failed postwar overspill estate, which suffered from poor construction and maintenance, social deprivation and high levels of crime. The area became the focus of a targeted regeneration initiative, led by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust (CVHAT) from 1993 to 2005, where the estate witnessed the demolition of many of its houses and facilities, the repair of remaining properties, and the construction of new housing and facilities along with the remodelling of the estate, funded both privately and publicly. It is now hailed as an example of a successful community-led regeneration scheme."
Mahayana
"Mahayana (, ""mahāyāna"", literally the ""Great Vehicle"") is one of the two main branches of Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism is from India. Zen is a kind of Mahayana that is influenced by Confucianism."
Tritylodont
Tritylodonts were small to medium-sized mammal-like cynodonts. They varied in size from a rabbit to a beaver.
"They were the last family of the non-mammalian synapsids. One of the last cynodont lines to appear, the family Tritylodontidae descended from a ""Cynognathus""-like cynodont. Their teeth had three cusps (bumps) which gave them their name."
"The tritylodonts were herbivorous, chewing through vegetation, such as stems, leaves, and roots. Tritylodonts have no canine teeth, just incisors and cheek teeth. The jaw worked by grinding forward and backwards, shredding the food between the ridges of the teeth."
"They were the longest surviving of all the non-mammalian therapsids. They appeared in the latest Triassic period, and persisted through the Jurassic until the middle of the Cretaceous. This shows that the tritylodonts were a successful group of therapsids, even though they lived right beneath the ruling dinosaurs' feet, so to speak."
"It is very clear that the tritylodonts were warm-blooded. The tritylodont fossils were found in the Americas, South Africa, and Eurasia. They may have managed to live worldwide, including Antarctica."
"There are quite a few parallels between these tritylodonts (which are outside the mammal line) and multituberculates, which are mammals. The tritylodonts had no competition in the Jurassic, because all the other mammal-like types were either carnivores or insectivores. Kermack's conclusion is that when the multituberculates appeared (middle Jurssic) they were in direct competition, and eventually they out-competed the earlier group, and replaced it."
August Belmont
"August Belmont, Sr. (8 December 1813–24 November 1890) was born in Alzey, Hesse, to a Jewish family. He emigrated to New York City in 1837 when he became the American representative of the Rothschild family's banking house in Frankfurt. Later he became an American citizen, and married Caroline Slidell Perry, daughter of Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry."
Early life.
"August Belmont was born on December 8, 1813—some sources say 1816—to Simon and Frederika Elsass Schönberg. His mother died when he was seven, and he went live with his uncle and grandmother in Frankfurt. He attended the Jewish Junior and Senior High School until he began his first job as an apprentice to the Rothschilds. He would sweep floors, polish furniture, and run errands while studying English, arithmetic, and writing. He was then given a confidential clerkship in 1832 and promoted to private secretary before travelling to Naples, Paris, and Rome. In 1837, Belmont travelled to Havana to manage the Rothschild's Cuban interests. On his way to Havana, however, Belmont stopped in New York. He arrived there during the Panic of 1837 and stayed to look afte Rothschild's interests there instead of continuing on to Havana. After he emigrated to the United States, he changed his surname, Schönberg (German for ""beautiful mountain""), to Belmont (French for ""beautiful mountain"")."
August Belmont and Company.
"In the Panic of 1837, hundreds of American businesses, including the Rothschild's American agents, went bankrupt. As a result, Belmont postponed his departure to Havana and began August Belmont &amp; Company, believing that he could supplant the recently bankrupt firm, the American Agency. August Belmont and Company was an instant success, and Belmont restored health to the Rothschild's US interests over the next five years. In 1844, Belmont was named the Consul-General of Austria at New York City. He resigned in 1850 because he thought Austria was cruel in the way it treated Hungary."
Entrance into politics.
"Belmont married Caroline Slidell Perry, the daughter of Matthew Calbraith Perry, on 7 November 1849. Soon, John Slidell, his wife's uncle, starting helping Belmont. Belmont's first task was to campaign for James Buchanan in New York. In June, 1851, Belmont wrote letters to the ""New York Herald"" and the ""New York National-Democrat"", insisting that they do justice to Buchanan's presidential run. But Franklin Pierce won the nomination instead, and Belmont made large contributions to the Democratic Party. After his victory, Pierce in 1853 appointed Belmont ""chargé d'affaires"" and minister to The Hague. While in Holland, Belmont urged American annexation of Cuba as a new slave state in what became known as the Ostend Manifesto."
"That September, Carter was beating Sanders in the first round by 49% to 38%. Since no one won more than half the vote, they went into a second round. Carter won the Democratic nomination with 59% of the vote against Sanders's 40%. In the general election, Carter beat Republican candidate Hal Suit, winning 59% of the vote against Suit's 40%."
"Governor of Georgia, 1971–1975."
"Carter became the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. In his inaugural speech, he said that ""the time of racial discrimination is over. ... No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being [without] the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice"". ""Time"" ran a story on the progressive ""New South"" governors elected that year in a May 1971 cover. The cover of the magazine had Carter."
"Lester Maddox, who Carter replaced as governor, became lieutenant governor. Richard Russell Jr., then President pro tempore of the United States Senate, died in office during Carter's second week in office. Carter picked David H. Gambrell, state Democratic Party chair, to replace Russell's in the United States Senate."
"Carter wanted to grow the governor's power while making the state government easier to run. He supported a bill that could give him the power of executive restructuring and to force a vote on it. The plan was not popular in the state legislature. But after two weeks of talking about the plan, it was passed. He lowered the number of state agencies from 300 to 22."
"In April 1971, while on television, Carter was asked if he supported the idea of governor and lieutenant governor running together. He said, ""I've never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia. The lieutenant governor is part of the executive branch of government and I've always felt—ever since I was in the state Senate—that the executive branches should be separate"". In July 1971, while in Columbus, Georgia, Carter created a Georgia Human Rights Council that would help solve issues in the state of any possible violence."
"In January 1972, Carter wanted to give state money for an Early Childhood Development Program and prison reform programs. In April 1972, Carter went to Latin and South America for a possible trade deal with Georgia. Carter said that he had met with Brazilian President Emílio Garrastazu Médici. Many said he was acting like President Kennedy."
"The number of black state workers, judges, and board members grew when Carter was governor. He put paintings of Martin Luther King Jr. in the capitol building, while the Ku Klux Klan were at the ceremony protesting. While on television with Governor of Florida Reubin Askew in January 1973, Carter said he supported a constitutional amendment to ban busing and to make desegregation in schools faster. He supported an anti-busing plan with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference. Carter signed a new death penalty law after the United States Supreme Court rejected it. Carter later said he did not support the death penalty, saying, ""I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now""."
Carter wanted to give equal state aid to schools in the rich and poor areas of Georgia. He helped create centers for mentally handicapped children and education programs for convicts. He also wrote a program that made picking federal judges based on their experience over their political party possible.
"In an unpopular move, Carter rejected a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River. He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was not giving the right numbers on the project's cost and possible harm on the region. The veto became popular with environmentalists across the country."
"Carter was not allowed to run for re-election because of term limits. Wanting to run for president, Carter was active in national politics and public appearances. He was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Carter hoped he would be George McGovern's vice presidential pick. He supported Senator Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson, to not support George Wallace."
"In May 1973, Carter told the Democratic Party to not make the Watergate scandal a political issue."
1976 presidential campaign.
Democratic primary.
"On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his candidacy for President of the United States at National Press Club in Washington, D.C. He talked about inequality, optimism, and change."
"When Carter first announced his presidential run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, he was seen as having little chances against better-known politicians. However, by March 1976 Carter was doing better in polls against other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. He was also ahead of President Ford by a few percentage points. Carter wrote ""Why Not the Best?"" in June 1976 to help make his name known for the American public."
"Carter won the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. In the South, Carter ran as a moderate and in the North, Carter ran as a conservative Christian. He had visited 37 states, and gave over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race. Carter ended up winning 30 states, with a total of 6,235,609 (39.2%) of the popular vote. He was officially nominated as the Democratic nominee at the national convention. He picked U.S. Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota as his vice president pick."
"During his presidential campaign in April 1976, Carter said to an interviewer, ""I have nothing against a community that is ... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods"". Carter said he understood why some neighborhoods were against desegregation. However, he also supported open-housing laws that make it illegal not to sell or rent a house or apartment to a person based on their race. His comments were unpopular with many Americans."
"Carter's campaign supported congressional campaigns using public financing, creating a federal agency for consumer protection, creating a separate department for education, signing an agreement that would stop the Soviet Union from using nuclear weapons, lowering money given to the military, increasing taxes for the rich and lowering them for the middle class, supporting the Social Security Act, and having a budget that would give money to government resources."
1976 general election.
Carter and President Gerald Ford were in three televised debates during the 1976 election. The debates were the first presidential debates since 1960.
"Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of ""Playboy"" for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election. While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: ""I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times"". He also said in another interview that he did not mind if people said the word ""fuck"". This led to a media to criticize the idea if politicians should be separated from their political campaigns and their private intimate lives."
"Carter began the race with a lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in by a small margin on November 2, 1976. Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240. Carter won fewer states than Ford, with Carter winning 23 states compared to Ford winning 27."
"Presidency, 1977–81."
"Carter was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1977."
Domestic policies.
Energy crisis.
"On April 18, 1977, Carter gave a televised speech saying that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was like war. He supported energy conservation by all Americans and added solar water heating panels on the White House. He wore sweaters because he turned down the heat in the White House. On August 4, 1977, Carter created the Department of Energy. During the signing event, Carter said the current ""crisis of energy shortages"" made him create the Department of Energy. Carter said that the House of Representatives had created many energy saving ideas. A month later, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's power to pass the energy reform bill. He said that ""the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office"" was the energy crisis."
"On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said plans about his energy reform proposal were not being made and that Congress was not being respectful."
"In April 1978, Carter said his biggest surprise since becoming president was the how hard it was for Congress to pass an energy reform bill."
"On March 1, 1979, Carter wanted to create a gasoline rationing plan with Congress approving it. On April 5, he talked about how important energy conservation is. At the end of the month, Carter said it was important that the Congress pass his gas rationing plan. On July 15, 1979, Carter said the crisis was a """" among the American people. Many did not like Carter's speech. People thought Carter for not doing enough to solve the crisis. Many believed he wanted Americans to do most of the work instead of the government."

Nadia Comăneci
"Nadia Elena Comăneci (born November 12, 1961) is a Romanian former gymnast."
"She is famous for scoring the first ever perfect 10 in Olympic gymnastics history in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Comaneci scored six perfect scores in Canada. She was coached by Béla Károlyi. She is married to former American gymnast Bart Conner, who is a commentator for the sport."
History of post-Soviet Russia
"Because of the end of the Soviet Union, Russia went through a large change politically, economically, and militarily. First off the Soviet Union became the Russian Federation. People now consider that the Federation is a follow up of the Soviet Union. However, Post-Soviet Russia lacked the military and political power of the former USSR. Now that communism died, Russia could elect a President. In June 1991, Boris Yeltsin was elected as the first president of Russia."
Change in Economy.
"Boris Yeltsin told his people that he would help the economy. One thing he did was help improve trade with other countries. However, not all his ideas would be good. When Yeltsin lifted price controls, a sudden increase in prices occurred (hyperinflation). Because the military was hit hard during the fall of the Soviet Union, many plants laid off workers because the Government was not sending the plants any new orders. This led to large unemployment."
"In August 1998 the Russian government devalued the ruble and defaulted on their debt. This was called the 1998 Russian financial crisis. This was due in part to the Asian financial crisis and the war in Chechnya. Many banks were forced to close down. The government stopped making payment of wages, pensions and when workers were paid, it was often with goods rather than rubles."
"Despite this, Russia came back from the August 1998 financial crash with speed. This was because the price of oil went up. Having the prices of oil go up, the exportation of the oil form Russia would cost more, this would bring in lots of money for the economy."
A series of privatizations occurred.
Relationships with Countries.
"Unlike in the Cold war, Russia now said that the West was considered an ally. In June 1998 they joined the NATO peace-keeping forces. The Russians also have begun relationships with China. In 1997 the Russians made a treaty with Belarus"
Today.
"Russia in the 21st century has gone through many changes. In 2000 Vladimir Putin was made President of Russia. Through his term he had good and bad approval ratings. In 2001-2002 Putin took over several media stations. Issues like this have also occurred with print media. However Putin has done good things for Russia, Indeed, during real GDP grew on average 6.7% a year, average income increased 11% annually, and a positive balance of the federal budget now let the government to cut 70% of its debt during his term."
Hurricane Henriette (2007)
"Hurricane Henriette was the deadliest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. The storm, which caused nine fatalities, formed from an area of cloud on August 30, 2007, and became a tropical storm the next day. The storm moved along the Mexican Pacific coast, and it rained very heavily. The city that had the most problems was Acapulco, Guerrero, where six people were killed by landslides, and where over 100 families had to leave after the La Sabana River flooded. Henriette then turned north and headed towards the Baja California peninsula, and became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Henriette made its first landfall east of Cabo San Lucas when it was at its strongest, causing the death of one woman because of rough seas."
"Hurricane Henriette then moved over the Sea of Cortez, and made its second landfall near Guaymas, Sonora. After causing heavy rains in Sonora, the storm weakened over the Sierra Madre Occidental and what was left went on to cause flooding in New Mexico and Texas. The damaged caused cost about $275 million (2007 MXN, $25 million 2007 USD). It hit Mexico on the same day Hurricane Felix hit Nicaragua, only one of two time when an Atlantic hurricane and a Pacific hurricane have made landfall on the same day."
Meteorological history.
"Henriette originated from a tropical wave that departed the west coast of Africa on August 20, 2007. The wave produced some convection while in the Caribbean Sea but reached Central America on August 28 before any significant development could occur. Early on August 30, the area of low pressure, now 400 miles (640 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico, started to gain clusters of strong convection. By the afternoon of August 30 the system continued to show strong convection and had developed a broad but well defined area of low to mid level cyclonic turning. By 0600 UTC that day the system became a tropical depression about southeast of Acapulco and was designated as Tropical Depression Eleven-E."
"Convection continued but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly wind shear which stinted the strengthening of this storm throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, parallel with the west coast of Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85 miles (137 km) south of Acapulco."
"It continued to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains. With continued strong convection, Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength. However, despite the low wind shear and apparent warm waters. Henriette did not strengthen as expected. This is believed to be due to its proximity to land and colds waters being brought up due to Henriette's slow movement. The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco. Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over northern Mexico."
"Henriette continued to improve in structure and with the formation of a distinct eye feature, reached hurricane strength on September 4 as it turned north-northwestward toward the Baja California peninsula, ahead of a mid-latitude trough approaching the west coast of the United States. The hurricane reached its peak intensity of 85 mph (135  km/h) that morning while centered about 75 miles (120 km)south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas."
"The center of Henriette made landfall just east of Cabo San Lucas on the afternoon of September 4 with maximum winds near  (130  km/h). It was over land for only about six hours before emerging into the Sea of Cortez. The brief interaction with land caused a slight weakening, but Henriette remained a Category 1 hurricane for most of that day. The next day it made final landfall near Guaymas in the state of Sonora. Henriette weakened quickly over land and dissipated over the mountains of northwestern Mexico early on September 6. The remnants of Tropical Storm Henriette continued to track across west Texas and southeastern New Mexico as it was being absorbed by a cold front moving through New Mexico. The flow of moisture from originating from these remnants, moderate instability, and marginal shear contributed to flash flooding and severe thunderstorms."
Preparations.
"The formation of Henriette was not anticipated well in NHC Tropical Weather Outlooks. The incipient system was first mentioned only about 31 hours before it became a tropical depression, and the potential for the formation of a depression was explicitly stated beginning only about 13 hours prior to genesis."
"On August 31, 2007 the National Meteorological Service in Mexico decreed zone of alert from Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. It requested the public to take precautions before the possible coming of rain, intense winds and storm surges in the south and southwestern coasts of Mexico. The Ministry of Education of Guerrero canceled classes at all schools in the evening and close the port navigation. Faced with the prospect of Henriette strengthening, The Head of the Harbor Bay in Acapulco stopped all travel for small craft and coastal fisheries. Also blue and yellow flags were raised as a preventive measure for swimmers. On September 4, the port of Mazatlán, Sinaloa had to be shut down to all navigation due to the inclement weather produced by the hurricane. The port authority reported that Henriette produced waves surpassing 4 meters (13 ft) in height. The Carnival Pride cruise scheduled to arrive at the port had to be diverted out to sea as a result of the port's closure. In the city itself, school was suspended for two days, and officials stated that approximately 600 famiilies might have to be evacuated. Further north, the port of Topolobampo, Sinaloa was also closed due to Henriette's threat, and 20 families were evacuated from their homes in an ejido."
"In La Paz, the Municipal Direction of Civil defense informed that the first of 13 temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000 people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they should take care not to leave their homes unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel Márquez de León International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500–8,500 tourists. Henriette also forced the ports in Los Cabos to close completely, and the port in La Paz to close to small craft."
Impact.
"During this period, in 1542, a Portuguese ship reached Japan and made the first direct contact between both cultures, including the knowledge of firearms. In the next few years, merchants and also some Christian missionaries from several European countries, mainly Portugal, the Netherlands, England, and Spain, reached the shores of Japan."
Azuchi-Momoyama Period.
"Azuchi-Momoyama period covers the years from 1568 to 1600. During these years, different parts of Japan became united again. Japan's military power grew. In 1592, Japan wanted to conquer China. At that time China was ruled by the Ming dynasty. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was one of the main leaders of Japan. He sent an army of 160,000 samurai to Korea. The Japanese could not win and retreated back to Japan. In 1597, Japan again sent an army to Korea. In 1598, Toyotomi Hideyoshi died. After his death, the Japanese dropped the idea of conquering Korea and China."
"During this period, the Japanese brought many Koreans to Japan. These Koreans were very good at making pottery and at other arts. Some of them were very educated. Japan gained new information and knowledge from these Koreans."
"Yaita Kinbee Kiyosada, the Japanese blacksmith who was ordered to copy and reverse engineer Portuguese matchlock muskets could not make the screw properly himself and had to give a his 16 year old daughter Wakasa in marriage to a Portuguese in exchange for the Portuguese teaching him to build the muskets. Today Japanese in Tageshima regard Wakasa as a heroine for giving herself to a Portuguese man in exchange for teaching how to screw the end of the musket barrel and a statue was built in her honour as well as candy, restaurants and boast named after her."
Japanese prostitutes were required to prove they were not Christian in order to work in prostitution by the Tokugawa government.
Edo Period.
"During the Edo period, Japan had many small rulers. There were about 200 of them. They were called daimyo, and they were all ruled by the Tokugawa Shogunate which was leaded by the Tokugawa clan. The shoguate's capital was relocated to Edo. This place was at modern-day Tokyo. Fifteen shoguns controlled the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo Period."
"Tôjin-yashiki, the Chinese merchant colony on a square island was south of Dejima where the Dutch merchants were. Japanese prostitutes from the Maruyama red light district of Nagasaki visited both the Dutch and Chinese men to have sex with them. Japanese artists drew erotic paintings of the foreign men having seen with Japanese women."
"Japanese peasant men were not required to kill wives who committed adultery but samurai were. The majority of the Japanese people in this period were townspeople, fisher people or peasant commoners and they did not take adultery, virginity or paternity of their children as serious issues unlike the samurai families, who were a minority of the Japanese population. Japanese commoner women and men mixed with each other and had out of wedlock or bastard children through adultery and they made up the majority of prostitutes. Japanese commoners did not have surnames until the Meiji restoration in the 19th century."
The Edo period is also a very important period in the history of Japan. The main developments include:
"In 1867, the Tokugawa Shogunate returned its political power to the emperor. Although, the emperor did not know how to rule the country because the last time the emperor had power was 500 years ago. So, the shogunate still remained in authority."
"In 1868, the Boshin War occurred between the Japanese emperor and the Tokugawa shogunate. Japan again came under the actual rule of an emperor as the Tokugawa shogunate was defeated."
Seclusion.
"Beginning from the early 17th century, the Tokugawa shogunate followed a policy of seclusion, known as sakoku in Japanese language. They suspected that traders, merchants, and missionaries from Europe wanted to bring Japan under the control of European powers. All traders and missionaries from other countries were forced to leave Japan, except for the Dutch, the Koreans, and the Chinese."
"Even during the period of seclusion, the Japanese continued to gain information and knowledge about other parts of the world."
End of seclusion.
"This policy of seclusion lasted for about 200 years until it ended under American military force. On July 8th 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry of the United States Navy reached Edo with four warships. The ships were heavily armed and their guns pointed towards the city. After this display of American military power, Japan was forced to agree to trade with other countries. The Japanese called these ships the ""kurofune"" or the Black Ships."
"Next year, on March 31st 1854, Perry came with seven ships and the Japanese signed a treaty (known as the Convention of Kanagawa) that established a diplomatic relationship with the United States. Another treaty (known as the Harris Treaty) was signed with the United States on July 29th 1858. This treaty gave more facilities to foreigners coming to Japan and expanded trade with Japan. Many Japanese were not happy with reopening diplomatic relations and trade with other countries."
"""For years several countries have applied for trade, but you have opposed them on account of a national law. You have thus acted against divine principles and your sin cannot be greater than it is. What we say does not necessarily mean, as has already been communicated by the Dutch boat, that we expect mutual trade by all means. If you are still to disagree we would then take up arms and inquire into the sin against the divine principles, and you would also make sure of your law and fight in defence. When one considers such an occasion, however, one will realize the victory will naturally be ours and you shall by no means overcome us. If in such a situation you seek for a reconciliation, you should put up the white flag that we have recently presented to you, and we would accordingly stop firing and conclude peace with you, turning our battleships aside."""
-Commodore Perry
"After Commodore Perry's visit, Japan began to deliberately accept Western culture to the point of hiring Westerners to teach Western customs and traditions to the Japanese starting in the Meiji era. Many Japanese politicians have since also encouraged the Westernization of Japan using the term Datsu-A Ron, which means the argument for ""leaving Asia"" or ""Good-bye Asia"". In Datsu-A Ron, ""Westernization"" was described as an ""unavoidable"" but ""fruitful"" change. After Japan's surrender to the United States and its allies ended World War II, the Westernization process of Japanese culture was further intensified and today, Japan is notably among the most Westernized countries in Asia."
Meiji Restoration.
The Meiji Restoration is an important period of history of Japan. Emperor Meiji ruled Japan and regained power from the shogunate. The Meiji Restoration began with the Boshin War of 1868. Emperor Meiji wanted Japan to become Westernized. Many changes occurred in Japan’s government and culture.
"The Iwakura Mission or Iwakura Embassy (岩倉使節団, Iwakura Shisetsudan) was a Japanese diplomatic voyage to the United States and Europe conducted between 1871 and 1873 by leading statesmen and scholars of the Meiji period. Although it was not the only such mission, it is the most well-known and possibly most significant in terms of its impact on the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. The mission was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck."
"Cong Liangbi was the owner of the Zhenye match producing company in Qinghai and Jinan and his sales for 1927-1928 were recorded in a survey by the Chinese Match Union. A Chinese businessman named Cong Liangbi in the match industry from Qingdao, Shandong who led the local Red Swastika Society branch had multiple concubines besides his Chinese first wife, Cong Jingshu (Xuannan) née Chi, he had a Japanese concubine from the time he stayed in Japan for business and another Chinese concubine, Cong Wanying (Shijian). The name of the Japanese wife transliterated into pinyin was Gaoqiao Xingzi. She was a temporary wife and they married for a period of 10 years agreed to in a written contract which said daughters would belong to the Japanese mother and sons to the Chinese father. She bore 2 sons, in 1906, Liumen, and in 1902, Zhengmen. Cong's Chinese wife back home in 1904 bore a son, Tongmen."
"A Xiangshan (Zhongshan), Guangdong born Chinese compradore named Su Jiesheng had a Chinese wife in Guangdong, but he also went to Japan and took a Japanese concubine and had a child by a Japanese maid who gave birth to his son Su Manshu (1884-1918), who was raised by the concubine but then also raised by the Guangdong based wife. The Japanese maid left when he was 3 months old so the Japanese concubine was called Kawai-sen and the boy grew up in Yokohama until he was 6 when he was sent to Guangdong in China.. He arrived in Guangdong in 1889. He went back to Japan in 1898 to Yokohama and to Tokyo in 1902."
Modern feminist ideas about letting women out of the house and participating in public life were taught to Chinese students studying in Japan by Japanese women.
Japanese peasant commoners did not care about the paternal identity of their children since they didn't have surname before the Meiji restoration and the maternal families accepted out of wedlock children born to yobai (night crawling) when Japanese men snuck into women's homes they were not married to and impregnated them without marrying them.
Han Chinese viewed the Uyghur women's practice of temporary marriage as morally corrupt.
Japanese girls prostituted to the Dutch were called Oranda yuki san while Japanese girls prostituted to the Chinese were called Karayuki-san. Japanese women were prostituted around the world as Karayuki san and Korean women were also taken into prostitution by the Japanese.
"Japanese sex tourists in the 1970s to 1990s often went to South Korea for sex with South Korean women and a connection was drawn by feminists to Japanese exploitation of Korean comfort women during World War II as well as Japanese women's prostitution as Karayuki-san in Singapore and other countries in Southeast Asia. There were 200,000 South Korean women servicing Japanese men as prostitutes by 1973."
"The college was founded by Elizabeth I on 27 June 1571 for the education of clergy, though students now study a broad range of secular subjects."
"A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh Price (or Ap Rhys), a churchman and lawyer from Brecon in Wales. The college continues to be associated informally with Wales to this day."
"The oldest buildings, in the first quadrangle, date from the 16th and early 17th centuries; a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713, and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906. Further accommodation was built on the main site to mark the 400th anniversary of the college, in 1971, and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east Oxford."
"The life of the college was disrupted by the English Civil War. Little happened at the college during the 18th century, and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards."
Reforms of Oxford University after two Royal Commissions in the latter half of the 19th century led to removal of many of the restrictions placed on the college's fellowships and scholarships. This meant the college was no longer mostly Welsh students and academics. Students' academic achievements rose in the early 20th century as fellows were appointed to teach in new subjects. Women were first admitted in 1974 and now form a large part of the undergraduate population.
"There are about 475 students. The Principal of the college is Lord Krebs, the son of the Nobel Prize winner Hans Krebs. Former students include Harold Wilson (twice British Prime Minister), Norman Washington Manley (Chief Minister of Jamaica) and T.E. Lawrence (""Lawrence of Arabia"")."
The university's Chair (professorship) of Celtic is attached to the college.
Nosferatu
"Nosferatu eine Symphonie des Grauens (translation: ""Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror"") is a 1922 German silent horror movie by F. W. Murnau. It was based on the ""Dracula"" novel by Bram Stoker."
"The movie was shot in 1921 and was released in Germany in 1922 and in the US in 1929. It is about a vampire or ""Nosferatu"" named Count Orlok (starring Max Schreck) who lives in a castle on top of a hill. The movie is in the public domain in America but not in Germany."
The movie was a commercial failure and caused the company Prana Film to be shut down due to copyright infringement. The movie was the only movie by Prana Film.
"The movie got a strong cult following. Not only this, the movie has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes it got a ""Certified Fresh"" label: 98% of critics gave the film a positive review with a ""fresh"" rating, based on 46 reviews."
"In 2010, it was ranked twenty-first in ""Empire"" magazine's ""The 100 Best Films of World Cinema""."
Plot.
"In 1838, Thomas Hutter lives in the fictional German city of Wisborg. His mysterious employer, estate agent Herr Knock, sends Hutter to Transylvania to visit a new client named Count Orlok who plans to buy a house in Wisborg. Hutter entrusts his loving wife Ellen to his good friend Harding and Harding's sister Annie, before embarking on his long journey. Nearing his destination in the Carpathian Mountains, Hutter stops at an inn for dinner. The locals become frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name and discourage him from traveling to his castle at night, warning of a werewolf on the prowl."
"The next morning, Hutter takes a coach to a high mountain pass, but the coachman declines to take him any further than the bridge as nightfall is approaching. A black-swathed coach appears after Hutter crosses the bridge and the coachman gestures for him to climb aboard. Hutter is welcomed at a castle by Count Orlok. When Hutter is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away."
"Hutter wakes up to a deserted castle the morning after and notices fresh punctures on his neck which, in a letter he sends by courier on horseback to be delivered to his devoted wife, he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house across from Hutter's own home in Wisborg and notices a photo of Hutter's wife, remarking that she has a ""lovely neck."""
Production.
"""Nosferatu"" is Prana Film's only production. Prana Film was founded 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and Albin Grau. Grau had the idea to shoot a vampire film; the inspiration arose from Grau's war experience: in the winter of 1916, a Serbian farmer told him that his father was a vampire and one of the Undead."
"Diekmann and Grau gave Henrik Galeen a job to screenplay inspired from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel ""Dracula"", despite Prana Film not having rights to the film. Galeen was an experienced specialist in Dark romanticism ; he had already worked on ""Der Student von Prag"" (""The Student of Prague"") in 1913, and the screenplay for 1920's ""Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam"" (""The Golem: How He Came into the World""). Galeen set the story in a fictional north German harbour town named Wisborg and changed the character names. He added the idea of the vampire bringing the plague to Wisborg via rats on the ship. He left out the Van Helsing vampire hunter character. Galeen's German Expressionism screenplay was poetically rhythmic, without being so dismembered as other books influenced by literary Expressionism, such as those by Carl Mayer. Lotte Eisner described Galeen's screenplay as """" (""full of poetry, full of rhythm"")."
"Dieckmann and Gray won the director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, who made movies until 1919, but had made ​​his first seven productions a reputation as a talented filmmaker. Gray, who had studied at the Art Academy in Dresden, took over as artistic director and designed sets and costumes. For the soundtrack of the musical director of the Prana-Film Hans Erdmann was responsible. The unknown stage actor Max Schreck from Munich, was committed for the title role. Other roles took on expressionist theater of Max Reinhardt trained actors like Greta Schröder, Gustav von Wangenheim, and Alexander Granach, a former classmate at Murnau Reinhardt's acting school at the Deutsches Theater."
"Filming began in July 1921. Exterior shots were filmed in Wismar. A take from Marienkirche's tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations were the Wassertor, the Heiligen-Geist-Kirche yard and the harbour. In Lübeck, the abandoned Salzspeicher served as Nosferatu's new Wisborg house, the one of the churchyard from Aegidienkirche served as Hutters and down the Depenau ""coffin bearers"" beared coffins. Many walks of Lübeck took place in the hunt of ""Knock"" who ordered Hutter in the ""Yard of Füchting"" to meet the earl. Further exterior shots followed in Lauenburg, Rostock and on Sylt. The film team travelled to the Carpathian Mountains, where Orava Castle served as backdrop for Orlok's half-ruined castle. Nearby locations also served: Hutter's stay at Dolný Kubín; the river journey with the coffins filmed on the Váh River; and the panoramas of the High Tatras mountain range. The team filmed interior shots at the JOFA studio in Berlin's Johannisthal locality. and further exteriors in the Tegel forest. Parts of the film set in Transylvania were also shot in Slovakia."
"For cost reasons, cameraman Fritz Arno Wagner only had one camera available, and therefore there was only one original negative. The director followed Galeen's screenplay carefully, following handwritten instructions on camera positioning, lighting, and related matters. Nevertheless, Murnau completely rewrote 12 pages of the script, as Galeen's text was missing from the director's working script. This concerned the last scene of the film, in which Ellen sacrifices herself and the vampire dies in the first rays of the Sun. Murnau prepared carefully; there were sketches that were to correspond exactly to each filmed scene, and he used a metronome to control the pace of the acting."
"Since the camera was mostly static and immobile to Nosferatu, Murnau used movement and differentiation within the rigid cadre in order to energize the scene. As Orloks ship slowly moves from right to left through the movie screen, Murnau used this so Eisner's ""powerful effect[s] of the impression of transverse motion."" would stress education. This served the same purpose subjectifications of the camera view, such as when the vampire filmed on the ship from the frog perspective or stand looking out of windows, parts of the frame and shoots into view . The highlight of the subjectivated gaze are the scenes in which the vampire character - directly facing the camera - turns to the audience and thus the fourth wall is broken: ""The vampire seems by its immensity, the dimensions of the screen to blow up and the viewers to directly threaten """
Release.
"Shortly before the premiere, an advertisement campaign was placed in issue 21 of the magazine ""Bühne und Film"", with a summary, scene and work photographs, production reports and essays including a treatment on vampirism by Albin Grau. Nosferatu's preview premiered on 4 March 1922 in the ""Marmorsaal"" of the Berlin Zoological Garden. This was planned as a large society evening called """" (Festival of Nosferatu), and guests were asked to arrive dressed in Biedermeier costume. The cinema premiere itself took place on 15 March 1922 at Berlin's ."
"This was Prana Film's only movie because the movie was a financial failure as a limited release. The UFA refused to take the film in the program of their large movie theaters, and so Nosferatu was only shown in a few small theaters. This was also because Bram Stoker had an estate, acting for his widow, Florence Stoker, sueing for copyright infringement and winning. The court ordered all existing prints of ""Nosferatu"" burned, but one purported copy of the film had already been distributed around the world. These prints were duplicated over the years."
Reception.
"Despite the movie's failure and Prana Film's bankruptcy in 1922, the film received critically positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes says that 98% of critical reviews were positive (53 out of a total 55 reviews) with an average rating of 3.9/5, stating, ""One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, gothic feel -- and a chilling performance from Max Schreck as the vampire -- set the template for the horror films that followed."""
"Roger Ebert called it ""more effective for being"" a ""silent"" film. He concluded,"
"Ulrich Gregor and Enno Patalas evaluate ""Nosferatu"" as a quantum leap in Murnau's cinematic work for being ""visible for the first time in any setting."" Thomas Elsaesser says the appeal of the film from the conflict between technical perfection and its mainly psychological acting subject: ""Murnau's poetry, the result was a detached, almost clinical application of technical mastery German photography and camera work in an emotionally charged, with deep-seated fears and feelings related topics"". The dream-like, the subconscious appealing presentation give the film a ""shadow only decipherable, hidden logic"", they keep the film ""still strong appeal character,"" says Thomas Koebner. Also Kreimeier Klaus picks up on this film ""Nosferatu"" effect and certify an ""authenticity of the dream - and the fictional (the means based on conventions) character of what we call reality."""
"Pixar started as a division of George Lucas' Lucasfilm in early 1979. In 1986, Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs bought it for $10 million. He worked as a chairman and CEO until 2011."
"The company has made a total of 28 movies and short films based on the characters, starting with ""Toy Story"" which was released on November 22, 1995, ""Toy Story 2"" was premiered in 1999 and ""Toy Story 3"" was made in 2010. The fourth film of the franchise is ""Toy Story 4"" which released in 2019.

Finding Nemo
"Finding Nemo is a 2003 American computer-animated comedy adventure film written and directed by Andrew Stanton, released by Walt Disney Pictures, and the fifth film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. It tells the story of the over-protective clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who searches for his captured son Nemo (Alexander Gould), along with a regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) in Sydney Harbour. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and let Nemo take care of himself. It is Pixar's first film to be released in cinemas in the northern hemisphere summer. The film was re-released for the first time in 3D on September 14, 2012, and it was released on Blu-ray on December 4, 2012. A sequel, ""Finding Dory"", was released on June 17, 2016."
"The film received extremely positive reviews and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It was the second highest-grossing film of the year, earning a total of $921 million worldwide. ""Finding Nemo"" is also the best-selling DVD of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2011, and was the highest money making G-rated film of all time before """" overtook it. It is also the 22nd highest money making film of all time, as well as the 3rd highest money making animated film. In 2008, the American Film Institute named it the tenth greatest animated film ever made during their Top 10."
Plot.
"Two clownfish, Marlin and his wife Coral are admiring their new home in the Great Barrier Reef and their clutch of eggs that are due to hatch in a few days. Suddenly, a barracuda attacks them, and Marlin tries to defend and save his eggs, leaving Marlin unconscious. Coral and all but one of their eggs are also eaten. Marlin names this egg Nemo, a name that Coral liked."
"The movie next shows Nemo's first day of school. Nemo has a tiny right fin, because his egg was injured by the barracuda attack. This makes it difficult for him to swim. After Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip by mistake, Nemo refuses and sneaks away from the reef towards a boat. So he gets captured by scuba divers. As the boat sails away, one of the divers accidentally knocks his diving mask into the water."
"While trying to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a good-hearted and optimistic Regal blue tang with short-term memory loss. While meeting three sharks on a fish-free diet, Bruce, a great white shark; Anchor, a hammerhead shark; and Chum, a mako shark, Marlin discovers the diver's mask that was dropped from the boat and notices an address written on it. However, when he angrily argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the scent of blood causes Bruce to lose control of himself and attempt to eat Marlin and Dory. The two escape from Bruce but the mask falls into a trench in the deep sea. During a hazardous struggle with an anglerfish in the trench, Dory realizes she is able to read the address written on the mask, which leads to Sydney, Australia, and manages to remember it. She repeats "" P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney"" to keep it in her memory. After receiving directions to Sydney from a large school of Silver moony, Marlin and Dory accidentally run into a bloom of jellyfish that nearly sting them to death; Marlin falls exhausted after the risky escape and wakes up to see a surf-cultured Green sea turtle named Crush, who takes Dory and him on the East Australian Current, referred to as the EAC by the animals. In the current, Marlin shares the story of his journey with a group of young sea turtles who spread the story around the ocean."
"Meanwhile, Nemo's captor - P. Sherman, a dentist - places him into a fish tank in his office on Sydney Harbour. There, Nemo meets a group of aquarium fish called the ""Tank Gang"", led by a crafty and ambitious moorish idol named Gill. The ""Tank Gang"" includes Peach, a starfish; Bloat, a puffer fish; Bubbles, a Yellow tang; Deb, a Blacktailed humbug Gurgle, a Royal gramma; and Jacques, a pacific cleaner shrimp;. The fish are frightened to learn that the dentist plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla. She is infamous for killing a goldfish given to her previously by constantly shaking the bag. In order to avoid this fate, Gill gives Nemo a role in an escape plan, which involves jamming the tank's filter and forcing the dentist to remove the fish from the tank to clean it manually. The fish could be placed in plastic bags, at which point they could only roll out the window and into the harbor. After a friendly pelican named Nigel visits with news of Marlin's adventure, Nemo succeeds in jamming the filter, but the plan backfires when the dentist installs a new high-tech filter."
"While leaving the East Australian Current, Marlin and Dory get lost in the blooms of plankton and krill and are caught by a blue whale. Inside the whale's immense mouth, Marlin tries to escape while Dory talks with it in whale-speak. So, the whale carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole. They are met by Nigel, who recognizes Marlin from the stories he has heard and rescues him and Dory from a flock of hungry seagulls by scooping them into his beak and taking them to the dentist's man's office. By this time, Darla has arrived and the dentist is prepared to give Nemo to her. Nemo tries to play dead in hopes of saving himself, and, at the same time, Nigel arrives. Marlin sees Nemo and mistakes this act for the actual death of his son. After a struggle, Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain through a sink."
"Sad, Marlin leaves Dory and begins to swim back home. Poor Dory then loses her memory and becomes a little worried, but meets Nemo, who has reached the ocean, has no memory of him. As you know, Dory's memory is restored again after she reads the word ""Sydney"" on a nearby drainpipe and, remembering her journey, she guides Nemo to Marlin. After the two joyfully reunite, Dory is caught in a fishing net with a school of grouper. Nemo bravely enters the net and directs the group to swim downward to break the net, reminiscent of a similar scenario that occurred in the fish tank earlier. The fish, including Dory, succeed in breaking the net and escape. After some days, Nemo leaves for school once more and Marlin who is no longer overprotective after all."
"Back at the dentist's office, the high-tech filter breaks down and The Tank Gang escape into the harbor. But, they realize that they are trapped in the bags of water that the dentist put them into when cleaning the tank."
Reception.
"""Finding Nemo"" currently holds a 99% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes with 100% by top critics, and an average of 89% on Metacritic. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, calling it ""one of those rare movies where I always wanted to sit in the front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision."" The late broadway stars Paul Winchell, John Fiedler, and Ken Sansom who were the voices of three of Pooh's friends, Tigger, Piglet, &amp; Rabbit in the ""Winnie the Pooh"" franchise, said ""Finding Nemo"" was their favorite animated film."
"The film's use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the animal as pets in the United States, even though the movie portrayed the use of fish as pets negatively and suggested that saltwater aquariums are notably tricky and expensive to maintain. The demand for clownfish was supplied by large-scale harvesting of tropical fish in regions like Vanuatu."
"At the same time, the film had a quote that ""all drains lead back to the ocean"" (Nemo escapes from the aquarium by going down a sink drain, ending up in the sea). Since water typically undergoes treatment before leading to the ocean, the JWC Environmental company quipped that a more realistic title for the movie might be ""Grinding Nemo"". However, in Sydney, much of the sewer system does really pass directly to outfall pipes deep offshore, without a high level of treatment (although pumping and some filtering occur). Additionally, according to the DVD, there was a cut sequence with Nemo going through a treatment plant's mechanisms before ending up in the ocean pipes. However, in the final product, logos for ""Sydney Water Treatment"" are featured prominently along the path to the ocean, implying that Nemo really did pass through some water treatment."
"The Australian Tourism Commission (ATC) launched several marketing campaigns in China and the USA in order to improve tourism in Australia, many of them using ""Finding Nemo"" clips. Queensland also used ""Finding Nemo"" to draw tourists to promote its state for vacationers."
"On the 3-D re-release, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote that its emotional power was deepened by ""the dimensionality of the oceanic deep"" where ""the spatial mysteries of watery currents and floating worlds are exactly where 3-D explorers were born to boldly go."""
"The 3-D re-release also prompted a retrospective on the film then nine years after its initial release. Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger described it as ""A genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic,"" with Roger Moore of the McClatchy-Tribune News Service calling the movie ""the gold standard against which all other modern animated films are measured."""
Home media.
"""Finding Nemo"" was released on DVD and VHS on November 4, 2003. The film was also released on DVD in a ""Gold Edition"", which came with a ""Finding Nemo"" stuffed toy character. The film had a home video release on both Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on December 4, 2012, with both a 3-disc and a 5-disc set."
Production.
"The inspiration for Nemo was made up of multiple experiences. The idea goes back to when director Andrew Stanton was a child, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992 shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There he saw the shark tube and various exhibits he felt that the underwater world had bene done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997 he took his son for a walk in the park, but found that he was over protecting him constantly and lost an opportunity to have any ""father-son experiences"" on that day. In an interview with ""National Geographic"" magazine, he stated that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone:""It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I wasn't taking my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish—it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you."" Also, clownfish are very colourful, but don't seem to tend to come out of an anemone very often, and for a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect kind of fish for the character."
"Pre-production of the film took place in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of ""A Bug's Life"". As such, it began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director Lee Unkrich called ""very unusual for an animated film."" The artists took scuba diving lessons so they could go and study the coral reef. The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and Bob Peterson while driving to record the actors. Ellen DeGeneres was cast after Stanton was watching ""Ellen"" with his wife and seeing Ellen ""change the subject five times before finishing one sentence"" as Stanton recalled. There was a pelican character known as Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) who was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other as Nigel being neat fastidious while Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. However the filmmakers had not found an appropriate scene for them that didn't slow the pace of the picture down, so Gerald's character was minimized."
"Stanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. Stanton originally did the voice for the film's story reel, and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance was popular in test screenings, Stanton decided to keep his performance in the film. Stanton recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in co-director Lee Unkrich's office."
"Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director Brad Bird. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was ""this generation's Thumper"" and immediately cast Nicholas."
"Final Cut Pro X shares some of both its code and interface design philosophy with Apple’s consumer video editing software, iMovie."
Laurussia
Laurussia was a minor supercontinent which formed in the Devonian period. It is often called the Old Red Sandstone Continent or Euramerica.
"Laurussia included much of what is now northern Europe, Greenland and North America."
Lifespan.
"Laurussia formed when 3 continents Baltica, North America, and Avalonia collided with each other during the Silurian. Baltica and Avalonia collided with each other first in the Shelveian Phase of the Caledonian orogeny. Then Avalonia and Baltica collided with North America in the Acadian Phase of the Caledonian orogeny. This drift of Avalonia closed the Iapetus Ocean and opened the Rheic Ocean behind it."
"Laurussia became part of Pangaea in the Permian. In the Jurassic, when Pangaea rifted into two supercontinents, Gondwana and Laurasia, Laurussia became part of Laurasia. The Atlantic ocean opened up in the middle of Laurussia, causing it to split into North America and Europe."
Independent State of Croatia
"The Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH) was a fascist/nazi puppet-state during World War II. It was established in April 1941, after the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was split up by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Geographically it encompassed most of modern-day Croatia as well as all of Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Slovenia and Serbia."
"The NDH was ruled by Ante Pavelić and his Ustaše — a racist, terrorist and saboteur organization — which were followers of the Pure Party of Rights founded by Ante Starčević at the end of 19th century. The NDH had a program, formulated by Mile Budak, to purge Croatia of Serbs, by “killing one third, expelling the other third and assimilating the remaining third”. The first part of this programme was begun during WWII by a planned genocide in Jasenovac concentration camp and other places all over NDH."
Establishment of NDH.
"Following the attack of the Axis powers on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941, and the quick defeat of the Yugoslav army (""Jugoslovenska vojska""), the whole country was occupied by Axis forces. Hitler and Mussolini installed the Croatian Ustaše, who had long sought Croatian independence, forming the Independent State of Croatia (NDH - Nezavisna Država Hrvatska)."
"The establishment of NDH was proclaimed on April 10, 1941 by Slavko Kvaternik, deputy leader of the Ustaše. Ante Pavelić came to power as leader (""Poglavnik"") of the Croatian puppet state. Pavelić took power with Mussolini and Hitler's blessing. On paper, it was a kingdom under King Tomislav II of the House of Savoy (the Duke of Split). But Tomislav II was only a figurehead with no real power."
"From a strategic perspective, the establishment of the new puppet state was an obvious attempt by Hitler to pacify the now conquered Yugoslav peoples for the purpose of reducing the necessary occupation force to a minimum (in light of his plans for the upcoming Operation Barbarossa). Vladko Maček the head of the Croatian Peasant Party, the strongest elected party in Croatia at the time, refused an offer from Germans to head the government but called on people to obey to and cooperate with the new government the same day Kvaternik made the proclamation. Ante Pavelić arrived on April 20th to become the ""poglavnik"" (Leader, correlated with ""führer""- better to translate as a ""Head-man""). The Roman Catholic Church's official stance was also openly positive in this period."
"On 19 May 1941 Pavelić and Mussolini, in accordance with the contract signed in Rapallo at the end of WWI between Serbs Kingdom of Jugoslavia and Italy, signed Roma operating contract by which NDH had to cede to Italy (in accordance with Rapallos Contract) almost all of Dalmatia and parts of Hrvatsko primorje and Gorski kotar. NDH was also forbidden to have a navy. These ""contracts"" illustrate more than anything else the dependence of the country upon the Axis powers."
State of terror and mass killing.
"Much of the population of the Independent State of Croatia was not Croat, mostly because of the inclusion of Bosnia. It had significant populations of Serbs (about 19% of the population of Croatia at the time, over 30% of the population of NDH), Bosnian Muslims (the largest population group of Bosnia at the time, and over 10% of the population of NDH), Germans, Hungarians and others. The Catholics (mainly Croats, Germans and Magyars) constituted just over 50% of the 6.3 million population. Mile Budak, politician and minister of the NDH - also a Croatian writer- immediately took the opportunity to proclaim the Muslims as ""Brothers"" and wanted to force them to convert to Christianity. Many Croatians agree with the idea that the majority of Bosnian Muslims are actually Croatians who were converted to Islam during the invasion of the Turks in the 15th Century."
Many Bosnian Muslims were accepted the NDH (in many cases were forced to accept it under the penalty of converting to Christianity or being executed) and immediately became involved.
"The most infamous of Islamic Ustase divisions was the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar. In respect to the soldiers of Muslim faith, a mosque was built in Zagreb - Croatia's capital city- known as ""Poglavnikova dzamija"" or Poglavnik's Mosque. Despite Pavelić's assurances of equality with the Croats, many Muslims quickly became dissatisfied with Croatian rule. A Muslim leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the administration. Fierce fighting broke out between the Ustaše, Chetniks and Yugoslav Partisans in NDH territory. Some Ustaše militia units became convinced that the Muslims were communist sympathizers, and burned their villages and murdered many civilians."
"The Ustase almost immediately enacted racial laws that reflected the acceptance of the ideology of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, with an emphasis placed on Croatian national issues."
"The first ""Legal order for the defense of the people and the state"" dated April 17, 1941 ordered the death penalty for ""infringement of the honour and vital interests of the Croatian people and the survival of the Independent State of Croatia"". It was soon followed by the ""Legal order of races"" and the ""Legal order of the protection of Aryan blood and the honour of the Croatian people"" dated April 30, 1941, as well as the ""Order of the creation and definition of the racial-political committee"" dated June 4, 1941. The enforcement of these legal acts was done not only through normal courts but also new out-of-order courts as well as mobile courts-martial with extended jurisdictions."
The normal jails could no longer sustain the rate of new inmates and the Ustaša government started preparing the grounds what would become the Jasenovac concentration camp by July 1941. The regime would eventually form concentration camps in eleven different locations.
"The Ustaše started conducting a deliberate campaign of mass murder, deportation and forced religious conversion in an attempt to remove the Serbs. The Jews and Gypsies were exposed to total annihilation i.e., to the campaign of mass murder and to, lesser part, deportation."
"The Jasenovac concentration camp would become the place of murder of up to a hundred thousand people (some estimate that this camp was the third largest camp of WWII). Overall Ustase death count is estimated at around 600,000 people, but all written records were destroyed to cover it up."
"The state of permanent terror, mass killing, raping women and looting properties of their victims in the Independet State of Croatia forced, primarily, the Serbs to rebel. According to the Glaise von Horstenau reports, Hitler was angry with Pavelić whose policy inflamed the rebellion in Croatia - by which Hitler lost ability to engage the Independent State of Croatia forces on the Eastern Front. Moreover, Hitler was forced to engage his forces in quelling the rebellion. For that reason, Hitler summoned Pavelić to his war headquoters in Vinica (Ukraine) on September 23, 1942. Consequently, Pavelić replaced his minister of the Armed Forces, Slavko Kvaternik, with the less zealous Jure Francetić. Before meeting Hitler, to appease the public, Pavelić published the ""Important Government's Announcement"" (»Važna obavijest Vlade«) in which he threatened those who were spreading the news ""about non-existent threats of disarmament of the Ustashe units by representatives of one foreign power, about the Croatian Army replacement by a foreign army, about the possibility that a foreign power would seize the power in Croatia ..."" (Hrvatski narod, September 3rd, 1942.)"
"Hans Helm, the appointed head of Gestapo for the Independent State of Croatia, in his confidential report - (under the title ""Basis of the partisan danger"" - sent to General Kasche) of January 14, 1943, wrote: ""Most of the partisan ranks are coming from the Serbs - due to the fact that they are the most villainous way persecuted ... the new regime in Croatia started the programs of annihilation and destruction of the Serbs, which (the programs) are publicly supported by the highest ranks of the Croatian government, and (the programs) adopted as the main government goal. The fact that a different talk was coming from the official Ustashe side - under the rebellion pressure and due to the course of events - even a reconciliation was mentioned - leaves no possibility to compensate the harm caused by, for example, Dr. Mile Budak, the actual (Croatian) minister in Berlin ..."" Appointed general Horstenau wrote in his report: »Ustashe movement is, due to the mistakes and atrocities they have made, and the corruption, so compromised that the government executive branch (the homeguard and the police) shall be separated from the government - even for the price of breaking any possible connection with the government ..."""
End of the war.
"In August 1944, there was an attempt by Foreign Minister in NDH government Mladen Lorković and Minister of War Ante Vokić to execute a coup d'état against Ante Pavelić. The coup failed and its conspirators were executed."
"The NDH army withdrew towards Zagreb with German and Cossak troops by early 1945, and continued fighting for a week after the German surrender on May 9th, 1945. They were soon overpowered and the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) effectively ceased to exist in May 1945, near the end of the war. The advance of Tito's partisan forces, joined by the Soviet Red Army, caused mass retreat of the Ustaše towards Austria."
"In May 1945, a large column composed of Ustaša followers and NDH Army troops and civilians retreated from the partisan forces, heading northwest towards Italy and Austria. Ante Pavelić detached from the group and fled to Austria, Italy and finally Argentina. The rest of the group, consisting of over 150,000 soldiers (including Cossak troops) and civilians negotiated passage with the British forces on the Austrian side of the Austrian-Slovenian border. The British Army then turned over a number of them to the partisan forces."
"So it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
That's another thing.
You have to go to different places to do that.
Right.
"So it's, so that's nice."
"It would be, it would be really nice if they, uh, came to the house to pick it up"
"and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that,"
"but, uh, uh, it didn't go through."
Uh-huh.
"But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh,"
"I don't know,"
it just doesn't make sense to me.
Right.
"I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, you know."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, so I guess that's one option."
Yeah.
"That's good,"
that's good.
I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.
"Like, uh"
Uh-huh.
"have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what  kind of plastic it is?"
Huh.
No.
"Yeah,"
"I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle,"
you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
Especially if you need a tune-up.
Uh-huh.
"They kept saying that the that's what Chryslers did, is they wore out starters."
"Yeah,"
"well, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key"
and it starts up
Yeah.
"and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time."
Uh-huh.
"See, they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years."
Right.
They all take the exact same starter.
They'll interchange completely.
I mean completely.
One starter will fit all of them.
"So they've got a whole lot of torque,"
"but to do that, they did it,"
"use an underdrive system,"
"but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it's got, to spin for very long,"
Uh-huh.
it's kind of tough on the bushings.
Yeah.
Usually what goes is the bushings.
Right.
"You take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly good starter."
"But, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with with good enough bushings."
Uh-huh.
"So it's, you know,"
"after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up."
Yeah.
"Anyway, what are you driving now?"
"Uh, my Chrysler van"
"I mean they, they would go ahead and kill themselves for three or four minutes to see what happens."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"they said, she said that this was almost believable"
that could really happen.
"You know, you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things,"
and you never know.
"Almost,"
"yeah,"
"I, I, it's a little far fetched to, find a bunch of medical students doing it,"
"but but, it was, um, it was, it was odd enough, you know,"
Yeah.
and they didn't just sort of make it silly.
"It was, you know, it was done fairly well, I think."
"So. Actually, I actually enjoyed that as well."
Yeah.
I like it when they will do something and not get too silly.
"I've been disappointed in some movies that, they don't know how to end it, it seems like,"
so then they get crazy
"and, and it doesn't end like the story has been going."
The story sort of keeps going and going.
Well I guess that covers our topic.
"Yeah,"
great.
"Well, it was, nice talking to you."
Nice talking to you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
That sounded like one.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system, as far as, uh, people dropping out of school, uh, grades on test scores being low, uh, more and more people taking G E D trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school."
Uh-huh.
"In a big city like that most houses, I would think, would be sort of like what we live in. Just a you know, basic tract house."
"Well, in the, uh, newer neighborhoods and development communities, the houses are so close together,"
Yeah.
if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow.
That's exactly right.
That's the way we are.
"We have, uh, one thing we have that we really enjoy here, is we have a hot tub in the back."
"So we have, we have quite a few parties,"
"and uh, seems like everyone that lives around us, ends up, you know, hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone."
"So, uh, that's true"
"that is one thing that I don't enjoy about it, is the houses are too close together."
"But, uh, you know, it's fine for now,"
"hopefully, eventually, we'll move in a larger home."
The only thing that I don't like also is the rooms are so small.
"You know, it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that,"
so.
Are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home?
"Because it seems like then, that they built the homes much larger"
is that true?
Yeah.
And they've got better closet space.
Yeah.
new houses that I've seen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's really it.
That's a plus.
At least we do have like three walk-in closets here.
"So that's, that's maybe not so typical,"
"but, uh,"
It helps a bunch.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"it, it really is."
"Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the, off the price, if you want to think of it that way."
Uh-huh.
"So when we get like, uh, uh, a twelve pack, then that's like twelve cents back."
"Yeah,"
so you guys can actually get ahead
Yeah
"But, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you you're not like reimbursed for or paid for."
"Like we can recycle, uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass. Uh, and milk jugs and, uh, newspapers, you know,"
Yeah.
everyone does newspapers.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
everybody does newspapers.
"But, that, that kind of stuff."
Yeah.
"But they, they said they can't be smashed or else, uh,"
it doesn't fit in their little containers
"and they're not reimbursed by the, the people who are over them or something."
"Well, shoot, maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed, uh, Pepsi cans and whatever up there"
Yeah
"Exactly,"
"yeah,"
"send it to this address,"
no
"But, uh, let's see,"
"they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,"
"I, I, I tell you what, what really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, you know what I mean, then people tend to do it. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"that's,"
"In other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good"
"and then it had the two swivels in the middle, and then the two swivel chairs on the front"
All right.
"and, I mean it was fantastic,"
Uh-huh.
"and it got good gas mileage,"
but I don't know
"I don't really, I don't,"
"I want something I can drive too, you know,"
"Well well, the mini, that,"
and I was scared to drive that big van.
"you'd be surprised if, if you drive a, one of the, the mini vans, uh,"
"more or less alike the, the, uh, Chevrolet"
"and, uh, well of course, Oldsmobile has got one,"
"and Chryslers got one,"
but they drive remarkably like cars.
"Well, do you, does yours have that this one had it where you know, you would see something coming in the rear view mirror, I mean not the rear, those little side mirror things"
Yeah.
and it would look like it was further back than it was.
Yeah
"but, the little, thing etched in it,"
"say objects are, are closer than they appear or something"
"Yeah,"
does yours do that too?
Yeah.
"Oh. I was wondering if all vans did that,"
"Well you, you can, you can, uh, install those mirrors,"
"we've got the big side mirrors, which are really nice."
"I don't know if you've, well, if you've driven a pick up truck, you know,"
"these are, these, uh, mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high,"
Uh-huh.
"and they're really nice, uh,"
"got them on both sides,"
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"and, um, when, when you do that, they automatically, once you start with their service, they close your accounts out."
"Oh, I see."
"So, I'm still paying on all these accounts,"
but my accounts are closed.
Yeah.
"So, and I would prefer to keep it that way."
"Once we, once we're paid off um, I would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa"
Uh-huh.
and that's it.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Actually I pay off my cards every month.
Only once in my life have I not paid.
"I think that's a really good way to handle it, because that way, if you, if you paid off every month, you never have to worry about, well, how much do I have to pay these guys, you know, this month, you know."
"This, you buy what you can afford."
I mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash it's a lot easier to keep it in check.
Right.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Well, and also in a sense, they're giving you a loan for a month"
"so that you know, if I were smarter, I would have that same amount in savings and get the interest, which I don't do,"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"but, but yeah,"
"the, the thought of adding, you know, X percent to, to the price of what I buy, I just, I can't accept."
"Yeah,"
"and I, and I think at this, at this point in time with the economy the way it is, I think that, um, it's going to get even worse."
"Um, I'm, I'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off, now, um, you know,"
"we, only we started this last year"
"Uh-huh,"
"Well, I haven't counted."
"I, I would have guessed eight even"
but you might be right.
I don't have any idea.
"Well, I remember, uh, uh,"
"thinking, I think it was the last time I did hear that we get about the average."
"Maybe even a little more, a day or so more than the average."
Yeah.
"But, uh, government is ridiculous."
Wow.
Just think of the money they could save.
"I mean, they're, they're paying out this money anyway."
Yeah.
Why not get the work out of the people.
Yeah.
"And, well, anyway that would, of course, eventually come back to taxes."
"But, uh, as far as income tax is concerned, I can't complain too much about it."
"Uh, I'm single,"
"I have no, uh, dependents or anything,"
my children are all grown
and they're out worrying about their own income taxes.
Yeah.
"Well, I, I have another thing that I thought about too, for instance, when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is"
"and, you know, we're not typically talking about big dollars"
"but here you feel like you've, you've done something good"
"you've, you've earned your interest"
and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it.
"So, the real amount of your savings on that is, is, not much."
"Uh, very true."
"That's,"
"You know, it's kind of a vicious circle there."
"And then they tell you to, uh, well, invest it in, uh, is it I R A or something"
And they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down.
"And that's the way to do it, too."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I think it's, you know what's I think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you"
and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen.
Yeah.
"And, And it makes an awful lot of difference, doesn't it?"
"Preparing it,"
right.
"Oh, it sure does."
"Well,"
"Well, when I was brought up, you know, we didn't,"
"Uh, go ahead,"
tell me what you think.
Do we get our money's worth?
"Hey, listen, if I had my way, I wouldn't pay my taxes."
"Not with the, not with some of the things that I hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things."
"Yeah,"
did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night?
"No,"
I did not.
"I,"
"Well, they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need."
"And, uh, it's staggering."
"Well, how does this grab you? How did this grab you?"
"Uh, this,"
"I, I mean, I'm, I'm a lady,"
"but this, I heard this on a Christian program"
"and it was, uh, about the N E A"
"and, that's the National Endowment for Arts,"
"and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money."
That would be a really good thing to do.
"That would be a, a really good thing to do."
So it's
"I have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial,"
Huh.
"and what happened was her husband was, uh, involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight"
and he ran into the motorcycle.
Huh.
"But the reason, the actual reason that the motorcycle person, her husband, was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle."
He was just taking it home from the place.
"It was brand new,"
and his brakes did not work.
For goodness sakes.
"And this expensive, big company that owned these motorcycles, um, railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady"
and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened
Uh-huh.
and they were following him home in the car. Saw the whole thing happen.
"Oh, they saw the husband,  get,"
That's right.
They were following him home from the motorcycle shop.
Yeah.
"And they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials, um, this and that and the other."
"Every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of her,  of a settlement,"
Uh-huh.
They would find something wrong with it.
"Until finally they won and,  said that it was the drunk driver's fault"
Did they really?
Uh-huh.
"but I just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money, the big lawyers, and she didn't,"
That is a shame.
"You'd think there would be enough, uh, people who saw the accident other than his wife,  to, to also, uh, make statements,"
Right.
"Oh, I see."
"Uh, we live right, might say we live right in, uh, in the middle of a residential area."
Um.
"And, uh, so that is not as good, uh, you know,"
"this dog, being a small dog it's, uh, more you, more acceptable"
Yeah
"but again,"
it's not that big of a problem.
"With Domino, she was full grown,"
I would estimate seventy pounds.
Yeah.
"And, you know, we lived in Oviedo, which is a small town,"
it's a suburb of Orlando
Uh-huh.
"but there's not, there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around,"
"and she was a dog that loved to run,"
"so that was the biggest problem I saw,"
"and I think that's one of the, uh, the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is, you know, do you have the room for this dog to run around,"
"or, you know, I guess you can't really say for cats."
"Me and cats don't get along too well, uh"
"but, you know, that whole space issue, I think, is real important."
"Yeah,"
"it's, uh, that's one of the biggest concerns."
"It's like, uh,"
"there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal,"
"but the same time, one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"that, that,"
"and the larger they are, the more room they need to exercise."
"Sure,"
"and that's all part of of keeping your part of the relationship. You know, showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those, uh, those issues."
"Yeah,"
"so it kind of makes it easy, you know, to do a little something for it."
"Sure,"
"because we, uh, we've talked to a lot of people from Texas, it seems,"
"and we thought, well, maybe they work from, for Dallas,"
All right.
I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight.
"Which is movies,"
correct?
That is correct.
Okay.
Are you a movie buff?
"Um, yeah."
I don't like going to see them in the theaters
"but outside of that, rent a lot,"
watch them on T V mostly.
"I sometimes wonder, are, are they really doing anything,"
"or,"
"Right,"
"well, I think we're going to see a streamlining in the government."
"I just, you know,"
"I, I don't know what kind of, uh, I don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to start saying, Hey, this is too much. We're not going to pay any more. You know, we're not going to pay for this,"
"and you're out, you know."
"I think we're starting to see it a little bit now,"
"but I think, uh, I don't know what, what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it."
"Because I think, I think we're just getting taxed way too much."
Yeah.
"I mean, right now we're getting taxed probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more."
"And that's, that's, you know, that's me not making a whole lot of money."
Yeah.
"Well, they got so many hidden taxes, that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying, because, go to a grocery store, something like that, and you're paying a little tax here"
and you
Do they like to listen to other people recollect though?
My grandmother doesn't
"She, she wants to to tell you about her story over again"
so
Right.
"which is fine, you know,"
"so,"
"Well, that is good because we,"
"Um, so what do you think?"
"Um,"
"I lived, I lived in Sweden for two years."
Uh-huh.
And in Sweden they have socialized medicine.
And so I saw some of the good
and also I saw some of the bad that results from such a program.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, some of the, some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care."
Right.
"So it's a very, it's a very, uh, comfortable,"
"I mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that, you know, there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life."
Right.
"Um, the bad was more apparent I think at least for me"
"because I think it affected people's lives on, in a way that you could see."
"One, one thing that I noticed is it's very, very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden."
"Oh, really?"
Because it's treated as a disease.
"Now I don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine,"
"but, uh, if you're, if you're alcoholic, then you're treated as if you're on disability, long-term disability"
and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that.
Huh.
"Also, um, another thing that, that I noticed that was very strange,"
"I was, uh, I would go down all these, uh, uh,"
"Well, it has been."
"Although the new president and C E O of the company is from a much more formal eastern, uh, background."
Oh.
"And so the result is that, uh,"
so anyway I wore this suit
"and I went over to, uh, uh, to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it"
Uh-huh.
"and it, and I, I was almost converted because, uh, the effect of that suit on the way people reacted and responded to me as opposed to the,"
"uh, just to kind of,"
"how shall I say it,"
they know you're there
but they don't
"uh, you don't,"
there's no notice at all.
"But when I wore a suit that day, uh, it was obvious that people didn't know whether I was a worker bee or a manager."
Wow.
"So people, uh, how shall I say it, made a, made much more effort to notice you, acknowledge your presence, say hello and, uh, things like that,"
so.
That's interesting.
"It's like a mini, little study there"
Yeah.
That's really interesting.
"And so this dress for success thing, I think is, uh,"
"by and large I've, I'm kind of, uh, convinced that, uh, by that, just that one, uh, uh, experience and then having talked to several other people that, that, uh, unless you're in a, an environment where they're going to make fun of, of, of better clothes, that better clothes always pay off."
Right.
Huh.
That's interesting.
"Doesn't mean they have to be, uh,"
"how shall I say it,"
"they don't have to be the, the most, uh, the absolute best"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, a little dressing a little bit above the standard, I think, would, uh, pay off"
"as you said for someone who, you know, a more, you know, who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them."
"Or, it's also a good environment,"
"it may be good for someone who already has self discipline, who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own, that,"
"Yeah,"
and want to develop that.
"And, that,"
"yeah,"
the
it's the same.
Uh-huh.
It can benefit different people different ways.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But, uh, you know, I, I agree with that, because I see people that I know again, from high school, that I still keep in touch with, that didn't go to college Same patterns of behavior, same, uh, same socializing, same exact crowd that they hang with"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"The same patterns of behavior, you mean?"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"and it's like, it's like frozen time, you know."
"Exactly,"
"it's I find it kind of sad,"
I really do.
It is.
"It really is that they haven't found anything, anything better that, uh,"
"or their, their experiences haven't been broadened at all, to, to you know, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it's a, it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a, in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions"
and you hear all these different sides of the story that you never thought of
Yeah.
Right.
"and, uh, that's another big thing I think people get out of college is the appreciation for different point, differing points of view, you know, or different opinions."
Right.
"Well, no,"
"I haven't seen any,"
"so I, I thought that it all, had all been delayed several times."
So I have no idea what they look like
"and, I'm kind of anxious to see them."
"Yeah, That's going to be interesting because it's, uh, we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is uh,"
"I look at our big green containers,"
"and I say, well, they work fine"
and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors
"but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh,"
"Oh, right."
it will be interesting to see how well that works
"and I am, I'm glad the community is doing it."
"Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people."
"Uh, I don't know if, where you grew up in your, what you saw back, uh, years ago,"
"but for me the thing that strikes me is I, uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass"
Right.
Right.
"and you got a nickel or dime, which in that time was a lot of money, when you returned them."
Pop bottles all had a deposit on them.
Oh.
"Oh, of course."
"That, they did."
"You know actually, we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles"
Oh.
and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house.
Uh-huh.
You could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed
Yeah.
and so you just put the empty ones back out there
"and he took them away and put, you know, put another gallon of glass, glass bottle in there."
and we went ahead
"but, uh, not everybody can make that choice"
"and even, even though my wife wasn't working, we did have, uh, one or another of the boys in, uh, child care for just for part of the day. Uh, or a couple of days a week just so that, uh, other things could get done around the house and so on,"
"so, So, we did look around."
Huh.
I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not
"and, uh  so I would always trust her judgment on that."
Huh .
Huh. Well I'm just thanking heaven.
My husband just got a new job.
"His last company, he was only working four days a week."
Uh-huh.
"So it's,"
and he just got a new job.
"He's getting lots of overtime,"
he got a pay raise
and so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not.
There's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid
"so, yeah, do it as long you can"
I suppose.
"But I think, you know, you have to look through a place"
"and you have to get a feel for, uh, how they treat the kids and, uh, uh, what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I think you have, the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open. That you're welcome anytime without notice, in the middle of the day and so forth"
"and if they're at all queasy about that then  I'd look elsewhere, yeah."
You have to start wondering if they don't want you.
Yes.
Right
Huh.
"You have other friends that have kids, uh, being taken care of in, uh, child care?"
"Uh, I have one"
"Yes,"
I saw HOME ALONE with some friends just a couple days ago.
"I wanted to see it, uh, because there was, uh, much recommended, for months and months and months"
"and it was a, a genre that I wasn't in the least bit interested in,"
"and I usually, when I hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good even if it's in a genre I don't like,"
Uh-huh.
"I figure, well, I should go see it, because if this is, you know, the best of the genre and I should know about it, or something like that"
"Yeah,"
"right, uh-huh."
"and I usually come away thinking, no I really don't like this show"
"Yeah,"
"I, I, I, I feel that way when movies are like blown up, out of proportion, you know"
Yeah.
"usually people tell you how good they are,"
"and you always, you know, end up with expectations too high or whatever,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Right.
"Well, the, the problem I had with the movie was the problem I've had with a lot of, uh, I guess, Hollywood movies which is they are, it's a formula movie,"
Uh-huh.
and they're making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula
Uh-huh.
"but they seem to fall short of, of being really creative with a lot of things,"
"I mean here's the situation of this kid at home, you know,"
"Yeah,"
uh-huh.
it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in
Right.
"and, you know, he did some clever things,"
"but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was, it seems to me they could have done a lot more, I mean, you know, basically stepping on things and yelling in pain"
Yeah
and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used.
"because there could be accidental kind of things, you know,"
Right.
"but they never told us why these two people, hated themselves or if one had done something to, you know, really aggravate the other"
"there was never any motive, given"
Uh-huh.
"and, and I had a tough time with that"
"and, and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did, because we were just observing, you know, there in the courtroom, at the end of it all, I still didn't know"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
right.
I still have a lot of reasonable doubts
and I've seen everything presented
"and, you know, they just haven't done a real complete case here to my thinking."
Uh-huh.
"I don't know that I want to,  sit on a jury like that"
"I think so,"
"and I,"
"and you'd still, you know,"
I want ask some questions here
"Yeah,"
that's something I thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen.
Uh-huh.
"And it seems to me that you'd get a lot more, uh, information if your questions were heard, if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things, or if, or the lawyers things or even the judge."
Uh-huh.
Right.
But particularly the witnesses.
Right.
"Yeah,"
"allow them to, uh, go back and, and deliberate and, uh, you know, after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day, bring those people back,"
"Or if they would allow them to, uh, give broader answers, they,"
"it's really kind of, uh, choreographed."
It's like a script has been written when people testify.
"Well, there are a lot of things that people, I think general,"
And then it just frosts me terribly.
"Well, I think it's interesting to look at, uh, where the money goes,"
and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go
"and and I don't think generally, I think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government"
Absolutely.
and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with.
"I believe that's true,"
yes.
"And that, what I think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it."
"I mean, we are going to have to change the people who represent us."
That's correct.
"I mean, and I think it's going to be real interesting to see and, and then force upon them, uh,"
Heavy involvement from the public.
"Yeah,"
right that's I think that's the only thing that's going to change it.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
heavy involvement from the public.
"Our anger is going to have to, to give rise to, to more activity on our part."
Yeah.
"Uh, I've, I've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active"
"and in our society, uh, there's very little full employment."
"Most people in this country are getting worse off, not better off."
Absolutely.
"Eighty percent of the public, according to Bill Moyers', uh,"
"recent, uh,"
"piece for, uh,"
"Public Broadcasting, which, by the way is a very good use of government money. I think P B S is wonderful."
"But this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are, are seeing their real incomes,"
"and thus, standards of living, decline."
And twenty percent are seeing theirs improve.
Right.
Now like who's got that extra two and a quarter
I know I don't.
Yeah.
"Well, that's exactly the way he feels is that, he really hates to spend the time,"
it takes a lot of time
"if he, if he thinks it's going to be two hours, it's four if, you know, whatever, it always takes him twice as long."
"But then when he's finished he's, he always says, well, now you owe me three hundred dollars"
"And then he thinks that he has the money that, that he can spend on something"
and he hasn't given it to someone else.
Yeah.
"So, he gets some satisfaction out of that although, generally I think he, he does not look forward to or anticipate,"
there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars.
There's a lot of people
and he just isn't one of them.
Yeah.
"I, uh, I don't mind it,"
"um, there was a time when I had my Corvette,"
"I mean, of course, I loved it, um,"
"but if, you know,"
I've got other interests now
"and there's a lot, other more important things I think I should be doing with my time."
"And I have the same problem,"
"I mean, you can tell him from me"
"but it doesn't matter,"
"I mean, I've, I've had greasy fingernails for years"
"And it still takes me twice as long as I think it's going to take to do the job,"
Yeah.
"so, but, I think the difference is that, uh, when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing,"
Uh-huh.
"and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right,"
"and, you know, I've, I've in the past I've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I'd find something drastically wrong with it, you know, like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident. You know, those kind of things,"
"Although, um"
"I'm only twenty-five,"
so I've never actually been through a period of war
Uh-huh.
and I don't know anyone in the military
"and I don't have a lot of background knowledge in, uh, military strategy and, and weaponry, and, and all that kind of stuff."
And I thought the generals were very interesting.
"Now when they started to speculate, I, I saw that for what is was, and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on."
Uh-huh.
"But I thought they were interesting,"
"and, and they shed some light on what was going on for me."
I will admit it's interesting.
I'm twenty-six.
So I don't have any more experience in that than you.
"Um, it, it, it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind, you know,"
"there were some that were screaming for air power,"
there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it.
Uh-huh.
"And they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world, which I suppose just about everyone does,"
"but these guys had a, a, uh, national soap box to stand on and, and express this view."
"You know, one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C,"
and it was for children
Uh-huh.
"and it was hosted by Peter Jennings,"
"and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio,"
and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions.
"And they, they had all their correspondents in the different areas, in Saudi Arabia, and Israel, and, and all."
"They had them all, uh, on,"
I don't know what you'd call it other than on line.
They had them all on hold
Uh-huh.
"and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer, they would cut to that person,"
"airport's been shut down, uh, till about noon every day"
"and then they seed the clouds, or seed the fog to try to to get the airplanes in and out."
Uh-huh.
Huh.
"Well, we, uh, had a bad siege last, uh, Christmas a year ago."
"We went up to visit my wife's, uh, sister who lives in, uh, Calgary, Alberta, Can,"
"Well, the topic's about government."
"Uh, I'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic. Uh,"
"I thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and uh, how many people are self serving."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I mean, you I, I think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt And that people aren't self serving."
Uh-huh
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I mean that's what I would like to think.
"Yeah,"
"I, I, I think that the last, uh, part of that question was particularly interesting, uh, about, uh, uh, uh, can all unethical behavior, or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal uh, because it seems to me that when uh, government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes uh, parallel to the legal codes that, uh, we're focusing on the wrong thing."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Maybe, maybe that's what is happening."
"Maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past, you know, ten to twenty years that, uh, it becomes more evident."
"Perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or, you know, et cetera like that"
Uh-huh.
and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons.
Uh-huh.
"And I couldn't help thinking when that last it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about how many things can we, uh, actually put a legal code on that, uh, how much, uh, should it be our, uh, prerogative to see into the private lives of these people. You know."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
"You should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your life insurance and your medical and your, uh, uh, car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm."
He's going to sue the pants off of you.
These kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year.
"So you know, these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things."
Uh-huh.
Some of them are there to pacify situations.
And some of them are there to prevent things from happening.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying, two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a child which is about a year old,"
"and then uh, we've just been kind of working on,"
Uh-huh.
"I've been developing it,"
but it's kind of hard.
"Diaper prices are going up, you know, and formula and stuff, you know."
Uh-huh.
That's funny.
"Yeah,"
"we have a,"
"we're twenty eight, and he's been working at T I for five years,"
"and that was pretty much his first real, really major job of any, you know, professional, because he had worked, you know, part time during school and what not,"
"and, uh, he was a little late graduating,"
"so we're, you know, uh,"
"and we have a nine and a half year old son,"
"and it's because, you know, we were eighteen when we had him,"
"so, we're, we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of, we, you know, we have a lot for, to be our age and, you know, just everything, and having the responsibilities we've had on us for, at such a young age."
"You know, we have a, like a nice house."
"People, you know, are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house."
"But, we don't, you know, live in a brand new house, either, maybe a ninety, hundred thousand dollar house"
Uh-huh.
but we're in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty-five thousand.
The IceCube Neutrino Observatory (or simply IceCube) is a neutrino observatory constructed at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica.The project is a recognized CERN experiment (RE10).
"Its thousands of sensors are located under the Antarctic ice, distributed over a cubic kilometre."
"Similar to its predecessor, the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), IceCube consists of spherical optical sensors called Digital Optical Modules (DOMs), each with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a single-board data acquisition computer which sends digital data to the counting house on the surface above the array. IceCube was completed on 18 December 2010."
"DOMs are deployed on strings of 60 modules each at depths between 1,450 and 2,450 meters into holes melted in the ice using a hot water drill. IceCube is designed to look for point sources of neutrinos in the TeV range to explore the highest-energy astrophysical processes."
In November 2013 it was announced that IceCube had detected 28 neutrinos that likely originated outside the Solar System.
"IceCube is part of a series of projects developed and supervised by the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Collaboration and funding are provided by numerous other universities and research institutions worldwide. Construction of IceCube was only possible during the Antarctic austral summer from November to February, when permanent sunlight allows for 24-hour drilling. Construction began in 2005, when the first IceCube string was deployed and sufficient data was collected to verify that the optical sensors functioned correctly. In the 2005–2006 season, an additional eight strings were deployed, making IceCube the largest neutrino telescope in the world."
Construction was completed on 17 December 2010. The total cost of the project was $279 million.
"Barco is not mentioned in the ""Inquirições"" (Inquiries) of 1288, although it is known to have existed at that time."
"The parish of Barco was established by the 15th century, when it was split off from the priory of St. Silvestre da Covilhã and given its own priest. Even before this, there was a small chapel dedicated to Saint Simon the Zealot."
"Until the 19th century the parish was called St. Simon, after which it assumed the common name of Barco."
"Saint Simon was said to have been martyred by being sawed in half, and the emblem of the parish is a saw."
Between 1860 and 1950 the parish saw rapid population growth.
"The census of 1878 gave Barco a population of 923, of whom 429 were male and 494 female, in 234 dwellings."
"By 1950 there were 1,800 people."
Since then the population has declined steadily.
In 2011 Barco had a population of just 473.
Until recently wolfram and tin were mined in the parish.
"The Mina da Argemela, a tin mine that was abandoned around 1960, is located near Barco."
"Economic activities include trade, industry, agriculture and construction."
"Most people work in agriculture, growing maize, beans, olives and rye."
"Local gastronomical specialties include ""Borelhões"", sausages, river fish and wild boar."
"Religion plays an important role in local culture, as shown by the many small shrines one sees in the countryside."
"Festivals include St. Simon (28 October), San Sebastian (4th Sunday of August), St John (June 23) and Our Lady of Fatima (May 30)."
"Barco has always been part of Covilhã. There was some uncertainty about the extent of its territory, now ."
The boundary between Barco and the neighboring parish of Peso was only defined on 4 October 1894.
From 1872 to 1984 the parish of Coutada was attached to Barco. It was then made a separate parish.
In 2013 Barco was again merged with the parish of Coutada to form the parish of União das Freguesias de Barco e Coutada.

"The Tomb of the Triclinium () or the Funereal Bed ("""") is an Etruscan tomb in the Necropolis of Monterozzi near Tarquinia, Italy. It was discovered in 1830. Stefan Steingraber, Associate Professor at the Italian Research University 'Roma Tre', dates the tomb to approximately 470 BC and calls it one of the most famous of all Etruscan tombs. He considers the artistic quality of the tomb's frescoes to be superior to those of most other Etruscan tombs. The tomb is named after the triclinium, the formal dining room which appears in the frescoes of the tomb."
Since its discovery the tomb's frescoes have deteriorated and lost some of their color and detail. In 1949 they were moved to the Tarquinia National Museum to conserve them. Thanks to the watercolor copies made by Carlo Ruspi shortly after the discovery of the tomb it is still possible to see the frescoes in their former state.
"The tomb consists of a single room. The fresco on the back wall shows a banquet scene, borrowed from depictions of drinking scenes on Attic red-figure pottery from the early fifth century. The banqueteers recline on three couches called ""klinai"". On the floor under the ""klinai"" a cat prowls towards a rooster and a partridge. On the left wall three female dancers, one male dancer and a male musician with a barbiton appear. They are placed between small trees filled with birds. On the right wall a similar scene is shown. On the entry wall two youths jump down from their horses. They may be ""apobates"" or a reference to the Dioscuri as intermediaries between the earthly life and the afterlife."
The similarities between the frescoes in the Tomb of the Triclinium and Tomb 5513 (also in the Necropolis of Monterozzi) led Steingraber to conclude that they were the products of the same workshop. The strong influence of red-figure Attic vase painting has convinced some experts that the artist who decorated the tomb was a Greek metic.

Martha Mears was an eighteenth-century midwife and author.
"Mears was a midwife, mother, and author in London, England. Her work, ""Pupil of Nature"", was published in 1797. The full title is ""Pupil of Nature: Candid advice to the fair sex, on the subjects of pregnancy, childbirth, the diseases incident to both, the fatal effects of ignorance and quackery, and the most approved means of promoting health, strength and beauty of their offspring."" It consists of 10 essays about topics from the state of the womb before and after conception, to the effect of music on nerves. She depicted the pregnant woman as a cluster of symptoms to be managed, particularly with regard to her psychological state. Mears subscribed to the common notion that ""irritability"" of the pregnant woman’s uterus induced a heightened ""sensibility"". The organization and broad scope of the text mirrored this representation of the body as a bundle of potential pathologies. A contemporary review of her work describes its purpose being to teach women the important advantages of pursuing nature's plans in everything that relates to the pregnant state. Mears' studied the writings of Harvey, Leake, Smellie and Denman."

"Dinaw Mengestu (born 30 June 1978) is an Ethiopian-American novelist and writer. In addition to three novels, he has written for ""Rolling Stone"" on the war in Darfur, and for ""Jane Magazine"" on the conflict in northern Uganda. His writing has also appeared in ""Harper's"", ""The Wall Street Journal"", and numerous other publications. He is the Program Director of Written Arts at Bard College. In 2007 the National Book Foundation named him a ""5 under 35"" honoree. Since his first book was published in 2007, he has received numerous literary awards, and was selected as a MacArthur Fellow in 2012."
"Dinaw Mengestu was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 1978, during a period of political repression that became known as the Red Terror, his father, who was an executive with Ethiopian Airlines, applied for political asylum while on a business trip in Italy; Mengestu's mother was pregnant with him at the time. Two years later, when Mengestu was a toddler, he, his mother and his sister were reunited with his father in the United States. The family settled in Peoria, Illinois, where Mengestu's father at first worked as a factory laborer, before rising to a management position. Later the family moved to the Chicago area, where Mengestu graduated from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois."
"Mengestu received his B.A. in English from Georgetown University, and his MFA in writing from Columbia University in 2005."
"Mengestu's début novel, ""The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears"", was published in the United States in March 2007 by Penguin Riverhead. It was published in the United Kingdom as ""Children of the Revolution"", issued in May 2007 by Jonathan Cape. It tells the story of Sepha Stephanos, who fled the warfare of the Ethiopian Revolution 17 years before and immigrated to the United States. He owns and runs a failing grocery store in Logan Circle, then a poor African-American section of Washington, D.C. that is becoming gentrified. He and two fellow African immigrants, all of them single, deal with feelings of isolation and nostalgia for home. Stephanos becomes involved with a white woman and her daughter, who move into a renovated house in the neighborhood."
"Mengestu's second novel, ""How to Read the Air"", was published in October 2010. Part of the novel was excerpted in the July 12, 2010, issue of ""The New Yorker"", after Mengestu was selected as one of their ""20 under 40"" writers of 2010.

= = = Sphinx (search engine) = = =
Sphinx is a fulltext F/OSS search engine that provides text search functionality to client applications.
"Sphinx can be used either as a stand-alone server or as a storage engine (""SphinxSE"") for the MySQL family of databases."
"When run as a standalone server Sphinx operates similar to a DBMS and can communicate with MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL through their native protocols or with any ODBC-compliant DBMS via ODBC."
"MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, is distributed with SphinxSE."
"If Sphinx is run as a stand-alone server, it is possible to use SphinxAPI to connect an application to it. Official implementations of the API are available for PHP, Java, Perl, Ruby and Python languages. Unofficial implementations for other languages, as well as various third party plugins and modules are also available. Other data sources can be indexed via pipe in a custom XML format."
"The Sphinx search daemon supports the MySQL binary network protocol and can be accessed with the regular MySQL API and/or clients. Sphinx supports a subset of SQL known as SphinxQL. It supports standard querying of all index types with SELECT, modifying RealTime indexes with INSERT, REPLACE, and DELETE, and more."
"Sphinx can also provide a special storage engine for MariaDB and MySQL databases. This allows those MySQL, MariaDB to communicate with Sphinx's codice_1 to run queries and obtain results. Sphinx indices are treated like regular SQL tables."
"Sphinx is configured to examine a data set via its Indexer. The Indexer process creates a full-text index (a special data structure that enables quick keyword searches) from the given data/text. Full-text fields are the resulting content that is indexed by Sphinx; they can be (quickly) searched for keywords. Fields are named, and you can limit your searches to a single field (e.g. search through ""title"" only) or a subset of fields (e.g. to ""title"" and ""abstract"" only). Sphinx's index format generally supports up to 256 fields. Note that the original data is not stored in the Sphinx index, but are discarded during the Indexing process; Sphinx assumes that you store those contents elsewhere."
Attributes are additional values associated with each document that can be used to perform additional filtering and sorting during search. Attributes are named. Attribute names are case insensitive. Attributes are not full-text indexed; they are stored in the index as is. Currently supported attribute types are:
(since 1.10-beta);
(since 2.1.1-beta);
"Sphinx, like classic SQL databases, works with a so-called fixed schema, that is, a set of predefined attribute columns. These work well when most of the data stored actually has values: mapping sparse data to static columns can be cumbersome. Assume for example that you’re running a price comparison or an auction site with many different products categories. Some of the attributes like the price or the vendor are identical across all goods. But from there, for laptops, you also need to store the weight, screen size, HDD type, RAM size, etc. And, say, for shovels, you probably want to store the color, the handle length, and so on. So it’s manageable across a single category, but all the distinct fields that you need for all the goods across all the categories are legion. The JSON field can be used to overcome this. Inside the JSON attribute you don’t need a fixed structure. You can have various keys which may or may not be present in all documents. When you try to filter on one of these keys, Sphinx will ignore documents that don’t have the key in the JSON attribute and will work only with those documents that have it."

"L'Opéra du pauvre (English: Poor's Opera) is a piece for voices and orchestra formalized by Léo Ferré as a quadruple concept album released in 1983. This dreamlike and wry plea in favor of the Night, symbol of imagination and subversiveness for Ferré, synthesizes all aspects of the French poet and musician."
"""L'Opéra du pauvre"" comes from a ""lyrical"" ballet titled ""The Night"", written in 1956 at the request of choreographer and dancer Roland Petit, within the Revue des Ballets de Paris. The piece was abandoned by Petit after a few performances (critics being severely negative). Ferré published the libretto same year at La Table Ronde Editions. This work stayed then on the shelf for twenty-six years."
"It was after the triple LP ""Ludwig - L'Imaginaire - Le Bateau ivre"" was released in 1982, that Léo Ferré decided to dedicate his upcoming year to bring ""The Night"" back to life. As time had passed, Ferré had accumulated a lot of material, and he chose to enrich his original text and score with elements from various sources, thus creating a new Baroque work of much larger scope (it would take four LP to hold this whole new version)."
Léo Ferré changes his voice and acts all parts.
"The Night is accused of having murdered the Lady Shadow, who is missing. The opera depicts Night's trial by the ""day people"", allegorized by animals. The judge is a raven, prosecutor is a cock and Night's attorney is an owl. Witnesses, all night owls for some reason of their own, are called to the bar and try to save the Night."
= = = Lucsuhin Natural Bridge = = =
"Lucsuhin Natural Bridge, locally called Cabag Cave or Lucsuhin Cave, is a natural bridge located between Brgy. Lucsuhin and Brgy. Kalubkob in Silang, Cavite province in the Philippines. The bridge, which crosses the Ylang-Ylang River, is the first large natural bridge reported in the country."
"The first American to discover and study the bridge is Paul R. Fanning from the Division of Mines during the early part of the American colonial period. He was making a geological reconnaissance in the vicinity of Silang, Cavite in July 1910 when he discovered the natural bridge of unusual size. Owing to its remoteness, Fanning believed no white men have probably visited the place before."
The natural bridge is located in the great bedded tuff area lying between Manila and Tayabas Bay where the rock is favorable for their formation.
"The opening under the bridge span is tunnel-like and has a diameter of about and a length of about . It makes a double turn that roughly approximates the shape of the letter 'S.' During low water, the stream occupies a central channel consisting of a staggered series of small falls and potholes which are the result of the action of the water upon the horizontal bedding of the tuff rock."
"The floor of the bridge, which is about above the stream, was examined by Fanning and showed evidence of once having formed the bed of the stream. Erosion had nearly obliterated this old bed, but had not been sufficient to destroy the sides of the valley. At one time, the river must have flowed at this higher elevation to a place several kilometers down stream from the present tunnel and then passed over a cliff. This cliff gradually receded upstream forming the present box canyon. As illustrated by the sketches, seepage began at a point several hundred meters above the falls and, owing to the horizontal bedding of the rock, it first took a path at right angles to the river course, then descended from bed to bed to the bottom of the falls. The porous, soft nature of the rock favored the rapid enlargement of the underground channel, and eventually the entire stream followed this course."
"Subsequent erosion and caving had greatly decreased the length of the underground channel and produced the short canyon above the present entrance portal. Owing to the thinness of the roof, the first part of the tunnel caved rapidly, whereas the erosion and caving of the lower part was much slower. A condition now has been reached where the entrance and exit portals will be eroded with about equal speed and at the same time the tunnel will be greatly enlarged in diameter by down cutting and by caving of the roof. Under these conditions the bridge eventually should assume the arch structure characteristic of famous natural bridges in other parts of the world."
"The bridge and cave is not a protected area and need preservation for future generations, as well as the areas upriver to preserve the quality of water, lest it would end up like Hinulugang Taktak falls in Rizal province."
"The bridge can be reached from Silang by following the Silang-Banaybanay Road for about west from the Aguinaldo Highway and J. Rizal Ave. junction to the barrio of Lucsuhin, past the road to the Riviera Golf & Country Club, past the bridge over Ylang-Ylang River to Brgy. Kalubkob. From here, it is about long hike to the site."
"An alternate route from Kalubkob, is to head north on Fresco Belen Drive for about to a dirt road to the right. The bridge and cave are reached by hiking east on the dirt road for ."

Autocomplete allows quickly typing names in the context of the code. It can be further improved to assist the developer.
"For example, in an XML context, when the developer types an opening tag ""<"" he is offered a list of tags via autocomplete, contextualized following the DTD or XML schema of the document. As the developer types more letters, the offered choices are filtered to only retain the relevant completions. When the developer finally completes the tag, the editor automatically generates the closing tag."
"Other autocomplete techniques exist. For example, using the Eclipse IDE to code in Java, a developer can just type in the first letter if lowercase and the uppercase letters from a type/variable name then press Ctrl+space to be offered all the choices that match the entered letters that are valid for the current context (class name, interface name, variable or field names)."
Code snippets allow the developer to add a complex coding structure by typing a minimal amount of text. Code snippets can only be used in a valid context (statements snippets are only offered when you can insert statements).

= = = First Leisure Corporation = = =
First Leisure Corporation plc was a leisure operator in the United Kingdom between the years 1981 and 2004.
"Originally based in Soho Square, London, and with other offices in Blackpool and Leicester, its operations included Blackpool Tower, the WinterGardens and all three of Blackpool's piers, as well as five other piers, health and fitness clubs, nightclubs and bars, tenpin bowling centres and other mainstream UK high street entertainment venues."
"In 2000 a management buyout (MBO) financed by 3i and PPM Holdings saw First Leisure shed all but its Nightclubs and Bars division, which retained the First Leisure brand and consisted of approximately fifty mainstream high street venues. The MBO saw the company de-listing from the stock exchange (whilst retaining its plc status) and moving its operations to Leicester."
"At that time, the Health and Fitness chain was spun off as Esporta."
"By 2004, the company had shrunk its operations from 50 to 25 nightclubs; in so doing, it had sold its premises leases to rival operators. A clause of such sales mandated that should those new operators be unable to meet their obligations under the leases that they would be automatically reassigned to First Leisure with little warning or ceremony."
"At the end of 2004, such an automatic reassignment took place following competitors' defaults on a number of previously sold leases. Unable to meet the dramatically increased month-to-month obligations brought about by this mandatory re-acquisition, the company was subject to a Winding Up Order by a trade creditor and hence placed into Compulsory Liquidation by the Official Receiver."
"A 'Phoenix' company, named The Nightclub Company, was formed virtually immediately by the incumbent management team. Such an operation was short-lived, however, and it too was placed into administration in 2005. The precise circumstances regarding the collapse of TNC are unclear."
"The remaining leases were sold, mostly to long-time rival Luminar Leisure."
All that remains of the corporation as of 2007 is the Esporta health and fitness chain.

"Gillis van Stralen, Antonie's father, was a textile merchant. The family originated in Weert but moved between 1584-1590 to Gorkum, presumably because of Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma's armies marching through the area."

The couple went to live in Oude Spiegelstraat, near Singel. In Amsterdam Antonie got into a dispute with the Sint Lucasgilde, for its laxness in allowing in too many non-citizen painters."
"In 1641 he was buried in the Westerkerk. In 1644 his two children inherited two hundred guilder each from the sale of their father's paintings. The paintings must have been sold very cheap.

"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" is set between the events of ""Halo 3"" and ""Halo 4"". Players control the human soldiers Sarah Palmer and Edward Davis as they fight a splinter faction of the alien Covenant. The game launched with 25 single-player missions, with an additional campaign released as downloadable content. The console versions feature an exclusive cooperative horde mode."
"After years of rumored or cancelled handheld ""Halo"" projects, ""Spartan Assault"" was the franchise's first mobile game. The developers spent time adapting ""Halo""s distinctive elements to a touchscreen game meant to be played in short bursts. The game received mixed reviews on release, with the game praised for its success at pinpointing ""Halo""s aesthetic; the mobile versions of the game received lower average scores. ""Spartan Assault"" was followed by a sequel, """", in 2015."
"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" is a shooter game where players view gameplay from an overhead top-down perspective. The control method for the game depends on the host device. On touchscreen mobile devices, players control the character through virtual joysticks—the left stick controls movement and the right stick controls the direction of the character's fire—along with buttons along the edge of the screen. Xbox 360 and Xbox One players use a physical gamepad, while Windows players can use either a gamepad, or keyboard and mouse."
"The game features classic weapons and vehicles from the franchise. To assist players, many weapons auto-target enemies in the direction the player is firing."
"Gameplay of ""Halo: Spartan Assault"" earns the player experience points (XP), Achievements, and emblems for a ""Halo 4"" Spartan career."
"The Xbox 360 and the Xbox One versions of the game feature an additional cooperative game mode, designed to be different from that of the main campaign. Two players team up to survive against waves of enemy Flood."
"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" takes place in the 26th century between the events of ""Halo 3"" and ""Halo 4"". Following the events of ""Halo 3"", the human UNSC and alien Covenant separatists signed a ceasefire to end a decades-long war. Gameplay follows through the perspective of the Spartan supersoldiers Sarah Palmer or Spartan Davis. The campaign is divided into chapters, then further subdivided into individual missions."
"Spartans Palmer and Davis are stationed on the planet Draetheus V when it comes under attack from a rogue group of Covenant who have ignored the ceasefire. Palmer and Davis work to repel the invaders. This new Covenant leadership discovers that Draetheus' moon is actually a weapon built by an ancient race known as the Forerunners. The Covenant activates the weapon, tearing apart Draetheus and triggering an evacuation. Spartan Davis gives his life to allow the remaining human forces enough time to escape. Spartan Palmer tracks down the Covenant leader Merg Vol, kills him, sabotages the Forerunner weapon, and escapes the moon."
"In the Operation Hydra campaign, Spartan Palmer returns to X50 in search of a mysterious signal. She discovers that the signal is actually a distress signal from Spartan Davis. Palmer reaches the core of X50, but finds Davis dead; the moon is using his remains to create an unknown device, which Palmer extracts for study."
"Over the years, rumors swirled of a handheld or mobile version of ""Halo"" for the Game Boy Advance, Gizmondo, Ultra-Mobile PC, and Nintendo DS.

When ""Halo"" overseer 343 Industries was interested in developing a mobile game, Franchise Development Director Frank O'Connor recommended an arcade shooter, having wanted for years to see a ""Halo"" game in the vein of ""Moon Patrol""."
"343 Industries Executive Producer Dan Ayoub described the challenge of adapting ""Halo"" for a portable device as crafting the right experience for the device. ""If we'd gone down the first-person shooter route, we might have built something compelling, but it couldn't on its own merit play as well as a traditional ""Halo"" game,"" O'Connor recalled. While focusing on optimizing the game for touch controls, the developers wanted to make sure the elements that made ""Halo"" distinctive—its weapon sandbox, abilities, and look—remained. The focus on a mobile game experience also meant that the developers broke up the game's missions into smaller chunks for short playthroughs. During development, the game was known by the codename ""Bootcamp""."
"Tom Salta composed ""Spartan Assault""s music. The game was the first time Salta had worked on a project where the sound had been established by another composer—Salta called the original music of Combat Evolved ""sacred ground for me"" and his inspiration to compose for video games. Previous to ""Spartan Assault"" Salta was part of the team that reorchestrated and recorded the music for """"."
"Because the game was designed to be played on mobile devices, Salta and the music team worked to make sure audio quality would be high on small mobile speakers as well as through headphones or higher-end hardware. Since there was a limited budget for the music, Salta chose which sounds and instruments he would record live. Salta starts composing on a keyboard and uses Logic."
"""Spartan Assault"" was released in North America and Europe on July 18 and 19, respectively. In the United States, the game was initially restricted to Verizon phones before being released to all Windows 8 enabled devices. An Xbox One version of the game released on December 24, 2013, followed by an Xbox 360 version on January 31, 2014. It was released on Steam on April 4, 2014, the first game in the series to be distributed on the platform. On April 16, 2015, the game was released for iOS. The game's release coincided with a tie-in comic series, ""Halo: Initiation"", which detailed Palmer's path to becoming a Spartan."

"XML Information Set (XML Infoset) is a W3C specification describing an abstract data model of an XML document in terms of a set of ""information items"". The definitions in the XML Information Set specification are meant to be used in ""other"" specifications that need to refer to the information in a well-formed XML document."
An XML document has an information set if it is well-formed and satisfies the namespace constraints. There is no requirement for an XML document to be valid in order to have an information set.
An information set can contain up to eleven different types of information items:
"XML was initially developed without a formal definition of its infoset. This was only formalised by later work beginning in 1999, first published as a separate W3C Working Draft at the end of December that year."
"Infoset recommendation Second Edition was adopted on 4 February, 2004. If a 2.0 version of the XML standard is ever published, it is likely that this would absorb the Infoset recommendation as an integral part of that standard."
"Infoset augmentation or infoset modification refers to the process of modifying the infoset during schema validation, for example by adding default attributes. The augmented infoset is called the post-schema-validation infoset, or PSVI."
"Infoset augmentation is somewhat controversial, with claims that it is a violation of modularity and tends to cause interoperability problems, since applications get different information depending on whether or not validation has been performed."
Infoset augmentation is supported by XML Schema but not RELAX NG.
"Typically, XML Information Set is serialized as XML. There are also serialization formats for Binary XML, CSV, and JSON."

"Tubism is a term coined by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles in 1911 to describe the style of French artist Fernand Léger. Meant as derision, the term was inspired by Léger's idiosyncratic version of Cubism, in which he emphasized cylindrical shapes. The style was developed by Léger in his paintings of 1909–1919, such as ""Nudes in the Forest"" (1909-10) and ""The Card Players"" (1917)."
= = = Doomdark's Revenge = = =
"Doomdark's Revenge is a role-playing and strategy video game developed by Mike Singleton and published by Beyond Software for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC in 1985. It is a sequel to Singleton's 1984 seminal ""The Lords of Midnight"" and has similar game mechanics but adds more detail and complexity with the number of characters and locations increased."
"In ""Doomdark's Revenge"", the hero of the first game, Luxor the Moonprince, goes into the savage wastes of Icemark to save his son Morkin and defeat the evil Empress Shareth, daughter of his enemy Doomdark. Despite what the title suggests, Doomdark himself, who was killed in the first game, does not actually return in the sequel."
"Like its predecessor, ""Doomdark's Revenge"" was a major critical success and a commercial hit. It was supposed to be followed the sequel titled ""Eye of the Moon"" in 1989, which was never finished. Another sequel, """", was eventually released in 1995."
A novelisation of Doomdark's Revenge has been announced and is planned to be released towards the end of 2019
"The game has five factions to be recruited or fought: the Fey, the Barbarians, the Dwarfs, the Giants, and the Icelords. The main difference between this game and ""The Lords of Midnight"" is that the lords now all move and react independently, no longer content to sit in their castles and wait to be recruited. The enemy leader, Shareth, also moves around, attempting to recruit armies and lords to her cause, so a major part of the game involves recruiting sufficient forces to counter hers. This makes the relationship between lords very important, as some lords can only be recruited by certain others. Certain lords are vassals of certain others, and some may only be recruited by their lieges. Recruiting a liege does not, however, automatically recruit all his vassals, nor their respective vassals. Lords may also cooperate, recruit and fight each other independently, making the world much more dynamic than the previous game. There are many magic items to be found, most belonging to a single lord and having 'power in battle', as well as magic crowns, and the landscape and its features hold many surprises for the player."
"""Doomdark's Revenge"" reverses the first game's victory conditions by giving the computer only a single goal, the death of the main protagonist Luxor. The player has many possible levels of victory, ranging from the mere rescue of Luxor's son Morkin from Shareth's spell of enchantment and retreat to Midnight, to the complete destruction of Shareth and the safe return home of Luxor, Morkin, as well as Luxor's companions Rorthron and Tarithel."
"There are other ways to collect award miles when not travelling. The Lufthansa Miles & More Credit Card can be subscribed to (which may be issued as a VISA, MasterCard or American Express card, depending on the country in which it is issued) and at least one award mile for every two Euro spent. A one-time sign-up bonus is given and sometimes introductory promotions may apply, such as double or triple award miles for an introductory period."
"Award miles can be earned on certain Deutsche Bahn trains, when staying in certain hotels, shopping in certain shops (such as the LH Worldshop), renting cars, investing in certain funds, opening an account with certain banks, picking up a catalogue in a Bang & Olufsen store, and others."
"For all offers see Miles & More website as offers vary between countries. However, all these offers do not earn any status miles."
"Once a member has collected the necessary number of miles, they can be used to buy flights, upgrades and products from the Lufthansa Worldshop (offer restricted to residents of some countries only)."
"Miles in a member's account can be exchanged for award flights on all the fully integrated airline partners and all of the Star Alliance carriers. The number of miles that is deducted from the account depends on the origin and destination of that flight. The number of miles that is required can be checked in this file. Additional fees and taxes will still apply for award flights (but can be paid by additional miles). Since the beginning of 2017, with “Cash & Miles” members have been able to use miles flexibly for their flights, and thus, to reduce the amount of money to be paid."
Lufthansa does add fuel surcharges hidden as fees on award tickets. This is prohibited for US based carriers. A transatlantic award flight (regardless which airline is actually flown) with Miles and More can cost up to 500 EUR in additional taxes and fees whereas the same itinerary booked with the US based Star Alliance partner (United) and their miles would cost less than 100 EUR in fees and taxes (even if the itinerary involves Lufthansa aircraft). So Miles and More may have a much lower value than US based Miles.
"In September 2016, Miles & More adjusted the flight award table, thereby reducing the international / national surcharge per flight distance for domestic European premium flights. Miles & More thereby takes over a part of the regular surcharge. Participants now pay €5 instead of €35 in economy classes and €20 instead of €43 in business class with Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SWISS and brussels airlines. The number of miles required for a flight award inside Europe was adjusted slightly, increasing by 5,000 award miles for return flights."
"Miles can be redeemed for upgrades on all fully integrated carriers of Miles & More and on the following Star-Alliance partners: All Nippon Airways (ANA), Asiana Airlines, Condor Airlines, Singapore Airlines, TAP Portugal, Thai Airways International, United Airlines. Again the number of miles required depends on the destination of the flight. The exact number is found on . Passengers are only allowed to upgrade one class of service. Only certain booking classes qualify for upgrades."
"Miles can be redeemed for rental car, hotel, shopping, banks & insurance, telecommunications & electronics industries etc. Moreover, the Miles & More GmbH also continues to expand its offers in relation to travel. The hotel booking portal Miles & More Hotels already makes it easier for users to book the accommodation they need quickly, giving members the opportunity to earn at least 1,000 miles per night or to redeem their miles. In addition to this, the Miles & More rental car service allows members to redeem miles to book rental cars. Avis car rental in US costs 47,000 miles at the minimum, finding a Hilton hotel and shorting the list based on miles is impossible, selection of hotels in Best Western is very limited (The hotels are available in Best Western but most of the hotels in the list in US are NOT available for miles)."
"Members of the programme also earn award miles when paying their purchases with their Miles & More credit card. Holders of the Miles & More Credit Card Gold benefit furthermore from unlimited mileage validity. Programme members use more than 1.4 million Miles & More Credit Cards in Germany and 22 additional countries, primarily in Europe, America and Asia."
On Miles & More all customers can build status through collecting status miles. The status miles from 1 year only count towards status. Status is important as there are many privileges and advantages that status holders receive (such as priority check-in).
There are four status levels on Miles & More:
"This is the normal status that everybody gets after they join the program. This status does not receive any officially documented privileges. A Miles & More member starts with a temporary paper-card, which is usually cut out from one of the Lufthansa magazines or printed from the internet; a plastic card is sent once the member has credited at least one award mile to their Miles & More account."
"The frequent traveller card is given to all Miles & More customers that received a total of over 35,000 status miles or had 30 flights. This status remains valid for two years and a member can requalify in any one of those two years. All status cards expire in February of the third year, i.e. if status is earned in November 2009, the status will be valid until February 2012."
As a frequent traveller a passenger receives a number of privileges:
"Having collected 100,000 Status Miles within one calendar year, Miles & More members will receive ""Senator"" Status with a validity of at least two years."
The main benefits of Senator status are:
"Having collected 600,000 HON Circle Miles within two calendar years, Miles & More members receive HON Circle Status with validity of two years."
The main perks of having HON status are:

"In 1898 McLaren married Leila Evelyn Landon, who died in 1904. He married Ethyl Mary Wilson in 1910 despite the advice of Baden-Powell, who considered her below his station."
"McLaren had schooled at Harrow and studied at Sandhurst before joining his regiment, the 13th Hussars in 1880. He was posted to India, where he served as regimental adjutant and later aide de camp to General Baker Russell. In South Africa he was gravely wounded at the Siege of Mafeking in March 1900, and taken prisoner by the Boers. He was created a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1900."
"McLaren played polo throughout his military service, and was umpire of one of the two matches in the 1908 London Olympics."
"McLaren first met Baden-Powell (also a 13th Hussars officer) in 1881. Although McLaren was 20 at the time, Baden-Powell nicknamed him ""the Boy"", on account of his appearance. The two became fast friends, their relationship being one of the most important friendships in Baden-Powell's life."
"McLaren was recalled to military service in World War I, but retired again in 1915 due to ill-health."
"McLaren was one of the staff at Baden-Powell's Brownsea Island Scout camp in 1907. Baden-Powell convinced McLaren to be his first manager at the C. Arthur Pearson Limited office of ""The Scout"" magazine but McLaren resigned that position in March 1908."

"The codice_6 attribute does not always have to literally describe the contents of the image. Keep in mind the purpose and context of the image and what would be useful to someone who cannot see it. The alt attribute is supposed to be an ""alternative"" for the image, usually stating its purpose. For example, an image of a warning sign should not have alt text “a triangle with a yellow background, black border and an exclamation mark”, but simply “Warning!”—unless, of course, the image's purpose is to show what the warning symbol actually looks like."
"Internet Explorer 7 and earlier render text in alt attributes as tooltip text, which is not standards-compliant. This behavior led many web developers to misuse alt when they wished to display tooltips containing additional information about images, instead of using the codice_7 attribute that was intended for that use. As of Internet Explorer 8 alt attributes no longer render as tooltips."
"The alt attribute is commonly, but incorrectly, referred to as the ""alt tag""."
"The W3C recommends that images that convey no information, but are purely decorative, be specified in CSS rather than in the HTML markup. However, it may sometimes be necessary to include a decorative image as an HTML codice_2 tag. In this case, if the image truly does not add to the content, then a blank alt attribute should be included in the form of codice_9. This makes the page navigable for users of screen readers or non-graphical browsers. If (in breach of the standard) no alt attribute has been supplied, then browsers that cannot display the image will still display something there, e.g. the URL of the image, or a fixed text string."

However, Neill died before he could edit or illustrate the book. Oz publisher Reilly & Lee decided not to publish the book due to shortages caused by World War II. The text remained a possession of Neill's family."

"On the eve of an important ceremony in the Emerald City, Scraps the Patchwork Girl has been making more of a nuisance of herself than usual. After confrontations with Jellia Jamb and Jenny Jump, Scraps decides to run away on her spoolicle (a bicycle made of thread spools). She visits Jinjur's Munchkin Country farm; but Jinjur wants to put Scraps to work, so Scraps leaves quickly."
"At Prof. Wogglebug's Royal Athletic College, Scraps falls in with a 12-year-old prodigy named Alexample. They marvel at the air castle the Professor has dreamed into existence for his coming vacation, as it hovers above the college. Through unfortunate clumsiness, Scraps knocks the mooring line loose and the air castle floats away, with Alexample hanging onto the tethering rope. Scraps flees from the pursuit of the irate Wogglebug."
"Scraps meets a Repairman who magically fixes the damage and staining she's endured in her recent actions. The exasperated Scraps longs to run away from Oz entirely, but doesn't know how to cross the Deadly Desert. The Repairman informs her of a Weather Witch who lives on the highest mountain in Oz; she makes weather for the entire Earth from her windmill there. Scraps decides to get the Weather Witch to blow her across the Desert with wind, and sets out for the mountain."
"On the way, Scraps meets Popla, ""the one and only power plant...the most powerful plant in the world."" (Popla looks like a large shrub, with the face of a beautiful young woman.) Popla longs for release from her bleak and stationary existence, and eagerly transfers herself into a flowerpot to join with Scraps; Popla's strength and resourcefulness prove to be important advantages in their coming adventures. Despite tempestuous winds, the two intrepid travelers reach the top of the mountain. Fanny the Weather Witch agrees to blast them across the Deadly Desert; but additional clumsiness gets them stuck on one of the windmill's blades, which hurls them high into the atmosphere."
"Meanwhile, Prof. Wogglebug stomps toward the Emerald City to complain about Scraps to the Wizard. He encounters Jenny Jump and Jack Pumpkinhead, who have set out in search for the missing Scraps. The Wogglebug decides to join up with them, as the most direct approach to recovering his air castle. (The later chapters of the book alternate between the two plots: the runaway Scraps and her companions, and the searchers pursuing her.)"
"Scraps and Popla land on a friendly cloud, who takes them to a nearby star. The star is a kind of semi-mechanical conveyance, commanded by Captain Batt, who is built of wires and electric components. Predictably, Scraps gets into a fight with him; she punches him in his button nose, which proves to be his on-off button. With Captain Batt shut down, they meet the Twinkler, the star's maintenance man (he looks like Cap'n Bill). Popla tries piloting the star — and crashes into the missing air castle. They find Alexample there, and endure a few peaceful days in its palatial environs. They get to know the inhabitants of the upper air, who include sky fairies and air sprites, and cloud sheep herded by cloud-pushers and sky-sweepers. Scraps and company also repel an attack from sky pirates."
"Things go badly for the searchers below; they are caught in a storm, in which Jack loses his pumpkin head. Jenny and the Professor have to lead or drag his headless stick-body along with them. They wander into an enchanted orchard, where they confront an army of rebellious quinces. By this time, the week of the Wogglebug's planned vacation has expired, and the air castle's time is up: it melts, cracks, dissolves, shatters, and otherwise falls apart around its occupants. They come tumbling down upon the enchanted orchard, and the search party, and the quince army. In a final confrontation, the quince soldiers commit mass suicide by shooting their sooty stems at Scraps. She is so blackened by the soot that she tries to hide from the world."
"The others convince Scraps to return to the Emerald City, where she can be magically repaired. Scraps agrees, but she hides herself under a sheet as she walks through the city streets (like Ojo in ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz""); she causes a panic when she is mistaken for a ghost. Yet Ozma has no trouble in restoring Scraps to normal (if that term applies) with her Magic Belt. Popla and Alexample are welcomed into the ever-growing circle of Ozma's followers."
"In the best Baum tradition, puns come thick and fast throughout ""The Runaway in Oz"". In Chapter 8, ""The Professor Sets Out,"" the reader is informed of the enlarged bug's feelings: ""But though he was in an unsettled state of mind, he was not crushed."" Two pages later, he threatens to become ""hopping mad."" Jenny tells the professor that the Wizard is busy ""ridding the country of dumb little kings and their little kingdumbs."" These three pages can stand as representative of the whole."

"The two popular models claiming to explain the WSE are the interactive activation model (IAM) and the dual-route coding model (DRC) Neither of these models takes attention into account; This is a relationship looked into through research on the WSE. Evidence shows that the WSE persists without an observer’s conscious awareness of the word presented, which implies that attention is neither necessary for WSE nor involved in this phenomenon. However, attentional focus has been demonstrated to modulate the WSE which agrees with recent neurophysiological data explaining that attention, in fact, modulates early stages of word processing."
"The activation-verification model (AVM) is another model that was developed to account for reaction time data from lexical decision and naming tasks. The basic operations explored in the AVM that are involved in word and letter recognition are encoding, verification, and decision. Both the IAM and the AVM share many basic assumptions such as the fact that stimulus input activates spatially-specific letter units, that activated letter units, modulate the activity of word units, and that letter and word recognition are frequently affected by top-down processes (e.g. Reading the phrase ""A cow says..."" a person would guess ""moo"" and in checking that the word begins with 'm' ignores the rest of the letters)."
"The WSE has proven to be an important finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by Rumelhart and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel will either stimulate or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for ""C"", horizontal and vertical bars for ""H"", etc.). Those feature detectors will then stimulate or inhibit different letter detectors, which will finally stimulate or inhibit different word detectors. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word ""WORK"" in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader)."
"According to this interactive-activation model, the WSE is explained as such: When the target letter is presented within a word, the feature detectors, letter detectors and word detectors will all be activated, adding weight to the final recognition of the stimulus. However, when only the letter is presented, only the letter detector level will be activated. Therefore, we may remember the presented stimulus word more clearly, and thereby be more accurate in identifying its component letters, as observed in the WSE."
"The AVM deals with encoding, verification, and decision operations. Encoding is used to describe the early operations that lead to the unconscious activation of learned units in memory. After encoding, verification occurs. Verification often leads to the conscious recognition of a single lexical entry from the respondents. Verification is to be viewed as an independent, top-down analysis of stimulus that is guided by the stored, or previously learned, representation of a word. Real-time processing in verification can be mimicked by a computer simulation. Lastly, the factors affecting speed and accuracy of performance in a particular paradigm depend on whether decisions are based primarily on information from encoding or verification."
"One of the findings of the Johnston and McClelland reportwas that the WSE does not occur inevitably whenever we compare a word and a nonword. Rather, it depends somewhat upon the strategies that readers use during a task. If readers paid more attention to the letter in a particular ""position"", they would experience the adverse word superiority effect. This is because the reader would no longer have the benefit of having the word detector level activated with as much weight if they neglected to focus on the full word."

"The tank is controlled by a standard NES controller: Directional buttons control the tank's movement, ""A"" fires the tank's machine-gun, ""B"" fires the main gun, ""Start"" pauses the game on the main screen, and ""Select"" opens the in-game menu. The turret can point in the standard 8 directions and is rotated by simultaneously pressing ""A"" and the desired direction. The turret will maintain its direction on the screen regardless of the tank's movements or facing and using this is part of the game's strategy."
"While in the game, pressing the ""Select"" button will open the in-game menu. From here, the player can activate or deactivate main gun fire options, read incoming radio messages, check progress on the game map and turn on the automated ""Refuel"" option. There are four main gun options, which when activated, alter the main gun's properties. They are:"
"While advancing through the game, the player will also come across power-up icons—red squares with a white letter in them. Some of the benefits from these include:"
"Like most NES action shooters, ""Iron Tank"" is divided into multiple levels, with bosses at the end of each. However, gameplay is continuous; there are no breaks between levels as the defeat of one boss directly leads to the start of the next level. One unique aspect that separates it from other action shooters is the ability of the player choose different paths to the final level by driving down the path of his choice. Some paths have fewer but more difficult levels, resulting in a shorter game if the player can successfully negotiate them while others are the reverse. The paths break and converge at specific points in the game's progress, allowing the player to mix and match level paths as the game progresses."
"The level bosses are various different, powerful weapons that include giant tanks, railway artillery, fortresses and grounded aircraft. Most have some degree of movement either in two directions—such as the railway gun, or freely around the screen like any of the several giant tanks. All of them have predictable movement and firing patterns and exploiting this is necessary to defeat them."

= = = BroadR-Reach = = =
"BroadR-Reach technology is an Ethernet physical layer standard designed for use in automotive connectivity applications. BroadR-Reach technology allows multiple in-vehicle systems to simultaneously access information over unshielded single twisted pair cable. Benefits for automotive manufacturers integrating the BroadR-Reach Ethernet standard include reduced connectivity costs and cabling weight, according to Broadcom Corporation, now Broadcom Limited, inventor of the BroadR-Reach standard."
"Using BroadR-Reach technology in automotive enables the migration from multiple closed applications to a single open, scalable Ethernet-based network within the automobile. This allows automotive manufacturers to incorporate multiple electronic systems and devices, such as advanced safety features (i.e. 360- degree surround view parking assistance, rear-view cameras and collision avoidance systems) and comfort and infotainment features. The automotive-qualified BroadR-Reach Ethernet physical layer standard can be combined with IEEE 802.3 compliant switch technology to deliver 100Mbit/s over unshielded single twisted pair cable. This innovation bypasses traditional cabling for Ethernet connectivity, allowing all vehicle components to connect using wires that are lighter and more cost effective."
"The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard realizes simultaneous transmit and receive (i.e., full-duplex) operations on a single-pair cable. In order to better de-correlate the signal, the digital signal processor (DSP) uses a highly optimized scrambler when compared to the scrambler used in 100BASE-TX. This provides a robust and efficient signaling scheme required by automotive applications. The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard uses a signaling scheme with higher spectral efficiency than that of 100BASE-TX. This limits the signal bandwidth of Automotive Ethernet to 33.3 MHz, which is about half the bandwidth of 100BASE-TX. A lower signal bandwidth improves return loss, reduces crosstalk, and ensures that BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard passes the stringent automotive electromagnetic emission requirements."
"The OPEN Alliance SIG is a special interest group formed by BMW, Broadcom, Freescale, Harman, Hyundai, NXP and STMicroelectronics to establish BroadR-Reach as an open standard and to encourage wide scale adoption of automotive Ethernet as the connectivity standard in automotive networking applications. Since its inception in late 2011, membership has reached more than 140 members as of May 31, 2013."
IEEE 802.3 has standardized 100BASE-T1 in IEEE 802.3bw-2015 Clause 96.
"The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard was officially released in December 2011, following the formation of The OPEN (One-Pair Ether-Net) Alliance Special Interest Group (SIG) (OPEN Alliance SIG). License to the specification for BroadR-Reach is available to all interested OPEN Alliance SIG members under RAND terms via a license from Broadcom Corporation."

"Motorcycling greetings can include several gestures made between motorcyclists on the road.

The greeting made can include a number of gestures including a nod, a pointed finger, palm-out V sign, or an actual raised-hand wave."
Motorcyclists may use specialized hand signals to both greet and warn oncoming riders:
"The use of specific gestures may be culturally or regionally dependent. Some observers have commented that waving is common amongst riders in North America but uncommon in some European countries, like Germany."
"French riders will stick their foot out when overtaking another motorcycle, and while lane splitting when a car facilitates it.. In Britain, vehicles drive on the left hand side of the road, and so bikers will most commonly give eachother a nod, rather than releasing the throttle to wave, or waving with the clutch hand which would likely be difficult to see."
= = = Country Place = = =
"Country Place is a residential neighbourhood near the geographical centre of Ottawa, Canada and part of the former city of Nepean. It is a mature residential subdivision with about 400 houses located just inside the Ottawa greenbelt near the Rideau River, and about 11 km from downtown Ottawa. It is bordered by the Black Rapids Creek and the greenbelt to the south, Prince of Wales Drive to the east, Merivale Road to the west, and the Pineglen community to the north. Amberwood Crescent meanders through the community, exiting onto Prince of Wales and Merivale. Tennyson Drive links Country Place to Pineglen."
Houses in Country Place were built mostly in the early 1970s and are similar in size and design. The only exceptions are houses on Campfield Ct. which was built in the 1980s on land that had originally been set aside for a possible school.
"The community has an active community association that runs events several times a year, maintains an outdoor rink in the winter, and helps promote the interests of the residents. Country Place is within the Knoxdale-Merivale Ward of the City of Ottawa."
"The IBM Z family maintains full backward compatibility. In effect, current systems are the direct, lineal descendants of System/360, announced in 1964, and the System/370 from the 1970s. Many applications written for these systems can still run unmodified on the newest IBM Z system over five decades later."
"Virtualization is required by default on IBM Z systems. First layer virtualization is provided by the Processor Resource and System Manager (PR/SM) to deploy one or more Logical Partitions (LPARs). Each LPAR supports a variety of operating systems. A hypervisor called z/VM can also be run as the second layer virtualization in LPARs to create as many virtual machines (VMs) as there are resources assigned to the LPARs to support them. The first layer of IBM Z virtualization (PR/SM) allows a z machine to run a limited number of LPARs (up to 80 on the IBM z13). These can be considered virtual ""bare metal"" servers because PR/SM allows CPUs to be dedicated to individual LPARs. z/VM LPARs allocated within PR/SM LPARs can run a very large number of virtual machines as long as there are adequate CPU, memory, and I/O resources configured with the system for the desired performance, capacity, and throughput."
"IBM Z's PR/SM and hardware attributes allow compute resources to be dynamically changed to meet workload demands. CPU and memory resources can be non-disruptively added to the system and dynamically assigned, recognized, and used by LPARs. I/O resources such as IP and SAN ports can also be added dynamically. They are virtualized and shared across all LPARs. The hardware component that provides this capability is called the Channel Subsystem. Each LPAR can be configured to either ""see"" or ""not see"" the virtualized I/O ports to establish desired ""shareness"" or isolation. This virtualization capability allows significant reduction in I/O resources because of its ability to share them and drive up utilization."
"PR/SM on IBM Z has earned Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 5+ security certification, and z/VM has earned Common Criteria EAL4+ certification."
The KVM hypervisor from Linux has also been ported.
"Since the move away from the System/390 name, a number of IBM Z models have been released. These can be grouped into families with similar architectural characteristics."
"The IBM zEnterprise System (zEnterprise), announced in July 2010, with the z196 model, is designed to offer both mainframe and distributed server technologies in an integrated system. The zEnterprise System consists of three components. First is a System z server. Second is the IBM zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX). Last is the management layer, IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager (zManager), which provides a single management view of zEnterprise resources. The zEnterprise is designed to extend mainframe capabilities – management efficiency, dynamic resource allocation, serviceability – to other systems and workloads running on AIX on POWER7, and Microsoft Windows or Linux on x86."
"The zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX) is an infrastructure component that hosts both general purpose blade servers and appliance-like workload optimizers which can all be managed as if they were a single mainframe. The zBX supports a private high speed internal network that connects it to the central processing complex, which reduces the need for networking hardware and provides inherently high security."
"The IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager integrates the System z and zBX resources as a single virtualized system and provides unified and integrated management across the zEnterprise System. It can identify system bottlenecks or failures among disparate systems and if a failure occurs it can dynamically reallocate system resources to prevent or reduce application problems. The Unified Resource Manager provides energy monitoring and management, resource management, increased security, virtual networking, and information management from a single user interface."
Highlights of the original zEnterprise z196 include:
"The newest zEnterprise, the EC12, was announced in August 2012, and included:"
"On April 8, 2014, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the System/360 mainframe, IBM announced the release of its first converged infrastructure solution based on mainframe technology.

"Bob Wren Stadium features many modern amenities and has a capacity of 4,000. The stadium has 100 chairback seats that are part of the VIP club, named the Baumholtz club in honor of former Ohio baseball player Frank Baumholtz. In addition, there are around 1,000 bleacher-back seats in the stadium and another 1,000 seats of regular bleachers. Down both the third and first base lines there are two grassy knolls that are capable of seating up to another 1,000 fans."
"There are two concession stands available with traditional ballpark fare, and members of the Baumholtz Club have access to a private lounge that serves more upscale food items. The press box provides multiple phones and computer lines for members of the media. There are also two radio broadcast booths and one television broadcast booth available."
"The stadium has already undergone several modifications since opening. In 2003, a large Daktronics digital scoreboard was added to the outfield of the stadium. That same year, heated batting cages were added to the northeast of the stadium, allowing Bobcat players to practice inside during cold weather. Most recently, lights were installed in 2004. As a result of this new addition, 15 of Ohio's 28 home games in 2005 were played at night."
"The stadium is named for former Bobcat head coach Bob Wren, who held the highest all-time winning percentage of any Ohio baseball coach."
"In addition to serving as the home of Ohio Bobcats baseball, Bob Wren Stadium is home to the Southern Ohio Copperheads of the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League and is the home of the state American Legion baseball tournament every year."

"It was estimated that the Nation of Islam had at least 20,000 members in 2006. However, today the group has a wide influence in the African American community. The first Million Man March took place in Washington, D.C. in 1995 and was followed later by another one in 2000 which was smaller in size but more inclusive, welcoming individuals other than just African American men. The group sponsors cultural and academic education, economic independence, and personal and social responsibility."
"The Nation of Islam has received a great deal of criticism for its anti-white, anti-Christian, and anti-semitic teachings, and is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center."
"The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to the ""Nation of Gods and Earths"" (NGE/NOGE) or the ""Five Percenters"", is an American organization founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by a former member of the Nation of Islam named Clarence 13X (born Clarence Edward Smith and later known as ""Allah the Father""). Clarence 13X, a former student of Malcolm X, left the Nation of Islam after a theological dispute with the Nation's leaders over the nature and identity of God. Specifically, Clarence 13X denied that the Nation's biracial founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was Allah and instead taught that the black man was himself God personified."
"Members of the group call themselves Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those elites and agents opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the rest."
"The United Nation of Islam (UNOI) is a group based in Kansas City, Kansas. It was founded in 1978 by Royall Jenkins, who continues to be the leader of the group and styles himself ""Royall, Allah in Person""."
"After the death of Elijah Muhammad, he was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammed. Mohammed rejected many teachings of his father, such as the divinity of Fard Muhammad, and saw a white person as also a worshiper. As he took control of the organization, he quickly brought in new reforms. He renamed it the World Community of al-Islam in the West; later it became the American Society of Muslims. It was estimated that there were 200,000 followers of W. D. Mohammed at the time."
"W. D. Mohammed introduced teachings which were based on orthodox Sunni Islam. He removed the chairs in the organization's temples, and replaced the entire ""temple"" concept with the traditional Muslim house of worship, the mosque, also teaching how to pray the ""salat"", to observe the fasting of Ramadan, and to attend the pilgrimage to Mecca."
"A small number of Black Muslims however rejected these new reforms brought by Imam Mohammed. Louis Farrakhan who broke away from the organization, re-established the Nation of Islam under the original Fardian doctrines, and remains its leader."
"Although at first the India-originated Ahmadiyya Muslim Community's efforts were broadly concentrated at over large number of racial and ethnic groups, subsequent realization of the deep-seated racial tensions and discrimination made Ahmadi missionaries focus their attention on mainly African Americans and the Muslim immigrant community and became vocal proponents of the Civil Rights Movement. Many Ahmadi Muslims fled countries like Pakistan due to persecution in recent times."
"""Salafi methodology means that Muslims teach and understand the holy texts, the Qur’an and the prophetic Sunnah by learning Arabic and trying to live as closely to the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam) as possible. The early Salafis (the first three generations) are referred to as the righteous companions of the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam). Of course, there are some state and federal laws where they must make exceptions, such as getting photos taken for identification purposes and basically obeying secular law. Most Salafis do not wish to participate in modern photography. It is considered haram, which means unlawful in Arabic."""
"Philadelphia has one of the largest concentrations of Muslims in the United States. Philadelphia's Germantown Salafi community is one of the most important, as their community is primarily African American and adherents to the Salafi methodology, according to the first three generations of Muslims. There has been an increase of authentic teachings of Islam in the United States over the past several decades to mitigate many misunderstandings, incorrect deviant sects and harmful, terrorist propagated teachings that are against traditional Islam as taught by the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam) and his righteous companions. The Germantown community has been one of the largest representatives of this effort. Teachings of correct Aqeedah (creed) and Minhaaj (methodology) according to the authentic prophetic traditions are their foundation."
"The Germantown community has a very Muslim feel with Muslim stores of various sorts. Anything from halal meat shops, clothing, authentic book stores and various Muslim businesses line the commercial corridor. One of the defining representations of the community is seeing Salafi Muslim women dressed in full length black Abayas and Hijabs, Salafi Muslim men wearing the Kufi (style of Muslim hat) mandatory beards and white Thobes (usually white lining robes) with pants underneath and above the ankles as a signature style for the community."
"Conversion to Islam is a practice which is common to African-Americans in prison. J. Michael Waller found that Muslim inmates comprise 17–20% of the prison population, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. Waller states that these inmates mostly come into prison as non-Muslims. According to him, 80% of the prisoners who ""find faith"" while in prison convert to Islam. These converted inmates are mostly African American, with a small but growing Hispanic minority. Waller also asserts that many converts are radicalized by outside Islamist groups linked to terrorism, but other experts suggest that when radicalization does occur it has little to no connection with these outside interests."

"Too-Rye-Ay is the second album by Dexys Midnight Runners, released in July 1982. The album is best known for the hit single ""Come On Eileen"", which included the lyrics ""too-rye-ay"" that inspired the album's title."
"Shortly before recording this album, Dexys' bandleader Kevin Rowland had decided to add a violin section to the band's existing horn section, which had contributed strings (viola and cello) to the band's previous single, ""Liars A to E"". However, after violinists Helen O'Hara and Steve Brennan joined the band, the three members of the horn section, including Dexys' co-leader and album co-composer ""Big"" Jim Paterson, decided to leave Dexys and become an independent horn band (ultimately known as The TKO Horns). Rowland convinced them to stay with the band long enough to record the album and to perform in a kick-off concert debuting the album on BBC Radio One in June 1982."
"All the songs on the album were rearranged to add strings, which caused Dexys to re-record the 1981 singles ""Plan B"", ""Liars A to E"", and ""Soon"". During the rearrangement process, ""Soon"" was revised into the opening section of ""Plan B""; since both songs were written by Rowland and Paterson, the merged songs are credited on the album simply as ""Plan B""."
"The album's ""Come On Eileen"" became a number one hit in both the UK and the US. Dexys Midnight Runners is best known as a one hit wonder in the US (""Come On Eileen"" was also the first US single release by Dexys), but in the UK, ""Geno"" had previously reached number one, and ""Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)"" and ""The Celtic Soul Brothers"" were also UK hits."
"Before ""Come On Eileen"", Dexys' only North American single was the Northern Soul classic ""Seven Days Too Long"", which Dexys' previous label EMI America had released only in Canada (with ""Geno"" as the B-side). However, on the strength of ""Come On Eileen"", ""Too-Rye-Ay"" reached number 14 in the US. Dexys' success in US was not maintained; the best performer of the band's follow-up singles in the US was ""The Celtic Soul Runners"", which peaked at number 86."
"Different releases of ""Too-Rye-Ay"" featured different versions of ""Come On Eileen"". Certain editions of the album featured a version beginning with a solo fiddle playing the first line of the folk song ""Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms"" and ending with a simple fadeout (""length: 4:07""). This version of the song is the one featured on the single release. Other editions of the album (including many of the ""re-releases"") featured a version without the violin intro and including a tag of Kevin Rowland singing ""Young Charms"" at the end, while the digital version offered by Spotify includes both front and end ""Young Charms"" tags (""length: approximately 4:32""). In addition, the most common release of the album features ""Come On Eileen"" as the final track, while the original US release features the tune as the opening track on Side 2."
"The album was re-released in 1996 on CD with 8 bonus tracks. In 2000 an enhanced edition was released with the music videos for ""Come On Eileen"" and ""Jackie Wilson Said"" as bonus material. In 2002 a US edition with bonus tracks was released. Marking its 25th Anniversary, a 2007 2-CD Deluxe Edition was released, which included the entire 14-song album kickoff performance on BBC Radio 1 that had previously been released (without ""I'll Show You"") as ""BBC Radio One Live in Concert""."

"Westside High School is the only high school of the Westside Community Schools district (also known as District 66 to local residents) of Omaha, Nebraska, United States."
"Westside has used a modular schedule since 1967. Each module, or ""mod"" (as known colloquially among WHS students), is either a 20 or 40-minute period used for classes or independent study time in an instructional materials center (IMC). This allows freedom in scheduling as classes can be 40, 60, or 80 minutes long, as needed for one-to-one, small group, large group, and laboratory instruction. Classes are taught in a similar format to many universities; students meet a large group lecture once per week and have small group recitations throughout the week. An average student has at least one or two full open mods per day, to be used for studying, interacting with teachers, eating lunch, or socializing. Juniors and seniors who have met specific requirements are eligible to apply for a pass that allows them to leave the building during open mods."
"In 1985, Westside Senior Bridget Mergens was denied the ability to create an after-school Christian Bible club. The principal at the time rejected the idea since he said a religious club violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. In addition, the club lacked a school sponsor that was required when forming a club. Mergens argued that the district's decision was in violation of the federal Equal Access Act requiring that groups seeking to express messages containing “religious, political, philosophical, or other content” not be denied the ability to form clubs. In 1990,Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens was heard by the Supreme Court. In an 8-1 decision, the court said that since the club did not study school curriculum, it was permitted under the Equal Access Act."

= = = International Offshore Rule = = =
The International Offshore Rule (IOR) was a measurement rule for racing sailboats. The IOR evolved from the Cruising Club of America (CCA) rule for racer/cruisers and the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) rule.
"The IOR was superseded (in the early 1990s) by the International Measurement System (IMS) and CHS (since renamed IRC). While some IOR yachts race at club level under IRC in more or less their original form, others had major surgery to make them competitive within the new rules."
"The IOR concentrated on hull shape with length, beam, freeboard and girth measurements, foretriangle, mast and boom measurements, and stability with an inclination test. Additionally, the IOR identified features which were dangerous, or it couldn't fairly rate, and penalized or prohibited them. The measurements and penalties were used to compute the handicap number, called an ""IOR rating"", in feet. The higher the rating, the faster the boat was deemed to be able to sail. A typical IOR 40 footer (a ""one tonner"") rated 30.55 feet."
"The IOR rule encouraged wide short boats with limited stability. A narrow waterline and large beam on deck, combined with a high centre of gravity, meant that crew weight provided a significant proportion of stability at small heel angles, and boats had a relatively low angle of vanishing stability. This developed into the situation about 1977 when the boats winning in most smaller IOR categories (up to the half tonners - about 10m LOA) had all internal ballast, often with an unballasted daggerboard. The managers of the rule realised that this was not a suitable direction for seaworthy yachts, and heavily penalised boats with lifting keels, but not before the 1979 Fastnet race ended in disaster. Writes John Rousmaniere:"
"Apart from the girth measurements, all measurements were basically point measurements. This meant that the hull was often locally distorted to maximise or minimise a measurement locally, with minimal effect to the surrounding hull. This gave a characteristic ""bumped"" look to many boats, particularly at the point of maximum beam and in the stern. Also, as stability was only measured at very low heel angles (less than 5 degrees), boats were designed with a very narrow waterline and low stability in measurement trim, but a hull form that gained stability with the weight of the crew and other equipment, and with increasing angles of heel. Low stability was encouraged (up to a point) because the initial assumption was that low stability indicated a well fitted out interior, and so more of a cruising boat than a stripped out racer."

"Tourist Trap is a 1979 American supernatural slasher film directed by David Schmoeller and starring Chuck Connors, Jocelyn Jones, Jon Van Ness, Robin Sherwood, and Tanya Roberts. The film follows a group of young people who stumble upon a roadside museum housing mannequins that wield supernatural powers. Schmoeller co-wrote the script with J. Larry Carroll who served as producer for the film alongside famous producer/director Charles Band."
"Eileen and her boyfriend Woody are driving through the desert. When their car gets a flat, Woody goes to find a gas station. Their friends Becky, Jerry, and Molly are traveling separately in a different vehicle. They reach Eileen waiting at the car and they all drive off to collect Woody."
"Woody has found a gas station but it appears deserted. He enters the back room but becomes trapped. Various mannequins appear in the room, and multiple objects fly at him until a metal pipe impales and kills him."
"The others find a tourist trap and conclude Woody is there. As they drive in, their vehicle mysteriously breaks down. Jerry tries to fix his jeep and the girls go skinny dipping in a nearby oasis. As they swim, Mr. Slausen - the owner of said tourist trap - appears holding a shotgun. Though outwardly polite he also seems embittered by the decline of his tourist trap since the highway was moved away. The nude girls feel awkward in the water as he chats and they apologize for trespassing."
"Slausen offers to help Jerry with the jeep, but insists the group go to his house with him to get his tools. There, they see the tourist trap: animated waxworks figures, including armed bandits. Eileen is curious about a nearby house, but Slausen insists that the women should stay inside the museum. Slausen takes Jerry to fix the jeep, leaving the women. Eileen leaves to find a phone in the other house. There she finds several mannequins inside the house. Someone calls her name, and a stranger wearing a grotesque mask suddenly appears behind her. Various items in the room move of their own accord and the scarf Eileen is wearing tightens and strangles her to death."
"Slausen returns to Molly and Becky saying that Jerry drove his truck into town. When told that Eileen left, he goes to the house and finds Eileen has been turned into a mannequin. He returns and tells Molly and Becky he did not find Eileen and will leave again to continue the search. The women are frustrated, and later leave the museum to search for Eileen. Becky enters the nearby house and finds a mannequin resembling Eileen. Becky is attacked by the masked killer and then by multiple mannequins. She later wakes up tied up in the basement along with Jerry. Jerry says the killer is Slausen's brother. Also held captive is Tina (Dawn Jeffory), who is strapped to a table. She is killed when the masked man covers her face with plaster, causing her to suffocate. Jerry frees himself and attacks the killer, but is soon overpowered. Jerry tries to reach for a key but the killer telekinetically moves it from his reach."
"Molly is still outside and searching for the others. She is soon pursued by the masked man. She meets Slausen who drives her to the museum and gives her a gun while he goes inside. The masked man appears and Molly shoots, but the gun is loaded with blanks. The man removes the mask, revealing himself to be Slausen. She panics and tries to elude Slausen but is soon captured and restrained to a bed."
"Becky and Jerry escape from the basement, but get separated. Slausen appears and takes Becky to the museum. There the Old West figures begin shooting at her. Becky is killed by an Indian Chief figure who throws a knife at her, stabbing her in the back of the head. Back at the house, Jerry arrives to rescue Molly, but he is revealed to have unknowingly been turned into a mannequin. Slausen dances with the figure of his wife, and Molly sees that the wife has become animated. Traumatized, she kills Slausen with an axe."
"The next morning, an insane Molly is seen driving away in the jeep with the mannequin versions of her friends."
"The screenplay for ""Tourist Trap"" was written by David Schmoeller and J. Larry Carroll, the latter of whom pitched the film to producer Charles Band. Initially, Schmoeller intended for John Carpenter to direct the film, but Carroll was unsatisfied with the financial arrangements, and opted instead that Schmoeller should direct. Carroll and Schmoeller had previously pitched the film to producers Samuel Z. Arkoff and Bruce Cohn Curtis, but were unable to secure a production arrangement."
"The original screenplay did not feature the telekinetic powers; according to Carroll, the idea was proposed by Band, who insisted it be implemented into the script."
"The production did not appoint a casting director for the film, instead relying on independent talent agents to help cast the roles. According to director Schmoeller, $50,000 of the film's budget was dedicated to salary for the lead actor portraying the villain Mr. Slausen. The role was offered to several older Hollywood actors, such as Jack Palance and Gig Young, but both turned the project down. Chuck Connors, who was the production crew's third choice for the role, accepted the role."
"According to Schmoeller, each of the actors in the film aside from Connors auditioned for their parts. Jocelyn Jones was cast as the female lead, Molly, after Schmoeller had seen some of her previous performances, while Tanya Roberts was given the role of Becky. Jon Van Ness and Robin Sherwood were given the roles of Jerry and Eileen, respectively."
"""Tourist Trap"" was filmed in 24 days in Los Angeles County, California, with additional interiors shot at Rampart Sound Studios in Los Angeles. Principal photography began on March 27, 1978. A portion of the interior scenes were shot at an abandoned house located at 5255 Hollywood Boulevard which was scheduled for demolition. Schmoeller made arrangements with the contractor to postpone the demolition of the building for five days, during which time the crew shot footage. By using the abandoned location, the production saved an estimated $30,000 in set construction and soundstage fees. David Wyler, the son of William Wyler, served a second assistant director, while the director of photography was Nicholas von Sternberg, son of Josef von Sternberg."
"Production designer Robert A. Burns, who had worked on Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974) and Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (1977), handled the art direction – and the majority of the special effects – on ""Tourist Trap"", including the mannequins and their physical manipulations. To accomplish the poltergeist-like effects in the film's opening scene, the set was constructed at a rotated 90 degrees; this allowed items to be hurled by the crew from the cabinet—which was in fact anchored to the ceiling—to the floor, which appeared on camera as a wall. Other special effects were accomplished with the use of wires. For the death sequence of Tanya Roberts's character, for example, a block of wood was taped behind Roberts's hair; a knife attached to a wire was hurled at the back of her head, which stuck into the wooden block."
"Schmoeller recalled the filming process as being a ""learning"" experience as he was a first-time director; he stated in a 2014 interview that he learned a significant amount of ""how to work with actors"" from actress Jones."
"Italian composer Pino Donaggio was in town working on Joe Dante's ""Piranha"" (1978) at the time that David Schmoeller was filming ""Tourist Trap"". Since Donaggio spoke Spanish – as did Schmoeller – the director was able to convince the composer to score the music for ""Tourist Trap"". The two would have subsequent collaborations, including ""Crawlspace"" (1986)."
"According to the American Film Institute Catalog, the film premiered in Los Angeles, California on March 14, 1979. Despite its depictions of violence and macabre images, the Motion Picture Association of America awarded the film a PG rating. Because of its rating, the film was able to receive significant broadcasting on syndicated television in the years following its theatrical release."
"From contemporary reviews, ""Variety"" wrote, ""Although pic has some appropriately menacing music and occasionally employs some decent special effects, the plot is too loaded with cliches, from the concept to individual bits of dialog to be taken seriously and not silly enough to be regarded as delightfully bad."" Charles Champlin of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote that the film ""has some moments of effectiveness, but even the hard-line shiverists are likely to feel it's a long time between shrieks."" Tim Pulleine of the ""Monthly Film Bulletin"" called the film a ""wholly unimaginative exercise in low-budget horror plunders ""Psycho"" for its central plot gimmick in a fashion even more hamfisted than its is bare-faced."" and that ""Nothing much is made of the potentially sinister import of the wax dummies, by comparison with whom the human performers also fail to come off too well"""
"From retrospective reviews, Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film one and a half out of four stars, stating that although the film had a couple of genuine scares, it was a ""mostly boring thriller""."
"Author Stephen King, in his book ""Danse Macabre"" (1981), praised the film as an obscure classic, noting that the film ""wields an eerie spooky power, as wax figures begin to move and come to life in a ruined, out-of-the-way tourist resort."""
"Jason Buchanan from AllMovie praised the film, calling it ""one of the most underappreciated low-budget horror films of the 1970s"". In his review on the film, Buchanan commended the film's atmosphere, score, Conners' performance, and unsettling use of sound and imagery; comparing it to Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"". ""TV Guide"" awarded the film two out of four stars, calling it a ""bizarre, eerie shocker."""
"The film was satirized by RiffTrax on November 21, 2012."
"The film was released on DVD by Cult Video on July 20, 1998. It was re-released on DVD by Wizard Entertainment on March 19, 2013. Full Moon Features released the film for the first time on Blu-ray on May 20, 2014. The Full Moon Blu-ray release features a truncated version of the film; though the film's violent scenes remain intact, minor plot points are absent from this cut of the film."

"Ladestien () is a broad walking track that strolls along the Trondheimsfjord around the entire Lade Peninsula in the municipality of Trondheim in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. The track is about long. The western part of the track starts at Korsvika, about east of the center of Trondheim, and follows the fjord east to Charlottenlund. The western part climbs small hilltops, often with a beautiful view of the Trondheimsfjord. The eastern part is almost flat."
"There is lush vegetation along the track, with birch, pine, spruce, Rowan, alder, and hazel, the latter being very common in the western part of the track. In addition, sycamore maple, although not a part of the original flora, is rapidly spreading and is now among the most common trees. Further east, Statoils large research center at Rotvoll is easily spotted as the track continues east. Also at Rotvoll is the ""Leangen Manor"" (), including an English-inspired garden, with small water ponds and large deciduous trees (ash, elm, maple, oak). The manor is owned by Trondheim municipality and used for representational purposes."
"There are several beaches (mainly rocky or with pebbles) along Ladestien, some of the most popular are Ringvebukta (not far from Ringve Museum and botanical garden) and Djupvika; the latter includes a large lawn and volleyball net. Swimming in the fjord is indeed refreshing, although a water temperature of is fairly common during warm spells, and in warm summers water temperatures might reach .

= = = Hall of Worthies = = =
"The Hall of Worthies, or Jiphyeonjeon (; ), was a royal research institute set up by Sejong the Great of the Korean Joseon Dynasty in March 1420. Set up during the beginning of his reign, King Sejong staffed the Hall of Worthies with talented scholars and instructed them to conduct a variety of research activities to strengthen his rule and the nation. The Hall of Worthies is well-known for its role in compiling the Hunminjeongeum, the original treatise on Hangul."
"The Hall of Worthies originally served an advisory role to the king, and King Sejong restructured and expanded its role into an academic research institute. During the early part of King Sejong's reign, the Hall of Worthies served as a legislative system, but its role eventually grew to hold discussions regarding Joseon's national policy. The Hall of Worthies would also later act as an organ of press."
"The Hall of Worthies participated in various scholarly endeavors, one of which was compiling the Hunminjeongeum. Hangul was personally created by Sejong the Great, and revealed by him in 1443. Afterward, King Sejong wrote the preface to the Hunminjeongeum, explaining the origin and purpose of Hangul and providing brief examples and explanations, and then tasked the Hall of Worthies to write detailed examples and explanations. The head of the Hall of Worthies, Jeong In-ji, was responsible for compiling the Hunminjeongeum. The Hunminjeongeum was published and promulgated to the public in 1446."
"Confucianism ideals were very important to King Sejong, and he wanted his subjects to have a medium through which they could learn the ethics and morals of Confucianism. During his 14th year in power, King Sejong instructed his scholars at the Hall of Worthies to compile outstanding examples of the fundamental principles in human relationships (filial piety, loyalty to the state, and wifely devotion) from both Korean and Chinese history. This compilation of works would become the book ""Conduct of the Three Fundamental Principles in Human Relationships"" (Samgang Haengshildo, Hanja: 三綱行實圖, Hangul: 삼강행실도). Unfortunately, this work was originally recorded in Chinese characters, and thus, the general public could not read it until it was translated into hangul some 30 years later."
"Besides contributing to the Hunminjeongeum and publishing the Samgang Haengshildo, the Hall of Worthies was involved in publication of numerous scholarly and scientific writings, which contributed to reputation of Sejong's reign as the golden age of Korean culture."
"The Hall of Worthies was disbanded by King Sejo () after many of its members (notably the six martyred ministers) plotted to assassinate Sejo in 1456, following the latter's usurpation of the throne from King Danjong. However, a similar organization, the Hongmungwan (), Office of Special Advisors, continued much of the same work, though without enjoying the same prestige or output it had during the earlier period."

= = = Eolith = = =
"An eolith (from Greek """"eos"""", dawn, and """"lithos"""", stone) is a chipped flint nodule. Eoliths were once thought to have been artifacts, the earliest stone tools, but are now believed to be geofacts (stone fragments produced by fully natural geological processes such as glaciation)."
"The first eoliths were collected in Kent by Benjamin Harrison, an amateur naturalist and archaeologist, in 1885 (though the name ""eolith"" was not coined until 1892, by J. Allen Browne). Harrison's discoveries were published by Sir Joseph Prestwich in 1891, and eoliths were generally accepted to have been crudely made tools, dating from the Pliocene. Further discoveries of eoliths in the early 20th century – in East Anglia by J. Reid Moir and in continental Europe by Aimé Louis Rutot and H. Klaatsch – were taken to be evidence of human habitation of those areas before the oldest known fossils. The English finds helped to secure acceptance of the hoax remains of Piltdown man."
"Because eoliths were so crude, concern began to be raised that they were indistinguishable from the natural processes of erosion. Marcellin Boule, a French archaeologist, published an argument against the artifactual status of eoliths in 1905, and Samuel Hazzledine Warren provided confirmation of Boule's view after carrying out experiments on flints."
"Although the debate continued for about three decades, more and more evidence was discovered that suggested a purely natural origin for eoliths. This, together with the discovery of genuine early Lower Pleistocene Oldowan tools in East Africa, made support for the artifact theory difficult to sustain."
"Virginia City is a 1940 American Western film directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Errol Flynn, Miriam Hopkins, Randolph Scott, and a mustachioed Humphrey Bogart in the role of the real-life outlaw John Murrell. Based on a screenplay by Robert Buckner, the film is about a Union officer who escapes from a Confederate prison and is sent to Virginia City from where his former prison commander is planning to send five million dollars in gold to Virginia to save the Confederacy. The film premiered in its namesake, Virginia City, Nevada. The film was shot in black and white (sepiatone)."
"Union officer Kerry Bradford (Errol Flynn) stages a daring escape from Confederate Libby Prison run by the commandant, Vance Irby (Randolph Scott). Bradford reports to Union headquarters and is immediately sent to Virginia City, a Nevada mining town, to find out where $5,000,000 in gold that Southern sympathizers plan to ship to the tottering Confederacy is being kept. On the westbound stagecoach, he meets and falls in love with the elegant Julia Hayne (Miriam Hopkins), who unbeknownst to him is in fact a dance-hall entertainer — and a rebel spy, sent by Jefferson Davis (Charles Middleton) to assist in the transfer of the gold by wagon train. Also on the stagecoach is the legendary John Murrell (Humphrey Bogart), leader of a gang of ""banditos"", traveling as a gun salesman. Before he and his gang can rob the stage, Bradford gets the drop on Murrell, who is forced to send his men away."
"When the stage reaches Virginia City, Julia gives Bradford the slip and heads off to warn Captain Irby, who is now managing the gold-smuggling operation, that Bradford is in town. Bradford follows Irby to the rebels' hideout behind a false wall in a blacksmith's shop, but the gold is moved before he arrives. The Union garrison is called out to patrol the roads to prevent any wagons from leaving town."
"While Irby is meeting with the sympathetic town doctor, Murrell shows up looking for someone to set his broken arm. Irby offers Murrell $10,000 to have his banditos attack the garrison, which will force the Union soldiers guarding the roads to come to its defense. While the soldiers are busy, Irby's rebels will smuggle the gold out in the false bottoms of their wagons. First Irby needs to take care of Bradford. He uses Julia to arrange a meeting between the two men, and then takes Bradford prisoner, intending to return him to prison."
"The rebels' caravan is stopped at a small Union outpost. At first, they are allowed to proceed, but after watching the bullion-laden wagons have difficulty moving through the soft dirt, the soldiers become suspicious and attempt to inspect the wagons. The Southerners start a firefight, killing the soldiers. In the confusion, Bradford escapes. Pursued closely by Irby and his men, he rides his horse down a steep incline and ends up somersaulting down the hill. The rebels, believing him dead, continue toward Texas. Bradford returns to the outpost and sends a telegraph to the garrison. Major Drewery (Douglass Dumbrille), the garrison commander, arrives with a contingent of cavalry. Drewery, who is scornful of Bradford as a soldier, does not take his advice and ends up following a false trail, causing the pursuit to fall ever further behind the rebels, who are themselves fighting thirst, privation, and the unforgiving terrain. Bradford is able to persuade Drewery to allow him to take a small detachment to follow his hunch."
"Bradford and his men catch up with the caravan which is trapped in a canyon and being attacked by Murrell's banditos who are attempting to take the gold. Irby is wounded in the gunfight, but Bradford's superior military skills and the rebels' long guns eventually drive off the banditos. Before he dies, Irby delegates command of the caravan and its gold to Bradford. During the night, knowing that in the morning both Murrell's men and Drewery's command will arrive, Bradford takes the gold from the wagons and buries it in the canyon to prevent its capture."
"Drewery and his men arrive in the morning in time to crush the outlaws' renewed attack, and Murell is killed. Bradford refuses to disclose the gold's location and is brought up on charges in a court-martial. He defends his action in that, ""as a soldier"", he knew the gold might have been used to win the war for the South and prevented that, but ""as a man"" he knows it belongs to the South and he would prefer that it be used to rebuild the South's shattered economy and wounded pride after the war. The court finds him guilty of high treason and sentences him to death on April 9, 1865."
"The day before Bradford's scheduled execution, Julia meets with Abraham Lincoln (Victor Kilian, seen only in silhouette) and pleads for Bradford's life. Lincoln reveals that at that very moment, Generals Lee and Grant are meeting at Appomattox Courthouse to end the war. As the war is over, and in a symbol of the reconciliation between North and South, Lincoln pardons Bradford in the spirit of his second inaugural address, ""With malice toward none; with charity for all..."""
"The film was a follow up to ""Dodge City"" although it has entirely new characters and was not a sequel, predating it by eight years in historical time. It was originally called ""Nevada"" and was to star basically the same director and cast as ""Dodge City"": Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Ann Sheridan, Donald Crisp, Guinn Williams, and Alan Hale. The title was eventually changed to ""Virginia City"", which had been owned by RKO, but they agreed to give it to Warners."
"De Havilland dropped out and was replaced by Brenda Marshall. However, within a few weeks, Miriam Hopkins replaced her. Randolph Scott was hired to play Flynn's antagonist. Victor Jory was going to play the main villain, but had a scheduling conflict due to his appearance in ""Light of Western Stars"". He was replaced by Humphrey Bogart, requiring ""It All Came True"" to be pushed back."
"There was six weeks' filming based in Flagstaff, Arizona."
The film was given a gala premiere in Reno and Virginia City.
"Frank Nugent of ""The New York Times"", despite criticizing the acting talents of Flynn and Hopkins, wrote that ""there is enough concentrated action in [""Virginia City""], enough of the old-time Western sweep, to make it lively entertainment""."
"""Filmink"" magazine called it ""a big, expensive, noisy movie which aims for size and spectacle over, say, suspense and thrills – I don’t think director Michael Curtiz was any more excited by Westerns than Flynn, but both do professional jobs, as does Scott."""

"Born in the Mississippi city of Holly Springs, Vendig created ""The Edge of Night"" for Procter and Gamble Productions and CBS Daytime in 1956. He had been a writer on the ""Perry Mason"" radio show and when Erle Stanley Gardner refused to allow the show to become a soap opera, Vendig refashioned the show into ""The Edge of Night"", and brought actor John Larkin, who played Mason on the radio, to the show as series star Mike Karr. The character of Mike's daughter, Laurie Ann Karr, was named for Vendig's daughter Laurie Ann."
"Vendig was the series' head writer from 1956 until 1960, then co-head writer with James Gentile from 1960 until 1965. Vendig was credited on-air as series' creator until his departure from the daytime drama in 1965."

= = = Variable capacitor = = =
"A variable capacitor is a capacitor whose capacitance may be intentionally and repeatedly changed mechanically or electronically. Variable capacitors are often used in L/C circuits to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a tuning capacitor or tuning condenser), or as a variable reactance, e.g. for impedance matching in antenna tuners."
"In mechanically controlled variable capacitors, the distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps, can be changed."
"The most common form arranges a group of semicircular metal plates on a rotary axis (""rotor"") that are positioned in the gaps between a set of stationary plates (""stator"") so that the area of overlap can be changed by rotating the axis. Air or plastic foils can be used as dielectric material."
"By choosing the shape of the rotary plates, various functions of capacitance vs. angle can be created, e.g. to obtain a linear frequency scale. Various forms of reduction gear mechanisms are often used to achieve finer tuning control, i.e. to spread the variation of capacity over a larger angle, often several turns."
"A vacuum variable capacitor uses a set of plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid in or out of an opposing set of cylinders (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor, it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high-powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio, as well as high-powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient; since the elements are under a vacuum, the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced."
"Allen Gamble and Terry ""Yankee Clipper"" Hoitz are both detectives of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Allen is a mild-mannered forensic accountant while Terry is a hot-tempered detective who has been partnered with Allen ever since he mistakenly shot Derek Jeter during the World Series. They receive no respect from the other officers, particularly detectives Martin and Fosse. All but Terry idolize cocky detectives Chris Danson and P. K. Highsmith, who are considered New York City's best policemen even though they frequently cause millions of dollars in property damage catching petty criminals. During a pursuit, Danson and Highsmith leap to their deaths after attempting to ""aim for the bushes"", which causes the precinct to wonder why they did it and who will take their place."
Allen and Terry investigate a scaffolding permit violation by multi-billionaire Sir David Ershon but wind up uncovering a much bigger plot by Ershon to cover the losses incurred by his client Lendl Global. Lendl CEO Pamela Boardman has hired a team of mercenaries led by Roger Wesley to make sure Ershon pays her back.
"During their investigation, Allen confides in Terry about how he ran a college dating service in his past, though he denies that he was ever a pimp. When they both get to Allen's house, Terry develops a slight crush on Allen's wife Sheila, while not believing she is truly with Allen because of her beauty. When they visit Allen's ex-girlfriend, Christinith, to gain their police evidence, she and her husband wants him to have sex with her. When Sheila tells Allen that she is pregnant, he reverts to his dark personality, which has her kick him out of their house. Meanwhile, Terry unsuccessfully attempts to reconnect with his ex-fiancée Francine, who had walked out on him due to his furious attitude."
"Their investigation comes to a halt when Ershon's attorney, Don Beaman, learns of Ershon's plan to cover his losses, leading Wesley to kill him and make it look like a suicide. Angered at their lack of progress, Capt. Gene Mauch splits up Allen and Terry, sending Terry to traffic duty and Allen to beat patrol. Despite Terry's anger, Allen still works the case on his own. After Allen learns that Danson and Highsmith died investigating a staged theft during which Wesley broke into an accounting firm next door, he finds credible evidence and earns his gun back from Mauch. Allen then convinces Terry to rejoin him. They meet Capt. Mauch at Bed Bath & Beyond, his second job, where the police captain admits he has been holding off on the case because Ershon has high-profile connections that could ruin him, and he allows them to finish the case off-the-books."
"They go to an investment meeting Ershon is having and realize that the $32 billion Ershon seeks is really coming from the NYPD pension fund. They escape with Ershon to his private apartment, and Ershon tells them that the money for the pension fund is already in his account, ready to be transferred. Later that night, Allen and Terry finally reconcile with their loved ones. Allen apologizes to Sheila with her mother as a secret communication system and so she welcomes her husband back in. Terry also apologizes to Francine for letting his anger rule his life."
"The next morning, they drive to the bank to stop the transfer, evading Wesley's team, groups of Chechen and Nigerian investors to whom Ershon owes money, and police officers who are told Allen and Terry have gone rogue. They reach the bank and halt the transfer. Wesley arrives, and as a delaying tactic, shoots both officers and Ershon in their arms. Mauch finally arrives with police backup, rescuing the two and arresting Ershon for his embezzlement, and Wesley for multiple counts of murder. Ershon's arrest leads to a stock market crash and the subsequent federal bailout of Lendl Global. Terry marries Francine, and Allen reunites with his wife. The narrator finishes off by stating that the true heroes are the everyday people who work to make a difference, not the ones who appear in the newspaper or on TV."

"Birds of the West Indies () is a book containing exhaustive coverage of the 400+ species of birds found in the Caribbean Sea, excluding the ABC islands, and Trinidad and Tobago, which are considered bio-geographically as part of South America."
"Written by ornithologist James Bond, the book was first published as ""A Field Guide to the Birds of the West Indies"" in 1936 by the Academy of Natural Sciences as part of the ""International Series"". It has been reprinted several times since then, including as one of the Peterson Field Guides series (PFG 18), a September 1, 1999, edition from Houghton Mifflin and a March 4, 2002 edition from Collins. The book contains approximately 256 pages."
"The book was the only text exclusively devoted to the avifauna of the region for many decades until ""A Guide to the Birds of the West Indies"" (), by Herbert Raffaele et al.., was published in 1998."
"""Birds of the West Indies"" was a book owned by novelist Ian Fleming, who used the ornithologist's name for his own fictional British secret agent character, Commander James Bond. Fleming, a keen bird watcher while living at his estate in Jamaica, owned this book. He later explained that the author's name was ""brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon, and yet very masculine – just what I needed."" Fleming once said in a ""Reader's Digest"" interview: ""I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, and 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure — an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department."" The book has since become a collector's item amongst Bond fans and was featured as an homage in the twentieth James Bond film, ""Die Another Day"", when Bond poses as an ornithologist while in Cuba. The final shot of the miniseries """" is of a copy of ""Birds of the West Indies"" next to Ian Fleming's typewriter."
= = = Large format lens = = =
Large format lenses are photographic optics that provide an image circle large enough to cover large format film or plates. Large format lenses are typically used in large format cameras and view cameras.
Photographic optics generally project a circular image behind the lens. On smaller format cameras the image circle generally covers only the intended film size with little room to spare. Large format lenses are an exception. For large format use the circular patch of image light usually extends beyond the minimum size circle needed to fully cover the rectangle of the film. The extra image offers room to spare to make use of camera movements that re-align the lens away from dead center on the film.
"Lenses of the same general construction are often given a name implying this design. For example, a Tessar always has four elements in three groups as described below, although Tessars have been produced with different focal lengths and maximum apertures for many decades. Sometimes a name does not identify a specific design; Kodak's Ektar lens brand name encompasses many different types. Sometimes different manufacturers use different names for lenses of the same type; for example the Voigtländer Skopar is of Tessar design. And sometimes identical lenses are sold under different names and at different prices; for example, lenses branded as Rodenstock and Caltar."
= = = Convoy HX 112 = = =
"HX 112 was a North Atlantic convoy of the HX series which ran during the battle of the Atlantic in the Second World War. It was notable in that it saw the loss of U-boats commanded by two of the Kriegsmarine's (KM) foremost U-boat aces, with ""Korvettenkapitän"" Otto Kretschmer (POW) and with ""Kapitänleutnant"" Joachim Schepke (KIA)."
"HX 112 was an east-bound convoy of ships which sailed from Halifax on 1 March 1941, making for Liverpool with war materials. Many of the ships in HX 112 were tankers carrying fuel oil to Britain."
"It was escorted by 5th Escort Group which consisted of two destroyers, and and two corvettes, and was led by Commander Donald Macintyre of HMS ""Walker"". 5th Escort Group was reinforced on this occasion by an additional two destroyers, in view of the importance of the cargo, and met the convoy as it entered the Western Approaches."
"On 15 March 1941 HX 112 was sighted by commanded by Fritz-Julius Lemp, who sent in a sighting report and commenced shadowing the convoy. He was joined throughout the day by four other boats; ""U-99"" (Kretschmer) ""U-100"" (Schepke) (Clausen) and (Kentrat)."
"On the night of 15th/16th the attack started; ""U-100"" was able to torpedo a tanker, which burst into flames, but survived to reach port; all other attacks that night were frustrated by the activities of the escorts."
"Keeping up with the convoy on the surface during the day, the pack tried again as night fell on the 16th."
"""U-99"" managed to penetrate the convoy from the north, on its port side, and sank four tankers and a freighter in under an hour. Remaining with the central column of the convoy she sank another freighter 15 minutes later before making her getaway."
"Meanwhile, the escorts, searching for U-boats outside the convoy perimeter, found ""U-100"" around 1.30am moving in on the surface. She dived, but ""Walker"" attacked with a depth charge pattern at close range. ""U-100"" evaded further damage, and surfaced, to be sighted and rammed by ""Vanoc"" just after 3am; Schepke was killed when ""Vanoc"" smashed into his periscope structure and ""U100"" went down with most of her crew."
"As this was happening, ""U-99"" was making her escape; she nearly collided with a destroyer in the dark and dived. Picked up on ASDIC by ""Walker"", she was depth-charged and severely damaged. Saving ""U-99"" from being crushed as she sank deeper and deeper, Kretschmer brought her to the surface, where she was fired on by the encircling warships. ""U-99"" was sunk, but Kretschmer and most of his crew were saved, to be taken prisoner."
There were no further attacks on HX.112 and the convoy arrived in Liverpool on 20 March.
"A total of 41 merchant vessels joined the convoy, either in Halifax or later in the voyage."
A series of armed military ships escorted the convoy at various times during its journey.
"HX.112 had lost six ships totalling 50,000 tons. However, the loss of two of the Kriegsmarine's U-boat aces, one of which was the highest scoring submarine commander of the Second World War, was a severe blow to the Kriegsmarine offensive. The defence of HX.112, coupled with the successful defence of Convoy OB 293 and the loss of U-boat ace Günther Prien along with his sub the previous week, marked a minor turning point in the Atlantic campaign."
= = = The Return of Count Yorga = = =
"The Return of Count Yorga (originally titled Yorga Returns) is a 1971 American vampire horror film directed by Bob Kelljan and starring Robert Quarry. It is the sequel to the 1970 film ""Count Yorga, Vampire""."
"The story features Quarry returning as the infamous vampire Count Yorga, along with his servant Brudah, both of whom have been revived by the supernatural Santa Ana winds. Actor Roger Perry, who had a lead role in the first film, appears again but as a different character."
"Cynthia Nelson (Mariette Hartley), a teacher at the local orphanage, talks with a pastor while watching the sun set before getting ready for a fundraising costume party. Cynthia mentions the ""Santa Ana winds"" which the pastor states are an evil omen. One of the orphans, Tommy (Philip Frame), wanders into the nearby cemetery where he faintly hears a voice ordering ""Rise, rise; it is time."" Tommy initially dismisses it, but as he stops to rest, vampire women rise from their graves. Seeing this, Tommy tries to escape the cemetery only to run into the clutches of Count Yorga (Robert Quarry), who is waiting for them."
"Sometime later, Yorga goes to the orphanage during their costume party and fund raiser. Biting one of the pretty guests, Mitzi (Jesse Welles), outside the event room before going inside and introducing himself to those present, among which is Cynthia whom he becomes infatuated with. When a weakened Mitzi stumbles into the room, he leaves as the others are attending to her. That night, he returns to his manor and a makeshift throne room overlooking several coffins, greeted by Brudda (Edward Walsh), Yorga's hulking facially disfigured valet, and the female vampires from earlier ready to do his bidding. Yorga sends the undead women to Cynthia's house, using mind-control to get Cynthia's family (along with Tommy, who was sleeping over) into the living room before his brides break in and attack them. The family is quickly overrun with Cynthia's mother, father and sister, Ellen (Karen Ericson), fed upon by the undead horde. Tommy is untouched, showcasing he is under Yorga's power while Cynthia herself is subdued, but unharmed and carried by the brides to Yorga's residence where she awakens. Due to Yorga's hypnotic suggestions, she has no memory of the attack. Yorga tells Cynthia that there was a car accident and she was left in his care by her family. He tries to charm the young woman into willingly becoming his bride, though he is warned by his live-in witch that Cynthia will bring his end if he does not kill her or turn her into a vampire soon."
"The next morning, Jennifer (Yvonne Wilder), the Nelsons' mute maid, finds the massacre scene and calls the police. However, as she does, Brudda drags the corpses of Cynthia's mother and father to a quicksand pit on Yorga's property, disposing of the physical evidence. By the time the police arrive though, all of the evidence has been mysteriously cleared away, and Tommy claims that nothing has happened. Despite the confusion, David Baldwin (Roger Perry), Cynthia's fiancé, is suspicious about the Nelsons' disappearance. Meanwhile, memories of the attack on her family slowly start to resurface in Cynthia's mind as she stays within Yorga's manor. Jennifer, suspicious about Tommy's involvement with the Nelson's disappearance and his visits to Yorga's mansion, loses her patience and slaps Tommy who stares at her in a vengeful manner. Meanwhile, Yorga goes to claim Mitzi, killing her boyfriend near their boat house before feeding on her once more, this time finishing draining her completely and adding her to his vampiric harem."
"Hours later, Ellen's fiancé Jason (David Lampson) is lured to Yorga's mansion by Tommy, on the claim that he found Ellen. Once at the mansion, Tommy disappears, while Jason is reunited with Ellen who has clearly been made into a vampire by Yorga. As she mocks him for ""not loving her anymore"" and soon starts laughing cruelly at him when he sense something wrong, her fellow brides attack Jason from behind. Jason breaks free, only to run into Count Yorga, who chases Jason down a hall and strangles him. Bruddah tosses Jason's body into the throne/coffin room for the brides, including Ellen and newly vampiric Mitzi, to feed upon."
"That evening, Reverend Thomas (Tom Toner) phones Jennifer, but it is revealed she lies dead on her bed with a large knife sticking out of her chest. From her window, Tommy can be seen walking away from the house. After Thomas learns (off camera) of Jennifer's death, David is sure he is correct about the Count's true nature and manages to convince Reverend Thomas and investigating police detectives Lt. Madden (Rudy De Luca) and Sgt. O'Connor (Craig T. Nelson) to join him in a rescue-mission at Yorga's mansion. Reverend Thomas is sent to distract Yorga while Baldwin, Madden and O'Connor sneak in to search the manor, armed with sticks they can cross and hold up to ward off the vampires. Meanwhile, the pastor falls for Yorga's charms and reveals the others' suspicions that he is a vampire, alerting Yorga of danger. Thomas is tricked into walking into the quicksand pit and promptly sinks to his death. Yorga returns to the manor, awakens his brides and unleashes them through the household as he psychically calls Cynthia to him."
"Baldwin splits from the detectives to expand the room-by-room search, and upon opening one door discovers Jason's corpse, covered in bloody bite marks with an IV draining remaining blood from his neck into a glass-bottle on the floor beneath him. Later, Baldwin finally finds the half-mind-controlled Cynthia and attempts to escape; however, he is nearly beaten by Brudda. Falling into a suit of armor, Baldwin grabs a metal mace and knocks Brudda out with a violent blow to the face."
"Meanwhile, Madden and O'Connor come across Yorga's vampire brides. When the women don't respond to their question and continue tho silently advance on them. the detectives attempt to shoot them point blank, but their bullets prove ineffective as the undead women continue to give chase. In the midst of their escape, they encounter Brudda and managed to shoot him to death. Eventually O'Connor is separated in the brides' throne/coffin room by a shutter and immediately attacked from behind and bitten by the witch (also a vampire) as Madden helplessly listens to O'Connor's death-screams. Madden tries to find a way to him, but lured in by a voice from the shadows (thinking it is Baldwin) and killed by Tommy who stabs him in the same way he murdered Jennifer."
"Baldwin and Cynthia are the only ones left alive, with Yorga supernaturally mocking Baldwin throughout the estate. Yorga seals their exit routes while his brides slowly close in on the two. They duck into a darken hallway, but when Baldwin turns on the lights, he finds himself confronted by all the brides (including Ellen and Mitzi) with Yorga behind them who calls Cynthia over to his side. Yorga takes her away preparing to transform her into a new bride, while leaving his army of brides to finish off Baldwin. He is about to take her when he hears Baldwin scream his name who seemingly have escaped the brides. Yorga takes Cynthia and flees to upper balcony of the estate as Baldwin (who grabs an iron battle-axe from a wall) chases the two. Yorga and Baldwin fight with Baldwin surprisingly seeming stronger than before, however Yorga gains the advantage. Just as he is about to kill Baldwin via choking, Cynthia's memories of the brides killing her family resurfaces, causing her to realize Yorga was responsible for their deaths. She strikes Yorga in the chest with Baldwin's battle-axe. With Yorga stunned by the action, Baldwin uses the moment to throw Yorga off the balcony, and he lies motionless on the pavement below, dead."
"Cynthia hugs Baldwin, believing the ordeal over. However, she notices something wrong and pulls away. To her horror, she sees that Baldwin skin has turned pale and bite marks on his face revealing he was has transformed into a vampire) having apparently not escaped from the brides unscathed). Cynthia tries to run from him, but Baldwin pulls her back and promptly bites her."
"The last shot of the movie is Tommy playing with his ball in front of the orphanage accompanied by a haunting rendition of the song the children sang at the beginning of the film. Though Yorga is dead, his evil lives on as those who know of him are either dead or turned into vampires and will carry out his curse. The film ends with the ominous implication that Cynthia has joined them, Baldwin now their new leader and the surviving vampires are resting within the manor, where they will proceed to spread the vampirisim to the unwitting orphanage and soon to the rest of the town."
"In one scene, Yorga is seen watching a Spanish-language version of ""The Vampire Lovers"" on his television."
"Highwire artist Nik Wallenda had been planning to walk across the canyon since 2008, but put the plan on hold first due to logistical difficulties and then to highwire walk over Niagara Falls in 2012. After his success at Niagara, he accelerated plans to cross the canyon. In March 2013, Wallenda and Discovery came to terms on television rights for the walk."
"To prepare, Wallenda practiced in his home town of Sarasota, Florida in heavy winds, including during Tropical Storm Andrea. On June 23, he successfully completed the walk without safety devices in approximately 23 minutes, making him the first person to tightrope walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge. At , it was the highest walk of his career. Afterwards, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected."
"""Skywire Live"" aired live in over 200 countries worldwide. It was a ratings success in the United States, generating Discovery's highest-ever rating for a live broadcast. The show also generated a lot of interest of social media, with Wallenda's public display of his Christian faith being a focal point."
"Nik Wallenda is American highwire artist and member of the famed Flying Wallendas circus family. He has been walking the wire since age two and now holds seven world records. In 2008, he set the record for highest and longest bicycle ride across a tightrope. In 2012, he became the first person to successfully tightrope walk directly over Niagara Falls. The feat aired live on ABC who, much to the dismay of Wallenda, decided at the last minute that he would have to wear a safety harness for the event."
"The Grand Canyon area has played host to a number of high-profile stunts and daredevil feats. In 1922, Royal Thomas flew a Lincoln Stanard biplane into Grand Canyon National Park, landing just from the Canyon's edge. The park did not yet have stunting regulations and the feat was approved by park superintendent Walter Crosby. In 1980, stuntman Dar Robinson drove a sportscar over the canyon's edge, parachuting out of the car as it fell. He did the stunt in Hualapai Indian Reservation after being denied a permit by the National Park. In 1999, daredevil Robbie Knievel jumped a narrow portion of canyon in Hualapai territory on a motorcycle, breaking his own world record for longest jump in the process. The event aired live on Fox News. In 2006, Bob Burnquist skateboarded off a ramp into the canyon, descending to the bottom with a parachute. In 2011, Yves ""Jetman"" Rossy used a custom made jet suit to glide above the Hualapai reservation for eight minutes. He covered a distance of before parachuting into the canyon."
"Nik Wallenda originally secured permits to walk across ""the Grand Canyon"" in 2008, and planned to make the trip as early as 2009. However, the walk was delayed due to substantial logistical hurdles. His agent, Winston Simone, commented ""There's no electricity [at the planned location], there's no hotels, and for the last half-hour there are no paved roads."" Additionally, at a then-estimated distance of , the feat would be the longest walk of Wallenda's career by a significant margin. When the opportunity to cross Niagara Falls arose, the Grand Canyon walk was put on hold. Shortly after crossing Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he would try to make the Grand Canyon crossing ""within a year"". In August 2012, he said that he was ""98 percent"" certain that the walk would take place in May or June 2013 and announced he would get ""something in writing"" that no safety harness would be required for the walk."
"On March 18, 2013, Wallenda announced that he had come to terms with The Discovery Channel for television rights. ABC also bid for the walk, but was concerned about the show being repetitive with the Niagara walk and was not prepared to pay as much as Discovery. Additionally, Discovery emphasized its international footprint and promised Wallenda that he would not have to wear a safety device. After he came to terms with Discovery, both Wallenda and his network partners had to finalize permits with the Navajo. According to a tribal spokesperson, the decision to allow the walk was not taken lightly. The process included archaeological, biological, and environmental impact studies."
"According to Wallenda, ""There's a lot of updrafts and downdrafts, and the winds are hard to predict [in the Canyon]"". The air temperature during the walk was expected to exceed , with the steel cable hitting . To prepare, Wallenda walked a wire twice daily along the banks of a Sarasota river with fans watching. He practiced with wind machines to simulate wind gusts up to . During Tropical Storm Andrea he practiced among wind gusts and heavy rain. Wallenda said it was ""hard to prepare for [the updrafts] ... when it comes down to Mother Nature, we’re not in control."" His highwire shoes, which are custom made by his mother, had elk-skin bottoms to counteract the heat."
"On June 19, Discovery aired a special episode of ""MythBusters"" titled ""Duct Tape Canyon"" to coincide with Wallenda's walk. On the episode, Wallenda appears to the show's team as a hallucination as they attempt to survive in the desert using only duct tape."
"On June 23, 2013, Wallenda highwire walked across the Little Colorado River Gorge in the Navajo Tribal Park. The location was outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders, about 40 miles east of the main tourist facilities. In its official press release, Discovery previewed the feat ""Nik Wallenda ... will traverse the majestic Grand Canyon"". Other interpretations of whether or not the location was part of the Grand Canyon varied. The Reuters news agency described the location as simply ""the Grand Canyon"", while the Associated Press described it as a ""gorge near the Grand Canyon."" Commentary by ""Forbes"" writer Andrew Bender said there was ""one problem"" with the walk – ""It [wasn't] at the Grand Canyon"". He did, however, say the risks were as real and the visuals as spectacular at the location. ""National Geographic"" described the location as ""the Grand Canyon"" but noted that, like previous ""Grand Canyon"" stunts, it was taking place outside the park's borders."
"According to the United States Geological Survey, the Grand Canyon geological area includes the Little Colorado River Gorge. A Grand Canyon National Park spokesperson said the walk ""would not have been approved"" to take place in the Park due to regulations that ""events must not unreasonably impair the park’s atmosphere of peace and tranquility or have an unacceptable impact on the experience of park visitors."""
"The event, entitled ""Skywire Live"", aired live on the Discovery Channel in 219 countries with a 10-second delay. Coverage began with an hour-and-ten-minute preshow, followed by an hour-and-ten-minute main event. It was produced by Peacock Productions and hosted by Natalie Morales and Willie Geist. During the event, viewers were able to select from five different camera angles online at SkywireLive.com, including one attached to his chest that faced straight down. Another camera attached to Wallenda faced straight ahead, and a film crew filmed from the bottom of the Canyon."
"Before the walk started, Wallenda and his family prayed with evangelist and family friend Joel Osteen. He was then helicoptered to an island in the middle of the canyon to start his journey. To limit environmental impact, the event was not open to the public. Members of the press were required to sign a waiver saying they would not sue for post-traumatic stress disorder in the event that Wallenda fell. An armed security guard was positioned at the bottom of the canyon to protect his body from animals."
"As the walk began at 7:38pm MDT, Wallenda realized the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. He spat on his hands and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying ""Help me to relax, Lord"", ""God, you’re so good. Thank you for this opportunity, Lord"", and ""Thank you, Jesus."" Midway through he said ""Thank you Lord. Thank you for calming that cable, God"". Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge."
"At , the walk was the highest of Wallenda's career, about seven times as high as the Niagara crossing. He covered a distance of approximately in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, using wire. He carried a balancing pole weighing . Wallenda said it was important for him to vary his pace throughout the walk to prevent resonance effects. Terry and Mike Troffer were his safety coordinator and chief engineer, respectively, for the event."
"Commenting on the walk, a Navajo spokesman said, ""We are honored to be a part of this historic event and showcase the beauty that exists on Navajo country,"" and said he expected the event to boost tourism. Tribal president Ben Shelly said he was grateful for the publicity. ""It’s exposing what a beautiful land we have"", he said. ""Another nation exists, and it's the Navajo Nation."" However, a group of Navajo and other Native Americans protested the event saying the tribe should not be promoting the risking of human life to promote tourism. The Navajos did not charge for the use of the site, but Discovery did pay for the paving of a new road and parking lot to accommodate spectators."
"After the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected and that ""it took every bit of me to stay focused"". He said that dust had accumulated in his contact lenses and called the walk unusually stressful. Additionally, he said an ""optical illusion"" made it hard to concentrate. However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity ""was a dream come true."""
"""Skywire Live With Nik Wallenda"" drew an average of 10.7 million viewers in the United States, making it the highest rated program of the night. It beat out NBC's ""Crossing Lines"" (4.4 million viewers) and CBS's ""60 Minutes"" (8.2 million) among other offerings. Viewership increased steadily throughout the program, with a spike as the walk itself began."
"During the walk, 13 million people were tuned in. Those numbers made ""Skywire Live"" the highest rated live program in Discovery's history, easily beating the 4.21 million people who watched Felix Baumgartner's skydive in October 2012, and third-highest overall. The 4.77 share during the actual walk was also the highest in company history. Pre-coverage of the walk also pulled in high numbers, attracting 6.25 million viewers. ""Naked and Afraid"" which debuted after ""Skywire"" attracted 4.16 million viewers. Overall, Discovery had its fourth highest-ranked night ever."
"Online coverage attracted 2.1 million viewers, and tweets hit 40,000 per minute. During the peak hour, the program had 648,000 mentions on Twitter. Additionally, Shark Week and #SnuffyTheSeal trended nationally after a commercial for Shark Week featuring a fictional seal named Snuffy aired during ""SkyWire"". Overall, the show won 71% of TV-related social media usage for the day."
"To capitalize on the program's success, Discovery aired a follow-up interview, ""Skywire: Nik Talks the Walk"", on June 30. In the special, Wallenda provided commentary on his walk as the entire 23 minute feat was replayed."
"Commentary by Sally Jenkins published by the ""Washington Post"" called Wallenda ""The ultimate athlete, free of all law except gravity ... Beyond criticism. Committing a pointless act — yet praying."" Jenkins remarked ""We thought daredevils were gone — too much science had reduced them to the predictable ... But along has come this new breed."" Comparing Wallenda and Baumgartner's record skydive that also aired on Discovery, she speculated that the emergence of online media combined with ""stale, stupid predictability"" of television shows has led the re-emergence of interest in daredevil activity. She concluded ""Wallenda’s meaningless act restored the meaning of real."" ""The Telegraph""'s Ben Fogle declared ""I have never felt such fear for another person ... I have a new superhero: not a superman with a cape, but a slightly tubby dad in jeans and a T-shirt."""
"On social media, Wallenda's prominent display of his faith was the most popular topic. Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch tweeted ""Evangelism via entertainment on a tightrope and a major cable network. Brilliant."" In contrast comedian and noted atheist Ricky Gervais poked fun saying ""Well done Jesus for getting that bloke across the Grand Canyon safely. I bet he feels silly for wasting so much time practicing now."" Actor Dean Norris remarked ""Regardless of religious belief or not,feel little happier bout life then had #wallenda kept saying thank you nihilists, life is meaningless."" Interviewing Joel Osteen after Wallenda's walk, Piers Morgan called the event ""an advertisement for the power of prayer and Christianity in America""."
"Blue jeans manufacture Buffalo David Bitton was surprised that Wallenda wore a pair of their jeans for the walk. To celebrate, they erected a billboard showing a picture of the walk and reading ""Dear Nik, Thanks for taking us to new heights. Buffalo David Bitton."" The company also offered Wallenda and his immediate family free jeans for the rest of their lives."

= = = Fordcroft Anglo-Saxon cemetery = = =
"Fordcroft Anglo-Saxon cemetery was a place of burial. It is located in the town of Orpington in South East London, South-East England. Belonging to the Middle Anglo-Saxon period, it was part of the much wider tradition of burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England. Fordcroft was a mixed inhumation and cremation ceremony."
"Archaeologists affiliated with the local Orpington Museum began excavating in 1965, expecting to find evidence of Romano-British occupation, but after discovering the cemetery decided to focus on it. Excavation continued for four seasons, ending in 1968."
"The site was located in Orpington, close to the border with St. Mary Cray. It sits between Bellefield Road and Poverest Road, near to the junction with the A224 road. The source of the River Cray lies half a mile south of the cemetery, while the river itself passes by 200 metres away from the site. The plot of land on which it was discovered was 1/8 of an acre in size. The soil is largely brick-earth, resting on the Flood Plain gravel which covers the valley floor."
"The nearest settlement that is known to be long-established is the farmstead of Poverest, the name of which can be traced to the early-14th century."
"The area remained agricultural land lying between the two villages until the mid-19th century, when increasing development led to the area becoming suburban. Several Victorian cottages had been built atop the cemetery, but were demolished during the following century, when the site became ""overgrown with weeds and littered with rubbish"" prior to excavation."
"With the advent of the Anglo-Saxon period in the fifth century CE, the area that became Kent underwent a radical transformation on a political, social, and physical level. In the preceding era of Roman Britain, the area had been administered as the ""civitas"" of ""Cantiaci"", a part of the Roman Empire, but following the collapse of Roman rule in 410 CE, many signs of Romano-British society began to disappear, replaced by those of the ascendant Anglo-Saxon culture. Later Anglo-Saxon accounts attribute this change to the widescale invasion of Germanic language tribes from northern Europe, namely the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Archaeological and toponymic evidence shows that there was a great deal of syncretism, with Anglo-Saxon culture interacting and mixing with the Romano-British culture."
"The Old English term ""Kent"" first appears in the Anglo-Saxon period, and was based on the earlier Celtic-language name ""Cantii"". Initially applied only to the area east of the River Medway, by the end of the sixth century it also referred to areas to the west of it. The Kingdom of Kent was the first recorded Anglo-Saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record, and by the end of the sixth century, it had become a significant political power, exercising hegemony over large parts of southern and eastern Britain. At the time, Kent had strong trade links with Francia, while the Kentish royal family married members of Francia's Merovingian dynasty, who were already Christian. Kentish King Æthelberht was the overlord of various neighbouring kingdoms when he converted to Christianity in the early seventh century as a result of Augustine of Canterbury and the Gregorian mission, who had been sent by Pope Gregory to replace England's pagan beliefs with Christianity. It was in this context that the Polhill cemetery was in use."
"Kent has a wealth of Early Medieval funerary archaeology. The earliest excavation of Anglo-Saxon Kentish graves was in the 17th century, when antiquarians took an increasing interest in the material remains of the period. In the ensuing centuries, antiquarian interest gave way to more methodical archaeological investigation, and prominent archaeologists like Bryan Faussett, James Douglas, Cecil Brent, George Payne, and Charles Roach Smith ""dominated"" archaeological research in Kent."
"The Fordcroft cemetery contained a mixture of cremation and inhumation burials. The two forms of burial were interspersed within the cemetery, leading excavators to believe that they were contemporary with each other. Archaeologists have discovered a total of 19 cremations and 52 inhumations from the site. Due to the grave goods found at the site, Tester suggested that the site was probably active as a place of burial between ""circa"" 450 and 550 CE. He noted that culturally, the artefacts and forms of burial were similar to those found around the Thames Valley."
"There is evidence of nearby Romano-British occupation, which numismatic evidence shows extended to at least ""c"". 370. and Tester suggested that the Anglo-Saxons might have intentionally adopted Fordcroft as a cemetery site because of this. Equally, he thought it possible that the reuse of the site was simply fortuitous."
"Many of the skeletons were heavily decayed, although in many cases the teeth and long bones were sufficiently preserved for osteoarchaeologists to determine the age and sex of the individual."
"Most of the inhumation graves had the head facing westward, though in some cases they instead faced south. Most of the grave cuts were roughly rectangular with rounded corners, but some were less regular in form."
"Due to 19th century construction on the site, it was impossible for the archaeologists to accurately determine where the Anglo-Saxon ground level had been, and therefore how deep the graves had been cut."
"In the 1940s, a service trench had been excavated in the adjacent Bellefield Road by workmen, who revealed pieces of Romano-British pottery. Archaeologist A. Eldridge published this discovery in the ""Archaeologia Cantiana"" journal, suggesting that there might have been a building dating to Roman Britain nearby. In the 1960s, local archaeologists decided to test this theory by investigating the derelict site at Fordcroft following the demolition of the houses on that site. Test excavation took place at the site from July 1965, sponsored by Orpington Museum, under the authority of the London Borough of Bromley, to whom the site legally belonged. The borough council provided a mechanical digger to remove surface rubble, allowing excavation to commence. Much of the investigation was organised by M. Bowen, curator of Orpington Museum, where the site finds were initially stored."
"The first archaeological discoveries at the site were Romano-British in origin, although no evidence of buildings from this period were discovered. Soon, an Anglo-Saxon cremation urn was found, followed by several inhumations, revealing that this had been the site of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. Thenceforth, the excavation of the cemetery became the primary objective of the archaeologists. In the first two-seasons' work, 16 cremations and 29 inhumations were discovered. At the time of its discovery, it was recognised as the first ""well-authenticated"" archaeological evidence for Anglo-Saxon settlement along the River Cray. Elderly members of the community who had formerly lived in the cottages on the site visited the excavation, providing ""likely and amusing comments"" following the revelation that they had dwelt above a cemetery."
"A test pit was opened in the garage of No. 17 Poverest Road, uncovering another grave, and it is believed that further burials might be located under the house. The team excavated all available areas, although were unable to dig under either of the roads enclosing the site, or under the houses to the east and west."
= = = Battle of Apros = = =
"The Battle of Apros occurred between the forces of the Byzantine Empire, under co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos, and the forces of the Catalan Company, at Apros on July 1305."
"The Catalan Company had been hired by the Byzantines as mercenaries against the Turks, but despite the Catalans' successes against the Turks, the two allies distrusted each other, and their relationship was strained by the Catalans' financial demands. Eventually, Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and his son and co-ruler Michael IX had the Catalan leader, Roger de Flor, assassinated with his entourage in April 1305."
"In July, the Byzantine army, comprising a large contingent of Alans as well as many Turcopoles, confronted the Catalans and their own Turkish allies near Apros in Thrace. Despite the Imperial Army's numerical superiority, the Alans withdrew after the first charge, whereupon the Turcopoles deserted ""en block"" to the Catalans. Prince Michael was injured and left the field and the Catalans won the day."
"The Catalans proceeded to ravage Thrace for two years, before moving west and south through Greece, to conquer the Latin Duchy of Athens in 1311."

"The controller itself is shaped like an ""M"" (similar to a Gamecube controller). Players hold onto the sides of the controller and the part that dips down in the middle contains the battery pack. There are six buttons on the controller (A, B, Start, Select, L, and R), two D-pads, and the system's ""on/off"" switch. The two directional pads are located on either side of the controller at the top. The ""A"" and ""B"" buttons are located below the pad on the right side and the ""Start"" and ""Select"" buttons are located in the same spot on the left side. What would normally be called ""shoulder buttons"" (""L"" and ""R"") are located behind the area where the pads are, on the back of the controller, functioning more as triggers."
"In more traditional 2-dimensional games, the two directional pads are interchangeable. For others with a more 3D environment, like ""Red Alarm"", ""3D Tetris"", or ""Teleroboxer"", each pad controls a different feature. The symmetry of the controller also allows left-handed gamers to reverse the controls (similar to the Atari Lynx)."
"One of the unique features of the controller is the extendable power supply that slides onto the back. It houses the six AA batteries required to power the system. This can be substituted with a wall adapter, though a ""slide on"" attachment is required for the switchout. Once the slide on adapter is installed, a power adapter can be attached to provide constant power."
"During development, Nintendo promised the ability to link systems for competitive play. The system's EXT (extension) port, located on the underside of the system below the controller port, was never officially supported since no ""official"" multiplayer games were ever published, nor was an official link cable released. (Although ""Waterworld"" and ""Faceball"" were going to use the EXT port for multiplayer play, the multiplayer features in the former were removed and the latter was canceled.)"

= = = Nintendo 64 technical specifications = = =
"This article describes the processor, memory, and other components of the 1996 Nintendo 64 home video game console. It then goes on to explain the specs of the Nintendo 64's components in more detail, and details the sub components therein."
"The Nintendo 64's central processing unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300, a licensed variant of the 64-bit MIPS Technologies R4300i, itself a cost-reduced derivative of the MIPS R4200. Built by NEC on a 350 nm process, the VR4300 is a RISC 5-stage scalar in-order execution processor, internal 24 KB direct-mapped L1 cache (16 KB for instructions, 8 KB for data). Although a floating-point unit exists as a logical coprocessor, there is no dedicated physical FPU datapath on the VR4300; instead, the integer pipeline is shared for this purpose, meaning that floating-point instructions will stall the pipeline. The 4.6 million transistor CPU is cooled passively by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above."
"With a clock rate of 93.75 MHz, the N64's VR4300 is generally considered to be the most powerful console CPU of the fifth generation of video game consoles. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retains the computational abilities of the 64-bit MIPS R4200, though few titles take advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. N64 game titles generally use faster and more compact 32-bit data-operations, as these are sufficient to generate 3D scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space, which came at a premium with contemporary technology. The CPU is constrained by a 562.5 MB/s bus to the system RAM, and in order to access the RAM, the CPU must go through the Reality Coprocessor (RCP), and can not use DMA to do so as the RCP can. This issue is further compounded by the RDRAM's high access latency."
"Programs emulating the Nintendo 64 benefit from the scarcity of 64-bit operations in the game's executable code, especially when running with a 32-bit machine architecture as a host. Most of these emulators perform the majority of calculations at 32-bit precision and trap the few subroutines that actually make use of 64-bit instructions."
"Nintendo 64's graphics and audio duties are performed by the 64-bit SGI coprocessor, named the Reality Coprocessor, or RCP. The RCP is a 62.5 MHz chip split internally into two major components, the Reality Display Processor (RDP) and the Reality Signal Processor (RSP). Each area communicates with the other by way of a 128-bit internal data bus that provides 1.0 GB/s of bandwidth. The RSP is a MIPS R4000-based 128-bit integer vector processor. It is programmable through microcode, allowing the chip's functions to be significantly altered by each software title if necessary, to allow for different types of work, precision, and workloads. A number of microcodes were provided by Nintendo, while a few companies, such as Rare and Factor 5, would later develop their own microcodes. The RSP performs transform, clipping and lighting calculations, and triangle setup. The Reality Display Processor is primarily the Nintendo 64's pixel rasterizer, and also handles the console's Z-buffer compute."
"The RCP was developed by SGI's Nintendo Operations department, led by engineer Dr. Wei Yen (who later founded ArtX in 1997). The RCP was manufactured by NEC, using its 350 nm 3LM CMOS process, which NEC had introduced in 1994. The processor contains 2.6million transistors manufactured using this process. The processor has a size of 81 mm², giving it a transistor density of over 32,000 per square mm."
"Instead of a discrete sound processor, the RSP frequently performs audio functions, although the CPU can be tasked with this as well. It can play back most types of audio (dependent on software codecs) including uncompressed PCM, MP3, MIDI, and tracker music. The RSP is theoretically capable of a maximum of 100 channels of PCM at a time, but only in a case where all system resources are devoted to audio. It has a maximum sampling rate of 48 kHz with 16-bit audio. In practice, however, storage limitations caused by the ROM cartridge format limit the audio size and thus quality. Some game titles are designed for higher quality audio when storage expansions are available, as with ""F-Zero X Expansion Kit""."
"The RDP performs rasterization, converting images into raster format before output to the display. The RCP also provides the CPU's access to main system memory via a 562.5 MB/s bus. Unfortunately, this link does not allow direct memory access for the CPU. The RCP, like the CPU, is passively cooled by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above."
"The final major component in the system is the random-access memory, or RAM. Following its design heritage in SGI supercomputing, the Nintendo 64 implemented a unified memory architecture (UMA), instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video, as seen on its competitors. The RAM itself consists of 4.5 megabytes (0.5 MB for anti-aliasing) of Rambus RDRAM, fabricated by NEC. System RAM is expandable to a total of 9 MB with the Expansion Pak. The RAM has a 9-bit data bus at 250 MHz; as RDRAM transfers data at both the rising and falling edge of the signal (a technique also known as DDR), it provides the system with 562.5 MB/s peak bandwidth, shared between CPU and RCP."
"Rambus technology was quite new at the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth at a relatively low cost. The narrow bus makes board design easier and cheaper than the higher width data buses required for high bandwidth out of slower-clocked RAM types (such as VRAM or EDO DRAM); this way, the N64 mainboard could be designed with only 2 layers. However, RDRAM, at the time, came with a very high access latency. The combination of high bandwidth and high latency meant that significant effort was required from developers to achieve optimal results. Early N64 revisions use two 18 Mbit RAM chips; in ca. 1998 these were replaced with a single 36 Mbit chip, same as was used on the Expansion Pak."
"The Nintendo 64 Game Pak ROM cartridges are much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges as if they are additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers of many games, such as Nintendo EAD's ""Super Mario 64"" or Factor 5's ""Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine""."
"The system allows for video output in two formats: composite video and S-Video. This is accomplished through the proprietary ""MULTI OUT"" connector on the rear of the system, which was carried over from the SNES and later reused on the GameCube. Although the digital-to-analog converter chip used in early models had the capability to produce RGB video, it was not connected by default for this purpose, and later revisions lacked the pin connections for this purpose entirely."
"The system came bundled with a composite cable (labeled Stereo A/V cable by Nintendo). Available separately (and included with the system in the UK) were a RF modulator and switch set (for connection to older televisions) and an official S-Video cable, although the latter was only sold at retail stores in Japan. In the U.S., the official S-Video cable could only be ordered direct from Nintendo of America, while in PAL territories, no S-Video cable was officially sold altogether. Furthermore, Nintendo omitted several components from the S-Video signal path in PAL consoles, meaning that using an unmodified NTSC S-Video cable will result in an overbright, garish image, or no image at all."

= = = Coucher de soleil no. 1 = = =
"Coucher de soleil no. 1 (also called Landscape, Paysage, Landschap, or Sunset No. 1) is an oil painting created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956). ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" is a work executed in a mosaic-like Divisionist style with a Fauve palette. The reverberating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light at the core of Neo-Impressionist color theory."
"""Coucher de soleil"" was exhibited in Paris during the spring of 1907 at the Salon des Indépendants (n. 3457), along with ""Bacchante"" and four other works by Metzinger."
"The painting had been in the collection of Helene Kröller-Müller since 1921 or prior, now in the collection of the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands."
"""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 72.5 x 100 cm (28.5 by 39.25 in), signed ""J.Metzinger"" (lower right), and titled on the verso ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"". Also on the verso is another painting by Metzinger representing a river scene with ships."
"The work represents two nude women relaxing in a lush Mediterranean landscape with semi-tropical vegetation, hills, trees, a body of water and a radiating setting sun beyond. The plants to the lower left resemble the agave, a species found in the south of France, Spain and Greece. ""Agave"" is also the name of three characters in Greek mythology:"
The two nudes appear to play a secondary role in the overall composition due to their small size. But their prominent location in the foreground and the provocative nature of public nudity propels them to a position that cannot be ignored.
"In this luscious setting—as in ""Luxe, Calme et Volupté"" by Henri Matisse—Metzinger makes use all the colors in the spectrum of visible light. Unlike Matisse's work, Metzinger's brushstrokes are large, forming a mosaic-like lattice of squares or cubes of similar size and shape throughout, juxtaposed in a wide variety of angles relative to one another, creating an overall rhythm that would otherwise not be present."
"Evidence suggests that this work was completed prior to Metzinger's paintings entitled ""La danse (Bacchante)"" or ""Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape"": (1) there exists an oil on canvas study of the latter dated circa 1905-1906, located at the University of Iowa with the title ""Two Nudes in a garden"", 91.4 x 63.8 cm with a similar radiating sun above the bathers. (2) The brushstrokes are smaller in size consistent with Metzinger's style of late 1905. (3) In 1906 and 1907 Metzinger's brushstrokes became larger and more organized, structured within a highly geometrized framework already proto-Cubist in appearance. (4) As its name implies, ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" might have been the first in a series of sunsets. Though no other works by Metzinger are known by the titles ""Coucher de soleil no. 2"" or ""No. 3"", the artist did produce other works with sunsets during the same period: ""Landscape with Fountain"", for example, an oil on canvas measuring 53.3 x 73.6 cm; ""Paysage pointilliste"", 1906-07, an oil on canvas measuring 54.5 x 73 cm; ""Matin au Parc Montsouris"", ca. 1906, oil on canvas, 49.9 x 67.7 cm; or even ""La tour de Batz au coucher de soleil"", 54 x 73 cm, an oil on canvas ca. 1905."
"Indeed, these clues would seem to suggest ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" was painted during the later months of 1905, or early 1906, just before Metzinger and Robert Delaunay began painting portraits of one another, rather than circa 1908 as indicated by the Kröller-Müller Museum."
"The Fauves (many of whom would become Cubists), were heavily influenced by Neo-Impressionism, calling upon rational and scientific thought and creating highly abstract visions with the goal of producing the effects of real color-light. Mechanical brushwork suppressed the personality of the artist in an act of conspicuous defiance against the Impressionists. The Symbolists too would strip away the casual and accidental features of reality, revealing the true 'essence of form.' Whether such a revelation could be backed up by a scientific theory or not, there were still examples that could be codified. The problem was that pigments ""reflect"" light, they are not a light source themselves. Colors in the spectra of light did not respond in the same way as color pigments painted on canvas. For example, red and blue light rays result in white light, but the same colors in pigments make violet."
"Metzinger's response in ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"", in addition to illustrating actual radiation emanating in concentric circles from the sun, was to separate colors in such a way as to avoid mixtures, leading to inert tones. Contrary to the Impressionists related hues, often placed on top of one another while still wet—leading to a result the Divisionists found dull—contrasting hues placed side by side for the effect or creating optical vibrations were essential to Divisionists."
"The basic elements of art—the line, particle of color—like words could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, in addition to the particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting effect on the works produced in the coming years by Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Gino Severini."
"The impulse toward abstraction was a primary quality of the time, even prior to Metzinger's ""Sunset No. 1"". ""Neo-Impressionism"" wrote Paul Adam, ""wants to reproduce the pure phenomenon, the subjective appearance of things. It is a school of abstraction."""
"By ""abstract,"" writes Robert Herbert, ""writers and painters of the period did not mean ""devoid of reference to the real world"", as we now use the term. They meant to draw away from nature, in the sense of disdaining imitation in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of ""idea"", and represented the dominance of the artist over the mere stuff of nature. In embryo, the Symbolists and Neo-Impressionists did establish the philosophical defense of pure abstraction, but nature still formed part of the basic dialogue."""
"By 1905 Metzinger began to favor the abstract qualities of larger brushstrokes and luminous colors. Following the lead of Georges Seurat, Henri-Edmond Cross and Paul Cézanne, Metzinger began incorporating a new geometry into his works that signified a further departure still from naturalism."
"Robert Herbert writes of Metzinger's ""Coucher de soleil"" and its importance during the Neo-Impressionist period and thereafter:"
"The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and of Delaunay's ""Paysage au disque"" (1906-1907), writes Herbert, ""is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..."""
"""The Neo-Impressionists"" according to Maurice Denis, ""inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life."""
"In 1904-05 Henri Poincaré discovered a graphical tool for visualizing different types of polarized light (known as Poincaré sphere). The Poincaré homology sphere, also called Poincaré dodecahedral space, is a particular example of a homology sphere. Being a spherical 3-manifold, it is the only homology 3-sphere, besides the 3-sphere itself, with a finite fundamental group. While it is not known the extent to which such discoveries influenced Metzinger's representation of the radiating sun in ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"", his interest and prowess in mathematics is well documented."
= = = Huntsville Fire = = =
"The Huntsville Fire was an American professional indoor soccer team based in Huntsville, Alabama. The Fire played in the Eastern Indoor Soccer League during both of the league's seasons from 1997 to 1998. They played their home games in the Von Braun Center. The team began the 1997 season as the Florida-based Daytona Beach Speedkings before financial struggles forced a sale early in the season."
"During their existence, the Fire/Speedkings played a combined total of 52 games, winning 29, two via shootout, and losing 23, two via shootout. They scored a total of 810 goals and allowed a total of 702 goals and notched 87 total standings points out of a possible 156 points. The EISL awarded 3 standings points for a win, 2 for a shootout win, 1 for a shootout loss, and 0 for a loss in regulation."
"The team, a charter member of the Eastern Indoor Soccer League, was founded as the Daytona Beach Speedkings. They played their home games at the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach, Florida, under the direction of coach Scott Cooper. The team played the first-ever game in EISL history, losing to the Savannah Rug Ratz in front of a ""disappointing"" crowd of 600 fans. Despite having a winning record (5–3) and the league's top offense, the team failed to draw fans and suffered financially. Before the season, team owner Blake Cullen told the ""Orlando Sentinel"" that the team would need to average about 3,000 fans per game to break even. The team's official home attendance average was 609 per game but the bulk of those were complimentary tickets with the SpeedKings selling fewer than 200 tickets per game."
"This failure prompted Cullen to sell the team to Major League Indoor Football, Inc., based in Clearwater, Florida, who announced the team would relocate to the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. In just three weeks the new management headed by team president Bryan Dresden, moved the team from Daytona Beach opening to an inaugural crowd of over 2500 new fans in Huntsville, Alabama. The renamed Huntsville Fire finished the season with a record of 13 wins and 11 losses, including 1 shootout win. This gave the team a total of 38 points for the 1997 season and 4th place in the seven-team league."
"The Fire returned for the 1998 season. They finished the season with a record of 16 wins and 12 losses (including 1 shootout win and two shootout losses) for 49 points. This placed them 3rd overall in the seven-team league. The Fire made the playoffs, losing to the Mississippi Beach Kings 2 games to 1 in the semi-final round. The Fire averaged 2,535 fans per game, fourth-best in the EISL where the average league game saw 2,733 fans in attendance."
"Ting (old Norse: þing) means assembly. It first came into being during Viking times and was formed by the freemen of the community, and it generally numbered about a hundred men. Tings were necessary in the clan-based society of Northern Germany and Scandinavia, because they allowed for inter-clan wars to be resolved or prevented through the mediation of the ting. It also served as the place for religious rites and trade negotiations."
Landstinget is also the Danish name for the modern Parliament of Greenland.
"Under the Constitution of 1849, the requirements for the right to vote was the same for the two houses, however the requirements for electability were stricter for Landstinget; candidates were limited to those of age 40 and above and they were required to have a substantial income. The house originally had 51 members, all elected indirectly. The voters elected a group of electors for each constituency, and the electors elected the members of the house. The members were elected for a term of eight years; however, terms were staggered so that half of the seats were up for election every four years."
"With the Constitution of 1866, the electoral system was reformed. The number of seats was increased to 66 of which twelve were appointed by the king for a period of twelve years, and one by the Faroese Løgting. The remaining 53 were elected indirectly."
"In Copenhagen, half the electors were elected by the voters paying the largest amount of tax, and the other half by all the voters. In the rest of the country, one elector was elected by the voters in each parish in the countryside and half as many electors were elected in the market towns by the same system as in Copenhagen. Then for each elector elected in the parishes and the market towns, one elector was found among those that paid the greatest amount of tax in the parishes. As the main direct tax of the time was based on real estate and its value as farmland, this system greatly favored manor owners. The result was a conservative majority lasting 35 years, until the 1902 election."
"The next reform of the electoral system came with the Constitution of 1915, and the first election under this system was the 1918 election. Women were given the right to vote, the number of seats was increased to 72, the number of constituencies was reduced to seven, and the system of royally appointed members was replaced by 18 members elected by the resigning Landsting for a period of eight years."
"Although a 1939 referendum that would have replaced Landstinget with another chamber—the Rigsting—and simplified the legislative process, failed due to a low voter turnout, the bicameral system and thereby Landstinget was abolished when the current constitution was approved in a 1953 referendum."
= = = M. Clifford Townsend = = =
"Maurice Clifford Townsend (August 11, 1884 – November 11, 1954) was the 35th Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from 1937 to 1941. During his term he led relief efforts during and after the Great Flood of 1937."
"Maurice Clifford Townsend, known as Clifford to his friends and family, was born on a farm in Blackford County, Indiana to David and Lydia Glancy Townsend on August 11, 1884. He had one sister, Myrtle, and the two were raised on a country farm. After completing high school in 1901 he worked as a teamster in the oil fields during the Indiana Gas Boom, and later in a factory. In 1907 he entered Marion College in Grant County. After working as a teacher for six years to pay for his education, he graduated in 1907. He then taught in the common schools, and served as school superintendent for different counties between 1909 and 1919."
"He entered politics as a representative in the Indiana House in 1923. His single term in the legislature was focused mostly on reforming the state's tax code, an issue he worked on up through his term as governor. In 1928 he ran an unsuccessful campaign for Congress, but was defeated. He then returned to education, serving again as a school superintendent and on the executive committee of the Indiana's Teachers Association in 1929. Townsend's experience in education made Paul V. McNutt consider him as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor and helped him to win the nomination at the state's Democratic convention in 1932."
"He was elected the 33rd Lieutenant Governor on the Democratic ticket and served from 1933 until 1937. The position of Lieutenant Governor was dramatically altered during his term. Previously, the position received only a token salary, only required active work during legislative sessions, which amounted to sixty days every two years. The position was granted significantly more power after the passage of the 1932 Executive Reorganization Act when the position was made head of the state's agricultural department and assigning him other administrative duties. The change put a large number of patronage jobs under his control."
"Townsend's mother placed his name in nomination for governor at the 1936 Democratic state convention. His nomination though, was a tough battle. The Democratic Party was split between three strong faction, with McNutt supporting Townsend, powerful senator Sherman Minton supporting Pleas Greenlee, and the chairman of the state party supporting Kirk McKinney. The fight at the convention was bitter, and a fist fight broke out before the final vote took place. In the end McNutt's control over the party machine determine the nomination in favor of Townsend. The popular McNutt campaigned heavily on Townsend's behalf in the general election. Republicans again made gains in the General Assembly, but Democrat kept the majority and Townsend won the election, defeating Republican Raymond Springer by over 180,000 votes."
"Townsend was inaugurated January 11, 1937. The state was immediately beset with a disaster as the Great Flood of 1937 began. Within a week, every community on the Ohio River was destroyed and hundreds of thousands were homeless. In the early stages, he coordinated evacuation efforts, routing all available trains to carry people to safety as flood waters rose. Thousand of relief workers and the national guard were called out to help rebuild. The disaster remains the second worse to have ever hit the state. Indiana was the only state affected by the flood, and there were no drownings reported. Harry L. Hopkins of the National Relief Administration said, ""No state was better managed during the flood than Indiana."""
"Before the flood relief was completed, a large strike broke out in General Motors factories across the state. Violence broke out in Anderson and the National Guard was called out by Townsend to restore order and protect the factory. The strike prompted Townsend to request the creation of the state Division of Labor to provide voluntary mediation in union strikes. Steel workers in Gary launched a strike in 1937, and the division successfully prevented it from turning violent."
"As the end of his term neared, the former state party chairman Frederick Van Nuys, who had been elected Senator again, attempted take control of the party from the McNutt-Townsend faction. The battle was primarily over who would control federal patronage jobs. President Franklin Roosevelt intervened after Van Nuys opposed his plan to stack the United States Supreme Court, and used his own influence to have Van Nuys defeated in his reelection bid. Townsend at first agreed to go along with Roosevelt's plan, but after McNutt decided it would be to harmful to the state party, Townsend changed his mind, much to Roosevelt's chagrin."
"In the mid-term elections, Republican took the control of the Indiana House of Representatives, 51 to 49. The Republicans blocked Townsend's proposed new social programs, and attempted to roll back many of his predecessor's programs. The Senate blocked the bills from passage, and the session ended in deadlock. Only a few pieces of legislation were passed: the driver's license examination became required by law, pensions for the state's firemen were approved, free textbooks were authorized for public schools and the state ordered school buses to be painted yellow for safety's sake—this last starting a nationwide trend."
"After Townsend left office, he extricated himself from internal politics of the state party, and did not involve himself in the selection of his successor. During World War II Townsend used his farm experience in government service, directing the Office of Agricultural War Relations, the Agricultural Conservation and Adjustment Administration, and the Food Production Administration. In 1943 he resigned from federal service and returned to Indiana to manage his farms in Blackford and Grant counties. Townsend was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate in 1946, but was defeated by William E. Jenner. He died November 11, 1954 from a heart attack, and was buried at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Hartford City, Indiana."

"The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is a zoo in Roeding Park in Fresno, California covering 39 acres and housing over 190 species. Its attractions include Stingray Bay, Dino Dig, Valley Farm, Sea Lion Cove, African Adventure, and Ross Laird's Winged Wonders Bird Show. The zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA)."
"The zoo was formed some time around 1908. The earliest zoo record describes a collection consisting of two bears and around fifty birds of various species. According to the zoo's website, ""bears, local cats, hoof stock, and birds were added to the Zoo and housed in log cabin type exhibits."" The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) officially recognized the park opening in 1929 as the Roeding Park Zoo."
"Only few animals were seen, but that number would later rise. The year attendance was around 2,000 and most of the visitors were from Fresno and the surrounding areas."
"The zoo grew substantially in the 1940s and 1950s, with 100 animals and more birds by 1947. The zoo's first foreman, Eldon ""Curly"" Blocker, was hired from the San Diego Zoo. In 1949, the zoo's Asian elephant Nosey (a name determined by a citywide ""Name-the-Elephant"" Contest) was acquired, with help from the Fresno Rotary Club. Her arrival coincided with Fresno's ""49ers Days Rodeo Parade"", and Nosey's presence in that parade was popular enough to spawn the creation of the Fresno Zoological Society, which would create interest in the zoo and provide a fundraising mechanism. In the 1950s, ten large exhibits were added to the zoo grounds with monkeys, sea lions, camels, giraffes, an African bird aviary, a flamingo habitat, and on-site feed and medical compounds. The zoo became an institutional member of the AZA in 1957. In 1965 Paul S. Chaffee was hired as the zoo's first director. In the late 1960s, the animal exhibits were renovated, with climate control being added to increase the comfort of the animals. In 1967, the large bird of prey exhibit was constructed, and in 1968, a master plan for future development was drafted. something to support the rest of this"
"The zoo's area expanded by a third, and new exhibits featuring bison, elk, and prairie dogs were added. In 1976, in honor of the American Bicentennial Celebration, the park's grizzly bear facility was expanded. In 1978, the Park Zoo Trust Fund (distinct from the Zoo Admissions Trust Fund) was established to make sure a portion of concession sales were used to improve the zoo. This freed the zoo from having to approve a budget with the City Council. In 1979, the zoo added the Edward A. Kane Reptile House, the world's first computer-controlled reptile habitat."
"In 1982, Nosey the Elephant's habitat was renovated and three new elephants were brought in. A red wolf exhibit known as Wolf Woods was added in 1984, and the Doris and Karl Falk Wildlife Education Center was completed, becoming part of the zoo's Educational Center. In 1985, the zoo's name changed from the Roeding Park Zoo to the Fresno Zoo. In 1988, the zoo's walk-through rainforest exhibit was added. 1989 saw the addition of a large classroom wing, and the implementation of the Adopt-an-Animal fundraising program. Paul S. Chaffee, the zoo's director since 1965, died in 1990, and the Fresno Zoo was renamed the Chaffee Zoological Gardens of Fresno in his honor. In 1993, Nosey the elephant died at the age of 47."
"In 2004, ""Measure Z"" was passed by the voters (73%) in Fresno to raise money to expand the zoo, and to improve the animal exhibits. The US$150 million project was contingent upon the submission and review of an environmental impact report. The name of the zoo was shortened to Fresno Chaffee Zoo in 2006. In 2007, a traveling ""Stingray Bay"" exhibit visited and attracted large crowds. Several stingrays were bred while they were visiting Fresno. In 2009, a permanent Stingray Bay exhibit was opened, funded by Measure Z. In the rain forest exhibit, the former butterfly house (Maddis House) reopened as the Tropical Treasures exhibit in March 2009, with poison dart frogs and a sloth among other species."
"The first intercollegiate athletic event in the school's history took place on November 25, 1892, when the Agriculturalists defeated the football team from the University of Utah, 12-0. The football program has a rich history (Merlin Olsen and Phil Olsen are alumni) throughout the mid-20th century, but has struggled lately, following two ill-fated stints as an independent program and two more years in the geographically distant Sun Belt Conference, after the Big West Conference, which had housed the Aggies since 1978, elected to stop sponsoring football in 2001. USU's other teams remained in that conference until the school was invited to join the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 2005. USU had lobbied to join its in-state rivals Utah and BYU in the WAC for many decades prior to 2005, but were only allowed in after the two other schools had left to form the Mountain West Conference. Subsequently both Utah and BYU departed the Mountain West Conference and USU was invited to join that conference, where they currently reside."
"Recently, the men's basketball team, under coach Stew Morrill, has become a nationally respected program, with several conference championships and trips to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. The basketball program has been one of the most successful programs in the country since 2000, winning at least 23 games in each season, many conference championships, and appearing in the NCAA tournament numerous times. In fact, many Aggie sports have been extremely successful for many years, though this is often overlooked due to the recent futility of the football team."
"Following the great heights of the 1960s and 70's, Aggie football has fallen upon hard times in recent decades, leading to a disproportionate lack of USU sports coverage in statewide and national media. Many of the Aggie faithful attribute the decline to administrators at both Utah and BYU freezing then-superior USU out of the newly formed WAC. However, other factors cited as leading to the decline include a failure to upgrade facilities until recently, a lack of donors to athletics, and the complacency of past athletics directors. The futility of the football program has had an extremely negative effect on the perception of the university as a whole, and it is something that the Aggies are only now recovering from. 2011 saw the first winning season in many years, a bowl game, and in May 2012, an invitation to the Mountain West Conference, which will give USU its first stable, promising conference home in a half-century."
"However, former athletic director Scott Barnes recently inked deals with TV stations, replaced the head football coach, raised funds, and accomplished numerous necessary reorganizations, despite the athletics department's dismal budget in comparison with other state and conference schools. In large part due to his efforts, USU Athletics was crowned the 2009 National Champion of the Excellence in Management Cup, which seeks to identify the university that wins the most championships with the lowest expenses. The Aggies brought in WAC championships in five sports during the 2008–09 academic year, tied for the most in school history."
"As of January 2016, Aggie football has an overall record of 547–533–31 (.506)"
"After many years of futility, the Aggies experienced a renaissance under head coach Gary Andersen, who replaced Brent Guy following the 2008 season. The 2011 campaign was the team's first winning season in many years, resulting in a postseason bowl berth. 2012 has brought the school's first-ever 10-win season and WAC championship (its first outright conference championship since 1936), and national Top 25 rankings in all three major polls. Andersen left USU after the 2012 season and has been replaced by his former offensive coordinator Matt Wells."
"The Aggies have played in eight bowl games in their history, winning three. The team's first victory came in the 1993 Las Vegas Bowl against . The team has made three consecutive bowl appearances, the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, in 2011 and 2012, and the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl, in 2013. The team lost to Ohio in the 2011 edition and defeated Toledo 41–15 in the 2012 edition. In 2013 USU defeated Northern Illinois University in the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl."
"USU football is played at Maverik Stadium, which seats 25,100."
"The men's cross country team has been impressive in recent years, winning the WAC title for the past five years in a row—each year since joining the WAC. Members of the team have garnered numerous conference and regional awards, and have competed in the NCAA Championships. Likewise, the men's track and field team has long enjoyed success, with a bevy of All-American athletes from decades past. In recent years, the team has also won WAC championships in 2007, 2009, and 2010 (outdoor) and 2008 and 2010 (indoor)."
"Golf has spent many years attempting to return to the heights achieved in the early 1980s by alum Jay Don Blake. As a member of the Aggie golf squad, Blake won the NCAA Championship in 1980 and was named NCAA Player of the Year in 1981. He turned pro that year, and in 1987 joined the PGA Tour, where he has one victory and several top-10 finishes, mostly in the early '90s. He has won three times on the Champions Tour."
"The tennis team has a difficult time attracting major recruits due to the lack of indoor on-campus facilities. The team trains and plays its home matches at an upscale local gym. Despite this deficiency, the team has produced a number of athletes who have won all-conference honors in recent years, drawing from both local and international talent pools."
"Of women's sports at USU, gymnastics has probably been most successful historically, heading to the postseason 26 times, including five trips to the national championships. The soccer team has been successful as of late, finishing the 2008 season with a perfect record in conference play, as well as a WAC title. Despite falling in the conference tournament in 2009, Aggie soccer landed three players on the All-WAC first team."
"Women's volleyball and softball are two of the sports at USU that boast of national championships in their history. In 1978 the Aggie volleyball team defeated UCLA to win the AIAW Large College volleyball national championship. The following year, the team fell to Hawaii in the championship match."
"The Aggie softball team has appeared in four Women's College World Series, in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1984, winning the AIAW Division I softball national championship in 1980 and 1981."
"Neither team has returned to such heights in recent years, though each has been consistently good. The women's tennis team struggles with the same disadvantages as the men's."
"The women's basketball program began rebuilding in 2003 after a 16-year absence. At the time, USU was the only Division I school that did not have a women's basketball program besides the mostly male Virginia Military Institute and The Citadel. It took eight years for Utah State to post a winning record, finishing the 2010–11 season at 16–15 after reaching the second round of the WNIT. The 2011–12 team finished 21–10 for the first 20-win season in school history, exiting the WNIT in the first round. Following the season, Raegan Pebley, who had been head coach since the return of the sport, was hired away by Fresno State, with Jerry Finkbeiner being hired as her replacement."
"The most used sports venue is the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, where basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics events are held. TV and radio announcers visiting the Smith Spectrum for the first time commonly state that the spectrum is one of the loudest basketball venues in the country with one of the most enthusiastic crowds in the country, rivaling Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke University. It is a tradition that near the beginning of games the crowd chooses one player from the other team who commits a blatant foul, taunts the crowd, etc., and every time that player touches the ball the entire crowd boos loudly until he passes the ball. This pressure on opposing players created by this tradition has cut many outstanding players down to below average while at the Spectrum."
"The football team plays in Maverik Stadium, slightly north and west of the main campus. The stadium had natural grass until 2004, when artificial turf was installed. Romney Stadium is built on a hillside, and appears much smaller from outside than it actually is, as much of the seating and the field are below street level. In 2009, the field at Romney Stadium was named Merlin Olsen Field, in honor of the Hall of Fame alumnus."
"The name Aggies, short for Agriculturalists, is a fixture of many universities that began as land-grant and agricultural colleges. Early USU sports teams were sometimes simply referred to as the ""Farmers"" as well as the Aggies, though the former name was never official. Beginning in the 1930s, an image of a ""bean-pole farmer"" with a pitchfork in hand and hay stalk in mouth began to be used to represent the college, though this too was never made official, and disappeared following the transformation into a full-fledged university in 1957."
"During the late 1960s and early '70s, a movement began on campus to shed the Aggie name in favor of the Utah State Highlanders, but the movement met with widespread opposition and was abandoned. The name ""Highlanders"" was a nod to the university's historic ideological tie to Scotland, which came about very early on in the college's history, mostly due to the university's setting on a hill in a high mountain valley. In fact, for a brief period, USU's teams were indeed nicknamed the ""Scotsmen"" as well, and a remnant of this era lives on in the current and popular fight song ""The Scotsman""."
"A November 7, 1901 meeting decided that the college's official color would be blue. It originated as more of a royal blue, morphing fully into navy by the 1920s. The term ""Big Blue"" came about in the 1960s simply to refer to the uniform color, as opposed to any particular mascot. The image of a bull first appeared on a football game program in 1975, and the following year it was adopted as USU's mascot."
"For a few years, USU used an actual white bull, painted blue, which was brought to sporting events and corralled on the sidelines. However, when the Smith Spectrum was built, there were concerns with the bull ruining the floor. For a short time, the bull was outfitted with red rubber boots, which did not pan out and the bull was retired."
"In 1987 USU Student Athletics Vice President John Mortensen decided that Utah State should still have a mascot and spent $750 on a costume for Big Blue. The costume was somewhat of a disappointment because it was royal blue, not navy, had real animal horns, and was not easy to move around in."
"The costume has since undergone at least one redesign, but is now one of the most active and recognized college mascots in the region. Possibly Big Blue's most well-known antic was his tradition of rappelling from the JumboTron to kick off team introductions for men's basketball games. He also enjoys crowdsurfing. As of 2003, four of the six people who had played the Big Blue role had gone on to become mascots for professional sports teams."
"The HURD is the student section at Utah State University. The HURD started in 2006 and has grown every year since. Beginning as a club in the USU Student Association, the HURD moved to total inclusion of the entire USU student body in the summer of 2012. At capacity, the HURD fills 6,500 seats at Romney Stadium for USU Football and 4,000 seats in the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum for USU Basketball. The HURD helps organize major activities, with leadership and help from the HURD Committee, such as tailgates, camp outs, away game watch parties and more for the student body and community. Drawing from its motto ""Be Seen. Be Loud. Be HURD!"", the HURD ensures that the teams who visit Utah State University will experience the best atmosphere in the country for collegiate athletics by being known as one of the craziest student sections in the country."
"The Aggies' principal fight song is known as ""Hail the Utah Aggies"" as well as simply ""Fight Song"". It was composed in 1933 by Mickey Hart, with words by Darwin Jepsen and Mark Hart. The main verse is sung twice, with the chant once in between."
"The popular Scotsman song was composed by student Ebenezer J. Kirkham, class of 1918. At athletic events, ""The Scotsman"" is often sung immediately following ""Hail the Utah Aggies"". The words are sung twice through without a break, accompanied by synchronized arm gestures originally created by a small students in Section K of the Spectrum in the early 90s to represent milking of a cow by hand eventually spread to the entire student section. The motions are yet another example of USU students ingenuity creating longstanding traditions at sporting events. During the final words of the second ""verse"", the students' pitch often rises to a full-out yell."

"The game, along with the original ""Hotline Miami"", was released as part of the ""Hotline Miami Collection"" for the Nintendo Switch on 19 August 2019."
"Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it holds an aggregated score of 75/100 based on 18 reviews for the PlayStation 4 Version, one of 74/100 based on 67 reviews for the PC version, and one of 66/100 based on four reviews for the PlayStation Vita version. Danny O'Dwyer from GameSpot gave the game a 9/10, praising its techno and intense soundtrack, entertaining, engaging and challenging gameplay, well-designed controls, striking and vibrant visuals, improved enemy placement, lengthy story, as well as the huge variety of characters, levels and locations. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective. However, he criticized the lack of weapon customization. He summarized the game by saying that ""This is a confident follow-up which improves upon the original in almost every way. This is a tremendously stylish game which entertains throughout, and delights in forcing you out of your comfort zone."
"Chris Carter from Destructoid also awarded the game a 9/10, praising the open-ended gameplay, engrossing story, accessible interface and level-creator, as well as the game for allowing players to utilize creativity and strategy in every level. However, he criticized the poor AI. He summarized the game by saying that """"Hotline Miami 2"" may not be as ""profound"" as its predecessor, but it's still a bloody good time."" Chloi Rad from IGN gave the game an 8.8/10, praising its high replay value, engaging story, sizable maps, rich characters' backstory, character-specific abilities, the improved lock-on system as well as the level-design, which demands players a new and more cautious approach towards dangers. However, she criticized the occasionally frustrating levels. She summarized the review by saying that """"Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number"" is a great game and a worthy sequel. It's more confident in its style, storytelling ability, and level design than the first game."" Alex Carlson from Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4.5/5, praising its seedy and visceral art design and its improvement on its predecessors gameplay, but criticized its adherence to the established formula. He summed up the review saying """"Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number"" is purposely discomforting and hypnotically visceral. It's one of the best games released so far this year."""
"Steven Burns from VideoGamer.com gave the game a 7/10, while praising the narrative as well as the brutal violence featured in the game, which he stated ""has tread a fine, sophisticated line between titillation, power, and reflection, an integral part of both narrative and mechanics."", he criticized the oversized maps, as well as the game for being overly difficult, frustrating as enemy attack players where they can't be seen from the camera angle, and restrictive as the game forced players to play a certain way very often. Chris Thursten from PC Gamer gave the game a 57/100, criticizing the meaningless characters, alienating rape scene, rigid playstyle restriction, inconsistent AI, frustrating and unavoidable death as well as technical issues. Yet he still praised the soundtrack, where the ""experience is enormously enhanced by their work"". He summarized the review by saying that ""Restrictive design decisions sap the energy from a series that revels in it, and technical issues deal the killing blow."""
"The demo shown at Rezzed and the 2013 Penny Arcade Expo featured gameplay in the tutorial that had players appear to attempt to assault a woman sexually as the Pig Butcher. The player character lowered his pants and straddled the woman before the scene is interrupted by the director of ""Midnight Animal"", revealing the whole sequence to be a film shoot."
"Video game journalists, including Cara Ellison of ""PC Gamer"", spoke out against the usage of sexual assault imagery. In response, Dennis Wedin stated that Dennaton cut the scene from the demo, and that they were reconsidering putting the scene into the final game. Wedin also stated that they cut the scene short to show that that type of violence is not what the ""Hotline Miami"" series is about."
"On 15 January 2015 it was reported that because of the implied rape scene, the game had been refused classification in Australia, which prohibits sale within the country, effectively preventing its wide release there. In an official statement from Devolver Digital and Dennaton Games the creators mentioned that they have added a cut and uncut option for the slasher-flick level. Dennaton also reconfirmed that the context of the scene is important and that they were ""concerned and disappointed"" by the actions of the Classification Board, stating it stretched the facts in its judgment of the game. The statement concluded with Dennaton confirming that they will not challenge the ruling. Developer Dennaton Games have since suggested that people in Australia interested in the game should pirate it if they are unable to purchase a retail copy."
"With the release of the Nintendo Switch ""Hotline Miami Collection"" in August 2019, the game was no longer banned in Australia, with a new rating MA15+. According to Devolver, they had applied for a International Age Rating Coalition process for the collection as part of the requirement for publishing on the Switch. Though originally denied a rating one time, they successfully obtained the appropriate rating on a second submission. Devolver states that this automated rated may still end up challenged by the Australian board later."
= = = 2014 American Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Tournament = = =
"The 2014 American Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Tournament was the first conference tournament of the American Athletic Conference (The American). It was the first conference tournament held since the split of the original Big East Conference. While The American is the legal successor to the old Big East, the rights to conference tournament in Madison Square Garden were retained by the new Big East, so the 2014 tournament was numbered as the new conference's first edition. The tournament was held March 12–15 in the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee and decided a champion of the 2013–14 American Athletic Conference men's basketball season (like most NCAA conferences, The American recognizes both regular-season and tournament champions; Cincinnati and Louisville shared the regular-season title). The teams in the conference competed in a ten-team single-elimination tournament for an automatic bid to the 2014 NCAA Tournament."
"In the 2013–14 season, The American consisted of 10 members involved in the rearrangement of conferences between the 2013 and 2014 seasons. (Cincinnati, Connecticut, and South Florida) had been full members of the original Big East. One (Temple) had been a football-only Big East member before entering into full membership in The American. The remaining four schools (Houston, Memphis, SMU, and UCF) had previously been members of Conference USA."
"All teams in the American qualified for the tournament. Teams were seeded based on conference record and then a tie breaker system was used. Teams seeded 7–10 had to play in the opening round and teams seeded 1–6 received a bye to the second round. Louisville and Cincinnati finished with identical 15-3 records and shared the regular season title. Since the Cardinals and Bearcats had split their meetings during the regular season, a coin toss was held to determine the #1 seed in the tournament, which was won by Cincinnati."
All tournament games are nationally televised on an ESPN network:

"Suresh H.

Among his many scientific contributions is the development of the two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) model of carcinogenesis, also known as the Moolgavkar-Venzon-Knudson (MVK) model, a stochastic cell-level description of carcinogenesis based on Alfred G. Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis. In its original development the TSCE model represents tumor initiation as the first hit, followed by cell proliferation (clonal expansion) and malignant transformation as the second hit. It has been interpreted as describing the initiation-promotion-progression sequence observed in chemical carcinogenesis and has been applied widely for the analysis of both experimental and epidemiological data for purposes of quantitative risk assessment."

The Honda NS125 was first presented at the Bologna Motor Show in December 1984 and went on sale in April 1985.
"The engine is a liquid cooled, , two-stroke which used Honda's ATAC system (Automatically Controlled Torque Amplification Chamber). However the ATAC equipped models were not available in the UK. The NS was Honda's first attempt at the high end ""125cc"" sports bike market in Italy; therefore it was built in Atessa, Italy and many of the parts used were made by well known Italian brands such as Dell'Orto for the carburetor, Marzocchi forks and single rear shock and Grimeca wheels and front disk brake. Honda, Japan supplied the spec sheets and a few parts like the electrics, piston and barrel."
"The Honda NS125 which was available as an ""F"" naked, or an ""R"" fully faired is commonly mistaken as an older NSR, although it shares no real parts or design to it. This model is most easily identifiable by its singular square headlight, rather than the later NSR's 'foxeye' design"

The basic subdivisions of Illinois are the 102 counties. Cook County is the only home rule county.
"Of the 102 counties, 85 are divided into townships. Cicero is within a township but both its township and municipal governments are carried out by the same governing body. The remaining 17 counties are divided into 261 precincts, instead of townships."
"Municipal governments are the cities, villages, and incorporated towns. The minimum size for incorporation as a city is 2,500, and the minimum size for incorporation as a village varies by the county population. Municipalities having a population above 25,000 automatically have home rule status, whereas smaller municipalities have the option via referendums."
Illinois has several types of school districts:
"Elected boards of education and boards of trustees (in the case of community college districts) govern these districts, except for the Chicago Public Schools and the City Colleges of Chicago, for which the boards are appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the Chicago City Council, and the special charter districts, which may have elected or appointed boards. The Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) is the administrative agency with responsibility for overseeing all higher education in Illinois. With regards to the Illinois Community College System, the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) is the state coordinating board for community colleges."
Area vocational centers and special education cooperatives may be formed by joint agreement between two or more school districts. A board consisting of representatives of each participating school district governs each entity of these two types. Educational service regions replaced the former county school units administered by county superintendents. Each region originally served one county but now may serve multiple counties because of minimum population requirements. Each region is headed by a regional superintendent of schools and is also governed by a regional board of trustees; the latter deal primarily with district boundary changes. Township land commissioners manage school lands and funds in certain counties. Educational service centers are established by the state board of education and function primarily to coordinate and provide special and ordinary services to affiliated school districts. These service centers are governed by boards consisting of members appointed by the regional superintendent.
"Special purpose districts in Illinois are forms of local government that are responsible for a narrow set of responsibilities. Illinois has the most special purpose districts of any U.S. state. The exact number depends on how one defines a “special purpose district.” The United States Census Bureau has determined that Illinois has 3,227 special purpose governments as of June 30, 2012. The Office of the Illinois Comptroller, which uses a broader definition that includes special districts without budget autonomy, determined the state has 4,755 as of December 2015."

= = = Conquest of the Western Turks = = =
"The conquest of the Western Turks, known as the Western Tujue in Chinese sources, was a military campaign in 657 led by the Tang Dynasty general Su Dingfang against the Western Turkic Khaganate ruled by Ashina Helu. The Chinese war against the Western Turks began in 640 with the annexation of the Tarim Basin oasis state Gaochang, an ally of the Western Turks. Several of the oasis states had once been vassals of the Tang Dynasty, but switched their allegiance to the Western Turks when they grew suspicious of the military ambitions of the Tang. Tang expansion into Central Asia continued with the conquest of Karasahr in 644 and Kucha in 648. Su Dingfang commanded the main army dispatched against the Western Turks, while the Turkic generals Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen led the side divisions. The Tang troops were reinforced by cavalry supplied by the Uyghurs, a tribe that had been allied with the Tang since their support for the Uyghur revolt against the Xueyantuo. Su Dingfang's army defeated Helu at the battle of Irtysh River."
"The victory strengthened Tang control of the Western Regions, now modern Xinjiang, and brought the regions formerly ruled by the Khaganate into the Tang empire. Puppet qaghans, the Turkic title for ruler, and military garrisons were installed to administer the newly acquired territories. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent as China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Arabic Umayyad Caliphate. Later on, Turkic revolts ended Chinese hegemony beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan, but a Tang military presence remained in Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin. Central Asia absorbed cultural influences from the conflict. Turkic culture and language spread into Central Asia, as did artistic and political influences from the Tang Dynasty. Many of the Tang generals and soldiers stationed in the region were ethnically Turkic, and the prevalence of Indo-European languages in Central Asia declined with acceleration of Turkic migration. The Turks, Tibetans, and the Tang competed for control over Central Asia for the next few centuries."
"The empire of the Tang Dynasty (June 18, 618 – June 1, 907), successor of the Sui Dynasty, was a cosmopolitan hegemon that ruled one of China's most expansive empires. Raids by the nomadic Khitans and Turks challenged Tang rule, and Tang rulers responded by pursuing strategies of divide and conquer, proxy warfare, tributes, and marriages."
"Hostilities between the Tang and the Western Turks had existed since the founding of the dynasty. Emperor Gaozu, the first emperor of the Tang Dynasty, aided the assassination of a Western Turk qaghan on November 2, 619. Facing the threat of both the Western and Eastern Turkic Khaganates, Gaozu's successor Emperor Taizong formed an alliance with the Western Turks against the Eastern Turks, adopting a policy of allying ""with those who are far away to fight those who are close."""
"The westward expansion of the Tang Dynasty began with their wars against the Eastern Turks, Eastern Tujue in Chinese. Taking advantage of the political discord in the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, Taizong annexed the territory of the Eastern Turks in 629, beginning a period of rule that would last for the next fifty years. The nomads were driven out of the Ordos region and southern Mongolia and Taizong was declared a Great Khan by the defeated tribes, who surrendered and submitted to Tang rule."
"Several of the Tarim Basin oasis states switched their allegiance from the Tang Dynasty to the Western Turks. The oasis states Kashgar and Khotan surrendered to the Chinese in 632, as did the kingdom of Yarkand in 635. Tang military campaigns expanded further west against the remaining kingdoms of the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang beginning in 640. The king of Gaochang refused to submit to the Tang Dynasty as a suzerain. In 638, Emperor Taizong ordered a campaign led by general Hou Junji to invade Gaochang. Tang troops arrived in 640 and annexed the kingdom. A Western Turk army, sent to support Gaochang, retreated as the Tang forces approached."
"The nearby kingdom of Karasahr grew wary of the Chinese troops stationed at Gaochang, now under Tang domination. It refused to send tribute to the Tang court and formed an alliance with the Western Turks. A Tang campaign led by commander Guoxiao Ke captured the kingdom in 644 and installed a Tang loyalist as ruler. Military assistance by the Western Turks failed to deter the Tang forces. With the support of the Western Turks, the puppet ruler was later deposed, and another military campaign, led by the Tang general Ashina She'er, a member of the Turkic Ashina royal family, arrived in 648 to re-establish Tang control."
"After conquering Karasahr, She'er led his forces to the kingdom of Kucha. The army of Kucha, comprising 50,000 soldiers, lost to She'er. The king of Kucha fled with his soldiers to the kingdom of Aksu. After a forty-day siege, the king was captured and the Kucha forces surrendered on 19 January 649. Tang military garrisons were installed in the region to administer the annexed oasis states. These garrisons, known as the Four Garrisons of Anxi, were located in Kucha, Kashgar, Khotan, and Karasahr."
"Ishbara Qaghan (Ashina Helu), a member of the Ashina royal family, was previously a general under Emperor Taizong commanding Tang forces in Gansu. He led a revolt against the Tang and migrated westward, declaring himself Shabulou Qaghan and ruler of the Western Turkic Khaganate. Helu's rise to power unified the divided Turkic tribes under a single leader."
"After he established himself as qaghan, Ashina Helu led repeated raids on Tang settlements to the east. He also attacked the Tarim Basin, bringing the territory under Turkic rule for the next six years. Emperor Gaozong, the successor of Taizong, responded by sending Tang forces consisting of a main division led by Su Dingfang, and another led by Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen, Western Turk rivals of Ashina Helu."
"Su Dingfang was a commander from south-central Hebei who, earlier in his career as an officer, was responsible for leading the attack against the military camp of Illig Qaghan, qaghan of the Eastern Turks. He also gained military experience as a leader of a regional militia during the civil war fought between the transition from Sui to Tang. Su was a general with military experience in Central Asia, and was familiar with the culture of the steppes. He had been in contact with military leaders from the region. He was one of nine multi-ethnic commanders invited by Emperor Gaozong to a military event in 655. The Turkic general Ashina Zhong, second cousin of Ashina She'er, was another commander in attendance."
"Su Dingfang's forces comprised Tang soldiers and 10,000 Uyghur horsemen. The Uyghur troops were provided by Porun, son of the Uyghur leader Tumidu Eltabar and enthroned by Taizong. The Uyghurs were allied with Tang China, who had supported their revolt against the reign of the Xueyantuo, a tribe of Tiele people. Porun joined Su Dingfang as a vice commander of the Uyghur cavalry in the military campaign against the Western Turks. The commanders of the Uyghur cavalry were the Yanran Protector-General and Vice Protector-General, administrators of the Yanran Protectorate near the Tang Xishouxiang military garrison."
"Su's army marched through the Central Asian steppes from Ordos, Inner Mongolia to the Altai Mountains region. His troops left Ordos in March and arrived in Kyrgyzstan in November, a journey spanning 3,000 miles across steppes and desert. Su avoided stopping at the resource rich oasis states, and historian Jonathan Karam Skaff speculates that the Chinese troops may have relied on livestock for food instead of a supply train, a tactic used by the steppe nomads. The campaign continued through the winter, when the steppes were covered in snow. Describing the journey's ordeal, Su Dingfang is reported to have said: ""The fog shed darkness everywhere. The wind is icy. The barbarians do not believe that we can campaign at this season. Let us hasten to surprise them!"""
"Commanders in the Tang army were familiar with the political culture of nomadic empires. Nomadic alliances were formed through distributing war plunder and ensuring the security of tribal property, and grew tenuous when rulers failed to deliver their promises. The Chinese understood that disaffected tribes were vulnerable to switching allegiances, and used this to their advantage."
"Su Dingfang recruited tribes to side with Tang, and these former tribal vassals of the Western Turks contributed additional soldiers. The tribe Chumukun offered their support after they were defeated by Su, and the tribe Nishu aided Su after their children and wives, originally captured by Helu, were returned along with gifts offered by the Tang."
"The battle was fought along the Irtysh River near the Altai Mountains. Helu's forces, consisting of 100,000 cavalry, were ambushed by Su as Helu chased decoy Tang troops that Su had deployed. Helu was defeated during Su's surprise attack, and lost most of his soldiers. Turkic tribes loyal to Helu surrendered, and Helu escaped to Tashkent in modern Uzbekistan. The retreating Helu was captured the next day after residents of Tashkent handed the qaghan over to the Tang. On the way back to the Tang capital, Helu is reported to have written:"
"Following the end of his international career, despite scoring over 1,000 first-class runs in the England tour including two centuries, he made only sporadic appearances in Pakistani domestic cricket. He appeared in only three Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches between 1963 and 1965; an invitational XI match for the Punjab Governor against Pakistan Universities in 1966; Pakistan versus The Rest in 1967; and lastly one appearance in the Ayub Trophy on 15 January 1968 where he scored 40 and 15 for the Lahore Reds."
"In 1982 Butt was appointed manager for the Pakistani winter tour of Australia, and in 1984 the secretary of the then Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan, a position he held until 1988 along with the presidency of the Lahore City Cricket Association. In October 2008 he was named chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. His initial actions were to suggest the possibility of neutral venues to preserve international cricket during a time of tenuous security conditions within Pakistan: ""The holding of the Champions Trophy in Pakistan depends on the security condition of the country and if the current indefinite situation prevails further we may consider the option to play on alternate venues."" He expressed relief when the 2009 Champions Trophy appeared to be going ahead in Pakistan despite security risks, and ""made a series of startling revelations"" about discussions with the International Cricket Council about merging with the Indian Premier League."
"Pakistan, however, received little support as potential hosts of the Champions Trophy, a fact on which Butt expressed surprise. He warned that a divide would occur in the world of cricket should sub-continent cricket tours be marginalised. India later cancelled their tour to Pakistan, though Butt was hoping to host Australia after the latter team expressed an interest. In October 2008 he also asked questions of the financial security of the previous PCB officials, and speculated on the removal of Geoff Lawson, then Pakistani coach, from his position. Two days later, however, he reversed his position by stating he was ""duty-bound to fully back Lawson and to take care of all his liabilities."" Shafqat Naghmi, PCB Chief Operating Officer, also threatened to sue Butt over allegations that the former was stealing official documents."
"Security concerns did not lessen, however, and Javed Miandad's resignation as director-general of the PCB resulted in traded accusations between himself and Butt at a Senate of Pakistan meeting. Butt refused to step down, and attacked the senate as a body with little actual legal power over the PCB. The senate nevertheless moved a resolution for a change in the PCB management. However, Butt remained in his position. Following an attack on a touring Sri Lanka cricket team in early 2009, Butt admitted in a public statement the difficulty international teams had in coming to the country, but accused ICC referee Chris Broad of exaggerating the problems. ICC President David Morgan, however, agreed with Broad's assessment. the 2011 Cricket World Cup was duly moved out of Pakistan."
"Butt continued to meet with the PCB board to regain the World Cup, to no avail, despite a legal battle which lasted until August. Eventually an out of court settlement of 18 million US dollars was agreed upon; Butt calling it ""the best possible solution."" Concurrently, the PCB under Butt dissolved the national selection panel and removed Saleem Altaf from his position as chief operating officer. The summer tour of Sri Lanka was also marred by match-fixing allegations over which the PCB sought legal advice. The ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit eventually cleared the Pakistan players of having had any contact with bookmakers."
"Towards the winter of 2009, Butt also came up against Younis Khan in a dispute over the captaincy, with Khan taking time out of the game. By January 2010, however, Butt ruled that a new captain would be chosen following the tour of Australia, with Khan quitting the captaincy. Further match fixing claims arose in February, and Butt promised action against the players involved following the report of an inquiry committee which investigated Pakistan's whitewash defeat during the tour of Australia. Further match fixing and financial corruption accusations followed for both Butt and the PCB in 2010. Nevertheless, the ICC announced on 11 February the awarding of a medal for Butt for services to cricket."
"Though Butt had deflected accusations of match fixing earlier in February 2010 during Pakistan's tour of Australia, the 2010 tour of England was publicly marred by controversial match fixing allegations involving a number of Pakistan players and their actions during the One Day Internationals against England and the Test series against the host nation and against Australia. Scotland Yard confirmed on 17 September that it had questioned Pakistan players Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz over allegations of accepting bribes, and that the police had passed evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. Several Pakistani players were suspended. Initially, Ijaz Butt had supported the prosecution of Amir, stating that ""his board will not make any appeals for leniency"", however on 19 September he attacked the England cricket team during a press conference, accusing them of a conspiracy to ""defraud Pakistan cricket"" by accepting their own bribes. He stated that:"
"""This is not a conspiracy to defraud bookies but a conspiracy to defraud Pakistan and Pakistan cricket... We have taken it in hand to start our own investigations. We will shortly reveal the names of the people, the parties and the bodies involved in this sinister conspiracy and we also reserve the right to sue them for damages... There is loud and clear talk in bookie circles that some English players have taken enormous amounts of money to lose the match [the third ODI]. No wonder there was such a collapse."""
"The remarks provoked a backlash from the England and Wales Cricket Board as well as England coach Andy Flower and captain Andrew Strauss. The ECB announced that it would be taking legal action against Butt for his allegations, though the tour would continue despite several England players' reluctance to participate. There were several calls for Butt to resign, however he refused. Wajid Shamsul Hasan, the Pakistan's high commissioner, defended Butt, calling the disagreement ""a very innocent argument"" and denying relationships with the United Kingdom were adversely affected. The England team later made official their demand for an apology in a letter sent to Butt, promising legal action without further warning if their request went unfulfilled. Butt arrived in London in late September vowing not to retract his comments in the run up to a meeting with the lawyers of three suspended Pakistan players; however, he later reversed course and retracted his statement. He was nevertheless recalled by the PCB for an explanation, amid speculation that his future as chairman remained tenuous. The ICC board of directors discussed sacking him in a meeting in Dubai should he not accept new anti-corruption measures."

= = = Chocolate City speech = = =
"The Chocolate City speech is the nickname that some people have given to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day speech by Ray Nagin, Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, on January 16, 2006. The speech concerned race politics in New Orleans several months after Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of the city. The reference is to the occurrence of the phrase ""chocolate city"" in Nagin's speech, which was one of several points in the speech that occasioned significant controversy and raised accusations of racism against Mr. Nagin."
"In African American culture, the term ""chocolate city"" refers to a city with a predominantly African American population and/or African American political leadership. The concept originated with radio DJs in Washington D.C. in the early 1970s and was popularized by the band Parliament, who released the album ""Chocolate City"" in 1975. The term has been used by scholar Cornel West in his 1993 book ""Race Matters"" and by comedian Chris Rock."
"In an interview with Public Radio International's Tavis Smiley (originally broadcast on January 13, 2006) Nagin used the phrase ""chocolate city"" in reference to New Orleans' future demographics, a term that would become troublesome for him just a few days later."
"At the end of August, 2005, New Orleans had been hit by Hurricane Katrina, and catastrophic failures of the city's Federal levees flooded the majority of the city. Only a small portion of the city's evacuated population had returned by January. Some commentators were suggesting that the city's demographics would change from majority African American to majority Caucasian."
This speech put the post-Hurricane Katrina recovery process of New Orleans in the context of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Nagin's speech reflected on the problems of violence and crime in pre- and post-Katrina New Orleans. He also referred to the humanitarian plight of the largely African-American hurricane victims in the Louisiana Superdome and Morial Convention Center.
"At a Martin Luther King Day celebration at City Hall New Orleans on January 16, 2006, the mayor gave a speech."
"Nagin began the speech invoking spirits of Peace, Love, and Unity. He then described a talk he had with Martin Luther King, Jr. earlier that morning (as King was long dead, this was presumably a metaphor or rhetorical device). Nagin then described some of the problems and suffering New Orleans had been experiencing since the hurricane, with the repeated refrain that Dr. King says ""I wouldn't like that""."
"Shortly after, Nagin continued, ""We as black people, it's time, it's time for us to come together. It's time for us to rebuild a New Orleans, the one that should be a chocolate New Orleans. And I don't care what people are saying Uptown or wherever they are. This city will be chocolate at the end of the day."""
"Nagin also stated that New Orleans ""will be a majority African-American city. It's the way God wants it to be."" As most New Orleanians knew the city had been majority African American for decades before Katrina, Ned Sublette of The Nation found the implication of Nagin claiming to know God's will more troubling than the suggested return of pre-Katrina demographics."
"In the same speech, Nagin further stirred controversy by claiming that ""God is mad at America. He sent us hurricane after hurricane after hurricane, and it's destroyed and put stress on this country...Surely he doesn't approve of us being in Iraq under false pretenses. But surely he is upset at black America also. We're not taking care of ourselves."" Nagin then went on to relate an imagined conversation with the deceased Rev. Martin Luther King regarding both the response to Katrina and the modern problems of black America which he believes offended God."
"The speech generated an intense reaction, much of it negative. The ""Chocolate City"" metaphor was seized on and parodied by commentators, and cartoons depicting Nagin as Willy Wonka appeared in print and on the internet. A ""Times-Picayune"" commentator suggested that Nagin had just ruined his own chances at re-election."
"Political commentators point out that while this may just have been another example of Nagin speaking off the cuff, it will likely hurt his standing among white voters."
"Many people believed the word ""uptown"" to be a coded reference to wealthy whites, such as those who live in the old mansions on St. Charles Avenue or around Audubon Park. However, Uptown New Orleans actually is one of the most ethnically and economically diverse sections of the Metro area. Many of Nagin's original supporters live Uptown. As Uptown contains the largest section of unflooded high ground in the city's East Bank, at the time of the speech Uptown had the city's largest concentration of locals back in their homes, businesses back open, and displaced New Orleanians from other more severely damaged parts of town living there. Locals protested the Mayor's comment which some felt suggested he did not care about an important section of his city."
"Nagin later attempted to explain away his remarks by offering a more racially inclusive metaphor, saying ""How do you make chocolate? You take dark chocolate, you mix it with white milk and it becomes a delicious drink. That's the chocolate I'm talking about."""
"The Blue Night Network is the overnight public transit service operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The network consists of a basic grid of 27 bus and 4 streetcar routes, distributed so that almost all of the city is within 2 km of at least one route. It is the largest and most frequent night network in North America."
"The times of Blue Night service vary according to individual scheduling situations on each route. Most regular service bus and streetcar routes cease operations at approximately 1:30 a.m. If there is a Blue Night route on the same street, its first trip will then follow at a suitable interval after the last regular run."
"On the subway system, the last trains on each line make a complete trip; the last trains running east, west, and north from Bloor–Yonge and St. George stations each leave at 1:50 a.m. or just after. Each station then closes as the last train passes it."
"In the morning, regular bus and streetcar service mostly takes over from the corresponding Blue Night routes around 5:30a.m, or 8:00a.m. on Sundays. The first trains on the subway then start from various positions along the routes, allowing all stations to open more or less simultaneously just before 6:00a.m., or 8:00a.m. on Sundays. The Blue Night routes that parallel the subway lines keep running until that time, and their last buses terminate service at a subway station to facilitate transfers to the trains."
"Normal TTC fares apply on the Blue Night Network. Passengers can transfer to or from regular-service routes as usual. Additionally, TTC passes valid for the previous day are honoured until 5:30a.m. the next day, rather than midnight."
"Blue Night routes operate with frequencies of every 30 minutes or better. Blue Night routes are distinguished from regular routes by numbers in the 300 series. Numbering on these routes can correspond to a day route, such as 301 Queen being Blue Night for 501 Queen. Routings are often combinations of multiple-day routes or slight alterations to their corresponding day route."
"Most routes are operated by TTC's fleet of low-floor buses, where applicable, making them fully accessible for handicapped and wheelchair users. Four routes operate with streetcars: the 301 Queen, the 304 King, the 306 Carlton, and the 310 Spadina. As of January 2020, all of these routes are operated with accessible Flexity Outlook streetcars."
"Toronto has had overnight streetcar service since the days of the Toronto Railway Company in the 1890s, and the TTC continued it when they took over in 1921. The routes selected for 24-hour service were those serving 24-hour employers such as factories, stockyards, and railway yards."
"Over the years various streetcar routes were replaced by other modes, and where new subway lines replaced streetcars during regular hours, buses were put on overnight. But the overnight routings remained largely unchanged for decades, even after the TTC's service area expanded in 1954 from the Toronto city limits as they then were, to include the whole of Metropolitan Toronto (""Metro"", which in 1998 became the present amalgamated city of Toronto). Only one overnight route (the Queen streetcar, later 501 Queen, to Long Branch loop) extended a significant distance into the suburbs."
"In 1974, after the subway had been extended beyond the Toronto city limits in three directions, the same was done for overnight bus service. But large areas of Metro still remained without 24-hour transit — Etobicoke, North York, and Scarborough each had only one or two routes — as late as 1986, when the TTC's planning department issued a report on ""Metro All-Night Transit Service"" calling for major changes."
"The report pointed out that the importance of the original ""demand generators"" for overnight public transit had declined. Nightly demand was now twice as heavy on weekends as on weekdays, showing that not many people were using transit to get to night work. And as Metro had grown, only 45% of its population still lived within a 15-minute walk of the existing 24-hour transit routes. In fact, hardly any of the 14 overnight routes then in existence were strictly justified by demand any more, particularly on weekdays. But since ""one of the TTC's primary goals is to maximize mobility and accessibility to transit service"", the report's recommendation was to redesign the system, not eliminate it."
"Most of Toronto has a squarish grid of main streets that originated as township roads and are spaced at 1¼-mile intervals (about 2 km). By running overnight buses along every second road in the grid, all parts of Metro would be reached and 86% of the population would be within a 15-minute walk (taken as 1.25 km or ¾ mile). To avoid excessively long trips, some grid streets such as Eglinton Avenue would require two bus routes meeting end-to-end, but still just 15 routes would be needed to form the grid. The 506 Carlton route had sufficient traffic to be retained in addition, for a total of 16 routes."
"This is what the report proposed. In changing from the old network of 14 routes to the new set of 16, only 2 routes would be entirely unchanged. There would be 11 entirely new overnight routes (all bus-operated), with 7 existing ones eliminated (3 streetcar, 3 trolleybus, and only 1 bus route, as the night network would be shifted away from the streetcar tracks and trolleybus wires)."
"Despite the route eliminations and probable increased ridership, the changes could not be expected to finance themselves. The report recommended reducing service frequencies after 10 p.m. on certain routes in order to offset the increased costs."
"The Commission agreed to the expanded service, but could not stomach the elimination of so many routes. Instead, they chose to retain all existing routes despite the cost, creating a 23-route night system."
"Until this time, with the exception of buses that replaced subway lines, it had been understood that overnight transit was provided by regular routes that happened to have 24-hour service. Night services retained the same route names and numbers as their daytime counterparts, perhaps with a suffixed letter if there was a variation in the exact routing. But now a marketing decision was made to treat the overnight service as a new, distinct set of routes, even in those cases where the day route was identical."
"The name Blue Night Network was adopted, and with it the 300-series route numbers described above, and a new color-coding for bus and streetcar stops. The existing standard TTC-stop sign had a red square or stripe at the top and bottom; now, for all stops with 24-hour service, this was changed to red and blue, with the legend ""24 hr"" added. Those stops used only for the Blue Night Network, mostly for night routes paralleling the subway, received the standard sign with red changed to blue (and a notice of the limited hours). The Blue Night Network debuted in February 1987."
"In the 1990s, the TTC suffered major funding cuts and service on many low-traffic routes was reduced; the Blue Night Network lost three routes in February 1992, selected from those proposed for elimination in 1986. But other routes have been extended or added over the years, including one case (312 St. Clair in 2000) that required a mode conversion from streetcar to bus. In February 2003, two Blue Night routes were extended to reach Toronto Pearson International Airport."
"Then in 2005, several routes were added so that east–west service would run on every grid street instead of alternate ones in much of the city. This has brought the Blue Night Network up to a total of 24 routes, serving 97% of the city's population within a 15-minute walk."
"In the fall of 2015, the TTC expanded the Blue Night Network program, with 16 new or revised routes incorporated into the network as part of a $95 million investment made by Toronto City Council. This included the restoration of streetcar service on King Street as the 304 King and on Spadina Avenue as the 310 Spadina, operating entirely with low-floor Flexity streetcars. , the 310 Spadina, 306 Carlton, 304 King, and 301 Queen operate using accessible Flexity streetcars, with the remaining routes converted to the Flexity streetcars by the end of 2019 in line with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act."

", is a Japanese professional wrestler currently signed to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he performs under the mononymous ring name Kenta (stylised in all capital letters), and is a member of the Bullet Club stable."
"He is known for his time in Pro Wrestling Noah where he was a one-time Global Honored Crown (GHC) Heavyweight Champion, three-time GHC Junior Heavyweight Champion, three-time GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion, and one-time GHC Tag Team Champion; once was the inaugural reign with longtime partner and rival, Naomichi Marufuji, which saw the two hold the title for almost two years, as well as a reign with protégé Taiji Ishimori. He was also the winner of the 2012 Global League and the 2013 Global Tag League tournaments."
"He is also well known for his tenure in American promotion WWE where he worked under the name Hideo Itami in the company's developmental territory NXT and later in their cruiserweight exclusive brand 205 Live. A former amateur kickboxer, Kobayashi's wrestling style is based upon strong kicks and strikes. Kobayashi started his career in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), before moving to Pro Wrestling Noah; through Noah's involvement in the Global Professional Wrestling Alliance (GPWA), a global organization of cooperative promotions that allow their competitors to travel abroad to other companies, he has wrestled extensively in American promotion Ring of Honor (ROH)."
"Kobayashi was born on March 12, 1981, in Sōka, Japan. He trained under Kenta Kobashi and Yoshihiro Takayama."
"Prior to wrestling professionally, Kobayashi had a variety of athletic backgrounds, practicing baseball and kickboxing; the latter came to be a strong foundation in his wrestling style often referred to as shoot style. Kobayashi made his professional wrestling debut on May 24, 2000 against future ally and rival, Naomichi Marufuji, in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) to compete in their junior heavyweight division. He did not remain in the company long as Mitsuharu Misawa, acting president of AJPW, decided to secede from the company following a dispute with other forces, thus leading to Misawa forming his own company, Pro Wrestling Noah."
"One of Misawa's focuses in his new promotion was the junior heavyweight division, which never was treated with high regard in AJPW despite the successes in other promotions. Being sidelined with injuries for the majority of Noah's first year of operation, Kobayashi made his return in July 2001, simply named Kenta."
"Kenta's first involvement in a championship situation came when Naomichi Marufuji was forced to vacate the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship after suffering a knee injury; Kenta entered into the tournament held to determine a new champion. He advanced to the finals by defeating Kotaro Suzuki and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi before losing to Yoshinobu Kanemaru on the ""Navigation with Breeze Tour"" in June 2002. Following his relative success in the tournament, Kenta had an increase in his popularity, and he joined his mentor, Kenta Kobashi, in the faction Burning."
"March 1, 2003 saw Kenta team with Naomichi Marufuji for the first time against Makoto Hashi and Yoshinobu Kanemaru in a winning effort. They began teaming regularly as the two entered into a tournament to christen the first GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions during the company's ""Accomplish Our Third Navigation tour""; they went to win the tournament by defeating junior heavyweight veterans Jyushin Thunder Liger and Takehiro Murahama in the finals on July 16. While defending the tag team title, Kenta continued his venture in hopes of winning the GHC Junior Heavyweight title once again on November 30, 2003, in an unsuccessful bid against Takashi Sugiura."
"As part of a reward for the way Kenta performed, he earned himself a trial series of seven matches going into the next year, seeing Kenta able to challenge more established stars in an attempt to elevate his status. Kenta began his trial series on the ""First Navigation"" tour, beating Juventud Guerrera. This was followed by defeats to Yoshinari Ogawa and Jun Akiyama. The final match of the series was a loss against Marufuji in October. While the series was taking place, Kenta and Marufuji continued defending their title against a number of challengers: El Samurai and Ryusuke Taguchi, Yoshinari Ogawa and Kotaro Suzuki, Suzuki and Ricky Marvin, Marvin and Suwa and, on Noah's first Tokyo Dome show, against Kendo Kashin and Takashi Sugiura. Their reign as champions came to an end in June 2005 after almost two years by Kanemaru and Sugiura after the latter pinned Kenta."

= = = Brothers in Unity = = =
Brothers in Unity is a four-year secret society at Yale University. It used to be a debating society.
"The Society of Brothers in Unity at Yale College was founded by 21 members of the Yale classes of 1768, 1769, 1770 and 1771. The founders included David Humphreys, who is noted in the society's public 1841 catalogue as the ""cornerstone"" of the founding class. The society was founded chiefly to combat existing class separation among literary societies; prior to 1768, Yale freshmen were not ""received into any Society"", and junior society members were forced into the servitude of seniors ""under dread of the severest penalties"". Humphreys, a freshman of the class of 1771, persuaded two members of the senior class, three junior class members, two sophomores, and 14 freshmen to support the society's founding."
"Immediately after its conception, the society's unorthodox class composition was allegedly challenged by other literary groups at Yale College. According to its catalogue, Brothers in Unity only became an independent institution after persevering ""an incessant war"" waged by multiple traditional societies who did not support the concept of a four-year debating community. It is speculated that this struggle initiated the Brothers' near 250-year rivalry with Linonia, which previously did not initiate freshman members. Within a year, however, Brothers in Unity became fully independent, its popularity influencing other societies to reconsider their exclusion of first year students. The Yale College freshman class of 1771 yielded 15 members of Brothers in Unity, while Linonia accepted four; the first noted point in which underclassmen were publicly accepted into a Yale society. The Brothers adopted the motto between 1768 and 1769."
"Between its founding and 1841, the society is said to have followed the template of other debating societies, although operating under ""Masonic secrecy,"" according to 19th century Yale historian Ebenezer Baldwin. In conjunction with Linonia and the Calliopean Society, Brothers in Unity was noted by Baldwin to discuss ""scientific questions"" and gravitate towards ""literary pursuits."" This is substantiated by the Brother's own public documentation, which denotes that the society sought ""lofty places in science, literature, and oratory"" fields, as well as general ""intellectual improvement."""
"The Brotherhood, between the years of 1768 and 1841, claims membership of 15 Supreme Court Justices (seven of which Chief Justices), 6 United States Governors, 13 Senators, 45 Congressional representatives, 14 presidents of colleges and universities, two United States Attorney Generals, and a United States Vice President. In its catalogue, the Brotherhood also asserts: ""Every President of the United States, with the exception of two, has had in his cabinet one of our members, and the governor's chair of our own state has been filled for twenty years with Brothers in Unity."" 26 Yale valedictorians after the position's 1798 founding are attributed to the Society."
"Membership to the Brothers and the Linonian Society divided the students of Yale College beginning in the turn of the 19th century. Both held expansive literary collections, which they used to compete against each other. Between 1780 and 1841, the Brothers claimed right to more volumes than Linonia, although these assertions are disputed The two societies' rivalry extended to their membership. Brothers in Unity claims membership of John C. Calhoun, who was alphabetically assigned to Linonia, but had ""undiminished attachment"" to the Brothers. However, while publications released by both societies repeatedly assert superiority amongst each other, they also express positive sentiment; denoting each other as ""ornaments"" of Yale and ""generous rivals."""
"At the time of the formation of Yale's central library, Linonia and 'Brothers in Unity donated their respective libraries to the university. The donation is commemorated in the ""Linonia and Brothers Reading Room"" of Yale's Sterling Memorial Library. The reading room contains the Linonia and Brothers (L&B) collection, a travel collection, a collection devoted to medieval history, and a selection of new books recently added to Sterling’s collections."
"Following the transformation of Yale's debating societies into the Yale Union, and later, the Yale Political Union, Brothers in Unity and the Linonian Society ceased function as literary and debating societies. Both societies continued their existence in secrecy, recanting their roles as intellectual colloquiums and instead prioritizing power and social influence as paramount. Linonia morphed into the template of other Yale secret societies, although its current existence is still questioned and its membership is not disclosed to the public as of 2012. While unsubstantiated, Linonia is said to participate in Yale's April ""tap night,"" along with the college's senior societies."
"Unlike Linonia, Brothers in Unity refrained from association with the customs of Yale's senior societies. The society is rumored to tap a small cohort of members from each class during the fall semester, a notion in line with the organization's 1768 constitution and 1841 catalogue. Internally, the society is referenced as the ""Brotherhood,"" a community stressing unilateral action amongst members to acquire power in the realms of business, politics, and philanthropy. The society is said to have implemented methods of deterrence stemming from its 1768 constitution that prevent brothers from unearthing the identities of fellow members or disclosing internal actions of the brotherhood. However, public knowledge of specific traditions, discussions, and society regulations of Brothers in Unity ended after its 19th-century turn to secrecy, rendering most modern rumor as conjecture. It is rumored that the society maintains ""taplines"" into several of Yale's most prestigious senior societies, including Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Book and Snake, Myth and Sword, Elihu, and Mace and Chain."
"Though the society no longer discloses the names of its members, its presence on campus continued through the 19th and 20th centuries, with reported activity spanning into the turn of the 21st century. It is unknown whether men exclusively fill current membership of the Brothers, due to the integration of women into Yale's societal web."

The Old English Bulldog is an extinct breed of dog.
"The Old English Bulldog was compact, broad and muscular, as reflected in the well-known depiction ""Crib and Rosa"". Through John Scott's engraving, this painting became the best-known and most reproduced painting of dogs from that period. As described in the Philo-kuon standard from 1865, the average height was approximately , and they weighed about . A particular characteristic of the breed was the lower jaw that projected considerably in front of the upper jaw, which made possible a strong, vise-like grip."
"The English blood sport of bull-baiting allowed for a specialized breed in the form of the Old English Bulldog.The main locations in London for these exhibitions were the Westminster Pit, Beargarden and Old Conduit Fields. One of the breeders who spanned the transition period between the Old English Bulldog and the modern Bulldog was famous dog dealer Bill George."
"Historians are fairly confident that the Old English Bulldog is derived from ancient war dogs, such as the old Mastiff or the extinct Alaunt dog. Others believe that the true origin of the breed is not entirely clear. Depictions in old prints show that the variety was without doubt a small Mastiff with a comparatively long head. The word 'Mastiff' was eventually dropped when describing these smaller Mastiffs, as the Mastiff proper was found too slow for bull-baiting."
"Eventually, the Greyhound was crossed into the breed, increasing the Mastiff's speed without losing the breed's ferocity. This step reduced the Old English Bulldog's size and weight, with the Greyhound's features seen in specimens of that time."
"Two other recognized members of the breed can be seen in the 1817 painting ""Crib and Rosa"", with Rosa exemplifying the form and size of the ideal type of Old English Bulldog, albeit deficient in wrinkles about the head and neck and in substance of bone in the limbs. They are faster than regular bulldogs and have an average speed of ."
"Many authors bring us descriptions about the extinct bulldog, but a description stands out as one of the most extensive by William Hamilton Maxwell:"
"In England, the passage of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 caused a decline of bull-baiting and dog fighting, leading to a lack of interest in perpetuating the Old English Bulldog. Three dogs from the Duke of Hamilton's strain of Old English Bulldog, Wasp, Child, and Billy, were depicted in a painting and recognized as some of the last known members of the breed before they became extinct."
"Despite the laws making dog fighting illegal, the activity continued for many years. Breeders determined a cross between the Old English Bulldog and Old English Terrier created a superior fighting dog with increased quickness and dexterity. This new breed of dog, called the Bull and Terrier, was a precursor to the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, English Bull Terrier and American Pit Bull Terrier and accelerated the extinction of the Old English Bulldog."
"Several breeders are attempting to recreate this extinct breed, using known descendants of the Old English Bulldog lineage, with some success. As the breed went extinct long before DNA was recognized and little genetic material has survived, it is unclear how much the modern reincarnations of the breed resemble the original Old English Bulldog, and most of the recreations have purposely introduced differences in the breed compared to the original, most prominently reducing the breed's violent nature."
"One contemporary recreation of the breed started in the 1970s, using a breeding program developed for cattle at The Ohio State University. The lineage has since split into two, known as the Olde English Bulldogge and the Leavitt Bulldog, the Leavitt Bulldog being a lighter, more athletic dog. These modern day versions, though possessing similar physical abilities, do not have the violent temperament of the Old English Bulldog. The line-breeding was done with a foundation of half Bulldog, and the other half Bullmastiff and American Bulldog and American Pit Bull Terrier."
"There are several other recreations, including the Able Bulldog, Continental bulldog, Dorset Old Tyme Bulldogge, Olde English Bulldogge, Renascence Bulldogge, Victorian Bulldog and Wilkinson Bulldog."
"Often confused with the Old English Bulldog, the Bulldog is noted for its sweet disposition; however, it has maintained little of the speed and agility that were the definitive characteristics of the Old English Bulldog."
"= = = Battle of Gettysburg, second day = = ="
"During the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 2, 1863) Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee attempted to capitalize on his first day's success. His Army of Northern Virginia launched multiple attacks on the flanks of the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. The assaults were unsuccessful, and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides."
"After a short delay to assemble his forces and avoid detection in his approach march, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet attacked with his First Corps against the Union left flank. His division under Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood attacked Little Round Top and Devil's Den. To Hood's left, Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws attacked the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard. Although neither prevailed, the Union III Corps was effectively destroyed as a combat organization as it attempted to defend a salient over too wide a front. Gen. Meade rushed as many as 20,000 reinforcements from elsewhere in his line to resist these fierce assaults. The attacks in this sector concluded with an unsuccessful assault by the Confederate Third Corps division of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson against the Union center on Cemetery Ridge."
"That evening, Confederate Second Corps commander Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell turned demonstrations against the Union right flank into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and East Cemetery Hill, but both were repulsed."
"The Union army had occupied strong defensive positions, and Meade handled his forces well, resulting in heavy losses for both sides, but leaving the disposition of forces on both sides essentially unchanged. Lee's hope of crushing the Army of the Potomac on Northern territory was dashed, but undaunted, he began to plan for the third day of fighting."
"This article includes details of many attacks on the Union left flank (Devil's Den, the Wheatfield, and the Peach Orchard) and center (Cemetery Ridge), but separate articles describe other major engagements in this massive battle of the second day:"
"By the morning of July 2, six of the seven corps of the Army of the Potomac had arrived on the battlefield. The I Corps (Maj. Gen. John Newton, replacing Abner Doubleday) and the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) had fought hard on the first day, and they were joined that evening by the yet-unengaged troops of the XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum), III Corps (Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles), and II Corps (Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock), and on the morning of July 2 by the V Corps (Maj. Gen. George Sykes). The VI Corps (Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick) was still 30 miles (50 km) away in Manchester, Maryland, on that morning. They assumed positions in a fish hook shape about three miles (5 km ) long, from Culp's Hill, around to Cemetery Hill, and down the spine of Cemetery Ridge. The Army of Northern Virginia line was roughly parallel to the Union's, on Seminary Ridge and on an arc northwest, north, and northeast of the town of Gettysburg. All of the Second Corps (Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell) and Third Corps (Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill) were present, and the First Corps (Lt. Gen. James Longstreet) was arriving from Cashtown; only Longstreet's division under George E. Pickett did not participate in the battle on July 2."
"Robert E. Lee had several choices to consider for his next move. His order of the previous evening that Ewell occupy Culp's Hill or Cemetery Hill ""if practicable"" was not realized, and the Union army was now in strong defensive positions with compact interior lines. His senior subordinate, Longstreet, counseled a strategic move—the Army should leave its current position, swing around the Union left flank, and interpose itself on Meade's lines of communication, inviting an attack by Meade that could be received on advantageous ground. Longstreet argued that this was the entire point of the Gettysburg campaign, to move strategically into enemy territory but fight only defensive battles there. Lee rejected this argument because he was concerned about the morale of his soldiers having to give up the ground for which they fought so hard the day before. He wanted to retain the initiative and had a high degree of confidence in the ability of his army to succeed in any endeavor, an opinion bolstered by their spectacular victories the previous day and at Chancellorsville. He was therefore determined to attack on July 2."
"Lee wanted to seize the high ground south of Gettysburg, primarily Cemetery Hill, which dominated the town, the Union supply lines, and the road to Washington, D.C., and he believed an attack up the Emmitsburg Road would be the best approach. He desired an early-morning assault by Longstreet's Corps, reinforced by Ewell, who would move his Corps from its current location north of town to join Longstreet. Ewell protested this arrangement, claiming his men would be demoralized if forced to move from the ground they had captured. And Longstreet protested that his division commanded by John Bell Hood had not arrived completely (and that Pickett's division had not arrived at all). Lee compromised with his subordinates. Ewell would remain in place and conduct a demonstration (a minor diversionary attack) against Culp's Hill, pinning down the right flank of the Union defenders so that they could not reinforce their left, where Longstreet would launch the primary attack as soon as he was ready. Ewell's demonstration would be turned into a full-scale assault if the opportunity presented itself."
"Lee ordered Longstreet to launch a surprise attack with two divisions straddling, and guiding on, the Emmitsburg Road. Hood's division would move up the eastern side of the road, Lafayette McLaws's the western side, each perpendicular to it. The objective was to strike the Union Army in an oblique attack, rolling up their left flank, collapsing the line of Union corps onto each other, and seizing Cemetery Hill. The Third Corps division of Richard H. Anderson would join the attack against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge at the appropriate time. This plan was based on faulty intelligence because of the absence of J.E.B. Stuart and his cavalry, leaving Lee with an incomplete understanding of the position of his enemy. He believed that the left flank of the Union army was adjacent to the Emmitsburg Road hanging ""in the air"" (unsupported by any natural barrier), and an early morning scouting expedition seemed to confirm that. In reality, by dawn of July 2 the Union line stretched the length of Cemetery Ridge and anchored at the foot of the imposing Little Round Top. Lee's plan was doomed from its conception, as Meade's line occupied only a small portion of the Emmitsburg Road near the town itself. Any force attacking up the road would find two entire Union corps and their guns posted on the ridge to their immediate right flank. By midday, however, Union general Sickles would change all that."
"When Sickles arrived with his III Corps, General Meade instructed him to take up a position on Cemetery Ridge that linked up with the II Corps on his right and anchored his left on Little Round Top. Sickles originally did so, but after noon he became concerned about a slightly higher piece of ground 0.7 miles (1,100 m) to his front, a peach orchard owned by the Sherfy family. He undoubtedly recalled the debacle at Chancellorsville, where the high ground (""Hazel Grove"") he was forced to give up was used against him as a deadly Confederate artillery platform. Acting without authorization from Meade, Sickles marched his corps to occupy the peach orchard. This had two significant negative consequences: his position now took the form of a salient, which could be attacked from multiple sides; and he was forced to occupy lines that were much longer than his two-division corps could defend. Meade was furious about this insubordination, but it was too late to do anything about it—the Confederate attack was imminent."
"Longstreet's attack was delayed, however, because he first had to wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, circuitous route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order."
"Even so, and partly because of Sickles's unexpected location, Longstreet's assault did not proceed according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left to join a simultaneous two-division push on either side of the Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an ""en echelon"" style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast."
"Longstreet's attack commenced with a 30-minute artillery barrage by 36 guns that was particularly punishing to the Union infantry in the Peach Orchard and the troops and batteries on Houck's Ridge. Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division deployed in Biesecker's Woods on Warfield Ridge (the southern extension of Seminary Ridge) in two lines of two brigades each: at the left front, Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson's Texas Brigade (Hood's old unit); right front, Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law; left rear, Brig. Gen. George T. Anderson; right rear, Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning."
"At 4:30 p.m., Hood stood in his stirrups at the front of the Texas Brigade and shouted, ""Fix bayonets, my brave Texans! Forward and take those heights!"" It is unclear to which heights he was referring. His orders were to cross the Emmitsburg Road and wheel left, moving north with his left flank guiding on the road. This discrepancy became a serious problem when, minutes later on Slyder's Lane, Hood was felled by an artillery shell bursting overhead, severely wounding his left arm and putting him out of action. His division moved ahead to the east, no longer under central control."
"There were four probable reasons for the deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the III Corps were unexpectedly in the Devil's Den area and they would threaten Hood's right flank if they were not dealt with; second, fire from the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Law's Brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain was rough and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, Gen. Law, was unaware that he was now in command of the division, so he could not exercise control."
"A business opportunity (or bizopp) involves sale or lease of any product, service, equipment, etc. that will enable the purchaser-licensee to begin a business. The licensor or seller of a business opportunity usually declares that it will secure or assist the buyer in finding a suitable location or provide the product to the purchaser-licensee. This is different from the sale of an independent business, in which there is no continued relationship required by the seller."
"Eckhardt and Shane (2003) argue that when taking the path of entrepreneurship, one of the most important indictors for future entrepreneurship is the skill of finding the business opportunity. This is seen as the lynchpin around which the promise of entrepreneurial venture is to be built . Shane and Venkataraman state that individuals must possess prior knowledge and the cognitive properties necessary to value such knowledge in order to identify the new opportunity. This normally allows a triggering of the opportunity which can then move forward to scoping and validation."
"Napoleon Hill provided advice on achievement as necessary for success and within anyone's reach; ""The starting point of all achievement is desire. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small amount of fire makes a small amount of heat."" and Winston Churchill suggested similarly with a piece of inspiration; ""Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.""."
"A common type of business opportunity involves a company that sells bulk vending machines and promises to secure suitable locations for the machines. The purchaser is counting on the company to find locations where sales will be high enough to enable him to recoup his expenses and make a profit. Because of the many cases of fraudulent biz-ops in which companies have not followed through on their promises, or in which profits were much less than what the company led the investor to believe, governments closely regulate these operations."
"In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission receives complaints and helps coordinate enforcement action against fraudulent business opportunities."
"A business opportunity consists of four elements all of which are to be present within the same timeframe (window of opportunity) and most often within the same domain or geographical location, before it can be claimed as a business opportunity. These four elements are:"
"With any one of the elements missing, a business opportunity may be developed, by finding the missing element. A desirable characteristic is for the combination of elements to be unique. The more control an institution (or individual) has over the elements, the better they are positioned to exploit the opportunity and become a niche market leader."

= = = Abul Fateh = = =
"Abul Fateh (16 May 1924 – 4 December 2010) was a Bangladeshi diplomat, statesman and Sufi who was one of the founding fathers of South Asian diplomacy after the Second World War, having been the founder and inaugural Director of Pakistan's Foreign Service Academy and subsequently becoming Bangladesh's first Foreign Secretary when it gained its independence in 1971. He was Bangladesh's senior-most diplomat both during the 'Liberation War' period of its Mujibnagar administration as well as in peacetime."
"A former Carnegie Fellow in International Peace and Rockefeller Foundation Scholar and Research Fellow, he has been described as ""soft-spoken and scholarly"" and ""a lesson for all diplomats""."
"Exceptionally for a Bengali-born diplomat, he rose to the most senior ranks of public service in Pakistan. Then at the time Bangladesh began seeking independence, he spectacularly defected and changed sides to support the fledgling country of Bangladesh – a major propaganda coup and morale boost for the cause of Bangladeshi liberation given his stature in Pakistan's hierarchy. Fateh was automatically the highest-ranked and most senior foreign service officer in the new country. His story was later documented in a ""National Geographic"" documentary, ""Running for Freedom""."
"Following his death he was described by a former colleague and successor Foreign Secretary as ""a great and brave freedom fighter"" who was at the same time ""remarkably reticent about his contributions"", a ""soft-spoken and scholarly diplomat"" whose service to the Bangladeshi independence cause at a critical period was ""invaluable"" and ""a lesson for all diplomats. His outstanding professional skill and deep sense of patriotism should be a shining example"". The Foreign Minister of Bangladesh Dipu Moni talked about his ""contribution to self-right movements of people, country's independence struggle and managing assistance to war-ravaged country after independence."" She also cited his ""outstanding career"", stating that he would be ""always remembered for his contribution to the country's liberation"" war."
"Although rarely in the public eye, Fateh was a distinguished figure in the history of post-Second World War, post-colonial diplomacy, a public servant who was a leading light behind the scenes within the Developing World and Non Aligned Conference, including the Commonwealth, with a significant tour of duty in Washington D.C. at the height of the Cold War. In the West too Fateh came to be held in the highest regard, a rare joint U.S.A./U.K. intelligence assessment remarking in 1977 that he was: “very able, highly intelligent, moderate, easy to deal with, and well informed”."
"At the launch of his university's South Asia Centre in 2015, the President and Director of the London School of Economics Professor Craig Calhoun included Fateh in a list of a dozen public figures of the 20th century who he felt represented ""the greatest fruits"" of the ""close mutual relations between South Asia and the LSE""."
"Fateh was born in Kishoreganj on 16 May 1924 in a landowning family, to Abdul Gafur and his second wife Zohra Khatun. Fateh was a middle child, in a large family of a dozen children who survived to adulthood, while two other siblings died young. His father Abdul Gafur had attended Presidency College, Calcutta, and was one of the first Muslim ""daroga"" (sheriffs) in the British Raj. Fateh's mother Zohra was the daughter of a local nobleman. Fateh passed his matriculation exams from ""Ramkrishna"" High English School in Kishorganj in 1941. After passing his Intermediate exams from Ananda Mohan College in Mymensingh in 1943, he undertook higher studies in English Literature at Dhaka University (BA Honours in 1946 and MA in 1947) where he also excelled in sport, for a time captaining the cricket team and becoming the table tennis champion."
"While teaching English Literature at Brindaban College in Sylhet, he took the first Foreign Service exams of Pakistan (1948), before teaching English Literature for a few months at Michael Madhusudhan Datta College in Jessore. He joined the first batch of Pakistan Foreign Service trainees in 1949, moving to Karachi. Soon after he left for training in London, which included taking a special course at the London School of Economics, before he moved in 1950 to Paris to complete his training. Returning briefly to Karachi, he was sent back (1951) to Paris as Third Secretary in the Pakistan Embassy."
"A further posting as Third Secretary followed in Calcutta (1953–1956). During this time he married, at Rangpur on 5 January 1956, Mahfuza Banu of Dhubri, Assam daughter of Shahabuddin Ahmed, a respected lawyer and Mashudaa Banu a well known social campaigner. Then promoted to Second Secretary, he served in the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, D.C. from 1956 to 1960, during which time he and his wife had their two sons, one of whom, Aladin, is a strategy consultant, academic, artist and Editor Emeritus of the Bangladeshi news organisation Bdnews24."
"Fateh was a Director attached to the Foreign Ministry in Karachi from 1960 to 1963, during which time he was founding Director of Pakistan's Foreign Service Academy in Lahore and also went for a year and a half (1962–1963) to Geneva as a Fellow of the Graduate Institute of International Studies (""Institut Universitaire de Hautes Etudes Internationales"") under a Carnegie fellowship."
"Further foreign postings followed. He was First Secretary (and latterly acting chief of mission) in Prague from 1965 to 1966, Counsellor in New Delhi from 1966 to 1967, and Deputy High Commissioner in Calcutta from 1968 to 1970. He received his first posting as ambassador, at the Pakistan Embassy in Baghdad, in 1970."
"After the Pakistani military crackdown in March 1971, Fateh received a request from a former university dormitory mate, Syed Nazrul Islam, now Acting President in the Bangladesh government-in-exile, to join the liberation struggle."
"At about the same time, in July 1971, Fateh received a summons from the Pakistan Foreign Ministry to attend a conference in Tehran of regional Pakistani ambassadors. He chose to take his official car ostensibly to drive to Tehran but, as he and his driver approached the Iran–Iraq border, he feigned chest pains and ordered the driver to return him home, where he arrived that evening. Saying that he would take a plane the next day, he dismissed the driver. That night, he fled with his wife and sons across the border into Kuwait, where they were assisted by officials attached to the local Indian Embassy to take a plane to London."
"The announcement of Fateh's defection to the Bangladesh cause marked the first time a full ambassador had joined the fledgling Bangladesh diplomatic service. The news was received with fury by the military regime in Islamabad, duped by what was later described as a ""cool and calculated James Bond-type adventure"" and a calculated plunge into danger. It was a dramatic defection which created sensation in diplomatic circles and greatly boosted the morale of those engaged in the war of liberation. The Yahya Khan military regime in Pakistan was furious and requested the British Government to extradite Fateh from London, but the requests were rebuffed by the British Government. These events were chronicled in a 2003 National Geographic Channel television documentary, ""Running for Freedom."""
"The Mujibnagar government made him ambassador-at-large, followed in August 1971 by the concurrent position of Advisor to the Acting President, a position he was to resign in January 1972 after the return to Bangladesh of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He had a key role managing relations with the United States and India whilst heading the nascent country's diplomatic service. As the senior-most diplomat of the Bangladesh movement in the United Nations delegation under Justice Abu Sayed Choudhury which was in New York in September 1971 to lobby for the Bangladesh cause at the General Assembly, he played a vital role in the delegation's lobbying efforts. He was also in communication with other governments, such as the Nixon administration in the United States and also with Senators, Congressmen, and high officials in the US Administration, World Bank, and IMF; he had the advantage as well of being familiar with decision-makers and the decision-making process having served as a diplomat in Washington 20 years earlier. Former colleague Syed Muazzem Ali described him as a ""soft-spoken and scholarly diplomat"" who was exceptional in articulating the cause and whose contributions were invaluable. He was one of the first high officials to reach Dhaka after its liberation, and was quartered with other senior officials in Bangabhaban until January 1972. He was also the highest Bangladeshi official in Dhaka until the acting president and cabinet arrived after independence; on his arrival in Dhaka he was driven under escort from the airport, becoming the first civilian official to lay a wreath at the ruins of the Shaheed Minar, an act planned to mark the first presence of the government in Dhaka. Already the effective head of the incipient foreign service, he became Foreign Secretary at the end of 1971, playing a key role in formulating Bangladesh's foreign policy."
"He then took up the position of Bangladesh's first Ambassador in Paris (1972–1976). The early part of this posting involved extensive travel in Africa to persuade African governments to recognise the independence of Bangladesh. In 1973 he represented Bangladesh at a Commonwealth conference for Youth Ministers in Lusaka. In 1975 he went to Morocco and, at a time of a shortage in supply of phosphates, managed to secure a substantial phosphate shipment for Bangladesh."
"In mid-1975 he was selected to be High Commissioner in the UK, which post he took up in early 1976. His two years in London (1976–1977) saw him Chairing the Commonwealth Conference on Human Ecology and Development and the Bangladesh government approved his recommendation that dual citizenship be permitted. Many people from Bangladesh were settled in the UK, whose remittances into Bangladesh were an important source of foreign exchange. He pointed out that to oblige them to forgo Bangladesh citizenship if they took up the benefits of British nationality was not conducive to the continued maintenance of their ties to the mother country."
His last post was as ambassador in Algiers (1977–1982). He represented the Bangladesh government at conferences on Namibia in Algiers of the United Nations (1980) and the Non Aligned Conference (1981). He retired from that post in 1982.

= = = Samskara (film) = = =
"Samskara (English title: Funeral Rites) is a 1970 Kannada-language film written by U. R. Ananthamurthy based on his eponymous novel, and directed and produced by Pattabhirama Reddy. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao was executive director for the film. It is considered a path-breaking film that pioneered the parallel cinema movement in Kannada. ""Samskara"" won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film (1970)."
"The word ""samskara"" means ""ritual"" in Kannada. The Madras Censor Board banned ""Samskara"" because it was felt that the strong anti-caste message of the film could spark tensions among the public. The ban was revoked by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The film was released and it went on to win awards at national and international levels."
"The story is set in a street in a small village called Durvasapura in the Western Ghats of Karnataka. A majority of the people who live in the street belong to the community of Madhwas (a Brahmin community). The people who stay here have a traditional mindset and strictly follow the rules defined by their religion. Two of the main characters in the story are Praneshacharya (Girish Karnad) and Narayanappa. Praneshacharya is a devout Brahmin who has completed his Vedic education at Varanasi and has returned to Duravasapura and is considered as the leader of the Brahmin community of his village and the surrounding ones. His main goal is to attain liberation (""moksha"") and he is willing to go to any length to achieve it. To remain focused on his goal and as an act of self-sacrifice, he marries an invalid woman and hence remains celibate."
"The other main character, Narayanappa, a Brahmin by birth but one who has rejected the set rules of Brahminism by eating meat and by keeping the company of a prostitute named Chandri. Once Narayanappa and his friends catches the sacred fish in the temple tank, cooks, and eats them. This causes the Brahmins in the villages to rise up against him. They approach Praneshacharya to throw him out of the village. Praneshacharya decides against taking this extreme step and he believes that Narayanappa can be convinced to get rid of his immoral acts. Once Narayanappa visits Shimoga and he returns to Duravasapura with high fever and dies. The Brahmins are left in a piquant situation because, according to Brahmin principles, a person who dies should be cremated as early as possible. None of the Brahmins wants to cremate the body — they feel that by cremating Narayanappa's body, they will become polluted as he was against the Brahmin principles during his life."
"However, the Brahmin principles also stipulate that a non-Brahmin cannot cremate the body of a Brahmin. Praneshacharya, being the leader, is responsible for finding the solution to this difficult problem. He reads the holy books, but they do not provide any solution. He then goes to a temple to pray to God and spends a whole day there. Disappointed at not being able to solve the problem, he trudges back home. On his way, he encounters Chandri. He is mesmerised by her beauty and when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he finds himself lying on Chandri's lap. Chandri rushes home, finds that Narayanappa's body has started to rot, gets it cremated in secrecy, and leaves Durvasapura. Praneshacharya is left in a piquant situation on whether he has to reveal his immoral act to the people of the village or keep quiet about it. Feeling guilty, he leaves the village but the guilt never leaves him. Finally deciding to own up to his act, he returns to the village and the story ends there. It's left to the imagination of the viewer on whether Praneshacharya owns up or not."
"The story was written by U. R. Ananthamurthy in 1965, while a student at the University of Birmingham for his Ph.D. He saw the film ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957) by Ingmar Bergman and was deeply moved by it. His tutor Malcolm Bradbury suggested he write about his experiences in India concerning the multilayered structure of time in Indian society."
"After completing the story, he sent the manuscript to Girish Karnad in India who got in touch with Pattabhirami Reddy and S. G. Vasudev, a painter, both with Madras Players, a Madras-based amateur acting group. Impressed by the theme of the story, Reddy decided to produce and direct it. Vasudev became the art director and also brought in Tom Cowan, a photographer with the Commonwealth Documentation Division, Australia, as the cinematographer. Cowan, in turn, brought his friend Steven Cartaw as the editor. The initial casting for the film was done from the Madras Players before choosing the rest in Bangalore."
"The film required a localized dwelling of Brahmins as the setting and Vasudev found one in Vaikunthapura, near Sringeri in Mysore State (now Karnataka). Despite intervention from the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, the makers received cooperation from the locals during filming. In an interview with ""The Times of India"" in 2014, Ananthamurthy said, ""Vaikunthapura had a population of pure Brahmins. But the women of the agrahara where we shot the movie let Tom [Cowan] enter the kitchen. If the locals had known the theme, they would have never allowed the shooting to take place. They must have regretted it after the film's release. But the place became famous after the movie"". Cowan worked for 30 days, shooting 900 shots at an average of 30 shots per day, before the film was completed in a paltry 90,000."
"""Samskara"" was the first Kannada film to be directed and produced by Pattabhirami Reddy who had mainly dealt with Telugu films. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao was the executive director of the film. The film was also notable for it was the first Kannada film to not use excessive use of cosmetics for the artistes, music and dance, and for being made entirely with an amateur cast, most of whom were poets, writers and journalists. ""Samskara"" was initially banned by the Madras Censor Board in late 1969. It was the first Kannada film to receive a ban. The Board however gave no reasons for the ban in its letter to the makers. It was later revoked by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting."
= = = Democratic and Republican Left group = = =
The Democratic and Republican Left group ( or GDR) is a parliamentary group in the National Assembly including representatives of the French Communist Party (PCF).
"The electoral record of the French Communist Party (PCF) in 2007 was marked by dismal performances, first in the presidential election in which the party's national secretary Marie-George Buffet stood as a candidate supported by the PCF within the framework of an anti-liberal alliance; she was routed in the first round, receiving just 1.93% of the overall vote, a result deemed ""catastrophic"" for the party. The party's result in the subsequent legislative elections was similarly middling: though it outpaced the projections of pollsters, which placed it between only 5 and 15 seats, it still fell short of the threshold of 20 deputies, then required for the formation of a parliamentary group in the National Assembly. As a result, Alain Bocquet, outgoing leader of the preceding communist group in the assembly, demanded on 18 June that the requirement for the number of deputies to form a political group be lowered to 15 from 20 then needed, with a total of 15 deputies elected under the PCF label in the legislative elections (not counting PCF dissident Maxime Gremetz or PCF associate deputies Jean-Pierre Brard and Jacques Desallangre). Bocquet, referring to the recent election of Nicolas Sarkozy in the presidential election, added ""if the president of the Republic is a democrat, he will prove it"", further arguing that ""contrary to all predictions, the conditions for the constitution of a communist group in the National Assembly have been met, and their recognition is only a regulatory formality""."
"During the evening of 17 June, the second round of the legislative elections, Buffet issued an appeal to form an ""open"" group to carry the ""people's voice"" in the National Assembly, singling out the Greens (VEC) as a potential target. PCF spokesperson Olivier Dartigolles speculated that the party could secure an alliance ""with the non-inscrits, with the elected officials of the DOM-TOM, with the progressive elected officials of the left"", believing that the other forces on the left were sufficient to constitute a parliamentary group. Recognizing the predicament of the PCF, ecologist deputy Noël Mamère proposed that evening that the four members of the Greens elected in the legislative elections join the communist deputies in order to provide the necessary support to form a political group in the National Assembly, saying that he believed that the Green deputies accept the opening proposed by Buffet, hoping to sit along the PCF and others on the left in an ""autonomous group"" in the National Assembly, independent of the Socialist Party (PS); he later added that his invitation was also extended the Movement of Citizens of Jean-Pierre Chevènement, the Radical Party of the Left (PRG), and miscellaneous left. Bocuqet on 18 June indicated that ""the group was open to the world"" but did not signify that it would accept the support of the Greens in order to establish a group."
"Despite this initial outreach to the Greens, however, Buffet's initiative to form a common group with the Greens was ultimately rebuffed, ending the possibility of a ""communist, republican and ecologist"" group as envisaged by Mamère. Discussions between Mamère, PCF deputy Patrick Braouezec, and miscellaneous left deputies including Gérard Charasse were briefly initiated with the apparent support of the leadership of the PCF, which sought to strengthen its position in the assembly and diminish troublemakers within it ranks; however, these ultimately came to no avail, with Bocquet believing that an alliance with the Greens would be unfeasible during the debates of the Grenelle de l'environnement and legislation proposed as a result. Maxime Gremetz, ousted from the communist federation in the Somme and antagonistic towards the national party, made conditional his membership of a parliamentary group contingent on his demand that he and the other communists in the Somme excluded from the departmental federation be permitted to rejoin. With 18 total communist deputies, it was therefore necessary to seek two additional deputies for the formation of the group."
"Unable to pass the threshold of 20 deputies on their own, however, the communists – Bocquet in particular – were eventually forced to reopen the door to the Greens and PRG, with Mamère proposing a ""radical, communist, and green"" group. Though the PCF continued to petition for a lowering of the bar for a parliamentary group from 20 to 15 deputies, the necessary change of regulation required the assent of a majority of the National Assembly, then controlled by the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). There being no guarantee that this would happen, Bocquet said that the communists needed to act with ""pragmatism"". The Democratic and Republican Left group (""groupe de la Gauche démocrate et républicaine"") was ultimately formed on 26 June with 24 deputies, Jean-Claude Sandrier becoming its first president; it included the deputies of the PCF (with the exception of André Gerin, who refused to join), four Greens, and two miscellaneous left deputies: Alfred Marie-Jeanne for Martinique and Huguette Bello for Réunion."
"After leaving the PS along with Jean-Luc Mélenchon to co-found the Left Party, Marc Dolez left the Socialist, Radical, Citizen and Miscellaneous Left group to join the GDR group as an associate deputy before becoming a member on 27 January 2009. On 11 July 2010, Anny Poursinoff of the Greens was elected in a by-election in Yvelines's 10th constituency, defeating Jean-Frédéric Poisson, thus becoming the 26th member of the GDR group. On 1 September 2010, the Green deputy Yves Cochet took over the presidency of the GDR group. Maxime Gremetz was expelled from the group on 12 April 2011 after interrupting a parliamentary meeting about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and subsequently resigned from his seat on 16 May. Cochet left the GDR group on 6 December after being designated as an MEP, and was replaced by Roland Muzeau; this decision reflected the dissatisfaction of the Left Front at the decision of their ecologist partners, now known as Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV), to present a common candidate with the PS against incumbent François Asensi in Seine-Saint-Denis's 11th constituency. The four ecologist deputies subsequently left the GDR group, Cochet departing on 6 December to take his seat as an MEP and the three others quitting on 7 December. Jacques Desallangre left the group on 17 February 2012."
"Following the 2012 legislative elections, André Chassaigne was designated by the 10 deputies of the Left Front to form a parliamentary group, with only 15 deputies now required to form a parliamentary group, again raising the possibility of seeking support from ""progressive"" deputies representing Réunion, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. With the support of two such deputies already confirmed, as previous members of the group, the support of two newly elected deputies in Martinique, Jean-Philippe Nilor and Bruno Nestor Azerot, was sought out. The search for the fifteenth deputy proved difficult; though Ary Chalus of Guadeloupe, another newly minted deputy, was expected to join the group, the situation was complicated by Chalus's statement on 21 June that he would associate with the Socialist group. The continued existence of the group was finally assured with the confirmation that Gabriel Serville of the Guianese Socialist Party (PSG) would sit with the GDR in the assembly, the group now reduced to 15 deputies."
"In the 2017 legislative elections, the PCF and la France Insoumise, the movement founded by Jean-Luc Mélenchon prior to the presidential election, failed to establish an alliance to run common candidates in the legislative elections. Both subsequently decided to form separate parliamentary groups; Chassaigne declared that the GDR would continue on 21 June, including 11 of its own deputies and 4 from overseas France, but would not oppose the initiatives of the la France Insoumise group. Mélenchon's insistence on voting discipline respecting his movement's program proved an obstacle in any potential alliance between the two. At the time of its formation on 27 June, the parliamentary group included 16 deputies."

"Strava was founded in 2009 by Mark Gainey and Michael Horvath, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. During the early years of Strava, both founders held CEO positions before being succeeded by current CEO James Quarles who joined from Instagram. Strava has not published numbers of its user base and paying users although the service claims it was adding one million new users every 45 days, with 8 million activities uploaded each day."
"Strava depends on GPS, in mobile phones or other GPS-enabled devices, to record supported activities which can be shared among user's followers or shared publicly. If an activity is publicly shared, Strava automatically groups activities together, when they occur at the same time and place (for example, taking part in an organised marathon/sportive or group run/ride). Each activity, depending on which activity selected, shows users' activity results, including route summary in map view form, elevation (net and unidirectional), speed (average, min/max), timing (total and moving time), power (with optional accessory) and heart rate (with optional accessory). Each activity post has ""Kudos"", enabling followers to like followed activity and leave comments."
"Strava Slide is a fork of iD Editor for OpenStreetMap, which allows map editors to draw roads and trails more accurately using the same aggregated and anonymized GPS data. Cycling and running traffic may be monitored by everyone on the Strava Heatmap page which shows a global heatmap."
"In July 2015, Strava switched to Mapbox maps and imagery, based on OpenStreetMap data. Strava allows users to report issues with the maps, which are linked to the OpenStreetMap editor so that users can contribute improvements to the map."
Strava has a Trophy system in the form of periodic challenges that require completing either a running or cycling activity within a certain range of distance or elevation. Each activity has its own trophy badge shown in the Strava Trophy case and limited rewards if the Challenge is held by Strava partners.
"In July 2018, Strava discontinued its Strava Premium subscription system and announced its replacement, Strava Summit, which divides Strava Premium benefits into three different categories,"
"Strava Summit includes a ""Suffer Score"" if heart rate data is available during an activity. The Suffer Score allows Strava to rank user activities, which is used for Strava's Training Plans and customized goals. Other features of the subscription include Beacon, live location tracking of the athlete for family and trusted friends, Live Performance Data and Live Segments, used to check real time information and compare athlete's best available record in Strava, and Strava Premium only Leader-board, Power Meter Analysis, Race Analysis, Workout Analysis, GPX Export, Personal Heatmap and Trophy Case."
"In November 2017, Strava published a ""Global Heatmap""—a ""visualization of two years of trailing data from Strava's global network of athletes."" In January 2018, an Australian National University student studying international security discovered that this map had mapped military bases, including known U.S. bases in Syria, and forward operating bases in Afghanistan, and HMNB Clyde—a Royal Navy base that contains the United Kingdom's nuclear arsenal. The findings led to continued scrutiny over privacy issues associated with fitness services and other location-aware applications; Strava's CEO James Quarles stated that the company was ""committed to working with military and government officials"" on the issue, and would be reviewing its features and simplifying its privacy settings."
"In July 2019, Strava terminated access to its APIs to Relive—a service that allows fitness data to be combined with multimedia to generate video recaps. Strava considered this to be in violation of its terms of service, which forbids the API's use with services that ""replicate Strava sites, services or products"", and the combination of ""Strava data"" with any other customer data. Relive had recently introduced social networking features; the features were subsequently removed, but Strava did not reverse its decision. ""DC Rainmaker"" disputed the decision, presenting an opinion that ""Strava data"" constituted personally-identifiable information under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), meaning that users had rights to control how it is used by Strava—including third-party processing that they had already agreed to by linking Relive to Strava, and noted other examples of similar services (such as Trailforks) engaging in similar if not more extensive use of ""Strava data"", and that Strava had previously endorsed Relive on several occasions."

= = = African-American Muslims = = =
"African-American Muslims, also colloquially known as Black Muslims, are a religious minority among both African American and Muslim populations of the United States. They are represented in various self-described Muslim sects such as the Nation of Islam. There's also a sizeable minority of Salaf among African American as most have left former ideologies of black nationalism based forms of Islam once perceived as correct to a more pure, unadulterated authentic Islam from the first three generations of Muslims. The goal is to follow the true Prophetic teachings within the limits of the law of the country, such as correct prayer, proper dress and respect for women and children. The history of African American Muslims is related to African-American history, in general, and goes back to the Revolutionary and Antebellum Eras."
"Historically, between 15% and 30% of slaves brought to the Americas from West/ Central Africa were Muslims. Most of these captives were forced into Christianity during the era of American slavery; however, there are records of individuals such as Omar ibn Said living the rest of their lives as Muslims in the United States. During the twentieth century, some African Americans converted to Islam, mainly through the influence of black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive Islamic practices including the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded in 1913, and the Nation of Islam, founded in the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people by 1963. Prominent members included activist Malcolm X and boxer Muhammad Ali. The Indian-originated Ahmadiyya Muslim movement also sought converts among African Americans in the 1920s and 1930s."
"Malcolm X is considered the first person to start the movement among African Americans towards mainstream Islam, after he left the Nation and made the pilgrimage to Mecca. In 1975, Warith Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muhammad took control of the Nation after his father's death and guided the majority of its members to orthodox Islam. However, a few members rejected these changes, in particular Louis Farrakhan, who revived the Nation of Islam in 1978 based largely on the ideals of its founder, Wallace Fard Muhammad."
"African-American Muslims constitute 20% of the total U.S. Muslim population. The majority are Sunni and their percentages have been subdivided into three subsets, namely Sunnism (65%), Shiaism (11%) and non-denominational Muslims (24%). though some of these identify under the community of W. Deen Mohammed. The Nation of Islam led by Louis Farrakhan has a membership ranging from 20,000–50,000 members."
"During the first half of the 20th century, a small number of African Americans established groups based on Islamic and Gnostic teachings. The first of such groups created was the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded by Timothy Drew (Drew Ali) in 1913. Drew taught that black people were of Moorish origin but their Muslim identity was taken away through slavery and racial segregation, advocating the return to Islam of their Moorish ancestry."
"Pew Research Center has subdivided the American Muslim community and their percentages into three subsets, namely Sunnism (65%), Shiaism (11%) and non-denominational Muslims (24%). Sunni is a term derived from sunnah (سُنَّة /ˈsunna/, plural سُنَن sunan /ˈsunan/) meaning ""habit"", ""usual practice"", ""custom"", ""tradition"". The Muslim use of this term refers to the sayings and living habits of the prophet Muhammad. Its adherents are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jamāʻah (""the people of the sunnah and the community"") or ahl as-sunnah for short. In English, its adherents are known as Sunni Muslims, Sunnis, Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah. Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as ""orthodox Islam"". The Quran, together with hadith (especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah) and binding juristic consensus form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam. Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources, in conjunction with analogical reasoning, consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion, using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools."
"Although many African Americans ancestors were Muslims prior to being kidnapped to America the period of brutal enslavement had done much to rob the cultural and religious identity of many, the story of Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ibn Sori, a Muslim prince from West Africa who was made a slave in the United States and freed 40 years later, is a testament to the survival of Muslim belief and practice among enslaved Africans in America. el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz, also known as Malcolm X, is credited with being the catalyst for bringing the black community to Islam in general and as being the pioneer in leading Black Muslims to Ahlus Sunnah specifically. In the weeks after he left the Nation of Islam, several Sunni Muslims encouraged Malcolm X to learn about their faith. He soon converted to the Sunni faith and was followed by thousands from the Nation of Islam. Warith Deen Mohammed rose to leadership of the Nation of Islam in 1975 following the death of his father Elijah Muhammad and began the groundbreaking, though sometimes controversial, process of leading Black Muslims out of the NOI and into Sunni Islam. As a result of his personal thinking and studies of the Quran, he became part of Ahlus Sunnah during a term in federal prison from 1961-1963 for refusing induction into the United States military."
"Mohammed introduced many reforms and began an information campaign about Sunni Islam much as El Hajj Malik el-Shabazz had years earlier. He stated that Fard was not divine and that his father was not a prophet. All of the over 400 temples were converted into traditional Islamic mosques, and he introduced the Five Pillars of Islam to his followers. He rejected literal interpretations of his father's theology and Black-separatist views and on the basis of his intensive independent study of Islamic law, history, and theology, he accepted whites as fellow worshipers. However, he also encouraged African Americans to separate themselves from their pasts, in 1976 calling upon them to change their surnames which were often given to their ancestors by slave masters. He forged closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities, including Hispanic and Latino American Muslims. By 1978 he had succeeded in leading the majority of the original NOI to Sunni Islam which still stands as the largest mass conversion to Islam in the United States. In many urban areas of the United States today many Black Muslims in the Sunni tradition are known and recognized by the hijabs on women and kufi caps and long beards for men. These beards are grown as an adherence to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad for men to let their beards grow. Commonly called Sunnah beards, and Sunni Beards, among Muslims and more recently known as Philly beards have also gained popularity among non Muslim men emulating Muslim style."
"The Moorish Science Temple is an American organization founded in 1913 by Prophet Noble Drew Ali, whose name at birth was Timothy Drew. He claimed it was a sect of Islam but he also drew inspiration from Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and Taoism. Its significant divergences from mainstream Islam and strong African-American ethnic character make its classification as an Islamic denomination a matter of debate among Muslims and scholars of religion."
Its primary tenet was the belief that they are the ancient Moabites who inhabited the Northwestern and Southwestern shores of Africa. The organization also believes that their descendants after being conquered in Spain are slaves who were captured and held in slavery from 1779–1865 by their slaveholders.
"Although often criticized as lacking scientific merit, adherents of the Moorish Science Temple of America believe that the Negroid Asiatic was the first human inhabitant of the Western Hemisphere. In their religious texts adherents refer to themselves as ""Asiatics"", presumably referring to the non-Mongoloid Paleoamericans (see Luzia Woman). These adherents also call themselves ""indigenous Moors"", ""American Moors"" or ""Moorish Americans"" in contradistinction to ""African Moors"" or ""African Americans""."
"The Nation of Islam (NOI) was created in 1930 by Wallace Fard Muhammad. Fard drew inspiration for NOI doctrines from those of Timothy Drew's Moorish Science Temple of America. He provided three main principles which serve as the foundation of the NOI: ""Allah is God, the white man is the devil and the so-called Negroes are the Asiatic Black People, the cream of the planet earth""."
"In 1934 Elijah Muhammad became the leader of the NOI. He deified Fard, saying that he was an incarnation of God, and taught that he was a prophet who had been taught directly by God in the form of Fard. Two of the most famous people to join the NOI were Malcolm X, who became the face of the NOI in the media, and Muhammad Ali, who, while initially rejected, was accepted into the group shortly after his first world heavyweight championship victory. Both Malcolm X and Ali later became Sunni Muslims."
"Malcolm X was one of the most influential leaders of the NOI and, in accordance with NOI doctrine, advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. He left the NOI after being silenced for 90 days (due to a controversial comment on the John F. Kennedy assassination), and proceeded to form Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity before his pilgrimage to Mecca and conversion to Sunni Islam. He is viewed as the first person to start the movement among African Americans towards Sunni Islam."
"Muhammad died in 1975 and his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, became the leader of the Nation of Islam. He led the organization toward Sunni Islam and renamed it the World Community of Islam in the West the following year. Louis Farrakhan, who quit Warith Deen Mohammed's group, started an organization along the lines of Elijah Muhammad's teachings. Farrakhan renamed his organization the Nation of Islam in 1981, and has regained many properties associated with Elijah Muhammad, such as Mosque Maryam, its Chicago headquarters."
