one evening after thinking it over for some time harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight .
there wasn't any moon and harold needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight .
and he needed something to walk on .
he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost .
and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him ?
but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path so he left the path for a shortcut across a field .
and the moon went with him .
the shortcut led right to where harold thought a forest ought to be ?
he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest ?
how many trees are in this forest ?
yeah just one tree .
yeah just one ?
dah .

because he's trouble !
i'm watching him but he's still trouble .
even with me watching him right here .
joseph you're about to fall on your noggin .
you you don't quite have the balance to do that trick you were trying to do .
look at him catherine he's getting very daring !
the only problem with picking that piece of paper up joseph is that you're standing on it .
you're standing on it so it's not gonna come up !
now what are you gonna do .
why don't you turn the light on in thomas's room catherine .

do you think everything comes easy for them she asked ?
franklin had to think about that ?
oh you're right he is riding his bicycle ?
franklin went to the park ?
he saw beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars ?
each time she got to the third rung she fell into the sand below .
no beaver said bear do it like this it's easy .
easy for you said beaver she tried once more and fell again .
maybe tomorrow she grumbled .
franklin remembered when badger learned to swim .
she was afraid to put her head underwater ?
it's easy said franklin just do it .
badger sputtered and cried .
it took her a long time to feel good in the water ?
now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other .

she meets pete and repeat the school reporters outside the busy town broadcasting studio .
what a great idea pete says when hilda tells him about the cookie sale we'll take some .
reporters invite hilda inside the studio .
we'll help you sell your cookies they say .
hilda sees an interesting looking door .
i wonder what's in here she says .
that's the costume department pete says .
we keep all the costumes for the actors there .
take a peek inside we'll be back later ?
hilda opens the door ?
he knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see .
oh he's climbing up the mountain to see if he can find his bedroom .
oh he is .
let's see .
he hoped he could see the bedroom from the top of the mountain ?
oh ?
he looked down over the other side and he fell off .
there wasn't any other side to the mountain .
he was falling into ?
thin air .
but luckily he kept his wits and his purple crayon ?
and he made a hot air balloon and grabbed on .
he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in .
he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window .
he couldn't even see his house ?
so he made a house with windows and landed the balloon on the grass in the front yard .
none of the windows was his window though .
he tried to think where his window ought to be ?
oh it must be in back of the house i bet it's back behind the house right .
yeah .
he made some more windows .
he made a big building full of windows .
he made lots of buildings full of windows .
he made a whole city of windows .
but none of the windows was his window .
and he couldn't think where it might be .
he decided to ask a policeman .
the policeman pointed the way harold was going anyway but harold thanked him .
and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in his bed .
then .
he remembered .
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon .
oh where's the other hair elastic here it is .
and naima and mommy and daddy slept in the old house last night .
but we're going to go to the new house today .
maybe today .
later today .
oh library yes we're going to the library today we are .
we're gonna go to the library and see ?
who are we going to see there ?
do you remember who ?
mhm and some other mommies too ?
and we'll see the babies from the old group and we'll see the kids and toddlers from the new group ?
and we'll read books with everybody and we'll sit on our mommy's laps and have fun and play games ?
you combing his fur ?
who wants to read a book ?
doggie woggie wants to read a book ?
can you pick out a book for him ?
does he wanna pick a book ?
wanna help him pick a book ?
is there a book for him there .
what book does he like does he like pajamas ?
oh what one is that is that oh opposites .
does he want to sit and read it with us ?
you want to sit on my lap ?
he's gonna sit here okay ?
oh and naima's gonna sit here too okay why don't we sit back here .
yeah he's right here he can read too okay opposites oh the elephant and the bunny rabbit are on a .
what's that ?
seesaw opposites is the name of the book .
big and small short the pig is short and the giraffe is tall .
look that sheep has a balloon that's high .
and that sheep has a balloon but he is low .
fast who's fast .
it turned out to be an apple tree ?
the apples would be very tasty when they got red howard thought .
uh oh .
he put a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples .
he is going to scare harold .
it was a terribly frightening dragon .
it frightened harold and he backed away .
his hand holding the purple crayon shook ?
suddenly he realized what was happening but by then harold was over his head in an ocean .
he drew water .
but he came up thinking fast and in no time he was climbing aboard a trim little boat ?
he quickly set sail ?
ooh boy that's annoying huh ?
op it's gone ?
i think it was a car alarm .
what do you think ?
it was a car .
yeah i think so .
he quickly set sail and the moon sailed with him .
after he had sailed long enough harold made land without too much trouble .
he stepped ashore on the beach wondering where he was .
the sandy beach reminded harold of picnics and the thought of picnics made him hungry .
so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch ?
there was nothing but .
pie .
but there were all nine kinds of pie that harold liked best .
when harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left ?
he hated to see so much delicious pie go to waste .
so he left a very hungry .
moose and a deserving ?
porcupine to finish it up .
and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was .
lily loved school .
she loved the pointy pencils she loved the squeaky chalk and she loved the way her boots went clickety clickety click down the long shiny halls ?
lily loved the privacy of her very own desk .
and she loved the fish sticks and chocolate milk every friday in the lunch room .
and most of all she loved her teacher mister slinger .
mister slinger was sharp as a tack ?
he wore artistic shirts and glasses on a chain around his neck .
and he wore a different colored tie for each day of the week .
mhm and what color's this one .
right .
wow said lily .
that was about all she could say wow .
instead of greetings students or good morning pupils mister slinger winked and said howdy ?
he thought that desks in rows were old fashioned and boring .
do you rodents think you can handle a semicircle ?
and he always provided the most tasty snacks ?
things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy .
i wanna be a teacher when i grow up said lily .
me too said her friends .
what's on your book ?
really .
maybe some crayon ?
oh .
we'll have to try and clean that off ?
oh thank you .
oh very nice thanks honey .
at home lily pretended to be mister slinger ?
i'm the teacher she told her baby brother julius listen up .
lily even wanted her encyclopedias .
what's with lily asked her mother ?
i thought she wanted to be a surgeon or an ambulance driver or a diva said her father .
it must be because of her new teacher mister slinger said her mother .
Don't see why not.
"Some of it's useful, I mean"
What and that thing?
What?
That can be chucked.
"Well, we need it, the amount of stuff at the moment, and get rid of it  when we  know what we're doing with that thing."
Well we're gonna need two removal vans.
"Well if we have two removal vans, we have two removal vans!"
We didn't fit in the last one.
We only just fitted.
"The company pays for it, I don't care!"
And that was squeezing it.
But if the company pays for it I don't give a damn!
Hadn't you better contact Pickfords.
"Well they'll do it, I'm sure one"
Cos er they might sort of book them up ahead or something.
They'll do it in time.
They're not moving much at the moment.
Aren't they?
Well obviously not.
"Oh yeah, true !"
The housing market is hardly buoyant is it?
"So, in other words, you can  push them down a bit."
Did you get the er  bit they saved on the  stamp duty  to buy the kitchen?
It's possible.
Does that mean yes?
Oh good!
Mum was so embarrassed!
"She didn't know how you got the chee , the nerve to do it!"
Disgraceful!
"If you don't ask, you don't get anything."
"Don't ask, you don't get!"
Get it chopped up.
It's a great laugh!
Mm.
But we want one of those halogen jobs.
What are they called?
Hobs.
They are nice!
Mhm.
Not a bad price either.
What the halogen hobs?
Mm.
Oh you're joking!
About five hundred.
Not bad!
"You can't burn stuff on them either, can you?"
"On the halogen ones, no."
It's a
Exactly!
So that's a definite bonus!
"Well it wasn't, although they'd actually be going around burning ourselves anyway!"
"I do, you know those frying pans that you bought, the frying pans and saucepans?"
"An , you know the metal bit that's by the handle  that's a really poor safety device!"
Poor?
On the saucepans there's a metal rim  sort of piece at the end of the handle
Is there?
that that touches the actual saucepan
Yes.
when you pick that up you put your thumb on it!
I
And I burnt myself so many times on that!
Don't pick it up so close to the handle then!
Yeah but it's
That's just it.
"If we're to be, if we end up being audited on that, then we will fail the audit because we do not do that."
That's what I'm saying.
That is supposed to say what we do and what I'm saying is
Yeah.
we don't do that.
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it I'm saying we don't do it.
Well I'll leave that for you to manage.
"And, and procedures procedures should not say what we don't do."
"I, I agree with you."
They should say what we do do.
Or .
Or what we ought to do.
Yes.
Oh no.
No.
No.
Ah!
If if we're not complying with the procedures that's a different
"Well it, I mean if we go down that"
a different ball game.
path er Jim then we're gonna have er five or six set different volumes of procedures.
Yes.
Because we all do things slightly different at present.
If that is necessary then that is of course what happened and indeed in many cases that is exactly what happened.
There is nothing wrong
You have a dif
with that.
"But, but, but"
you have a different quality system for different offices.
But Hughie is
"Well you, you have to do in some cases ."
Not guilty.
"Also, that on the twenty first of June you've used the motor vehicle  at Worley on Accrington Road when there was no test certificate in force."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
"Also, that you failed to produce an insurance certificate on being required to do so."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
"And, finally that you failed to produce a test certificate."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Has he produced these documents to you Miss ?
No sir.
Have you got the insurance with you?
Yes.
The test certificate with you?
Everything my solicitor  was outside.
What?
"I give them to that solicitor that, I were talking to."
Which duty solicitor?
His duty solicitor's
Oh!
Mr .
.
likely to receive custodial sentences.
in this instance.
I can't see any harm  .
Would you like me to show the the prosecuting solicitor?
Well perhaps it'll save time.
.
Mm?
Knowing business effects it.
No  take them off.
Well Traidcraft's got loads to sell.
Not doing very well are you
No!
because I have this  erm dilemma.
Whether to just photocopy off a very good  original
Yeah
or do we print the whole lot.
And we came to the conclusion it was cheaper to print
Oh
than photocopy.
What  it's a bit slow isn't it?
"Yeah it depends, well you can get get it to run through copies but  the problem is that the cartridges for these printers they, they cost about fifty pounds."
Mm
They're not cheap.
So if I can do one run and then photocopy it.
Mm.
It a is actually a lot better because you can get them usually get them down to about  five p a copy.
"Well won't you lose, lose definition on the drawing though with a laser printer?"
No.
No?
No it's even better
Oh that's alright.
"Okay, no it's, I'm just going by the one at school and it, because it's all made up of little dots you"
"No, this is a laser printer."
This does it absolutely  it's not a dot printer it's it is a laser printer .
"Oh, well he keeps calling it his laser printer!seen it in action we don't see that well."
"So you, you said you could do it for five p a copy?"
"Well I r , I r , I reckon I reckon you can down to that, yeah."
That's printing both sides.
Yeah.
double sided printer and I I'll try and get that verified but
I think we could sell it I think we could sell it for
Okay.
"Could I briefly go back to liquidated damages, because there's nothing in the procedure, I think, that says what happens when you send that form to the client, he says, I haven't a clue."
What do you think?
Cos that's exactly what's gonna happen.
Because I've seen
Oh dear.
that form before and they will not know what to put on it or what they
You may be l well be right there.
Maybe  to tell them what liquidated damages
They need leading by the hand gentlemen.
Can't we just put a clause
"We need, we need, no."
They don't.
Organize everyone by us.
Perhaps we should set the course up.
Course up and .
Eh?
Absolutely I like that.
Yeah.
No.
It's very frustrating because I've never never known a client who knew what his losses were.
We'll run a course for project managers.
"As Hugh, Hugh is indicating that th that we have got a degree of expertise and we should be offering that expertise to clients."
Well we can tell him how much we'd be charging them to .
No.
No.
No.
"What we've got to do is say, look, within the terms of the contract"
This is what .
this is what you have to do.
You have to make a genuine pre-estimate of your
losses
"Give me a figure, that you might have seen in an advert, when you're drooling over BMWs and things, Maseratis."
Miles per hour.
Telling you about its acceleration.
What does it say?
Goes from nought to sixty.
Good.
In?
Six seconds.
Six seconds.
Nought to sixty in six seconds.
So those are the units of acceleration.
"From one speed to another speed,"
In however qu
"in so, so much time."
"So let let's say, instead of quoting from nought, they said well a much more useful figure is perhaps, which they do quote in lots of these car magazines, is erm forty to sixty"
Mm.
because that's what you need for overtaking someone.
"You can go from forty to sixty in point three seconds or something, you can really shoot past anything on the road."
"So forty to sixty, miles per hour, metres per second, whatever you like, let's say metres per second."
Let's say it goes from  forty to si forty metres per second to sixty metres per second in ten seconds.
"More of a slug, this car."
So what would that acceleration be?
How w what would the units of acceleration be?
Twenty metres per second per second.
"Twenty metres per second, per second."
Per second.
It's simpler to say per second per second .
"It's  Or per second squared, or second to the minus two."
"What is this rubbish, it doesn't, doesn't, cannot possibly mean anything real."
Mm.
"Well, it is real."
It's  erm fifty miles per hour  per hour.
Yeah.
"Right well we'd normally say, miles per hour per second."
"What's, what's your acceleration at the moment?"
Well it's ten miles per hour per second.
Okay?
"Well every second, I'm going"
I'm going ten miles an hour faster.
"So miles per hour per second, or you could measure it per hour if you wanted."
"Every hour, I'm going six hundred miles an hour faster"
So
so it's miles per hour per hour.
you'd need a stopwatch and a speedometer.
"You'd need a something to, I say, we've got something to measure the speed, radar gun,"
Mm.
"not interested in the distance, just the velocity, the speed."
How fast is that car going now?
"Okay, he's doing forty miles an hour."
Measure him again in one second's time
He's doing sixty.
"he's doing sixty miles an hour, so his acceleration was twenty miles per hour per second."
Per second.
"Twenty miles per hour per second,miles per hour, what's the change this miles per hour into metres per second."
"Okay, so,say a hundred and twenty metres per second per second."
And that's where your per second per second comes in.
Are you a bit happier with that?
Yeah.
But not totally convinced.
No .
"Erm  that length per time per time, is the unit."
Let's just have a little look.
What are the units of displacement?
Er
because it will be very complex.
"If you want to, if you start building a system that's gonna record every variation that's issued to the client and"
Make it simple.
print it all back again.
M see if we can make it
Yeah.
fairly simple.
"Could I just say at this point, this, this is one area where I would envisage us looking critically at what we're doing and, and, and, and altering things quite significantly over the next six months."
Keep it simple and build up on it
Beca
if we need to rather
Yeah.
than go the other way.
"Mainly because we're doing, we're trying to read the client's mind at the moment."
And w we we're putting together what we think the client wants.
"What I'm looking for is feedback from the clients which say, yeah, these reports are alright as far as they go but really I don't want all that information or I want this information."
Or
"And I would hope that we, we we enter into that with th that spirit and"
Mm.
"we're prepared to look at the the client reports and change them so that they become as good as we, we can get them."
Yeah.
Is there anything within these
It is the first step.
for the prediction of fees?
I mean we've just
Yes.
got something back from Intercity  on the P S work where they're wa wishing us to predict to certain date what we're gonna be spending over the next six months.
Nine months.
the football ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well
"You know, where's our right to life come from?"
I think you can far too sentimental about it!
"Erm  humans are more important than animals, you you cannot gi equate an animal life with human life."
We are the intelligent order.
"Being intelligent, we hope we won't be cruel to animals, but you can't say that we are, animals are just as important as humans."
Mhm.
"Wha , why do you think we are more intelligent than animals?"
"Well, for a start"
"You know , because we can have television"
we could
studios?
No!
"We can reason with each other, animals don't reason with"
But
other.
"We have conversations, animals don't have conversations!"
"We are, we are living in a world , we are living in a world where constantly there's violence, does that happen in the animal world!"
Yes of course it does!
Of course it does!
Of course it does!
To the same extent?
They're horrible!
Animals are terribly cruel to each other!
N no well
Yes?
I can't accept that!
"Surely if intelligence is the answer, you know, what about mentally handicapped children?"
"They're, they're not intelligent, does that mean they're just the same as animals?"
"If intelligence is the criteria, then an awful lot of us in this room would be used as test animals!"
Mhm.
We have a choice if we want to be involved in research
Mhm.
Yeah I know.
I use contractions in the newsletter some times which is deliberately honest.
It's like saying avoid cliches like the plague.
I mean I I'd having been  these comments and yes there are a couple of extra points put in there I think that that's fine.
It's nice to get some of it done.
What about the rest of you lads?
Well as soon as I have a window in my diary which I'm not
We'll let you off with the newsletter.
contribution it is said.
Alright I'll I'll undertake to to come up with something for our next meeting.
I mean all I I didn't I just did exactly what I was told.
I put brought out a list of points.
There's no grammar in there.
There's contractions all over the place because erm and all sorts.
I even used numbers instead of writing them out in full verse.
So erm
You can minute me and I'll erm
Did you use any semicolons?
Probably put a split infinitive as well.
Well I've got the checking erm.
Right so Steve is undertaking to be the next brave soldier to  write something for
I don't know what I'm doing.
The general
We have to be very busy.
I mean this this this item has actually been deferred two meetings and
Mm.
Yeah.
We'll just been too busy.
Then I'll try and get something if I get time but.
Okay
Still I suppose the time's it's the actual the calendar's starting to tick for having this  isn't it now.
"Yeah if we're actually ever gonna make use of it we will, joking aside, have to try and get something  ."
What  ?
"And straight away we say, well this procedure, doesn't work."
Yeah.
But it's
Right.
Yeah.
"come out, it's come out early."
Damn it all.
"We had a procedure erm about senior project engineers, er about two years before we"
We've gotta keep repeating that.
Er
does it?
put that into the bridge office in
Mhm.
intended .
Right.
"The thing with this , the thing that puzzles me a bit er"
Just because you booked that
"on this, and I'll reiterate this, is the process that we go through as I understand it for introducing procedures, is that we take a diagonal slice through the organization  er in other words there's a draft procedure produced."
That is sent round to people who will have been involved.
"They have the opportunity to input, it is amended er taking account of, of the comments"
Taking account of some of the comments.
It can never take account of all the comments.
Of course it can't.
It will always be compromise.
But by a very virtue of the draft going round and being commented on people are aware then
We don't see
.
Mm.
all the drafts
No.
Wh what wh where
Well after after the big box pile up I'm I'm free on the Green Party.
And then the elections and then get our act together.
I don't think we need to be too sorry at the reason we're not getting it written is we're far too busy lobbying MPs and making protests in the centre of town and things.
So it's probably good rather
On balance.
Right.
Any other business?
I've got a couple of things.
Do we have nominations for conference reps and local election candidates?
Because these will need to go in the selection ballot in the newsletter what I am going to write.
Oh er you mean from people here?
Well
Yes?
Or I mean the flood of phone calls that have no doubt saved the erm Green Party .
Oh I'd I'd like to be a a delegate at conference but I can't be a candidate this year cos I'm captain of my and I think I'll be a bit busy anyway to be honest doing press work.
It would be nice to have a break from doing it.
Right.
Anybody wish to be put forward as conference attender?
The number is unlimited is it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We have three voting certificates but you can pass them around
It's a shared job.
Yeah.
Oh might as well then.
You just have to be approved by the  that's all.
Yeah I'll do that thing.
Right so that's got three so far and
I mean I think if you're not sure whether you want whether you'll be able to go  I mean you can still you can still be a  delegate then if you do go then you're able to vote so.
So you'd like to be put down on the ballot to be approved do you?
Doesn't mean you have to go.
Just means that if you do go you
"But I'll write her a postcard to say, Yes it looks quite interesting when can we see the samples and can you tell us more about how the money works."
Yeah and confirm that that isn't a daily price.
I think that I'll have to confirm with the company.
Yes.
But it just just seems suspiciously cheap.
That twelve
Well I mean it's not the huge massive billboards.
I mean if they're just sort of four foot things I mean it's not you know I think.
Yeah perhaps.
Anyway  that's really into this idea.
Especially Bob's suggestion of calling for people to sponsor
Sponsor
sponsor a poster.
Erm should I at least be prepared to again stick something in the newsletter about .
As you say it's the sort of thing that might appeal to people because then they can go and look at their poster.
Be photographed next to it.
What do you think?
We could always do  posting on the side of the Conservative building.
Your direct your direct action at home.
Yes well come and visit you in prison.
Right does that cover billboards?
Yep.
no that was a good agenda item just got silly.
Okay.
Who wanted to talk about affiliation stroke working with other groups?
This is something we said we were going to discuss at a time in the future and I thought I'd stick it on and see how much time we'd got left.
Right.
Well we've got twenty five minutes at present shall we can you just wipe around a couple of other things and then we'll come back to that if time remains?
Yes do.
Okay.
Right intro leaflet.
Do I hear apathy?
"What I'm looking for, this is part of"
I know
Sorry.
this is part of the
the spirit.
"The reason this came about Dennis, is because some people were, were playing ducks and drakes."
"And the spirit of the exercise is that we will work as a team, and the most cost-effective procedure will exist."
"And in m in many cases the most cost-effective procedure will be for the lad on site, the R E or the assistant R E to measure, and provide the measure to the Q Ss who will put that forward and process that in the way they do now and send out a certificate."
And I don't see anything contentious about that.
Can I take it that if
"I don't, I don't like how it is worded then, because I don't think you said that."
Sorry to
No.
"It, it was worded that way because there are"
It says  the project Q S is responsible for agreeing all site measurements .
That's what it says.
Yes.
He is responsible for that.
He is.
And he may delegate that
He may delegate to
I agree with you  but
and in many cases will delegate that.
He is also responsible for the valuation
He has raised it with the contractor.
It doesn't say that here.
It does.
But there's no .
The letter of delegation normally says that
"It says, normally it says, normally obtaining them personally"
The letter of delegation has always said that Q S will measure
Yeah.
If he's coming he might like to be
to be
There's a good chance of filling most rooms most nights I would have thought.
Well shall I ring Joyce back and say providing it's close erm we'll have it and take it from there.
Okay.
Oh I haven't written .
Shall I alert Dick to its existence then?
Yes I think that would be that would be a nice thing to do.
Cos that would be a nice definite.
Okay.
I'll make a decision when I'm in a position to .
Well this is why it would be a good idea to so people will have to decide in advance and just see how we go for
Do you have to send off a deposit or anything?
I'll find out when I ring and she'll .
If I do I'll be ringing round frantically  find out what to do .
I would suggest that given the decision we prepared to make now even if you have to send a deposit get the local party to stump up the deposit and collect the money as soon as convenient from the people who are committed to going.
Is that agreed with all of you here.
Sure mm.
Since the local party's going to cover the shortfall anyway if there one.
Okay.
she'll be subletting rooms to people.
Slum land for the Green Party   .
.
Right is that erm.
Okay presumably I should put something again in the newsletter about conference and this accommodation thing.
Yeah.
Yeah it it means that you can point out that it makes it a lot simpler for someone to just pop over for a night and crash out on the floor.
Are you coming to conference at all.
No I won't be er my family situation can change so.
Oh.
Don't have to do things like erm .
We can always run a little creche actually for  nanny from Scarborough got a baby as well.
"Sir, is Miss  not in?"
No.
Could you take your coats off please and come into the blue room.
Well who's taking Miss  's class?
question?
What?
the answer.
Can you come through please.
Right folks  Donald is here making typical  of English in use  from schools at the moment.
So if you would er ignore the presence of the microphone that would be helpful.
I intend to give you a demonstration today based on work that  Kevin has done.
He's  his plate with hard wax as many of you now have done.
"He has  varnished the back with, can you remember what sort of special old varnish it was?"
Straw hat.
Correct.
Well done.
Straw hat varnish.
Now it's safe from acid attack on the back and on the front except for where he has lightly drawn through the thin wax coating using the etching .
Drawn this little character and what I intend to do is put this into acid  and etch it.
The actual etching process where the acid bites through the liner into the metal and makes a rule.
When that's happened I'll take it out of the acid  clean it and show you how to take a print from the plate.
"I would like you all to try to  remember  the stages of the process because you're going to have to do, as I said to you last lesson, a small write up on this in order to get your unit of accreditation  for this work."
That is to say your special certificates .
Right erm  would you normally be  room?
Would you normally be in this room?
Is it likely that there are other pupils who may turn up in that room in a few minutes?
Or do you think that you may be the only ones?
Are they all on the English trip?
Okay.
In that case could you just take your coats off and put them somewhere  erm out of the way.
Please.
So you're looking for attention probably more than anything.
So attention seeking's one thing.
Have a good time.
Sorry?
To have a good time.
"Okay, you could  what, what would you be hoping to achieve during that good time?"
"Have a few laughs, what else though?"
What other things do you hope or do you think might happen shall we say?
To meet some nice people to go on holiday with.
"Right, meeting people."
Things like romance are very important with holidays.
"I mean, you all know about the image the cruiseliners have with wealthy widows and things like that."
"The Club Eighteen Thirty idea is much along similar lines, and if you look at a Club Eighteen Thirty brochure, the sort of activities people do together, bringing people together."
So this is all an important element.
Cuisine.
"Right, cuisine could be an important motivating factor."
Er basically stuffing yourself to excess for two weeks.
Drinking yourself to excess for two weeks for peanuts.
"Again, that would be something."
"But in general the people who are doing some of those things, a lot of it's probably escapism  certain type, complete break from their work."
What other things do you think you would hope to get as a result of your holiday?
Time to relax.
Right.
"Okay time to perhaps to relax, to reflect."
see various water sports
"Okay, so you can improve your prowess at windsurfing."
"And certainly there's the fitness, activity side, that can be an important motivating thing."
What else will you do on holiday?
All we've talked about so far is drinking and lying on a beach.
Sorry?
Sightseeing.
"Right, sightseeing."
Right.
Because I've already written to Atkins cos that's in the newsletter.
Yeah.
So he's Secretary of State.
I'm asking the people round the table to write these extra couple of letters because we must be activists because we're here by definition.
And so we're likely to I think if I put the whole list in the newsletter it might have put people off.
Yeah.
Erm
Yes is it  all about this any more in the newsletter next newsletter?
No because I think by the end well unless something dramatic happens on the fourth of February which is this Friday next Friday rather.
If it does I'll be on to you straight on the phone.
But otherwise I I don't expect to need any more work on this for this Friday.
Yeah.
But we ought to have something about having a second reading in it anyway
Oh of course yes.
because it's news.
Yes indeed.
Even if it's stop press.
probably getting tight for Monday the seventh anyway.
Brilliant.
On a point of information Helen what can happen on on this second reading if
Right I can I I can tell you.
Erm there'll be a whole a whole day's debate on the bill which is an achievement in itself.
At the end of which a number of things can happen.
Firstly the bill can go through on the nod with no note.
This is possible with ballot laws  is now ballot bill.
But we can't rely on it.
It's quite possible that some MPs will try and talk the bill out.
That is try and ensure that when the House rises at two thirty P M the debate on the bill is still in progress.
And if that happened the bill automatically falls unless we can move the closure of the debate.
"Now this means that the sponsor of the bill, Allan ,brothers,pro proposes that the debate be closed and the bill be given a second reading."
In this case we must not only win the vote but we must have a hundred MPs in the House to vote for the closure.
Mhm.
By plant well will be by plant .
Right.
"Erm M for mother four stop one, payment application by contractors."
"Erm there are quite a few in, in this series which follow the same sort of thing is that er, all projects all jobs on site er will have a quantity surveyor from Dave  's section."
Erm and will
Eh?
Nominated.
to do all the post-contract measure work.
Nominated.
Come on.
"Let's, what you're doing is you're winding them up Den."
I'm not.
I can't believe Dennis would be mischievous enough to wind anybody up on p on a subject that he's so disinterested in.
"That's, that isn't"
Yes.
Go on.
I've been told to change these procedures to.
just taken the knife out of your back.
Right.
"The project Q S is responsible for agreeing all site measurements, normally attaining these personally."
"However when specifically requested by the project Q S, the resident engineer or the project engineer may obtain this information."
"A project Q S is responsible for agreeing all valuations and for processing all invoices for payment for physical work, and passing these to the client for payment."
So what's the change?
"Because on many jobs certainly smaller jobs, er the resident engineer or the project engineer would"
be doing the
"And normally normally they will do that and in, in the future"
Well
Yes it will.
"they can say, yeah,th the project Q S is just gonna say, measure me all"
That's right.
I haven't time to go and do that.
Well if there i if there in a
"no matter who, no matter what !"
If they're in a corrupt society  and when they get to that position they  they don't do anything about it and accept
Well they
it and take
they don't
"the bribes, well yes I agree this is the"
Yeah.
the
Yeah.
basis of the mafia isn't it?
"Ah, you see if  if you don't, I mean  it's not, it doesn't happen in, in every walk of life  but in big business and in politics  if you don't"
You have to modify your
"I'll tell you , I'll tell you how"
"No, no if you don't tow the line"
Exactly!
If you just don't
if you'd be elected
Yes  and you don't modify you  what happens?
You don't get anywhere!
You don't get elected which is what happened
Well
to the Labour government
No
last time!
"oh well, oh well apart apart from being"
No.
elected
fifty percent of the population
apart from that
"wanted control on nuclear weapons, or wanted to abolish nuclear weapons but they the the  Labour government didn't get in  on that basis  so they had to modify their  and I mean as"
Well you can use that for any argument then
Well that's got the ball rolling.
Erm  and if anybody runs into anybody else and can ask them or anything if there isn't actually an army of er sort of letters coming through your door saying yes yes make me a candidate.
Just to remind everybody that we've decided that this year we weren't going to put pressure on people.
Because it just took so much of our energy last time helping people fill in forms and everything.
If people aren't comfortable enough to volunteer.
"I mean obviously if  for example didn't ring up and say I want to sign your name your name tomorrow, I'd ring her up to see whether she'd lost her  mind or something ."
Because you know she usually does.
She's actually got er terrible flu.
But I'm going round to see her next weekend.
Yeah but you know what I mean.
If it's somebody who we really expect to stand then by all means then chase them up.
But I don't want to go around looking for candidates like we did last time.
Because it's erm it just takes too much energy away.
Right.
And if we haven't got a full slate well I mean looking at that list we're doing quite well.
Yeah.
So would you be likely to speak to John  saying again wouldn't like to pressure Jean again but think John would like to
I'm sure John would.
Erm I shall ring him and ask him make sure he's
I'll try and ask  .
So have we taken a decision to target Bishopgate then?
Yeah.
It's five for the next five years.
It's quite a commitment.
So we're looking for the ideal candidate.
Yep.
This is before anybody gets any ideas at all.
And the the reasons for it is because we're it's the sort of by far the most solid concentration of our our actual members and likely supporters.
I used to live down there towards one part of that.
Yeah.
So it's all it's from that time on it's .
I'd like to get that back again if we could.
If ones came as  in little wee pi pickups we called them the little lorry things you would sort of keep your eye very much because you didn't know they were looking for scrap and if you told them you had nothing they might go away with your iron gates or something.
This was during the mid thirties?
Oh yes I would say that yes that was coming more that way yeah yeah.
Coming more that
How about the individual er tramps?
Did you ever have bye-names for these characters?
Well th th there was one Joe Wrench.
Er but I don't know what's that.
But somebody so told me aye and I said that was a funny name or was it else's then.
Well I said I remember a man called Joe Wrench and but er oh I wouldn't er but one  said oh Joe Wrench is very black looking.
Well the bugger is just coming on and he was cleaning the car down hosing her car so he says I turned the hose on him.
Well the hose landed on him alright but it landed on his parcel and it the whole thing fell out on the road.
So there was a bit of
Mm.
among the few people that saw that happening.
But er he was quite a character the man that did that.
Did you ever have an opportunity to to see what the tramps actually carried with them?
No well I could never say I I was kept well away out of the but my father probably might have seen
Mm.
in his bag.
Well I think it would be a change it's when they're when they're when they're jacket would be wet they would have another
Mm.
jacket in the bag.
So whatever he and if he was dumping anything oh er er they would ask the father said er just er to dump that.
They wouldn't be left with a whole pile of stuff or er.
No oh no they or they would dump it in a place where nobody would see it you see.
And when they were coming along Lochassynt were they making for anywhere in particular?
We we well er er see they were on their rounds and then they'd be going round by Nedd and  and probably Scourie they were just doing their circular.
Aye they had their places for.
Yes it's amazing aye.
And did you have ever a chance to gain some sort of insight into their backgrounds?
Who they were in fact?
The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree.
Other forms were near.
His sole had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead.
"He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence.’"
"The beauty of these words cannot entirely hide a sense of suggested differentness, of an essential something so far held back but pushing now to get out."
"It is this sense which seems to be given the clearest possible confirmation in those moments of the portrait of the artist, where the brooding Stephen, Stephen Daedalus , suddenly emerges from his vigilance in a lightening display of strength."
"Here, from the portrait, are two of them."
"‘It's a curious thing, do you know’ Cranley said dispassionately, ‘how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelief."
Did you believe it when you were at school?
I bet you did.’
"‘I did’, Stephen answered."
‘And were you happier then?’
Cranley asked softly.
"‘Happier than you are now, for instance?’"
‘Often happy’ Stephen said ‘and often unhappy.’
‘I was someone else then.’
It's a lot of money.
most of it was fresh produce.
Really?
"They, it's not gonna last, like, they're still b buying more and more of it."
"It wasn't like all your basic items, or anything."
"Mike doesn't eat meat, so like, it's only like, slice of chicken, slice ham and stuff for Maryanne."
Most of it is fresh fruit and veg.
Really?
"There was some booze on there as well, but not much, so erm,"
"Right, a lot of money though, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Fifty pounds for two people.
Mind you if he sees .
"Did you, what did you want on this, did you want some jam, is that alright?"
Strawberry jam?
Have you got any butter
"town built in our country with two motorways, and the towns have all expanded to great extent and that was why we had to give up, it was nothing to do with our friends the  saboteurs."
"It was creeping suburbia then, it wasn't"
Creeping suburbia.
So wha
Yes.
"what do you do now with the, what do the old  the old hunt's people do?"
"Well we've, we just have to er, grin and bear it."
There is nowhere else to go for us.
Yes.
I would like to ask the saboteurs how they can justify  the fact that they ill-treat hounds and horses?
Now I
personally have had a horse actually had things thrown at it by saboteurs!
I feel this is cruelty to horses.
Yes.
"That's, that's just absolutely rubbish!"
I mean we don't
Well you
"can't, you can't"
"like er, you can't say that she might have something thrown at her horse cos maybe you weren't there and maybe"
Generally speaking
Mm.
"erm, I mean  people who spend their entire Saturday doing something that they, I mean, I don't enjoy going out every Saturday!"
"I mean, I'd like to do the things that, my hobbies, but I go out there because I care and I see that I feel that it's necessary to, to actually stop these people tormenting an animal for fun  and if I'm that concerned about animals, I'm not gonna stoop to  to hurt a horse, or  or the hounds!"
"I mean I ride myself, I have dogs myself, I mean, it's just another excuse from the hunting fraternity, turn it round, blame the cruelty on the saboteurs when really  there wouldn't be any saboteurs if there weren't people to kill foxes purely for fun!"
Do you want to come back on that?
Yes.
"Erm we ha , we have had horses and hounds and damaged but apart from that I would ask the speaker  who i , what"
Mm.
or who is the fox's predator?
"After all, the mouse has a cat, so what is the fox's predator?"
Do you know much about fox ecology?
Yes.
And so how can the Communist Party
But I mean
"just say right, we're gonna do this, this"
Just because they don't know what it  socialism
"theoretical concept or something, they might have known that they wanted"
Yes but it's the basic underlying concept
capitalism and becomes rich as the we western world then th they'll be all for that
"No, I just find that  really difficult  because they didn't have the means at that time to achieve it."
"I mean we've already established the fact they didn't have, they didn't have the personnel to"
.
Yes they did.
They were in power.
They were in power but I mean who's to say that the pe there's not gonna be a civil war and they'll be thrown out of power.
So why did they think that they had the er  means to do it in nineteen forty seven?
"You know when they said, when they went for a very radical policy"
Well perhaps because they were more idealist and that now they're becoming more realist but they're still  erm I mean they're learning from their past mistakes and they've seen that right so we have to have a moderate policy which is gonna take us a little bit further towards socialism.
They're not totally contradicting their ideals.
Oh yeah
It confirms our suspicions
at the last gasp we were right.
It's all this absolute power corrupts actually isn't it?
Mm.
"Erm the, the people who  did Mao ?"
Or ?
"Well I mean  there, there, there's no question about nineteen forty nine absolutely non no documents  could have come out unless they had Mao's approval."
Mm.
Er
Did he shoot the other people involved by any chance?
that's behind this
Right.
erm
I E it's the same person who comes up with
What on liquidated damages?
Next.
Shut up .
"S safe, okay."
"Procedure K zero stop one, safety related admin."
"I'm making the point that man management procedures erm, sorry, safety instructions and information and safety information will not be issued via management procedures."
"Management procedures w will relate, will only contain procedures relating to the admin of safety matters."
Yes.
Good.
Excellent
Go back to the clerical section
"You, you'll, you were instrumental about"
I've been fighting this b
that my friend.
I've been fighting this battle for four years and we've eventually got there.
Mm.
Good.
Good.
Next.
It was
Erm maintenance and use of portable electrical apparatus K nineteen stop one.
The safety one.
Er it talks about erm
Safety admin one.
Safety admin one.
"The functions clerical section, section maintaining registers."
Business and planning manager will ensure a contract's in place for routine inspection.
"Business, and business manager will ensure that inspection reports are forwarded to the function heads after inspections."
And there's talking about labelling of defective equipment and what have you.
Good.
And I've been ordered to .
Right.
I didn't say what the license is.
we only insure for the intrinsic value of
And is there any situation
the item.
That's all.
Right.
But you guarantee them delivery.
Yep.
On the piece of paper.
I know but you've lost the .
We give them their money back.
"I mean, well it'll probably arrive, it'll turn up somewhere won't it really?"
But se
Could do.
"I mean send another one is what we're saying, have your money back."
If you haven't got the  you should be okay.
Or
"if it arrived, if you paid for a before"
One customer should expect it to arrive then
noon  and it er
"I mean, same ta super mail, we wouldn't give them their money back."
I think that's a bit more than that now.
"But if you ordered a ten thirty delivery and it arrived before noon, we would just give you the money difference the before twe , ten thirty and the before noon price, not the complete price."
Unless you wanted to argue about it.
"But we feel that, okay, you know, it may have been a half an hour late but you got there."
"And therefore, we have incurred cost and therefore, but okay, it wasn't the guaranteed service."
"But you could argue with us, you know."
"And again, a commercial decision is made locally based on the strength of the account."
"But we don't, you've gotta be careful as you probably know Phil, the abuse can of the ca , you know, carrier, you know, can be a nice little earner if you're not careful."
"And, you know, erm people can  intend to fail in order to claim money, revenue back, and so on."
D'ya know
"Or damaged goods can, you know, put the foot through it to get the insurance cover on what we pay and we're liable."
Whilst there's a world economic malaise.
"Not sure you can blame the media altogether, I noticed you said there in almost these words er, John Major will the lead the Conservative party into the next election and the Conservatives will win."
You said exactly that I quote word for word in November nineteen ninety and a week later what happened?
You challenged Mrs Thatcher and brought her down.
Well it's interesting that er I mean these quotations get It must be very clever research.
Well you offered it.
"Yeah well okay, well I haven't I mean, I I did I did actually think that Mrs Thatcher would lead us into the election."
"Er I thought that it was wrong that she should, as everybody knows."
Er and I think frankly erm we won the election because she was not leader of the party.
That was my view and still my view and I think John Major fought a very distinguished campaign er against the pundits it has to be said.
er I hope I did everything I could to help.
As I did Mrs Thatcher.
Nobody worked harder in the nineteen eighty seven general election than I did.
Yeah but the point I'm making is that you thought that would happen then.
You say it may happen it is going to happen now.
Why should we believe it now any more than we believed it then .
"Well I I I mean there i thinking back, I didn't think at that stage, I hope I'm right about this,th that I had any idea that Geoffrey Howe was going to resign."
I never had the slightest intention of challenging Mrs Thatcher.
There was never my my view and and one day I shall if I ever get round to it I might set this all out.
My view was
Write your memoirs?
Yeah.
"In nineteen eighty six, my view was a very very clear one."
To survive.
I mean nobody thought I could do that.
I mean not many people who'd clashed with mrs thatcher did survive.
"But I did, that was my determination."
"John Major is beset with problems, you wouldn't"
Yeah.
argues that.
"In fact you said er again if if I may offer you one of your quotes erm, If you have back benchers who won't support you, that limits governments abilities to take decisions."
you said that a few months ago.
Well I mean I I know what Barbara feels about this.
"She feels that  erm  at the, the level that we are working at it is really coun be counter productive to hold stock."
Because however hard you try stock deteriorates.
Yeah.
Erm but I you know I feel that that very often we don't sell stock
Well couldn't we just have a few things
and I feel that if we did have stock then  then we would erm  sell it.
So I mean that that's two ways of looking at it.
Certainly if  we've got some stuff in a box
Well I mean we needn't buy the expensive things like sweatshirts
Shall I try at erm Cambridge?
I mean it's October.
"Yeah but they, will they, they won't sell you on at a discount will they?"
Cos if we all
"But I mean I I just know that that Harlow tried stock keeping and selling, they gave up."
I know that er in Hertford they were quite desperate.
All came up with the same idea and they wanted to do it.
And in the end they came to Barbara's conclusions  so that its a an expensive thing.
"But I mean if we only had like the  writing paper and the envelopes and re-use labels, small items of stationery"
the stickers and I mean
they still do  yeah.
"But I mean I I expect, I mean even we had some left over e eventually you could sell them to our own members because they'd all want to use it"
Mm.
and it's cheaper than ordering it off the catalogue.
That's a good idea about Cambridge isn't it?
"You could borrow there stock, is that what you're thinking and then take back what we didn't sell."
That's what
I mean I've never talked to them so I I don't know yet
"Well if they would let us borrow it, that's a different matter to buying it from then because we then wouldn't make any money on it."
"Well I don't, I have never heard of a local group that makes money out of this  selling."
Well you you buy it all at thirty three or twenty five percent discount so you can then sell it at a bit more.
But then you have then you have the stuff that doesn't sell and deteriorates and you still have to have paid for it so
I don't want  otherwise you finish up with five separate er management procedures .
But also  is it necessary.
Jim
So we can make
let's issue that.
Because
"You, David and I need to sort out what we need to do to implement it"
Yeah.
and we will then implement it.
For you.
We've also gotta recognize clearly Dennis that civils and M and E cannot be stereotyped they are very very different engineering .
I'm s not suggesting they could.
And some management procedures cannot work very well in M and E as they can in civils.
Not because
Mm.
"you know we don't want to  in, in, in the civils team or what have you."
Indeed it works very well.
But in some cases some procedures cannot be worked on M and E
Yeah.
engineering.
They've got totally different algorithms.
Well it is supposed to be talking about managing the system and not d not taking people's e professional expertise away from them.
I mean but if
Yes.
if we are gonna have
It is a problem.
"procedures which are, don't quite fit you, then I think what we ought to be looking for is a certain amount of common ground between your procedure and our procedure, so there is not something, you're doing something completely different to the way the rest of us are doing it."
No.
I totally agree with you.
It's gotta be married together.
Totally agree with you.
"cannot stereotype every function, under a management procedure."
The pace okay.
The speed at which we speak okay.
yeah
Power and pace and pitch and pause.
Yes okay.
let's just go back to the pace then.
How does the pace want to be compared with normal con one to one conversation perhaps?
slightly slower
"Slightly slower just so that the words come over a bit clearer yes, so so people can actually take in what you say okay."
"Now the pause, how about the pause?"
To get attention
You do don't you
it gives emphasis it attracts people's attention
sorry
Pregnant pause
Pregnant pau that's right a pregnant pause isn't it?
I mean
But it's perhaps one of the most difficult things when you start out doing presentations isn't it.
Because you get that silence in the room and mmm you want to fill it  so but you're right the use of the pause effective and particularly with a variation in pitch that gives that emphasis the two combined together can be very very effective.
Okay so the power the pace the pitch and the pause all to do with voice and slight variations on those compared with normal one to one conversation  Okay.
So that's about the voice itself now under paralinguistics also comes that the concept of words.
Words are are I mean what are words?
A simple thing to say but what are words?
Expression
Yes er but what do they express then
Sorry
Feelings
could express feelings yes.
Facts
thoughts
Facts feelings yes thoughts absolutely there there there a code aren't they?
"I mean if you speak three different languages you could use three different words to put the same sort of thought of a picture dog, chien, hound there's probably an Italian and a  and that but if you speak the languages then different words different codes if you like are for the same idea."
and they write the lecture for me
they write yeah
they write the lecture as it takes place
yeah
yes
good preparation
Well no there's actually there's a lot of preparation in that isn't there
Well what I do it on is planning
Oh yes
and er control of sub contractors then you get a mixed group from Tarmac er different companies and their conception of what planning is and conception of what controlling sub contractor is
yeah
is totally different so I did the first lecture with what my idea of  to find myself talking to a a contract housing guy whose biggest order was two thousand pounds
right
so I've have them produce the lecture and then we've gone on from like doing
yep
exactly the thing
right
pick out three things and we'll talk about them
"Mm, mm"
and that's how I use visual aids
so it can actually be a stimulus can't it?
so I then find myself doing nothing else but walking around so I go and ask
right
So it forces me
yes
out into the audience
Well that's what you hinted at yesterday as well didn't it?
I mean if if you're here even now you've got your notes down rather than in your hand and and you stand and read but you don't use that or you don't use that then there is that tendency isn't there to?
So the focus of attention switches from people looking at me
"yeah, to the visual aid yes"
to this to actually looking at what they're producing
"right, yes, and that's an important factor that that if you feel everybody's looking at you it is important"
And she were living in the parks.
Get up here.
Yeah.
"They used to give 'em subsidies to help 'em pay the rent, they've stopped that, so they've either to gerra job, to help put supplement to pay in the, you know, their housing accommodation, or they've got to stop school."
"In summer holidays, er, the grant don't  they take that six weeks"
Off the grant.
"off the grant, so that actually they get six weeks money less, through the year, than they should do, where they're used to paying all through year"
"For twelve months, now they don't."
"Now, they don't get anything for that six weeks that they're not at school."
No.
"So, you know, any girl that's not living at 'ome."
"She got to go out and work for that six weeks, to, to earn the money  feed the"
"And where can you get that bloody kind of money, only  corner."
"Yeah, but where can you get a job."
"Well, that's it."
Where can you job.
"Well, it's forcing the girls on to streets, ain't it."
Yeah.
corner.
"I mean, they're begging 'em you to ke they're begging you to keep 'em on at school, and yet you can't get no help to keep 'em on."
"It's like other day,we were talking to this bloke like, and he were on about businesses, says you can't underst , oh he said something about finances,how difficult it is to get finance to start a business up  and er, he said, I know, he said you can't me, he said."
"You seen all these adverts about starting your own business, you know, governments like, you know, doing all these courses and making it out as though it's it's dead easy to get fi , you know  hitting your head against a brick wall"
Yeah.
"The only way you can start a business, is by starting it without insurance"
"straight off your own back, and then, you know, after it's running, get insurance."
Yeah.
That ho ninety five per cent of firms do that.
regulate.
I mean it's
"I mean, look at laddo round there what's been broke into."
"He's no insurance  no insurance whatsoever, 'cos he couldn't afford it."
I know.
"I I mean I You know, you never make these er  you can get every sort of evasive answer to these questions."
"And they're all lies, you know, they may sound nice and they may deceive people, but the truth is, any politician that I know and respect, when it comes to the crunch, if they think they have a chance of preferment and obviously ultimate preferment, take it."
"Some of them do it sheepishly, and with reluctance and say, It's never what I ever had in mind."
But they always do it.
Others are honest about it.
"Ken Clarke, I like him, I trust him, I admire him."
"What does he say, he answers the question straight, just the way I always answered it."
"Which is to say, yes, given another chance, I'd have a go for it."
"No I no I don't say that, cos what I always said is you cannot do what your friends will never let you do."
That's the real test.
"You cannot If you're in the the House of Commons and there's a vacancy or something of this sort for a job, I mean we don't need to invent a hypothetical situation."
"Your friends are the ones who say, Well you're the guy who could do this."
"And if they don't say that, or if they positively say, You're not the guy, you're wasting your time."
The only reason that you can make progress in that sort of situation is if there's a body of opinion that says that you should.
"But somebody like you could always find friends to say, Yes you ought to do that"
No I don't agree with that.
I d I do not agree with that at all.
"I mean, there could I mean I think the House of Commons is now some way past in in my life in the sense I haven't been there since er June."
"I've no idea about the mood, I've no idea what people will think of er maybe large numbers Well one journalist said to me in Blackpool and perhaps this says it all, he said, Michael, you're the only really popular person here this week."
You see they've nothing to be frightened of any more.
But they're wrong.
Ah but they
"Aren't they because you're saying, I'm still around"
No they may not be wr I I mean the the fact I'm around doesn't mean to say that I'm frightening.
And I haven't changed.
I've never been frightening.
People have misjudged me.
So you're not going to write your memoirs?
"You know, I I I'm I'm unhappy about this memoir business."
"I mean, they're self serving aren't they."
And they're all to to put the person's point of view.
"And erm I I I find it I mean I'm not going to be sort of holier than thou about it all I mean, perhaps I myself might be tempted er one day."
Yes.
"But Hughie is saying as far the works office is concerned, he wants to regularize the system with this procedure."
And as I understood you
Yeah.
"again, you wanted the, the, to regularize the system with within the B E S office."
"We well I do, unless that doesn't make sense."
"Now I can't see why it doesn't make sense, but if Jim came to me and said, look Hugh, that's bloody silly."
"I mean our objective is to give the, the client a good efficient cost-effective service, that doesn't meet those"
objectives.
"But D Dave, Dave, Dave could not handle, in B E S, what he handles on the civil side."
In what respect?
H he is not staffed up to do what
could quite easily ask you to do all the erm
Running around
"the actual measure the site measurements, but the agreeing, the valuations, and the processing of the invoices, he does himself."
And that is w well within what this procedure says.
I mean he does the invoices now doesn't he?
Well I understood so.
"Or the, the certification to the client."
Yes he does he does the certificate.
Yeah.
"So really all it, all the, this would"
involve them
"doing would be to say, would you project engineers er or, or engineers collect the in information on site, provide it to the quantity surveyors so they can check it against the spirit of the contract, and make sure that er what's proposed to be certified they're happy with."
Well it doesn't say that though.
Yes.
It
Sorry.
It's
Let's
"What I'm, what I'm saying is if, if you want to really stir people up, bring in a procedure within telling them what you're doing, and then imple implement it at a later date and people will say, this is not quality."
Hey Jim
The erm type thing means what means little codes mean or does that give us any indication as to what these sites are?
No there isn't a key unfortunately.
Oh.
I'll tell you now if the poster says Labour isn't working I'm not having it.
Yeah what which is the nearest one to a Conservative Club?
Cos there's a Conservative Club down in Fishergate isn't there
They actually own the one on the side of the Conservative building I thought.
Or they thought they did until it always says Conservative propaganda  on the sides so I think that's a gonna .
It's it's on a little table at the end which says rate card analysis and it had T V areas Yorkshire T V North East T V and then principle main secondary local corner shop other and totals   numbers in the middle .
Anybody got any suggestions on that ?
Will we pay the cost of the poster site?
Is this your understand as well as the cost of the poster?
I think so.
Well I think what they suggest to me that we have to pay for the poster site.
Whether or not the Green Party then supplies the posters I wouldn't like to say.
Right so it's not just that the National Party want the people on the ground to choose the nice addresses.
Well that's the
I think it's clear that the money's coming from from the local parties.
What they're ac what they're trying to do is coordinate enough local parties with the same poster that they can make a block booking I would have thought.
This might be a good way of raising funds by asking people particularly for the Euros I think.
"Why don't you sponsor you know, members who don't normally come to meetings, to sponsor erm a site for"
Yeah.
I think a lot of people would be willing to do that.
"Erm make a big splash in the newsletter, Please sponsor your your Green Party poster for the elections."
Doing this this is one erm campaign that  as a small proportion of the poster sites is it?
It looks that way yeah.
There must be lots of other .
I mean this they must have got my name through Miriam so they must already have worked out the  they were working
Right.
Okay are you willing to go away and
Yeah I think I need to talk to Miriam again don't I.
Unfortunately I don't have a phone number I only have an address.
And it might also be that
"the landlords in Saigon are if you like more commercial, more capitalist, it might be they were better organized than landlords in the north."
"I mean th th th the clan links in the south were much stronger than they were in the north, and therefore there might be even greater commercial landlord opposition to land reform than there had been in the north."
Was the south not more erm densely populated as well?
Yes.
Yeah.
So you'd end up putting  much smaller sort of bits of land
Yes.
for each peasant which is going to harm production too.
So there's gonna be less
"There's, there's less"
inequality or
"there's a greater pressure of population  therefore  are you saying that, that  land reform might  at least on the model tried in the north, might not yield any economic benefits"
Mm.
"in terms that, that th th the erm land to  released would be relatively small?"
Yes.
Right.
So the economic gains from  land reform in the south  might not be that great.
"I mean you, the, the more you argue the south is a viable economic system, the less there is to gain from land reform."
erm
and stuff like that
"I mean the amount of land each family will get   if you redistribute land, then the land for the family is not gonna be able to support the family."
Right.
But
Yeah.
Yes
Mm.
Yes.
"Erm  I, I think I might have missed Adam's point and I was going back to  whether the south was more efficient than the north because just tying it in with the seminar we had on managerial farms, weren't there more in the north than in the south?"
"And so then that would just prove that how, managerial farms weren't that much more efficient?"
Er I think those are separate issues.
"You, you, you're right to say that on the whole  there, the managerial farms were in, in the north, although there w there was clearly some in the south"
"Well, it says on the bottom of the, your copy of the charge sheet, production of driving license  you must produce it, failure to produce it will mean that it is automatically suspended  and it also means you've committed yet another offence  by not having  a driving licence here to produce Mr !"
"Well I wa I wasn't sure  whether to, whether it would go through in time for the case  and that's why I haven't"
What's stopping you?
send off for it.
I wasn't sure what the situation was .
"Unless  the prosecutor is in the fortunate position of having  a computer printout of your driving  er le , holding your licence record  the case won't be able to proceed today anyway."
"And your worship, regrettably there is no printout of the driving licence."
Well the case can't go ahead today without  your driving licence.
Sorry?
The case cannot go ahead without your driving licence.
How many weeks do you want to ?
"Your worship, I would anticipate that it normally takes at least three weeks for a printout  for the computer to be able to"
And this case is adjourned for three weeks in order that a computer printout will  can be obtained.
Does that mean I don't have to apply for another licence?
"No, but er ee i , I suggest you don't apply for the licence now."
"No, you've left it too late!"
But er  I would urge you to try to find your driving licence  because
"No, I I I don't think I'll be able to because ."
"Right, well  you know you're going to be disqualified eventually for this offence if you're convicted."
Yes.
"What, the offence  the  drink driving offence?"
Yes.
Yeah.
Do you understand?
I realise that.
"You've pleaded guilty to the charge anyhow, it's a fair cop!"
The point is that when you are disqualified you're  not just disqualified from driving you are disqualified from holding or obtaining any driving licence.
So if you've got one at home  you're committing an offence  by being in possession of it.
Do you understand?
Do you understand that?
Yeah.
Right.
No Lochassynt Lodge.
That's right
Lochassynt
that's right.
And my mother er went to help them in the lodge in the season time also.
Fr from that time can you recall any incidents which er your father may have mentioned to you even as a young boy?
Well
Or stories about the the people that were there or
Well
passers by?
ah well yes the passers by will will remember being on the road side the famous tramp.
Aha.
The gentleman of the road.
My word and me just as a little boy of eight years.
I was no fear of being frightened of them because they were part of the establishment.
And well did the gentry know that too.
You mentioned that you were perhaps more scared of er ministers.
Well yeah ministers er.
When I think of it nowadays and I see children so very going round to the various churches that when people used to say about ministers well.
When you heard there was a minister coming I was just afraid and looking to see would you see that dark black clothed individual coming.
And even that seemed a  but thinking of the old tramp and he was in a a sort of all belaggered looking way.
My word but you weren't frightened of him because you were told that he was an old man and one of the road men of the road.
And there was no fright to be taken from him.
Is it correct to to say that the tramps actually used to make a special point of coming to to see your father ?
Oh yes.
Made a special point of coming there because they knew my mother would give them a bowl of soup or what was ever on.
She was baking fresh scones hot cakes anything that was going.
And my word they enjoyed it well.
They wouldn't come in they wouldn't come into the porch even.
They would sit outside wait in that days we had a seat out in the and even if was a seat for sitting outside they would sit on their own way or on a rock.
No they just had their own way of life and you wouldn't change it and they had stories to my father.
They would tell sing where they came from and who they saw and all the way up they came.
whereas animals don't!
They have no
Mhm.
"choice, they have no say."
Mhm.
"There, yes?"
How do you know that erm  animals don't reason?
"Like, how do you know what goes on, like with, dolphins, with whales, with all sorts of species of animals, like we don't know, well we're so dense we can only see things like this!"
"We don't know what goes on there, we've got no right to interfere with their lives!"
Yes?
"I think, I think we're overlooking one erm"
Mhm.
"great power that the individual has, instead of being ing , indignant  about erm, our views on animals in research, we could quite simply exercise our power, not to buy the products, to ask questions of our"
Mm mm.
of our doctors what kind of drug it is?
What research goes behind it?
"Do to exercise our individual intelligence to examine the facts on no , on the basis of our own conscience, individually to make a decision, and we can all do that!"
We can buy a different type of product.
And there are many
Mhm.
"companies now  erm which quite obviously assert that fact, on the doorways of chemists for instance, they do not test on animals."
So you're saying the consumer pressure could could change things?
Mhm.
It it it's every effective measure
Mm.
"of stopping erm, a certain product  it simply will go out of production."
"I would disagree that er, humans aren't used in experiments because I think that we're all being used at various"
"points in our lives, for experiments, medical or otherwise."
Mhm.
"And erm  a , a lot of the medicines that are passed  er have been passed to a certain degree and then th th the  we become the the animal."
"Are you speaking as a, as an experienced guinea pig yourself?"
Well I'm a diabetic  erm
Then we'll probably put this case back till later in the day.
Do you see that Mr ?
Because you're not represented
Well I don't know what the situation is!
"Well I'm te , that's what I'm trying to tell you!"
You'll have to .
But because you're not represented the statements will have to be read out!
Which will er  take quite some time and er will
and certainly will if you're reading to the court which was something you were concerned about.
I'm not   .
I don't know whether you can help that man with that.
"Because Mr  has represented him, Mr  said before that he he thought it was as duty solicitor  that he, he has represented him at some stage as duty solicitor  but, he is represented under legal aid though this defendant  by a firm of solicitors in Birmingham  and he's anxious to be committed for trial  today."
"If he was represented we could do it er, on the section six two."
Otherwise
Are there any solicitors present today?
"Not at present, but he doesn't know ."
Oh I see.
He's given certain information to the court which  isn't correct anyway!
Have a word with him.
It might help everybody concerned if you could have a word with .
Yes.
We'll have a word with .
Could you deal with cases fifty five and fifty six your worship?
"Shaun David , Mr  represents him."
Are you Shaun David ?
Yes.
What's your date of birth Mr ?
Twenty fourth of the seventh sixty seven.
What is your address  Mr ?
.
"Well you're charged with two offenses, the first of which is that at Clitheroe  on the twenty sixth of August nineteen eighty eight without lawful excuse  you damaged two stained glass windows  a picture frame glass and twelve  glasses of varying descriptions  belonging to Whitbread Breweries  intending to damage that property and the being reckless as to whether that property would be damaged  contrary to section one of the criminal damage act in nineteen seventy one."
"I understand this value, value has been mentioned on a previous occasion, I think three hundred and ninety five pounds?"
And what's the better deal?
Let's find out.
"And let's start with a basic question, here in this nation of animal lovers, do you think animals deserve a better deal?"
Some animals?
All animals?
Any animals?
Do they deserve a better deal?
"Button one for yes, and button two for no."
This is a descriptive vote because this hundred er  women are not a representative cross section of the whole of Scotland  they're invited to come from various places  and ninety six of them think that animals deserve a better deal.
When you said yes to that which animals did you mean?
And what were you talking about?
Yes?
"I think, a lot of people  see the stray dogs problem as a big problem, certainly if people have decided to  partake of pets, they have a responsibility to look after them and not throw them out on the streets."
Okay so
And I think problems like that  are due to human irresponsibility!
So those animals do have a raw deal!
"Okay, that's one area."
"Who else said yes, and why?"
"Up, yes?"
"I think animals that are used for human entertainment definitely deserve a better deal, for example, large wi wild animals that are used in circuses, we haven't got the right, as people, to say that they're here for our entertainment."
What would that better deal be in that case?
"The better deal would be, not being transported up and down the country, and not being made to perform tricks that are  un unnatural to their own  behaviour patterns."
Aha.
Aha.
Any other views?
Yes?
"I think that er  concern should also spread to animals that are hunted pleasure as well, i.e. the stags, deer, foxes, hares, I mean, there's there's quite a considerable list that's all done for entertainment."
Mhm.
Now the better deal there presumably would involve
Not chasing them at all!
not hunting them at all?
No!
Yes.
"Erm, being with the S S P C A, I have seen a lot of very sad pictures of animals, but one of the saddest photographs I saw, quite recently was  two monkeys, well they're primates, we are"
Yep.
"part of that family too, and they were in a lab awaiting experimentation and they were  in cages side by side and they'd stretched their arms out and were holding hands, almost as though, to give each other comfort."
Mhm.
Monkeys feel pain.
"They feel happiness, sadness  and they also have a sense of humour."
Under the nineteen eighty six act
Mm.
"they have stated that all use of animals must be justified and it very carefully policed by the Home Office, as well as locally."
"I mean, it's it's  vets etcetera"
Yeah.
Yep.
"are always present in research establishments to ensure  the well being of the animals, and very often there is actually no pain  involved in the research."
"How, how do you know that?"
Well I was told by somebody who's involved in animal
Right.
research!
Right.
"But er, frequently the animals are used  for the research and there's no pain involved at that time and they are killed humanly before the research actually takes place."
"But do we find it acceptable that animals should be used, however painless the event."
Well I would rather use an animal any time that my own child!
Up there.
"Er, Switzerland is one country that has banned the use of animals for research, and I think we ought to be going along these lines  that, if animals have rights we ought not to be using them for experimentation."
Mhm.
"And if we were to ban the the process,th erm  we would devise other means for research, would, we would find alternatives."
There.
"Th there'll, there'll quickly move it somewhere where we can do it."
It's quite
"alright, they move it out of Switzerland  but if we can't have it here we'll have it in Pakistan or somewhere  where they want the money!"
So it won't make any difference  in that
Yes?
In this dictionary of phrase and fable.
"Brewer equates black sheep with bet noir, the eyesore in the flock, a disgrace, something unpleasing."
Sheep used to be of great importance to the British economy.
"Black sheep was often despised by shepherds, and their wool was less valuable."
"Nevertheless, even black sheep were used for export."
"Okay, that's that's the bit of erm, sheep background."
"The nursery rhyme then, comes from Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book from around seventeen forty-four, and the division of bags, one for the master, one for the dame, one for the little boy who where wherever he is, lives down the lane, is said to refer to the export tax on wool, which was imposed as far back as twelve seventy-five, making even the outsider sheep of value."
So black sheep are different.
"The term is used negatively, but the black sheep of the family maybe an attractive person, someone with a sparkle, with a courage to be different, with a courage to defy the norm."
"Everyone, is says, can think of black sheep of their acquaintance."
"Every can you think of a black sheep of your acquaintance, do you do you."
"No, I don't whether I can."
Not  acquaintance.
"Perhaps I've, perhaps I've, perhaps I've mixed in a very sheltered society."
"Perhaps family history, perhaps, but not the very"
"Yes, yes."
No.
"I don't think er, and of course, er, again perhaps the idea of a black sheep, has changed over the years."
"Erm, circumstances which made someone, perhaps fifty years ago, considered to be the black sheep of the family, wouldn't necessarily be the same now."
No.
Mm.
"Erm, spivs."
I I don't think I had anybody in my family who was a spiv.
"But there was somebody in in the street where I lived, who was a spiv, and he was considered to be the black sheep of the family, didn't quite fit in when everybody else did."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Nowadays, you know, erm, don't know whether that sort of thing"
"Enterprise, culture."
"En enterprise, culture, yes indeed."
"Yes, yes."
"Er, I mean in the olden days, they used, they they usually the  sent to the colonies or, sent into the army or or into religion, weren't they."
Mm.
And all the estate men first of all would get everything.
And all the crofters then that was paying rent.
In those days how many people were actually involved on the estate?
Well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair paths.
They had to keep the river streams all flowing and if there was any deluge of rain and stones they would have to keep all the pools in good order and they would
The pools?
Yes the pools.
That's the salmon pools
Mm.
you see.
And they would have barriers going out so that they could so that the gentry could go out to stand on that ladies and men.
To cross the the
Yes just yes you see
the streams .
it still on the the rivers.
But now it's made of stonework or or concrete.
Mm.
Now and that cos that's the only thing that could stand
Mhm.
to the weather.
But er that's the way.
And the and the paths repairing at the riverside and all the bushes round the lodge.
And the gardener there was always a permanent gardener but he was he had enough to do but the estate men would be sent up to clear that.
And painters and joiners they would have themselves.
All self-contained?
Yes self-contained yes.
There'd be a joiner and he'd be engaged in a
"Erm  what, what we do today is to  way go back over some of the ideas about land reform and then carry them through to the ninety fifty er Agrarian Reform Bill."
Erm   what we've been looking at is  the process of land reform.
"Tt  and we're obviously looking at a process of land reform which has, has undergone a number of changes and I think we, we've begun to see some of the influences on those changes and particularly over the, the last week or so the  this has ."
"Tt er  and i in a sense there's kind of been an upward trend in terms of progression through that, that reform but within that there have obviously been a number of  and in a sense what we've been coming to terms with is, is what has been causing those, those variations, those changes in that policy."
Yeah.
That's the difference.
"And between them both, you can, you could  I mean you take a ten thousand pound out with a mortgage, mortgage, and you could end up paying what, twenty thousand, twenty four thousand  back."
Yeah.
"Well, finance company."
"You, you borrow ten grand or twenty grand whatever you like to, and you get a certain amount put on that, and that's it, it's fixed."
No.
You don't pay no more.
"Say you'll, you'll you'll get twenty thousand five hundred, that, if you buy, if you borrow twenty thousand just for er round figures."
"You borrow twenty thousand, and the interest payments works out"
Benji
very high
He's alright.
"It's very high, you know, the interest payments are very high, but for that money you've borrowed you'll only pay say, just for a a figure, five hundred pound back for that twenty thousand, five you know,"
Yeah.
"five thousand pound, not."
Not paying it for years and years all the time.
"But if you borrow it from a in er mortgage company, you're gonna, you're gonna borrow twice that, you gonna have to pay twice that much back."
"Forty grand, you kn that's the only difference, and"
"I don't mind that so much though, 'cos they say we are paying a lot less back a month than other way."
"But I just got one thing that I want, that they gonna send me owt dodgy like a loan shark bloke or owt like that, I mean you, you're bound to be a bit nervous, you know."
"No, they won't send a loan shark."
"You you can tell loan sharks, straight away, because the A P R's about twenty seven per cent ."
"Ma maybe twenty nine, even thirty, depending, but if it er, mind you I don't know, because it's a long time since I had a look at 'em."
"But, you know, when you when you borrow money, you get er, an interest rate, don't you, over so many,yo you've got to figure out ho how many years you're gonna pay it back."
You know.
"If you say, oh, we'll take it over ten years."
"Well you've got ten years interest to pay, ain't ya."
"So you pay the interest for for nine years, and they start paying your loan off."
"We're still having trouble getting insurance, and er, anyway I phoned, and I wrote him again yesterday, and he's given this number, who er, who he's with."
"'Cos he had a right job,got plastic, 'cos he even  plastics, I mean that's"
Yeah.
"As I say, I would like you to be in  fairly close proximity to where I am so that you can see what I'm doing and hear what I'm saying."
Er and I don't want you to be too close.
I will actually be working to start with in this area here.
So perhaps you could arrange yourselves in a semi-circle just round here.
"Right, my friends  we've very strange and wonderful chemicals in this erm    I do beg your pardon  when we are printing."
The one which you will have come across when we were doing lino printing was turps.
"We had to use turps didn't we, to dissolve the printing inks?"
"Can you remember that, when you did lino printing?"
Mm
But when we're doing screen printing we use very much stronger solvents  which can have a nasty effect on your skin.
You notice I have slight eczema on the palms of my hands.
"Some of us have even worse eczema, yeah?"
So it's really important that we  don't irritate our skin.
But frankly  it's not likely to irritate your skin anyway because er  you aren't industrial users of this  you would only ever touch these chemicals for a very short time so the  any possible side effects they might er have on you will be  greatly diminished by the fact that you didn't use them very much.
"If you're using them in industry, day in day out all day long, then that is the real importance of wearing protective gear."
But I'm just going to demonstrate to you just  what happens.
This lovely supple rubber here  is exactly the same supple rubber here at one time but now it's gone all hard and denatured because of the chemicals.
"So if y if the chemicals will do that over a long period of time  to rubber, think what it would do to your skin."
Does that make sense?
Mm.
These lumps have become so erm hardened by these chemicals that I can't er pick up  the  thin zinc plate from the  tub.
"I'm afraid that Mrs  has gone off with, ah Mrs   I'll be very grateful if you could bring me in a bowl."
You know the one you just took out?
You want it back?
I wonder if I could have it back please?
A a bowl.
"A a bowl, it doesn't matter which one."
"Just a plastic bowl please, washing up bowl."
Do you want anything in it?
Or just water?
Er  bring it empty and I'll .
Thank you very much.
and everything went .
"When I reached the pit bottom, there was approximately three feet of water at the pit bottom and I had my first experience of water in the mines."
Were the conditions in the mines quite dangerous in those days?
"Well in those days er there wasn't much me much er coal cutting machine, this was all hewn by hand."
"And we had the pit ponies and where we didn't have the pit ponies drawing the hutches, which we termed the small wagons carrying the coal from the coal face to the pit bottom, then er we had to do it by hand."
And if there were h a wagon or a hutch went off the road there you were with not enough height to lift it all back off the rail again and believe me that was experience in itself.
So it was quite a difficult job then?
"It was a difficult job, yes."
Mm.
What were the erm the wages and the hours like?
"Ooh, the wages."
"I started the wages and er I didn't have much more, I started I had six and eight pence per shift."
Mm.
And er what were the hours like?
"The hours, well sometimes I would do a double shift which was sixteen hours."
"Or eight hours for a full shift, sixteen hours for a double shift."
Mm.
"And in those days we required the money and er often, very often we had to do it to strengthen our wages a bit."
Do a double shift.
"Which meant you come home from your double er shift, went to your bed, had about four hours sleep and were back out for your normal shift again."
Was you erm in a union or anything at all at this time?
"Yes, the miners' union then was just  wasn't that that  was started was ."
"In fact there's, very near the start of the unions in and o er that, that the miners' union was one of the first to start up."
Do you think it gave you erm any advantages being in a union?
"Y oh yes it gave us advantage to the extent that we'd someone b behind us to fight for any, any er grievances that we had."
That was the idea of the union starting out in the first place.
Mhm.
We had to pay into a union.
"We can, on every Friday there was a union official down there in a small hut."
"We had straight from our wages straight to the union, it's payed at union right away."
So that there was nobody skipped.
What were the erm the erm relations between the w the workers and the bosses like?
You  I was in a warehouse at  served thirteen year there.
"And I was working in a large warehouse, a three floor warehouse, a grocers,grocers."
"I served there for thirteen year, became a chargehand eventually and eventually the f the firm folded up."
What were they
"Very old established firm, it was established in er eighteen fifty six."
"So it was a, a, a firm of about a hundred years standing at that time."
But the both brothers who owned it er Charles er John and Tom  were becoming very very aged and were not capable of carrying on the job.
And they approached the son who wasn't interested so they just folded up.
What were the conditions like where you worked in the warehouse?
"Ah well we, we actually made our own condition and this is one time, I'm telling you again, where my union membership came in very handy."
I actually made it a  union firm .
So you unionized the whole firm then?
Organ organized it.
Organized the people inside it.
And I explained to them  what benefits they were getting.
Mm.
Although the employer was pretty reasonable to us he p always payed us sixpence above the rate.
Above the normal rate.
What was the erm the employer's attitude to you unionizing and organizing and
"Oh oh he didn't say, he says oh just a, it'll not worry me he says, whether you er start one or not he says."
"I pay my men sixpence over the, the rate."
"So I says well thank you very much, but still for mu l people benefit themselves."
Mm.
"They're better being in a union, he says I agree with you, quite agree with you."
"The union fights for  he says, and the union's a  but I'm one of these employers who paying them, my men a plus rate, so I'm paying men sixpence plus over the normal rate so there was no difficulty there."
Mhm.
So he obviously wouldn't have thought the union would have been much of a threat to him seeing as he
"No, no it didn't  because he was prepared to pay over er above the rate ."
The union already fought for that rate and they got it.
But he was paying them sixpence above the rate so there was no problem to him.
Did you notice much differences in the work once you got promoted to a chargehand?
"Well er there was  I didn't do so much of the normal grafting naturally, but I was always, if there was a new man came on the job they would always  learns."
he's got  times
Time
"when ready, weight, number of packages, destination, and then haz"
Well done.
Haz will do nicely for me.
"That's what we're really looking for, hazardous"
Yeah.
goods.
Well done.
"Because, how can I say"
"Even, even I take"
"we've, you'll see, I mean there's a, not a very good illustration of a, the hub with the yellow walls of the, the conveyer belt behind you, but you can see the fairly plain packaging that parcels come in."
"The more, er er sophisticated erm  wholesale er  distributors now  know that people just pick up from stock a box don't they?"
"And, they may have one display displayed, but if you go to somewhere like a warehouse or distribution where you go round and pick up your  you can go to a garden you'll pick up a box that's illustrating a Flymo  lawn mower or something and, and it'll, er they spend a lot of time and money on the packaging, but, a lot of people for pilferage reasons don't illustrate and that's good practise not to illustrate, from our point of view, what's on the package."
But you must know what's in it.
"Just knowing the size and the weight isn't, you might, that's alright, that's only for the price  what's in it is vital  because  if I asked the sales people  from their top ten major customers what do you carry for them?"
"Do reme , can yo , can I, can you guess at how many would say I don't know?"
Major customers.
Half a dozen.
"It's a lo , I, I'd sa , they wouldn't admit it Bill, they might say something like erm  oh it's electronics, but they wouldn't know specifically what electronic."
Would that not cause er security problems if you put exactly what was on the box.
"You don't put , you shouldn't, but you should know."
You should declare it.
"They should declare if it's hazardous, infectious, infested,i it will, what's word you used?"
Incestuous weren't it?
Incestuous?
Was that a word.
Infested.
"Infested, contaminated"
Yes it is.
or fragile goods.
"Dangerous,haz really, he should declare it, and people don't you know, unless you ask."
"I think some of them do , yes, I know s er some of them have said how much they enjoyed it when it started off first, but er  but now it's just got that wee bit more serious."
"We're with the plays, with going to the festival of course, you can't,you must be serious when you're practising for something like that ."
"Do you feel like it's almost like doing a different thing that you're not, you know when you're actually acting in the play you're more self conscious and you're more conscious of what you're you're moving and you're speaking and whereas the likes of the panto you know you just be yourself really with a bit of fun thrown in ."
"Yeah, yes, oh yes aye the plays  the plays you've got to  think what you're doing wand if you miss your cue line you're putting your, the person next, off as well that it is more  er serious and you've got to think more I think"
Mhm.
really.
But however
"So you just kind of kept kept on singing, after the choir and that finished?"
"Aha, when the pantomime started up that was just carried on in there."
"Not that I'm a great, good or great singer it's just  I seem to have a strong voice."
Unfortunately you can always hear me above everybody else.
Oh dear.
"That's, you can"
But if er if folks spoke about you you know they would they would say you were a singer?
"Because you're seen in public and you do sing in public, there's a lot of people that sing but as you say it's sometimes just in their own homes or they used to but they would never sing in public ,they used to sing in the choir ."
"Yes, sing in public, no no."
"I've I wouldn't  I don't think I would go out if somebody said, Would you come  and sing  er at such and such a thing."
I I don't think I would go.
"But in the pantomime, well you're singing with everybody else, you're not er on your own really."
And the pantomimes a different thing altogether.
Mhm.
"And I mun that  I must have words in front of me, if I don't have words in front of me even though I know it, I I still forget it."
But er
"That's right, just nerves."
I think it's the nervousness that just knocks the words coming out of your head.
"Oh,"
It's easy to do.
Aha.
oh aye.
But er  do you quite like singing for folk that know you?
"Do you like singing in the village, where everybody knows you, or would you in some ways be less nervous do you think if you were singing like even to  folk,who just don't  so well ?"
Quite know me so well?
"We'll start down at the far end of what we call the lured mark and from there you'll have to tack all the way up to this closest one, the windward mark."
"From there it's a reach out to the far end to the wind mark, drive there and back to the beginning again."
Great.
We'll try it a few times just to put it all into practice.
Okay let's go.
That's fine .
Okay.
"Okay Howard, this should be a good test to see how much she's learnt."
Over she goes.
No she's let out the mainsheet to spill wind and now she's under control again.
"It's quite a steady tack around the windward mark, now that she's reaching she should have raised the daggerboard a little."
Now ready for the gybe.
"No I don't think she's ready quite yet, she's got a few things to sort out first and that's definitely not right, she wants to raise the daggerboard not lower it, bit of confusion there about which way to turn the tiller but she's round safely, she should be looking where she's going now instead of sorting out all the string."
"Okay now she's off really quickly on a reach but she's oversheeted, she's got too much power there, she's sheeting the sail in instead of easing it out until it flaps and then just pulling it in a little."
Should Suzanne have let the sail out like that?
"No, by letting the sheet go she lost power."
After the tack she'll have to put it all in again to accelerate away.
Now sitting out to balance the wind
That tack looked Okay.
"Yes, but she doesn't need that bundle of mainsheet in her hand."
"For this part of the course she should have the daggerboard right down,and she could be sailing in slightly shallower tacks towards us."
Whoops.
What happened there?
Well she let the boat heel so far before sheeting out that the boom hit the water and wouldn't go any further.
She recovered by leaning out more.
Suzanne's got a good sense of balance which is always useful when you're sailing  Now let's look at this gybe to see if it's any smoother.
Oh yes that's much better
"Wow, she's really taking off now."
"Yes, the wind is stronger out there."
"Considering she's only been sailing for a couple of days, she's doing very well."
If she were more nervous we'd have reached the Topper.
"She's still a little unsure on those tacks, she's easing out the mainsheet as she goes round."
Whatever they were carrying.
They they generally came all year round?
Yes oh yes generally came.
Ah but they always watched th they would be in some place over bad storms you know.
Er er er you know if there was a bad storm somebody would oh you better stay here today too again and he might be there three or four days.
So he would still stay there because he was told about the weather.
And he would know himself.
Mm.
You see it's not what er anybody else would say that it was good weather.
He they knew that they had a great sense of the weather themselves after being out in it.
Did they ever mention to you or your father that they in fact got caught out by the weather?
Oh well sometimes yes they would be very wet when they would come.
And when they would offer to no no they wouldn't they would have their own way of drying it in in their bags they would have another clean or or you would say clothes to put on but we never ever heard of them doing a washing .
Mm.
Or whatever.
Well they would be discarded.
It's it's like I I better not say say this but Irishmen over that when when I when I used to work with Irishmen my word they was good Irishmen.
Very good friends of mine.
But they would work they would never see them with dungarees.
They came with a good suit on and they would go to work with a suit double breasted and then and they would  work there and make a lot of money and when the next thing they would do they would hit into town and get all rigged out and then that was them from top to bottom from their hat right to their feet and then they were hitting the road then.
Yes I could say that that's true about Irishmen.
Mm.
The the tramps never mentioned some of the places they were actually forced to stay whether it was under a road bridge or?
Oh oh yes they yes they would stay under a road bridge too because you would see the er er if you would look a a bridge and they would say oh there's a tramp  there's a place there if you could tell me and you would see the rocks put up and where the bed was always above water level oh yes.
Mm.
Below the certain bridges.
Mm.
Depending how far away a house you see was and how they would be.
But never two of them meet together.
We we you never know that.
They would be always er passing.
They didn't go round like that they were very loners as you would say.
Okay would you like to start then?
Right has everyone had a chance to look at some stuff since last time?
Much.
"Okay Sally-Ann, have you had a chance to look at some of the things which we're gonna do today as well?"
"I haven't had a look at any books at all but, erm I was worried about ."
"Okay so do you want to run us through some of the things that  we haven't really discussed in detail of what we're gonna talk about in here today, specifically have we, I mean I thought something along the lines of er  the nature and extent of sexual variations in English, or any other language you want."
So in what way can it differ Men and women differ in conversation? and you can make it specific you can just discuss it and make very specific interruptions or turn-taking if you want.
On the other hand you could talk about things in general what the different aspects in the  speech are
being in other languages as well.
Is this
"yeah I mean okay  cover the languages to show how they did it properly, so if there is something else you want to bring in then that would be good."
"But I suppose it would mainly worthwhile concentrating on English, because that's where most of the data's from."
"Er I've got some notes here which I can go through  wouldn't actually be necessary but  When Sally-Ann's going through her notes if anyone else would like raise anything which backs it up or disagrees with it or whatever then, you know please you know butt in and say whatever think might might be relevant at the time."
have you stopped the erm  the
The don't  before Easter though.
What ?
"I'm not quite sure when the official handing in date for this essay is, because of the fact that some essays have overrun from last term."
"I suppose that really, probably is Friday week three but, I don't suppose it has to be."
Which reminds me.
Have I got your last essay in yet or not?
I'm a little bit confused  there and I can't get it out.
Okay.
Honest.
Okay.
Well like I say I'll I'll mark the rest of them when I've got them all in.
I can't really mark then till I don I don't want to mark them until I've got them all in cos otherwise it's not really fair  so hopefully next week sometime.
"I  this morning, I've been running around  and I can't get it out ."
What is it on WordPerfect?
Hm.
I keep getting  and things like that.
Oh maybe  could go to the advisory after I think they're open till five.
Mm.
No.
No.
"So if somewhere later on in the book she says, Michael Heseltine was a rotten old so and so."
erm
"I'm sure we know that she thinks that, so that won't actually sort of provoke great reaction in me."
What would it need to provoke you then?
We'll just see.
"What about, what she has had to say about John Major?"
"Well look, let's stand back."
My interest is in the unity and success of the Conservative party.
I don't want to see I I deeply deplore the divisions between left and right and the accentuation of often very phoney distinctions and mislabelling that goes on.
It's a development that has grown in my political lifetime over erm I suppose twenty years now.
"And I  don't like  that aspect of politics, the divisiveness of it all, the personal sort of er attentions of it all."
"I know it's there, but I thought that John struck with me a very powerful note, when he said in his conference speech, I should share these things first in private."
"And I don't think it would do any good for me on this programme, or any of my colleagues, and of course the media will be now all over the place trying to achieve this."
"To get instant reactions, instant comments which will blow the thing up."
But you're clearly unhappy about it.
I you you you've made that quite clear .
"I I cannot I I cannot believe that it is w within the the standards of the conservative party that I joined, that this sort of diary writing, gossipy, pseudo history er is part of the convention."
I think er one of the papers made this erm I think Alec Douglas Hulme er has set a sort of standard which I would admire.
"Er there were always memoirs, but I think that the nature of them has changed."
And I and not sure it's Well I am sure that it's for the worse.
It's causing damage?
I don't think that the people come out of it well.
Any of them?
Including the authors?
Er I think particularly the authors.
Should there be er a change in the rules?
What rules?
"That says, Well there aren't any rules at the moment obviously but but should there there are rules for for for civil servants, should there be rules for politicians?"
Well there are rules but cur
That say
Really?
"Lovely shops and everything, and er, it's all like round corners and everything, really, and some of these, dad's sort of, he marked the most that's open on Sundays."
"There, there's one street, it just like Gaps and everything, like, you know, it's a really lovely road, you know, and erm, it's just a really lovely area altogether."
"He showed me some really nice places, and then we went to this park, I can't remember what the park's called."
"We stopped off there, had hot chocolate and a piece of spinach quiche, but I was, and erm, and he treated me, which was quite amazing, and then erm,"
That was nice.
"and then erm, we drove, er then we walked through this park, which was lovely, it had squirrels running all round the place and pigeons and everything, it was gorgeous, and, and because it, it'd been such a gorgeous day, it's just that my fucking nose is cold."
It's really bright.
"So in fact, the sun is really hot, when you're in the car."
Yeah.
"So I, I erm, I had a lovely walk through there, and then we went out the other side of it, and it's Highgate Cemetery."
Oh.
"And, this cemetery is like, this, erm, George Eliot's buried there, Karl Marx is buried there,"
Mm.
there's all these famous people that are buried there.
"And er we didn't actually go in, but I'd love to go back one day and have a look,"
Yeah.
"because like, there there's a picture of the gravestone of Karl Marx outside and it looks really amazing, and some of the places, some of these graves that have, some of the, like tributes, are just enormous."
Really?
"They're just so big, it's incredible."
"You just can't envisage, you know, why and how they managed to afford such extravagant graves, and it's like on two sides of a road, on one side you can only go in, and if you're on a guided tour, erm, otherwise you've got to, be like, somebody to do with the grave."
Really?
"You know er personally attached to the grave, or go on a guided tour, and er, like you've got to wear certain bits of clothing, you gotta be like, you gotta be properly dressed, er, you're not allowed to eat or drink in there, there's all these things, like, you know, really"
into that.
Yeah?
But it looks fantastic.
"It looks, you know, I mean, it's  to say that, it sounds really weird, but it"
Yeah.
"so mysterious and strange in there, that it would be really interesting"
been in there.
to have a look.
"He's looked round some parts of it, yeah."
"We wouldn't have, we"
levels the then
wouldn't have no M S threes.
then none of our M S threes
would have come back at M S three.
"What concerns me is the project engineers are in close liaison with the client, and have a lot of procedures to go through that er S T Os and M S ones at design engineering level do not have to go through."
They do have a much greater responsibility.
"And particularly I mean just signing the V Os, because if it's cocked up, the question's been asked of me."
You know.
"If you have an S T O, in a sense if you don't define what the project engineer is, what grade he is, he can sign off unlimited amounts of money."
.
It doesn't seem right does it?
"I it seems, well"
No.
"But the point t that Hughie makes is that y you allocate er y you, you make the project engineer someone who have trained, and, and that you know is capable of doing that job."
Yeah.
Well I can think of one M S one in our er office who I'd be quite erm quite happy with him doing all the project eng engineering duties except finance.
"Because he, he just has  you know   a very slap happy er attitude towards finance, but from an engineering point of view you can trust him"
Mm.
so this means you daren't give him anything now.
Well in that case I wouldn't put him on er on a job that was made out on site but I would keep him in the
"T as far as the allocation of, of erm the project engineering responsibilities, that forms part of the quality plan."
"That, that, that he is given a note as part of the quality plan saying, here you are son, you are now project engineer."
These are your duties.
You are responsible for that job and you are identified on the project quality plan check list as to what you will be doing and what other members of the team will be doing.
"He couldn't live, live by it."
You know it d the first thought  bloody hell.
If you don't want to use it don't use it.
S T O with unlimited signing power.
There's an anom anomaly here.
But if you don't want to use it don't
"And anyway he can't, he can't actually spend, spend this money unless he's got"
Fighting has cut off supplies to the refugees.
Save The Children works with organisations like the Red Cross to restore that life line.
Poor children in Jamaica often fall prey to drugs dealers who offer them clothes and shoes in return for carrying drugs.
"Save The Children helps youngsters living and working on the streets, it runs schools where the poorest can get hot meals and lessons."
Just one more example of how Save the Children does just that all round the world.
Yes.
"Those are some of the reasons why I and many others support Save The Children and thank you Patricia Routledge  for talking to us today, it was a pleasure listening to you."
Hello everyone.
Once again it is lovely to see you all.
"Well this is it, next year is our seventy fifth birthday so today is one of our most important meetings we will ever have."
"It'll be a very challenging year for volunteers, I'm sure you'll all agree."
In the past year I've been invited by many of you to meet branch members and to make shop visits all over the United Kingdom.
It's been a privilege to have done this  and I'm overwhelmed by the enthusiasm I've encountered.
"You, Save The Children Fund volunteers, are determined not to let the recession beat you."
The message I've given to London is that volunteers are in very good heart and it doesn't stop there.
The really good thing is that there are a huge variety of plans for our big year.
More of that later.
But what about the last twelve months.
What stories do our figures tell us?
"Well  while we were all delighted about the tremendous increase in income two years ago we were also a little concerned about how we should hold on to it, but we have."
"Last year branch income was on target at seven point eight million pounds, a massive increase on the plateau of five to five and half million pounds we were on before Skip Lunch."
Congratulations to you all.
"And the shops, well there are now one hundred and fifty nine shops."
"Together they have raised five point seven million pounds last year, a wonderful result and thank you all."
I particularly want to highlight the shop cash donations.
We've introduced a new donations box and some shops have special donations secretaries  and many helpers encourage donations too.
What a success story.
"Shop cash donations have gone up from five hundred and sixty three thousand to six hundred and twenty nine thousand, a marvellous increase."
Hello sir.
How you doing?
Not so good.
I think it's possible to make a bit of money but at at at the rate  you know I feel we're all the time putting the cart before the horse.
"Erm  you know if if we are going to try to keep going as a viable group then yes one of the things we should consider I mean I I don't I've come here sort of thinking  oh is this it, is this the crisis meeting or"
is it  you know erm  I mean I feel so so passionately that that we should keep going but
Mm.
I also feel just that I am  able to contribute next to nothing in terms of time so and I think w we're almost all in that situation.
Erm  you know we sort of seem to limp from one meeting to another without  really committing ourselves to anything much.
"And you know if we were able to commit ourselves to two public, two meetings, three meetings of some sort in a year  where we're actually gonna do something and present some sort of front  Par part of presenting some sort of front is to try to sell a few bits of pieces  if we're prepared to accept that we're going to lose money."
Yeah.
"I mean if we, we're preaching you should use recycled products we, if we had a few to sell at least"
Mm.
Yeah.
I mean you you're be selling your Traidcraft stuff I mean
Which
why why does Barbara believe it's okay to sell that but not
"No, well we're, we're in exactly the same problem with Traidcraft."
"You know  we we used to sell thousand of pounds worth a year and now we're down to  couple of thousand a year and we're s , we are losing money on that."
Mhm.
No  we're not actually losing money but I mean  with Traidcraft we are getting to the low point where we put  borrowed stock
Well that's the recession isn't it?
Or
"Well, what I thought was with this one world week thing at least people that, who go might be more receptive  to what we have to say to show and sell ."
Yes we've done really well with with Traidcraft
"because that is, that's the whole reason for the the the concert and they're gonna have this concert in there as well and people will be buying tickets to go to."
Yeah.
And I don't know an awful lot about it and there's going to be all these stalls.
Where they're coming obviously because they believe in that sort of thing so
Two or three years ago one world week was a full week of all sorts of different activities which were all very well attended.
It's sort of dwindled very rapidly
Has it.
"down to, I d I don't even know what happened last year."
Mm
We just had a stall didn't we?
"Now  do you think that the campaign th the th , the campaigns against the use in cosmetic testing had anything to do with the changes that were brought in, or do you think advances and responsible er  science would have, would have made those changes anyway?"
"I think inevitably,th the changes would have come because the, the alternatives are better."
Yep.
They are less misleading.
"Ah, but I think the campaign, the public campaign and the pressure that's been put on companies have definitely made quite a, quite a difference."
Yes?
While I agree that there is absolutely no justification for testing for cosmetic purposes at all!
Absolutely
Yes.
none!
I think we would have advanced to the stage we are at had we not used animals in the earlier stages for medical research.
"We're advancing all the time and I think there may came a time we won't use animals at all for medical research, but at, up till now we needed to use animals for medical research."
"I think you've got to be realistic about this whole issue, that  er, obviously seeing the poor furry little bunny suffering for cosmetics!"
Mhm.
Yes!
"I agree, that is wrong!"
"But, if a test on a chimpanzee would save my child's life I'm afraid I'd go for the test on the chimpanzee."
Okay.
Yes?
"Erm I  I think that one of the erm, drawbacks in using animals for any kind of testing is that it sort of precludes in some way using alternatives."
"And I think that, you know people who, they may be trained when they're a studying to"
Mhm.
"use animals, and then go onto to work using animals, and erm  you know, if maybe alternative techniques were introduced at an earlier stage, maybe in their training, they'd be more likely to them on board."
"But, it's almost like it's  the established pattern to use animals to test"
Mhm.
"all sorts of things, and it's gonna take quite a big shifty to get out of that."
Mhm.
Yes?
I agree with what that lady's just said.
"What I find horrible is that  there are so many organisations or  or places all over Great Britain, they're all doing the same sort of tests!"
Can't we  collate our knowledge so that not so many tests are having to be done on all these animals?
Yes?
"erm, sort of relative."
"Yeah, that, that needs something if you actually set up a system and then a business meeting one month and a speaker the next, it puts a lot of pressure on one of us or some of us to, to , erm, this is true."
"Maybe, maybe, maybe if, I think it sounds as if people would, would like that, you know, at least every few months perhaps to have something different"
Yes.
"maybe, maybe, people could just be thinking or, you know if they hear of somebody who might be able to come and give a talk like your friend who, who was very good, erm, you know, we could make a note of it and, or ask people, you know, could talk to talk or something that sort."
"Mm, mm, that sounds a possibility, I think, I think it is interesting to have someone like that you know"
Mm.
"Like we had you know, who could talk about experiences you know, in a, in a particular country where there are human rights and problems, good."
"Right erm, so that's it, is that all the"
.
business?
"Yes, just, just, remind people the next, the next meeting erm, is Tuesday the tenth of March, we always meet on a Tuesday evening and it will be at Ann's house in Harlow, which is , said on the tape ."
Must be of benefit.
.
"Right, er, people can take what bits from tables they want them, or, I've got s , I've got one  put out, erm, shall we open that door a bit, it's getting a bit hot in here, erm, don't know if Mary wants any help out there."
Good.
"Testing, testing."
"Okay right, so what we've been looking at this week is trade in agricultural commodities, and er, possibly a little bit of GATT as well."
"And I believe Bob  has asked you to er, I think, collect some data erm, on trade in wheat and cotton erm, as an example."
We'll come on to that a bit later on.
"But can you just give me, sort of, a brief overview of what's happened to the composition of world trade right, say over the last hundred years or so."
What have been the main features?
"Well the er, proportion agricultural trade has decreased."
"Right, correct, okay, erm what absolute, the absolute values of trade."
"So the relative share of agricultural trade has declined, the relative share of manufacturing trade has increased."
How about in absolute terms?
It's increased.
"Yes, that's right."
All trade has increased.
"Why, why has trade in all commodities, agricultural or non-agricultural increased?"
Better transport links.
That are not the standard English shall we say something like that.
So let's think of all first of all then about the voice.
Now there's a word I'm going to use right now which is a technical term in a way and that is is er the technical term for the study of language and how we speak the word what we say and how we say it.
It goes under the lovely title of paralinguistics
Para yeah that's right yeah.
Paralinguistics is is the study of the words we say and how we say them.
So quite obviously the how we say things is all to do with the voice isn't it?
Now I've got four letter Ps to do with the voice er and what I want to do is is think about the comparison of aspects of the voice when we have a normal one to one conversation and compare that with the same aspects when we're making a presentation standing in front of a group.
First of all power.
The power of the voice.
How do we need to adjust the power when we're making a presentation?
To the size of the audience
"To the size absolutely, to the size of the audience so if we say a one to one we've got a certain level of conversational power if you say so with a group like this it has to be"
Just raised slightly doesn't it yes and obviously if you've got fifty people and you don't have a microphone or anything then it becomes even more so.
You get much above about fifty people you perhaps do need a some technical assistance with the power.
So the power needs to be just slightly slightly raised okay.
"Now another P, anybody think of other Ps to do with the voice."
Pitch
"Pitch, that's that's yes."
Now pitch is to do with er technically to do with the frequency isn't it the the high or low pitch like on a piano from high notes to low notes?
What do we need to ensure in terms of pitch when we're speaking to a group of people?
Variety
Sorry
Variety
Variety that's right there has to be variety because because if you talk in a monotone all the time then it all becomes rather boring doesn't it?
So there's got to be variations in the pitch.
"Power, pitch, there's one I want to squeeze in between but I mean it doesn't matter."
Pace
"pace, pace, yeah."
In a way projection is sort of with power.
Pace that's right you've been cheating and looking on looking on the next page
That's right.
Alright.
"I mean, we did reports, we did those, yeah"
"lot of ideas about getting an idea about did you, am I in the class just now?"
"I went to erm, the registration"
Yeah.
it says I haven't been put on the list.
Am I on it ?
"Er, well, they hadn't notified me, but they probably, you told them anyway, did you?"
"Yeah,"
Because that's the important thing.
"Erm, yeah  the important thing is that they know."
"I mean, I know, I've, I've written it down myself."
Erm
"Okay, you say you're still"
"Right, yeah"
You're still doing this
"I didn't think the question that erm, the question  culture was the same as our culture."
Right.
"And erm,read about the book so far, and I'm going through erm,"
Okay.
Why?
"Well, there's no need now, I mean, I only suggested this erm, to help you, er, and I wouldn't want to make you write it out er, just for the sake of writing it out."
It don't think it's a good use of your time.
"And I mean, if you think that just presenting it in the, in the class is er enough"
"send it down to use yourself, but to be able to carry that through and to, to go on to, to be sincere, and I respect that it's important to be sincere."
"If you, you know, talk about people  moral values and to be able to do that, and just  majority of anything you need to  you need to have a  that allows you to do that without"
"Yes, yeah."
"Yes, it's very important to remember that both in, from this direct point of view and from Freud's findings, you shouldn't just assume that it was a watertight compartment between two areas, as it were."
One conscious and un it's not like that.
"I mean, in fact, what, what er, what Freud found, he says is sometimes, you get erm, this is in fact a kind of continuing from conscious and unconscious, and there's a big gradation in between, and very often erm, things are erm, unconscious, not in the sense that they're totally lost, and you are unaware of them, but for example , they're, they're isolated."
"They, they, they exist erm,princ a very common finding in psychoanalysis is that things will, will, will exist as word representations, with no feeling representation, or they won't be connected to, to er   they'd be completely isolated."
"You know, a very good example of this, that always sticks in my mind,telling me erm, that once she was analyzing a woman and er, a lot of the analysis was concerned with erm, conflicts, erm, relating to masturbation in childhood, and  constantly felt that this was what the analysis seemed to have done , because the woman consistently denied this had ever happened."
"Okay well  we're in a really bad situation, I mean we can achieve something at least and perhaps  oh perhaps communism doesn't work after all, they just seem to be doubting their own beliefs and what they've read."
"And that's the only way I can see a way through this, thinking okay they've got this ideology, they've tried it twice and it still hasn't worked."
Let's go back to the drawing board and try something else.
"Cos this, this is definitely not communism in any sense."
Right.
"I mean  does, does this document surprise you?"
I mean is
Yes.
is that what you thought the nineteen forty nine revolution was all about?
"I'm not surprised it's come back erm  to, to a sort of right  is this an expression of mass mind do you think?"
What do you think?
Cos if it is  communist behaviour
"There is, no there's no mass  argument because you've got"
Why not?
this different situation
that's not mass minded.
"Well it's quite, I'm sure that I'm sure, I'm sure that a lot of, I'm sure the rich peasant"
Well there's about eight people
cos really they're the only f you know they'll be going yeah that's my mass line alright
"Well of course it is, yeah  but that's not  thing is it?"
"Well, it is for them you see,"
"there, there's no such thing as an absolute mass line, the mass line in particular  two types of people."
No that's not a mass mind then is it?
Exactly.
well there's no such thing as a mass line then is there?
"but anyway we, we, we'd better stop there."
"But I think it's important we've, we've now got  what  what the policy was."
On the face of it it looks very much as though this is erm   very little social justice
"what, what I hope we'll do next week is to, is to take that idea up and to see maybe why this policy came through  erm and we'll look at the, like the arithmetic of that as to, as to how much money there was, how much land there was in fact."
Mm.
How you could actually achieve a distribution.
"So I think for next week  I'd like to be looking in some detail, there are two sources on this one is, is  and the other is ,tho those two are crucial in terms of understanding or, and   and that those are crucial in terms of understanding erm why this  policy document ."
about it we could you know five minutes.
Well you know I mean you said that they did a couple of lines just to say something about
They both I mean they I think they've released four documents outlining the way in which they're going to meet their  commitments and they one of their the Guardian gave devoted page six the whole of page six to this.
Erm and one of the pieces was sort of comments from various interested parties and the Green Party got a couple of lines in there after the Lib Dems and before .
I was still laughing too much from from some comment that the Government did one one of their four promises was to was to put pri public transport before  private roads.
I nearly cracked up .
John Major saying that people will have to accept restrictions on on car usages and it's an amazing thing to come from a Tory.
Yeah and I I asked the question not too much from the Green Party point of view as from a personal point view as I I would like to know what my Government is saying to do about these things.
I I'd no idea he he'd actually he'd actually said something like like that.
He also said that there's no reason to give up the dream of economic growth but then there you go.
Well nobody thinks that.
They don't seem to be doing too well with the the energy of economic growth.
No.
Dream more I guess.
No after all the party of economic growth and reduced taxation
Yes
I know I've I've read the publicity material and
I thought you were going to say you voted for them.
I would have had something to say about that.
That's not my party
They had Sir Jonathan on the radio the day of the message  saying they're long on rhetoric and short of substance .
That was the the overall comment I think that the documents were very very light on detail as you might
I've was just  I heard erm how Lord Jonathan has just been become become a pier or something.
No it's erm his father died.
It it's not a hereditary title I think but I think he can become a sir if he wants to.
Yeah I just I guess I had hoped to be pleasantly surprised that it wasn't  rhetoric
The only coverage I've seen so far is erm is the news and ten of all things.
That we were watching last night.
And the encouraging thing was that they're all things that a few years ago in the Green Party  sort things out they're all there.
Absolutely.
"For all that the Government is making a bit of er er idiot of itself by not embracing the things that it needs to embrace the things it needs to do, at least it's saying that it won't do them."
Which is the first step from the process isn't it?
was going to see Miss I see
So then I saw Mrs Irwin on Tuesday  when I was in  and she came up with all sorts of things that she would like for the new  development.
"but there's nothing ready, of course."
There's this giant sundial we're going to have in one of the courtyards.
It's a giant one.
It's it's th the building and the blocks of things in in in the in the courtyard that make the time.
So the sun shines  bit of the courtyard when it's eight o'clock and that when it's nine o'clock and so forth.
This is just for the courtyard and these shrubs and things
how?
Where is it going to be seen from?
I presume it's seen from the wards that're behind looking down into this courtyard.
There's also erm a play area for the children's ward.
"There's also some murals on the walls, various artists did murals and of course they've got this grant from  for six thousand pound for a  exhibition."
A six thousand pound grant for  exhibition
"Well, well, over, over a period it's and other things too but this this set of murals and  are involved in it."
And various other art things.
But also there's the thought of th gar a garden and the children keeping the garden up.
"But that's  a long way and they have transport difficulties to cope from here to the  hospital but then I though perhaps, if"
"I can't see the education committee, with their lack of money, paying for transport for children out here to go to  hospital to do a garden"
The the education committee and the school governors have no money at all to pay for that
"I know, I would have thought it was very low priority"
"well it isn't even a priority, it's nothing, they won't get the money,th they won't pay for  walk to go swimming but I thought that now that the  has acquired that bus and it's gonna be standing around doing nothing for most of the time and it's a twenty nine seater bus."
"I mean, the seats come up so that wheelchairs go in, but in between times it's twenty nine seats"
And then you need a P S V licence
"But that's that's perhaps easily remedied, if you could get a er a driving licence holder to take them, who, a volunteer driving licence holder, among one of the parents or somebody who could take the children at periodic intervals to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing."
So that was a possibility.
But I haven't seen Miss White yet about all these sort of things.
But I did also say to Mrs Earl that a new head will be appointed to take in posts from first of September and it might be better to discuss it with them after I discussed it with Miss White.
"I only know one person, I only know one bus driver with children"
There's ambulance drivers
And he g he I think their children go to the Catholic school.
"Er, this letter from the Multiple Sclerosis"
in its infancy then.
"And, and then er at that particular time you know and er then unemployment you, I  you had to see each firm was issued with the and the firms had to agree that you had to sign a contract of employment so that er if you were leaving or he was paying you off, you had to be given two weeks' notice either way before they pay you off."
And that was the contract of employment.
Mhm.
Yeah.
What did you go on to do after the business folded?
"Ah well I was, I was a y on er thing we had back in the building trade."
Back in the building trade once again which I had experience before so I had no problem .
"And the reason in the first place I did leave the building trade was my hands was breaking out with in industrial disease, see?"
Dermatitis and I felt I couldn't go near cement and all of that.
"But then I, eventually I tried the building trade again and I joined a firm called er  forget, or something like that and I was working up in George Street in, in, in Edinburgh."
"You always go  building, we gutted right from ground floor, left the existing walls in."
"And then inside building we completely demolished inside, just sort of left the retaining walls and built it up from fourteen feet below the ground to five storeys, high,itself."
And we had to go down through fourteen feet of solid rock.
So this was obviously quite a difficult job?
Aye it was a difficult job but as I say to have an experience mines
Mhm.
"and er building trade work, both of these things had left me with the qualifications for be abl be able to do it."
Did you notice much difference in the sort of er erm the techniques or the machinery or whatever that was being used between ?
Ooh vast va er er in the building trade?
"Oh yes, yes."
"For instance you see all these big  they'd actually built up from the ground up, they'd no taking now just the odd ."
They built up from a working
"Was there still the erm the, the thing you talked about with the guaranteed work at that time?"
Yes.
Oh aye aye.
Yes
"but er the essential work contract then that I had spoken about in the first place  the building trade, that was a government order."
"Essential, essential work which was operated during the war years and er what  year a couple, several years after that."
"That was an essential b eventually that was taken away, but the building trade still believed if a building firm wanted men, they had to have at least a thirty two hour guarantee, which is at present still in operation."
"A thirty t they had to guarantee an employee thirty two hour guarantee,"
Was that to get rid of the sort of ee erm the way them building firms used to take people on every day?
.
So that was
Thirty six?
Thirty seven?
"Thirty seven, perhaps ."
"That was during well,th the end of the Depression, really?"
"Well it was still very depressed in the coal trade, you were they were doing this marvellous thing called three on and three off."
"If you worked four, you were worse off than if you worked three, you know, you'd got three days on th er and you got you got three days dole, er unemployment pay."
Mm.
"And er so times were still hard, it wasn't until they, let's say until thirty ei thirty eight, that the depression finished in the coal field, when they started building up from then."
"And of course, this was the time of the means test, when young men from  who er lived at home, their income was taken into account, in assessing how much Dad or Mum couldn't get."
"And er they took themselves off to Coventry and to and to Luton, to the motor trades."
And quite a few went.
What were the?
What
What?
was the sewage conditions and the the water supply like in the thirties in ?
Good..
"Because there'd been arguments about it earlier on in the century, hadn't there?"
"Oh there had, had er it h erm had a marvellous water supply and it had a good sewage it had a good sewage disposal system."
"But erm sewage was to be one of the things I shall never forget, later on."
"Whilst I was working for the council, someone came to ask and we had some new o new officer appointed and he was very worried about getting ca er p permission from the council to launch a sewer scheme that was going to cost a quarter of a million pounds, a very large amount in those days."
"And  the older members of the staff, and there weren't many, I mean the total s council office staff was only about thi was twenty or so, and erm more men were employed outside, than anything."
"And they said, Well you know how to draw up your agenda, and you'll have something that's contentious, in this case it was the supply of stationery from three local stationers, from printi local printers."
"And they argue that half the night, and then er your thing will go through on the nod, if you get it in before t half past nine when they er standing order say the council meeting closes."
Mm.
S so Huck Urban District Council was separate from Nottingham  wasn't it ?
Yes.
Yes.
"Er Nottingham had about three attempts to pinch , and er the last one they were told to put their own house in order, first, because  conditions were so much better than in the city."
"Erm mainly as a result,I I contend, that earlier on the Quaker coal owners encouraged home ownership, has this very high proportion of er owner-occupiers."
"Tt Er in nineteen seventy four, I think, at least about three quarters of them were ."
"But er nevertheless you felt that you wanted to go into Well you were probably to over qualified for going into the pit, weren't you?"
"Never thought about the pit, I'd been There was no question about that, it was something that was not going to last."
"I mean, the pits would be worked out, according to the talk at home, and anyhow, we wanted to live in Dartmouth."
Mm.
So what did you actually do in the rating office?
"Well, I wrote out births, deaths, marriage certificates, and er then measured up houses on the rating side, erm worked them out for evaluations."
"Erm used to go down to weddings, at the register office on a Saturday morning, and hope that they'd turn up without witnesses, because then you had to be  compensated,, for giving your service."
How much would you get for?
"I occasionally got ten shillings, which was more than a week's as much a week's wages."
"Erm but er I learnt to write a fair hand, erm without too many flourishes, which er because I was always told that somebody might be looking at this in a hundred years time, or more."
Mm.
"In going to measure houses, did you have to actually go out and visit houses ?"
"Yes, oh aye I Yes, we You had to measure, and in those days, the councils were grouped in what they called Assessment Committee Areas, and each were wor making sure the other areas were using the same sort of basis."
"And I remember, one afternoon, going out with the whole of the  rating committee, to houses at Eastwood and Beeston, and other places, and m in effect measuring them by counting how many nine inch bricks they were across the front and back, to make sure that, you know, nobody was subsidizing anybody else."
Mm.
"Erm and you went in houses, you saw them."
"You know, learnt about construction."
Mm.
Did you see much of people's living conditions?
"Particularly poor living conditions,?"
"Oh you saw er you'd seen this because er you had friends all over, I mean, the fact that you went to  didn't er tt get rid of all your friends."
Mm.
"Erm you had friends everywh , in all sorts of places, you didn't dally, shall we say, in some of them that might have been a bit smelly."
Mm.
"And others that you wouldn't have gone in anyhow, but they were areas."
"But generally  I saw more living conditions later on, er when er I started rent collecting for the council."
Mm.
"And the rating officer was part time with the council, and one day, a rent collector was taken ill, and then I was given a five shilling bag of copper and told to go and collect these"
When?
When was this?
Er it would be nineteen thirty seven.
Mm.
"If they are selling it abroad, it's international though."
"Mm, ah yes, you can't, any domestic policy has international ramifications, if it affects er, resource allocation and, and demand and agricultural protectionism, like any protectionism will, will er, will reallocate resources, not according to comparative advantage, but according to some erm, some priority, we want to support our agriculture, therefore we'll erm, give agricultural producers a lot of money."
"Now, clearly that's going to dis distort trade because, if we're increasing domestic production   Come in, ah, hi Mervin."
"Sorry, you alright for tomorrow?"
"Yes, I can go to the lecture, but I'm teaching at eleven like yourself."
"I'll er, I'll see you if Win's free at, at eleven."
"Yes, yes, I've been to se I've a couple of people up to sort of promise a hand"
"Yes, is, is, is Tony, is Tony er, busy as well?"
Tony's got a le meeting at ten thirty.
"Ah, which won't finish"
"Fortunately I wasn't expecting to be lecturing, but er,"
Right
I've had to lecture for Paul
"right, well we'll sort, we'll sort something out, but I'll see if Winnie's, I'll see if Winnie's available."
"Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that, yes, yes, okay."
"I mean if the worst comes to the worst, we'll sort of, cancel a lecture, or something"
"Ah, well, it's only a matter of giving them a cup of coffee afterwards."
"Right, okay, I'm sure we can go, we can look after, we can get Robert  in or something"
"Yes, that's right we just get, just grab a couple of people."
Sorry to disrupt your class.
"That's okay, I'll, I'll sort it out anyway, later this afternoon, yes, yes that's right, yes that's it"
"Okay, ten o'clock, eight thirty nine."
Do you want me to introduce us?
"Yes, if, if you want to, just to let the students know"
"Sure, yes"
"who he is, and why he's there."
"That's, that's grand, thanks, Melvin, cheers."
"yes, yes, okay, thanks for everything."
"Erm, right, where was I?"
"Yes, so domestic policies, you know, can not be viewed at in isolation, right."
"All domestic policies will have international implications okay, and it's something that er, governments tend to erm, sort of over overlook when they're arguing the agriculturalists case in, in GATT."
"Then don't you think given that case, we should set up a whole inter international thing, which oversees all the governments?"
What?
What have I done?
Oh you weren't supposed to be able to read it.
"No, we can read it but it's"
It's just happened a lot this week.
"Er so yeah, you want to do some questioney tag things?"
Yeah.
"Okay, I mean just ignore that one, forget I wrote it."
I mean on something like interruptions there's only so much you can say.
Er
"yeah, which is why may be general one might be more useful dependi it depends how much"
"Whereas if you do  interaction of children you can do it here,"
Mhm.
Oh yeah I mean if you wanted to also link that with multicultural situation or or cross cultural or comparing it with other ones I mean that's no problem.
language of the  different to
Okay.
certain dialectic language.
"Yeah well if you want to that then that's fine as well, I mean that  Tell you what, the best thing then is can everyone put a note in my pigeon hole by Monday in other words, you've got the weekend to decide for definite."
"Gives us just like a provisional title of what the essay will be, on what your essay will be."
"Is that alright, cos then you've gone away with any ideas you've got from now which is probably none, er and then it also means that I don't have to spend next week worrying in case we get to Friday and Thursday and you're still not sure what you're doing."
Is that alright?
Okay if you just sort of like think of a vague title which sums up what the things are which you want to cover in the essay and if you get it to me by Monday then that that'll be quite good.
"You know about  questions, is it questions like sort of"
Well tag questions and er and questions in their own rights which i I supposed seeking agreement is the idea.
Or with anything which is vaguely connected with that I mean that just sort of a coverall term for it.
excuse me.
"Okay so does everyone, think they'll gonna be able to think of something over the weekend?"
"Okay and then if next week somet If next week everyone can have Okay w I think what you need to do f for next Thursday is For Monday to give me  what you're going to do and then between Monday and Thursday, try and read anything you can about that topic."
"I mean you could forget this list that I gave th b that gave you, unless there's anything on it that is still relevant, but find the things yourself on that topic so that on Thursday Next Thursday you can each spend ten minutes talking about things which you've read in your topic specifically."
And if anyone chooses the same topic as somebody else then you can do it together or not together or which ever.
but if that can be a general idea for next week.
Okay .
I'm a  I totally disagree
You had a you you you were unfortunate in the way you were treated
with you in the way it is run when you  when I took my allegations to him because that's basically what they're saying it is  I know it's no allegations
"Let's not go into the specifics of the court case just now  David Lightbown, what I want to say to you, do you think it's a case, some people might perhaps unjustifiably but they still would say that those people who are bullied are bullied because they are nonconformists and in the military one has to conform and many people"
Well of course of course they do.
It's what our the Army's all about.
"So if in any way you're different, if you're black or if you're short or if in any way you're different, you're fair game for the bullies perhaps?"
"It's not whether you're black or white, it's not whether you're pink or green, it's how you respond to orders."
And how quickly you respond to orders  situations .
Did you not respond to orders Richard Richard?
It's not a case of black and white did you say?
No.
"It is, it was a case it was a case with me that I was black or white and that's why that's why it hit the press like it did."
"look, look you're you're you're a guy that's been through a lot."
I accept that.
"Yeah, yeah."
But you survived it.
"And you will go on surviving it, you will turn"
"why should I have to survive it?my country too you know,"
I know it's your country too.
And nobody  no no nobody nobody is saying that you were tr
"I was told when I was in my regiment I was told  my country, it wasn't my country that was what I was told."
nobody is saying that
David Lightbown
"you were treated correctly,badly treated ."
"David Lightbown, David Lightbown ."
survivor
David Lightbown one second.
"Now er w w with every respect, to say that he survived it is something of a crass statement, because I remember reading about him thinking isn't this country getting good that we can have a black guardsman, and I remember my own disappointment when I read that he had to leave the regiment."
Let's speak to er Tim er .
"Now Tim er, you were a soldier now you're a social worker."
"We heard earlier on about this this this regimental bath I think they call it, this bath of excreta and urine and bleach and the brigadier and David Lightbown said how rare this was, er did you ever see it?"
I mean you said two years later  change.
"Ah well sure but then the whole lot goes, but, but, but, but, but this was, this was the document, I mean the way this was put forward, this is going to last us through into the foreseeable future."
"Erm  you know,th th th this er er it was a medium term horizon on this at the time."
Are you saying that they didn't mean what they said then?
"And that  I mean cos Mao said that how that you needed to have a moderate policy, that was the correct one"
Absolutely.
"in order to ha to achieve one's goals, are you saying that how look well you've just got to assume that they were wrong  that they didn't mean what they said?"
I mean it's perfectly
Yeah.
legitimate to think that how that they did think that this was a short-term goal in order to achieve their long-term  objectives.
"One, one might argue that  erm one might argue that there is a cynical implication thereupon, one might argue that  but, but in i i in exactly the same way at the moment you might argue that all the assurances they've given on Hong Kong are, are not worth the paper they're written on and, and, and as soon as the, soon as you get through to nineteen ninety seven they'll walk in."
"Er  are, are you saying no that they, they are not  er"
But you see they wouldn't have been able to realize their goals in nineteen forty nine.
"I mean, okay"
Why not?
supposing if they had
"fifty they could, they could have gone  they could have gone"
But could they?
Were th were the peasants ready for it?
Is that what the peasants wanted at that time?
Ah.
Well okay bu but in that sense are you saying that the learning experience was such that the peasant was so conservative and reactionary and so  was all you could do?
Yeah which peasants are you talking about?
Mm.
"Are you talking, saying the peasant, I mean it doesn't mean anything does it, the peasant?"
Mm.
all peasants.
I mean it may just depend upon how secure the
"How, how would you have felt as a poor peasant"
"I mean it really does depend upon how secure they were and how much, how much support,ge genuine support they had of the, the masses as a whole, because if they didn't then there's no way, and people weren't calling for them to establish socialism at that time were they?"
Would they have known what socialism was?
Exactly.
"I mean yeah as you say he's very high personable person, there must be some reason behind it  er and a lot of the theoretical reasons that he says of"
"of ideological progression, maybe he thought that, that, that erm the only, ultimately the only way to capitalis er to communism was through capitalism and he needs to establish a period of capitalism first."
Sure yes.
And that's what sort of Marx said.
So that
Yeah.
yeah but it doesn't mean that they're selling out completely does it because it
Mm.
"it means that it's just, it's a realization of, of the progression of communism  is to establish a capitalist phase."
Okay.
"communism rather a, a weak theory doesn't it?"
It's like saying
"Well Mao would do anything  the Communist Party, let's make it capitalist society."
"No because if you look at Marxist writing it's,i it's, you go through certain stages and you can't achieve"
That's right.
And that's what's happening to us now
"That's just, that's just  but why does it have to happen?"
It doesn't.
If they really wanted they could've just gone straight for it.
If they'd really wanted to.
They wanted to make it work though and they couldn't have made it work unless  they had had the  I mean the right conditions to do so.
You could have you could have made it work.
"You could've made it work if the peasants if the peasants were revolutionary, if the peasants had  changed their value system and weren't  and that  there were very few who were still working within the  economy."
So er
Are are you saying this is all that was possible because the peasant really was a capitalist at heart?
Well it was very likely that this policy was gonna succeed
In what?
"and they was gonna take a bigger risk, in keeping  them in power   so that they can achieve  their longer term ends."
"But sh sh sure they can succ succ they can succeed in creating capitalism, it, it  it, it might succeed in  paving the way for new China's industrialization  but we've gone a long way from any  any ideological position, we've gone a long way from  well what is in the best material benefiting class of the poor peasant now  the poor peasant is not gonna get very much out of this."
"It seems as if a disillusionment, the communists are trying you know, trying policies"
Yeah.
and they're still not bloody work what can we do?
"As, as far as I know I have a committal today."
That's right.
But I would of thought that your solicitor was  to be here  to represent you.
As far as I'm aware my solicitor  has been in contact with Burnley prosecution to have the case  transferred to Birmingham Crown Court.
Well  he has been a bit
if you tried there.
Did you recognise  the chap?
"I'm afraid sir, I have  no knowledge, I haven't certainly myself spoken to anybody  with regard to that, I would of thought the normal procedure would be for him to be committed  to Preston Crown Court and for the Crown Courts thereafter  to sort out the final venue."
I certainly have no knowledge of  of any contact  with regard to the ultimate venue and nothing has been marked on my file.
"Your worships, legal aid was granted er  on the thirteenth of September to affirm   of burglary."
Well obviously they're not here your worship.
Well all I can suggest is the case is  adjourned for the week we'll just have to arrange a solicitor to be here.
I wish for the committal to go along please sir?
I've been stuck up in this place
In that case  of the day sir because the statements have to read out in full.
He doesn't want to be represented is that what you're saying?
What I'm saying sir is to save the inconvenience to the court  is that if I could have my committal  cos I don't wanna be stuck up in this part of the country!
I have a Crown Court appearance in Birmingham  and as far as I'm aware my solicitors  have been in contact with the prosecution in this part of the country to explain the procedure  and as far as I'm aware  the committal this morning was to be committed to Birmingham Crown Court with other offenses.
"Well you've heard the senior prosecutor say that she knows nothing, she"
"Well I don't, I wouldn't have said"
I don't know sir.
Oh!
"I mean, that case then can I take my  my committal to Preston Crown Court, and when I go to Birmingham"
If you're committed to trial in this court you will be committed to Preston.
Well I'll take it
If
now then sir.
if it is to be arranged  and that you're dealt with at another court  Crown Court will have to arrange that.
Well in that case sir can you  get the committee then please?
As of now.
"As I say sir we put this matter down till later in the day, the defendant wi will not appear to be represented therefore the committal will have to be  dealt with by re reading out all the statements."
It can't be done  simply !
The tone of the party has changed.
"On Europe for instance, we've had er Mr Major telling the Europeans to get the your tractors off our lawns."
David Hunt calling Delors a jumped-up socialist bureaucrat.
"That sort off the language, the tone seems to have changed, to have got harder."
On Europe first.
"Well Er I I hear what you say, I my views on Europe are very simple."
It's impossible to overstate the economic relationship we now have with Europe.
Two th nearly two thirds of our trade goes with Europe.
"I don't mind the sort of the use of language that gives this or that impression if that's what contemporary politics demands, I'm as guilty of that as er the next man."
"But if we create a psychology in this country where to the men and women who earn the crust upon which we depend, our business community, are switched off to the significance of Europe, there's only one people who'll suffer and it is us."
And when Peter Lilley says for instance
"I am not prepared to  yeah yes, but you will not get me to to separate myself from my colleagues ."
"Half Well let me let me finish the the quote because Well there are but but but but Well alright but but Peter Lilley is saying, is suggesting in a in a speech at a party conference that half the population of continental Europe are scroungers."
I mean one wonders how that helps this kind of partnership.
That that you obviously think is so important.
Well I'm not prepared to become involved in er er discussing the speeches which I didn't hear or er which may well be out of context or anything of that sort.
I'm not prepared to do that.
"No no but John, frankly"
"Oh come on, you heard that."
You know that wasn't out of context.
It simply it simply doesn't serve a purpose for me to allow that division to open up.
I will only use my words to describe my circumstance.
"And I know that whatever the rhetoric, Mrs Thatcher used all the rhetoric, nobody took us further into Europe than Mrs Thatcher."
"All these regulations that we're now having to I'm having to with expert er help from my colleague er Neil Hamilton, having to look at and redo, do you know where they all came from?"
Most of them came from the single European act.
From the Cofield agenda.
That Mrs Thatcher
Which which Mrs Thatcher rightly committed us to and rightly whipped us through the house  And and it and it
"Right, so we're to ignore all these things that we hear at the conference."
"There is no difference between the the endless bad mouthing between local and central government, as one tries to blame the other."
And central government trying to blame the Europeans.
"The fact of the matter is, every directive that comes out of Europe, comes with the agreement of the British government."
"Absolutely denied, she'd ever done that."
"Then one day, said she described something she often used to do in childhood, habitually did."
"And she had a special name for it, I can't remember what is was now, but it was an innocuous word, like erm  erm, kneading, or something like that, something you do with your fingers."
"Erm, and  said, okay, that's what you called it in childhood, you called, say kneading, if that's what it was."
"She said, now, supposing you had to look up what you just described, you know, in a dictionary, and find a word that everybody would associate with it."
What word would you find?
"And she said, the woman thought for a minute, and suddenly she gasped when said that's masturbation, isn't it?"
"And  said, yes."
"And she said, but I've always known I did that."
"And, you see, she'd known it, but it had been entered under another word, in her mind."
As she didn't connect it with what everyone else calls masturbation.
"You know, er, that's a horrible thing that other people do."
"She had her own  term for it, and as long as it was purely associated with that term, she never connected it."
And that's quite a typical finding.
"That things remain unconscious, not because you never knew about them, but because they're never brought into the relevant connections with other things that make you conscious of the thing in the sense of seeing what's in it for Mrs  you know,reports."
"So we're not saying it's a question of conscious unconscious, or rigid demarcation where we are actually talking about subtle gradations of consciousness, from complete self conscious awareness at one end, to total loss of all memory of the thing at, at, at the other."
"And everything in the  between, and most stuff is in between, as a matter of fact."
"So I think you're right, it's a very very important, erm, and, and often in life, you can find people switch from one to the other with astonishing speeds."
"I mean, some people have kind of butterfly minds, with butterfly behaviour, and they switch from being one type of person or another type of person almost minute by minute."
You just can't keep up with them.
"I mean what does this, you know, what is, is this?"
"I mean, do  to have this astonishing capacity of switch all the time."
"You just don't know, know where you are with them."
"Well, that was interesting, it was interesting discussion, er, thanks to an excellent paper, we're, we're, we're delighted, and that was first rate."
Who did I say was next week?
Right.
"We look forward to hearing from you next week,."
"Sorry I've got to throw you out on time, but I've got another appointment at four."
"Er,, did you see him about that?"
"Erm, yes I did the only problem"
Yeah.
You don't have a
You've got to unite and get in the one  gives us strength to fight them.
Is er how large is your organization?
Nationally.
"Well I er th well I couldn't, I'm not in a position to give the, the total  because the national, the national treasurer would be able to  you see?"
"And as I said, Mrs Mary  she's the national treasurer and has been for over thirty years."
"That woman's now approaching eighty three, eighty four years of age and she's still national treasurer, so it gives you a sort of sample of the, the kind of people they have at the top, who are really  their heart and soul in it."
"pensioner themselves who would sit down and think, now take for instance assuming that I wouldn't be a member of that just so surely a, a senior citizens' club."
"Now you go into a seniors  citizens' club, you enter your name and you get registered in the register, you get your cup of tea and then you get social activity."
"I remember thinking si sit down and say and where do we get this money pay for this tea, and this money pay for the registration."
Where do you get it from?
"A voice says it's solely from my pension,quite able and get enough to give to join the association at less than a penny a week."
Do you find you get a lot of erm resonance from old age pensioners when you ask them to join.
Are a lot of them er quite prepared to fight to get their erm
Oh the the members
"the members who are members of the branches are prepared to fight, but it's not them I'm er I'm  the other people who are er they're gaining from our fight, they're gaining from our fight."
"where we've tried, we've tried to keep a reasonable pension for them."
"But they're not fighting because they've nobody no, national officials to fight for them."
"We, we have the only national organization to f er that goes on to fight for  goes, goes to parliament and fights for them."
Have you had any erm any sort of successes in your campaigns that you've run?
Oh yes oh  well er er  is just across in fact is across the border.
Everyone got free passes over there.
Has that just been in re-instituted lately?
"Yeah, oh aye."
By just .
"It's only within the last couple of year, and then oh no you cannae do a certain of the er it was actually our vice president at the  started the campaign over in Fife, and they won through."
"And there again the  supported the, both the region and their district council."
"And here we have the  calling under er an administration you know who they are and they're hanging their heads every time you speak, you speak to them."
They're ashamed of themselves but they're afraid to admit it.
"They're afraid of, ashamed of themselves and they do  to the old people."
And they're afraid to admit it.
"They've all got somet an, an evasion or a counter argument with you."
And it's general  to fail.
And this was in training as well.
But is this not something you just have to put up with if you join the Army?
It's it's part of the toughening up process .
"No I do no, that's rubbish."
I don't who said that but that's rubbish.
That i it doesn't toughen you up at all.
"It doesn't toughen you up, it just turns you into a bag of nerves basically."
Aha.
"You've got two choices, you either stay and you take it or you leave."
"If you leave, you get caught, you get put in jail."
If you leave do you feel you've lost?
I mean there is a school of thought that
Yeah.
says if you can't take how would you be able to handle the front line .
"If you leave, if you leave let's say if you get caught and sent back then you're gonna get back you know twice as much as you had for the reason for leaving."
Have you learnt anything from the experience?
"Yeah I've learnt a lot basically, I've learnt erm erm  basically what sort of organization that is and those other ones I could mention as well which run along the same sort of lines erm I've learnt to look after myself"
Has it toughened you up?
Yeah it has.
"So some people might say perhaps perversely that it th it has achieved its desired effect, it's toughened you up ."
I think that depends on the individual.
"Well David Lightbown I mean er the brigadier said that these are very very occasional examples but from these stories that these gentlemen are telling us, and who are we to disbelieve them,the they make their claims, this is a very very serious problem in the Army."
"Perhaps some sensitivity is n needed for our young recruits, perhaps a a type of counselling is needed to help them?"
Would you agree with that?
No I don't.
"Erm I go along with the brigadier on this, I don't approve of any of the things I've heard this evening, and I don't believe that that is the normal course of action in the Army."
"I've been a soldier myself, I was a soldier a long long time ago and er er training was different in my day to what it is today."
"But I also have one of the largest training regiments in my constituency, and I see that unit erm in action a couple of times a year if if no more."
Now by and large it's a tough game being a soldier.
And the difference between being tough and responding rapidly to instruction and discipline and bullying is something that er you have to denote er i in this discussion tonight .
"Right fair enough, that's er that's a very fair point but is being thrown in a bath er full of excreta, bleach and urine part of the toughening process ?"
"No it's not it's qu it's quite disgraceful and nobody would approve of that and the co th th th th the Army if they got hold of anybody on that basis, they would court martial them immediately and they'd be very severely dealt with ."
Did anyone see Panorama erm because er Panorama was was almost entirely
I've got it taped.
"devoted to the question of of of road transport and its limitations and erm er although again I mean there was no particular mention to any party other than the Government, erm it it certainly seemed to be taking a very critical view of of road transport and it does seem to be spreading now."
It doesn't seem to be er just a few sort of you know  any more.
Yeah.
Certainly keeps them going on the grounds that eventually there will you know we'll be able to say and this is what we believed this long and you know this is what has been proved to be necessary.
So it's
We can already say that I mean there there obviously there's a lot of talk now about erm  taxation towards towards resource taxes and those sorts of things which the Green Party were saying you know fifteen years ago or something.
And now everyone's talking about it and it's in one way it makes you gnash your teeth that that we're not getting the credit yet
yeah
but in another way it's gotta be given I suppose.
Mm.
One last item for any other business erm I forgot about.
There's a book that goes with names in this campaign.
Erm a policy statement like roads to the future which is what reminded me of it.
And the price has gone down it's only five pounds if
What from twenty five?
Yes  thirty thirty five.
Erm and I was going to say we will get a a boiled down version from with our materials for the campaign.
But I was going to suggest that we order a copy of the book.
Certainly.
Okay we now have seven and a half minutes on affiliation  other groups.
Personally I think we might er defer it because that
Perhaps we could start with an informal chat on the topic and work up to
Yeah can you give us sort of thirty second briefing on what we're supposed to be developing
Right well it came up when War on Want wrote to us and asked us to affiliate and we had a brief chat about it and felt that there are many groups that we could affiliate to.
War on Want almost certainly weren't at the top of the list.
Erm and then I think it was Andy actually who said that erm affiliation is something we could do with considering.
I mean  any groups at all and if so which ones.
That it would be useful for us to affiliate to.
What are the implications of affiliating with somebody  be questioned by that I don't know the answer to.
It depends sometimes he gets the information sometimes it's basically just registering your your approval with them.
"It's not a struggle, you're harnessing the elements and having fun."
Sailing upwind works the boat over the waves gently.
"Well it really looks as if you're having a lot of fun out there, John, but you are an expert."
Now I'm sure that screaming along with fifteen knot in a force six is really exciting but for a landlubber like myself it's certainly not on.
As I suspect it's not for many of the people here.
Well sailing is what you want it to be.
"For some of us it's pitting our strength against the elements, for others it's pitting our wits against other people by going racing and yet other people seek adventure by exploring new sailing areas and the beauty of a small sail boat like the Topper is that you can do all of these."
"In tidal waters like the Channel Islands, you must find out what the tides are doing."
That means looking up the tide tables to see the times of high and low water and the tidal stream  list to find the maximum rates.
In tide free waters like the Mediterranean we don't have the same problem but we still need to consult a chart to find out a suitable location for sailing.
That may be affected by the prevailing wind and we'll have to find a suitable launching site.
Well this is a beautiful boat.
"Presumably we can just go and load, rig up and away we go, can we?"
"Well, almost, in this particular bay it's fine, we know it's a public beach, we've checked on the map."
It's a different matter if you're sailing inland because most inland water is owned by somebody.
What about the er winds here?
"Well here we've got an onshore wind, that's perfect, because we know that if we get into trouble just get blown back ashore."
It's different if the wind's offshore because then it can be deceptively  close into the shore and further out bigger waves and if you get into trouble you're lost out to sea.
Right well we're all set.
Fancy a sail round here Suzanne?
"I think it sounds pretty good fun, I think we should go for it."
Right
Let's go.
Let's go.
Fun?
"doesn't actually seem to be a lot up there, are you sure we've brought everything?"
"Yes, that's the beauty of the Topper, we've got the sail in the bowels of the boot and everything else is on the roof."
"In fact when I keep my Topper at home over the winter, they just lift the whole thing up into the roof of the garage, keeps it right out of the way."
So all we've got to do now is to untie everything and go sailing.
"Now that you've learnt to sail on your own, the next step is to sail with other people."
That probably means buy a boat and joining a club.
"If you are of a competitive nature, most clubs provide the opportunity for you to start racing and there's no faster way into a pretty good technique than by sailing against more experienced people."
Well I mean I you know the let's have a discussion.
"I don't think  it's not a not a complete You can't get a headline, Tories divided over rule changes."
You know it's
"I don't know, it's an interesting"
No no I don't believe that.
I think it's perfectly reasonable that the parliamentary party should have those sort of powers.
"And I'll tell you why I think it's reasonable, Because they would only use them seriously in extreme circumstances."
"doesn't matter if I'm not going to name any names but I mean I've seen some people who it's been suggested might stand  two hoots of a flick of a finger whether someone of the sort that I've seen mentioned, stood or not."
You are Are you thinking of Mrs Theresa Gorman there ?
"I'm not going to I'm not I'm not going to be drawn into discussing the names of any particular person, I'm merely saying it would be of no consequence."
It would be a joke.
Erm anyway I don't think it's gonna happen and I don't think it should happen.
Let me make that absolutely clear.
But nor do I think that you should somehow try to cosset the position of the leader of the party.
In the extreme circumstances.
"Cos otherwise, I can tell you what the alternative is, the alternative is the men in grey suits which is a equally arbitrary process and it can as actually concentrate power in the hands of a very small number of people o sometimes perhaps unrepresentative of the parliamentary party."
Is John Major unassailable now?
Yes I think er I mean my own view is that he well er erm lead the party at the next election and he'll win it.
Er w I think there's a there's a desperately boring feature about the present political circumstances from the media's point of view.
"And the more you stand back and look at it, the clearer it is."
"Every political leader of an advanced democracy, is in deep trouble, whether it's in America, Japan, France, Germany or Britain."
They're in deep political trouble because the the electorate is simply distanced from the messages they have to put over.
For very obvious reasons.
The electorate is going through a very difficult period.
The economy has got huge problems associated with it.
People's lives are are profoundly affected.
"So when a politician comes and says, Well it's gonna get better, we've gotta try harder, this is the policy we're gonna pursue."
"They're all saying,it's not doing me any good."
And it's not until that economic climate changes that people are l are able to to relate to what the politicians say.
"There's nothing new in any of this, I remember nineteen eighty one."
"But the media can't say that, they can't interpret that because what they've got to do is sell to their readers, a story which the readers want to hear."
And so the media are constantly giving the impression that there's something that the British government should be doing.
And there is Jesus asleep.
"Well we don't perhaps quite use that sort of language, but we start saying, well where is God in all this?"
If there is a God of love why doesn't he see my situation?
"If there is a God of love, a God who cares then why doesn't he do something about it?"
Why doesn't help me?
Why doesn't make a way of escape for me?
Where is this God of love  when I'm going through this situation?
"Now that's a question that we can all come up with at times, whether we're Christians or non-Christians, we come up and we question, where is God in this situation?"
Why doesn't he do something about it?
"If he is there, if there is a God, can he not do something?"
Why can't he help me?
"As I said, life is not all plain sailing, there are troubles, there are storms  and some of them are very fierce  and some of them would cause us to, to wonder if there is an escape."
"Now that doesn't matter whether we're Christians or not Christians, that is the course of life, that happens to every one of us."
"Becoming a Christian is not the solution and the answer and the  th the grand elixir , it solves all of life's problems, it takes away all the difficulties."
"Jesus Christ never ever made that claim, in fact he said, before you follow me, count the cost."
Weigh up what it will cost you to commit your life to me.
"It's not an escape route from all your troubles and all your problems, it's not an escape route from all the difficulties and all the unpleasant things in life, it's not a pathway of ease and of, of in , of un paralleled bliss and enjoyment day after day."
The sun will not always shine on you.
"Jesus said before you follow me, count the cost."
Weigh it all up.
But don't be a fair weather man.
Don't be a fair weather follower .
"And when the difficulty gets going, gets hard you turn back, he says don't do that."
"But before you start, count the cost."
"He said that a man who's gonna build a, build something, let's put it in a modern setting, the man who's gonna, a man and woman, a couple are gonna put an extension on their house, they don't just go down and buy a few dozen bricks, er, and a bag cement and start, they work out how much it's gonna cost them first of all."
"You see, they might have enough for that first barrel load of bricks, and the first bag of cement and sand  but perhaps the money will run out shortly after that?"
"And they've got is just a, perhaps a a, a few courses of brickwork."
"They might even get half the wall up, but that's as far as their capital goes."
"He says no, he says any man wanting to build an extension on his house, he's gonna sit down and gonna count the cost of it."
He's gonna see how much it's gonna cost him in pounds and pence.
He's then gonna look at his bank account and see if he can afford it or not.
"And he'll only start the job if he can afford it, that's if he's a wise man."
Mm mm .
"Have you ever, ever looked into"
"I'm willing, I'm willing to listen to you!"
"well the , I think these people who concern themselves very much about dictating the do's and don't of fox hunting, if they were to spend a little more time about looking into the research of, how foxes actually live."
"Three hundred thousand foxes are killed annually in this country, either through hunting, which only attributes to a small two point percent, shooting, gassing, snaring, all of which happen during the hunting season as well."
"So I mean, these foxes are still widespread and abundant, they can sustain seventy percent losses, so what human intervention are you doing?"
I mean   ha   how can you say that killing fifteen thousand foxes a year is helping to control foxes?
Up there.
I hunt regularly
Mhm.
"because I breed racehorses, I also am a farmer  so I wear two hats, but I've actually seen foxes sit down we move the  hounds move in,si sit down and scratch in the middle of a field, and then they think ah!"
Right we're off!
"But, in fact from a farmer's point of view they are a su a nuisance, we have a man who co , who supposedly raises pheasants, he traps them, he also trapped my dog and this is him  ah, justified, his justification was  there were too many foxes."
Erm.
"and so therefore, we don't particularly pretend that they are"
Mm.
that hunting justifies the  the end of killing foxes  but it does preserve country life.
"We're going to have to close, alas, because it's been very interesting, and er er er a very diverse, ninety six people think animals should have a better deal, seventy seven think that the use of animals in research is justified at ti , from time to time, and well over seventy"
Except .
think that hunting should be banned.
"And, my final question to you, just out of curiosity is, are you ve , a vegetarian?"
"Button one for yes, button two for no."
"I could of said do you eat animals, but I decided that would be insensitive, to those of you who"
are vegetarians.
"So, in this, very animal loving assembly, I think er, you would agree  er, only twenty one are vegetarians and seventy nine people love animals but they also enjoy  chewing on them from time to time."
Wo would er any of you animal eaters like to say something about that position?
Yes?
"Yes, I would"
"As, as an S S P C A representative."
"and and also as a farmer, if I"
Mhm.
"might say, I'm a beef farmer, erm I enjoy my, my beef very much, my philosophy is  that erm, if we're going to use animals we're going to eat the , their time here should be as humane, they should have as humane treatment as possible, and they should be free from fear, hunger and pain, and when the time comes for them to go they should know  as little about it as possible."
Any ideas?
Okay people could well have been using savings.
Redundancy.
Right good.
It's thought that a lot of the spending money for these would have come from redundancy payments when people lost their jobs.
"And that might seem a rather odd way to actually spend some of your redundancy money, but perhaps this leads us on to another area influencing the demand, and that's to do with, if you like, psychology."
Er making yourself feel good even if it's only for a short time.
"If you can imagine someone losing their job, the depression that actually causes, perhaps both within them and with their family, the idea of being able to take them away for a holiday to forget about things might be a good thing at the end of the day."
"The other thing is that of course, going back to the competition with price, these holidays weren't that expensive."
We're not talking about vast sums of money necessarily here.
Are there any other factors which can explain  the taking of these holidays?
The rising cost of holidays in the U K.
"Er okay, it could be the rising cost of holidays in the U K."
"Possibly not so much the cost, what other factors in the list of, of determinants could come into play now?"
Weather.
"Right, climate is always a major consideration."
"Er  in nineteen seventy six for example, we had  the long hot summer as people call it."
"I think we had something like eight and a half months without rain and  there's the feeling, quite often, that when we get a good summer in this country, people assume that the next summer will be just as good."
"And so you can imagine all the people in nineteen seventy six thinking well  you know, there's definitely been a climatic change, we're gonna holiday in the U K in nineteen seventy seven."
Nineteen seventy seven's summer was a total washout and that would tend to push people perhaps more towards guaranteed sunshine in the Mediterranean.
So climate is a key factor.
Anything else?
Okay well let's look at some of the main possible reasons for this in more detail.
The reasons I'm gonna give you were supplied by a guy called Tony .
Tony  is actually a consultant.
He used to be the marketing director of Butlins and obviously these trends were important to him when he was at Butlins because Butlins was actually losing  the market.
So the reasons why.
The first thing  we can say is definitely the strength of the pound.
The pound sterling was very strong against the dollar and relatively strong against currencies like the deutschmark.
"Now bearing in mind what we were saying about exchange rates before the break, if the pound was strong that obviously implied that people wanted to buy sterling, but what goods did they want to buy off us?"
What major good were we producing or did we start producing around nineteen seventy seven?
Which brought a lot of money into the country.
"but you, you've, you build up the strength in yourself and believe that your, your in vulnerable and then to find out that you are vulnerable, it really scary"
"yeah I think that's a very good point that, that the fact that you've lost control whether its of your, your own personal safety"
yeah
"or, or your, or your property or, or the people you care for, yes"
"I was actually flashed at er in the library and what I thought of I would of done was completely different to what I actually did, erm, I thought I would of been quite calm about it, but in fact I ran out the library and I ran straight back to my flat erm, I was at that point I think about twenty one"
mm
"and I'd just finished training as a nurse and I thought I was really cool and calm and I would of reported it, but I didn't"
you didn't?
no
why was that?
I think I was about twenty one several years ago now
"oh, I see"
"well its interesting that you've remembered it, I mean do you wish you had reported it?"
"yes, yes"
yeah
and its lasted the memory of it and I do wish I had reported it or at least gone to the library staff.
there
"I am a victim support counsellor and why is it that criminals get all the help you know when they don't give help to the, the victims of crime?"
"is that your feeling that, that criminals get more help than victims?"
well they get lawyers and all the supports
"what's, what's , what's the general view on that?"
"to because we've got the Legal Aid system, but I mean my son was also a repeated robbed in his car and what shocked me was the, the police they said to me you shouldn't have a pretty car any way, he had a brand new X R three"
"you shouldn't have a pretty car, I mean that is nonsense"
"mm, yes"
"so he's got an old banger now, you know, they don't break into it."
"As a police officer, any woman who do decide to report a crime to us they are offered quite a lot of advise"
"mm, mm"
"we refer victims onto victim support groups, if its a case of rape then their passed on to the rape counsellor's and also"
"survivor's, we will be with er a victim all the way through the enquiry and if at the end of that enquiry they will also be given details of the criminal injury's compensation board."
"In your experience is there er, er a distinct failure on the part of people, I don't know whether you'd say men or women to report a lot of crime, I mean I don't, I don't know whether you can assess what proportion of crime's aren't reported?"
I think there's always a fear to come forward and bring the details of a crime out into the open
mm
discipline.
Does that yeah does th that mean that if he's say h he's taunted about his race he sh he should just turn the other cheek and have a stiff upper lip?
Yes.
I do.
"If I was on the streets of Ireland now, and I've been there many occasions and someone said to me, look at that Welsh get there, I would just have to take it."
And I do take it and I have taken it
and I just get on with my job.
But that's
It's a lot easier  It's a lot easier to say that .
"Richard, Richard if you w if you were on the streets of Belfast for example goodness only knows what they would say to you, just because you're British and they'd use the pretext that you're black to to really throw horrendous insults at you."
"Let me tell you, let me tell you one incident er in Northern Ireland."
"Erm we was on patrol, we was going somewhere, we passed er a big factory wall, on the way back er a day later, on the wall was, go home British wog."
What am I meant to do with that?
"Did you though er feel yeah go on, brigadier."
"Er I'd just like to say something actually to to put this in context because this dis discussion which suggests that there's a lot of this goes on, I don't believe that an Army that's got bullying as an endemic thing would be able carry out its role in the Gulf, in the Falklands, in Bosnia now"
That's right
"in the way it has done, and furthermore, every year there's a survey taken in this country, where we look across the country at the public service and we ask people in the community what they think of their public services."
Year after year we come out with a satisfaction rating of over eighty per cent.
"Now the community doesn't feel that we're a load of bullies, the community doesn't feel that we're not doing our job properly and I think that's very very important."
"Well  Robert  here a a barrister, I'll just get the microphone over here, you're a barrister and you've prosecuted quite a lot of, you've been in the army yourself and prosecuted a lot of cases, now h he says that er that the British public love the Army, but from what we're hearing tonight, there's a lot that's rotten to the core?"
Well well can I take issue with the brigadier on one point.
It's true to say that very few cases come to court martial.
"But it's the nature of the offence as such that if a soldier is bullied, he's unlikely if he wants to stay in the Army, to bring it to the attention of the authorities, because he know that afterwards he has then to live with the people who he's complained about."
"And if he does bring it to the attention of the authorities, the problem then arises that in many cases, and I've seen it in my experience, he will be dissuaded"
Yeah.
from taking the matter further.
That does happen.
"How, because"
"We we heard there from R Richard and Andrew, it's a hierarchical bullying as well."
"I I'm sure that's right, I'm sure that's right."
Can I just say one thing about Andrew's point about the S I B.
"In my experience the S I B when they receive these sort of complaints do investigate them very thoroughly, and I'm surprised at his experience."
"My guess it's as least long as Samuel Pepys' diary, or will be."
"And I hope that, er, you know, this, all this data will be published, and people will be able to see just what the complete data is."
"And if that's the case, then in the middle of the next century, more will be known about me, than has ever been known about any other human being."
Because I have faithfully stuck to the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis.
I have not held back anything.
It's all true and it's all right.
"Of course, my own reputation will be the first victim of this."
I will be universally despised.
"But that's okay, I mean I'm not particularly, I'm not so impressed with the human race that I, I, I think much of their opinion of me anyway."
"But erm, the great pity of course is, that Freud didn't do this."
"It's, I mean, Freud we know, did do a certain analysis."
"My guess is, he must have written an account."
"It's a great pity he didn't preserve any detail, and he looked, er, like all his other papers had been left in the library of Congress until two thousand and twenty five, and then they will all become public."
"Erm, that would have been er, really worth knowing ."
"But as I've said, it will, it will be preserved in my case."
"Erm, it's my great contribution to science, unfortunately I shall be long dead, and many of yo some of you may, I don't know how many of you will still be alive in two thousand and forty six, but if you are, you may see this day."
I won't of course.
"But it's a, it's a problem  that, that you've put your finger on, and this is why I personally think that a lot of this literature is of such a poor quality."
"And certainly this  stuff, I mean, when a person's still alive, how can you possibly know enough?"
"You see, Woodrow Wilson was dead, Bullitt had access to a lot of private material that er, perhaps there's still,I don't know whether it's ever been published."
"And of course, Bullitt had directly observed the man and interacted with him during the critical time at, at the Versailles conference."
"And the whole book is really about er the Versailles conference in a way, isn't it, and about why he behaved the way he did at the time."
"So there's a kind of critical period here, that we have got a lot of information about."
"And in a sense, the book is very one dimensional  in that it follows just this one aspect of Woodrow Wilson's character, the critical one."
"Now of course, in a, in a complete psychoanalysis, if Woodrow Wilson had been going for analysis, then all kinds of other aspects of his life and personality would have opened up."
"And you wouldn't get this concentration on one, this one kind of character defect, which er, admittedly, is a, is a problem with the book and, and can make it look as if it is a kind of character assassination."
character assassination of Wilson?
"Erm, yes, perhaps."
Mm.
"Yes, but Freud does er justify this er meaning, that this is why to form a psychological"
That's
Because of his limitations
"Eventually was put on the tramcars as a, a conductor."
Served with them as a conductor er for about approximately four years er and the experiences I had er as a conductor were many and varied er er if you do er recall er the old tramcars er the fares weren't in comparison today.
"I can remember quite vividly the old tramcars running there er day and night, with the last service leaving the outskirts of Edinburgh around about er twelve er eleven thirty and you g have about ten minutes or so to reach the depots which there were many and varied  at this particular time."
"There was depots in Tower Cross, Portobello, Leith, and many other places like that."
But while I  tramcar leaving any suburban area there was always what was known then as a worker's return.
And that worker's return was three pence.
Three pence for a worker's return.
"And it was always on that er tramcar, whichever er suburban district they were leaving, was always a packed car."
Always fully laden.
"Because the conductor always had to wait until such time as the queue was diminished quite a bit and hi his tramcar was full so that the next tramcar come along er coming along, whatever number, was  to be d the same thing happening again."
So the suburban districts then were very well served with the old tramcars.
"And I believe myself today, at present day,the tramcars were coming back again, there would be, could be a way of resolving this matter of going onto different buses."
"I take, for instance, the present day just now where we have, what we term, the old aged pensioner's railcard."
"Now what is to stop, instead of an old age pensioner getting on, with their  ticket, or a thirty pound annual ticket or their quarter quarterly ticket."
"What on earth's to stop, to have a transfer ticket, which could be used on any bus at all."
"So there would b take away this anomaly of old people having to use three buses to get from one end of the town to the other, which means, in actual fact, that each bus they went on to, they paid this ten pence, which if there's three, if they do not turn it twice a week, twice a day, that's sixty pence."
"Now why can't they issue a ticket, transferable ticket  So I don't have to use three buses, all I have to do is I've got one ticket, now that ticket reserved for   particular  ."
Do you think then that the er trams provided a better service for the people than the buses?
"Well we were a better er service, they were a better ser I'm not saying that I think so, I know  they were a better service  don doesn't does n they're not quite  proof, there were  in an tramcar Edinburgh Corporation tramcars were running, they were running at a, a, every year a profit."
"Whereas at the present time, with the buses, it's all deficits."
If that is not proof I .
The one speech for the other surely.
"Was you erm in a union at this time, when you were in the"
"Yes, Transport and General Workers' Union was, yes."
"Did you find that erm there was more advantages in being in the union, when you working on the trams?"
Oh there always is advantages.
If you're a staunch union member there is advantages.
With the proviso that you keep your payments up to date.
And attend your branch meetings.
"Was there any erm disputes or anything at that time on the, on the trams?"
Oh very few and far between.
Very few and far between.
"That's what it says, it brings up the mud and the refuse."
"That comes from the se , the seabed  churning it up  but the sea is never still, it's tossing and in, as the movement there underneath, although it may appear calm on the surface, but there are times when it's not calm on the surface, it's as rough on top as it is underneath."
"Most of you won't remember the time, and I certainly don't, some of you will, you'll be familiar with the er, healing accounts, seeing pictures on, er either in magazines or on the television news, in in old news reels, of that time when Neville Chamberlain stepped out of an aeroplane, and he's just been to Germany and, and had a meeting with Hitler."
"He comes back with a little piece of paper in his hand waving it, peace in our time."
"The scrap of paper, and you know the,th the result of that, and you know the  conclusion of it all."
"The whole world in, in a matter of months is engulfed in the, in the horrors of the second world war!"
Oh it looked good on the surface  but underneath it was dark and peaceful.
And your life can be like that.
"It looks alright on the surface, you're not going through a hassle at the moment, and our memories are short, fortunately  and once we come into a calm patch  the hassles of yesterday are quickly forgotten."
We were just enjoying the calm and the peace of today.
"But underneath there are those hassles, and those, those agitations."
"And Jesus, he meant to come and bring peace."
"They say peace, it doesn't just go on the top two inches of the surface water, it goes right to the very depths of your life  and keeps ."
"One occasion Jesus said, my peace, to his disciples shortly before he left, my peace I leave with you."
"I don't give, what the world gives, I do it ."
"I don't give something I haven't got, I don't give something I've no right to give, I'm not giving you something just for  , I'm giving you my peace."
And there was never a time when  the life of Jesus is not shaping us.
"You go through all sorts of situations and circumstances  but there is a peace and an equilibrium  it wasn't just on the surface, it was right to the very depths of his being  the whole being."
"But you say, but I am a Christian, I've experienced God's peace, I've accepted Jesus Christ as my saviour."
I love the Lord!
I seek to serve him!
But there are still those raging storms that come.
"There are still those tempests that hit my life and would not be around, and would almost swamp me!"
"Well there is a difference you see, there is a difference."
"And the big difference for these disciples, was that they were not alone."
Though you're going through the storm  but Jesus is in the boat with you.
"There is the difference for the person who has put their trust in God  who has committed their life to Christ  and they will go and you and I will go through those storms, and through those tempests, and be knocked around and be, almost swamped by them  but the thing is we are not alone Jesus Christ, he is in the boat of your life with you."
"He says, I will never leave you."
I will never forsake you.
"Let me come into the book of Hebrews and those words he uses are actually, to be underlined and emphasized."
"Cos in the literary, I will never, never leave you!"
"I will never, never forsake you!"
You've done your bit for the universities.
"Oh no, I'd much rather not ."
Oh What a Lovely War is a very favourite film of mine still.
I get very emotional when I see it.
"I don't think I can still yet watch it without weeping — it's such a powerful film of a powerful time, and a terrible time really."
Yes.
I was bitterly disappointed.
"I saw it erm  I ran it — I can't remember why I was running it, oh I think I wanted to look at an actor erm, oh no, it was at a festival and I had to sit through it and I was very disappointed in it, I found it slow and rather obvious and erm a little lacking in bite."
On the other hand its subject matter I found overwhelming.
"One or two sequences worked quite well, but I hope I'm a better director now than I was then."
"Oh some marvellous performances in it, but really it was Joan Littlewood's intrinsic concept which was miraculous really, that's  and really I don't know whether the movie lost a lot as against the play — I think it lost something — the important thing was that millions of people who would never have seen it, had it remained purely as a theatre production, did see what Joan Littlewood had to say, saw her perceptions, her wit, her humanity, and therefore I think it was well worth making."
"And of course Ghandi was your big success, so far, in a sense."
"I mean you got every award going in the universe, just about, for that one."
"How do you feel about that now looking back, are you beginning to get a little bit critical of yourself."
"I hope so, yes."
"Ghandi came at the right time, you know."
"There was a  we need another feeling now, it seems to me."
I'm so sickened by the erm cynicism and scepticism and terrible jingoism that emanates to a large degree from the United States.
It seems to me that our leaders somehow or another have simply got to be persuaded that we are prepared to sacrifice a very great deal erm to secure erm a new attitude.
"That it is inconceivable that after this number of centuries man still believes that ultimately the only way in which problems are solved is by blowing the other chap's head off, which is so lunatic now."
"We've only seen what we've seen just recently in Russia,"
mhm
but I'm digressing.
"Ghandi, I think, in the early eighties epitomised, to a large degree, and attitude of concern about erm violence, and I think that in some large measure the sort of recognition that it gained, particularly in the awards and so on, had a lot to do with its subject matter as against it's actual execution, and I think that if it had been at another time, or if the subject matter hadn't been erm quite as powerful as that old genius's life was, I don't think it would have won the awards."
"I think it was a combination of  it was an okay movie, but it was also a wonderful subject, a wonderful subject."
"I was a very  good movie too, I must say."
"Those two movies had messages, very clear messages coming through."
Now how about A Chorus Line?
It was a challenge.
"I mean many people wrote disparagingly about your attempt, your nerve in taking on a gem of the New York stage and turning it into a British directed movie."
"But erm did that have a message, or was that just a fun thing for you to do?"
Oh in large measure it was just a fun thing to do.
"Mr , Mr , Mrs , Mr , Mr , and have been replaced by Mr , Mr , Mrs , Mr , Mrs ."
"Membership of the committee today is therefore Mr , Mr , Mrs , Mr , Mr , Mrs , Miss , Miss , Mr , Mrs , Mr , Mrs , Mr , Mr , Mr , Colonel , Mrs , Mrs , Mr , Mr , Mr , Mr , Mrs , Mr , Mr ."
Second item on the agenda is election of chairman could I have nominations please .
Mr
Is there a seconder for Mr ?
Are there any other nominations?
Mr  is elected chairman
"yeah, look yeah, I'm just  yeah, yeah"
"The next item is the election of vice chairman  erm, do you wish to defer this item?"
anybody not?
That is deferred.
Next item is apologies
no apologies
"Item five chairman's announcement, there are two."
"Number one is British National Corpus, members will have received a letter from the chief executive enclosing details about the British National Corpus, the B N C have sought permission to tape the Wiltshire County Council's Committee meeting, and it was suggested to them and they have agreed to tape today's proceedings."
"I hope no member objects to the recordings, but if anyone does the recording will not take place."
Is everyone agreeable to the recording of today's proceedings?
aye
Are there any against?
That is agreed.
"Second announcement is the Victoria county history exhibition, I wish to bring to members attention  bring members attention to the Victoria county history exhibition currently taking place in the old county hall foyer."
"I hope members will find time to visit this exhibition which is on today, tomorrow and Thursday."
Item six attendance of non- members of the committee.
Mr  in respect of item seventeen the environmental strategy
Thank you.
"Item seven, members allowances, cash limits."
"erm I'll like to deal with this in a if possible in a number of separate motions so that we can deal with the various bits of work that need to be done, but I'll call Mr  first"
"Thank you chair, erm, in likelihood that I, I mean you may wish to these separately as well but I'll  group wish to see, is to, a is to approve an extension of the maximum aggregate by five per cent, b officers continue to monitor expenditure reporting to group leaders monthly and c officers and group leaders look into the allowance scheme to see if any suitable alterations need to be made."
"Yes, erm, I had in mind that, is there a seconder to that?my own view is that erm, and that goes for most of the way for dealing with the problem, but I think it would be appropriate for this committee to make it clear that erm, any extension of the maximum aggregate for the current financial year will be met by an appropriate reduction or a corresponding reduction in the expenditure for ninety four ninety five, erm and I'm not certain that that's absolutely clear to the public or indeed to all members of"
Chair
as you say it is legally required
"I mean if, if, if, if the principal of the five per cent is acceptable then if you wish to qualify the  being put in  from the words you said then that is acceptable by the labour group."
and incur any additional expense
Three three farms and there's only te ten properties altogether in about two hundred yards
"But they're building some more aren't they, building another seven"
"Building some, yeah building some massive houses there"
and a Happy Eater as well
Well that's it
"Do they include that in the scheme, some of them on the rate, I won't bother with that anyway it's not our problem"
yeah
Okay anybody
"I've got one I meant to put on the main agenda and I forgot, and I wrote the agenda ."
"I've been offered the opportunity by er Bob  in training er in force  have taken this on er the tactical unit have taken it on, the chance of er one day erm assessment or appraisal training, at erm probably at Exeter for those of us that do it and erm I think that perhaps with the the way that the diverse way that our staff's spread out the proper ways of assessing people which I've I've never been shown how to do and I don't think many of us have."
"Erm I mean he it sort of went through our staff inspector wise and er Paul was sort of chatting, and he wasn't being unkind he said yes, they'll be dinosaurs because it's a long time since you've had er any training like that."
"What about civilian staff, I have to assess my staff, I haven't had no training."
"yeah, yeah"
"right, yeah"
"I also said that erm my I expressed that the fears that I expressed at this meeting last time about er the fact that Paul and I now supervise civilian staff, er which I've never been sat down and told what the civilians term of contract are and what I can or cannot say or whatever, so erm I feel it will be quite valuable, and brought it for me to see if anybody think it's worthwhile pursuing."
A one day appraisal
"Yes, it's a one day,"
"Just write it on a memo form Paul and send it round with a circulation slip, and those who feel they want to get involved put their name down, probably the quickest way of doing it."
"Right, things are on hold though with assessments aren't they at the moment, cos they"
aren't they always don't they change every ten minutes
I ain't got time to do assessments let alone a one day course.
"Yeah, that's true."
"I think that your two waiting for signature on his desk,"
"You haven't seen mine have you,"
"Well why do you want one, you've just bloody had one"
No it's Derek
"First time he's said anything nice about me, I thought I'll get in while I can"
"Derek, it won't last"
"Right, anyone else want to bring any points up"
"Took me, took me about bloody two days to do your last one"
"Stuart  is having a social event on the eleventh of March for the media and the police, I'll circulate this round with a er slip on it, erm it involves a conducted tour of the police station and some bits and bobs"
And Jesus says so  count the cost of following me.
Now Jesus wasn't saying this to stop people following him.
Not at all!
He wanted them to follow him.
But he did not want them to follow him under any false delusion.
"He didn't want them to follow him thinking that he was just a free ride, a free ticket for all their problems a and difficulties."
"As the bible says, in the world you have you will have persecution, you will have difficulties, you will have problems."
"There are the problems of life which are common to every one of us, whether they're Christian or not Christian, whether we believe in God or not, there are problems and difficulties and, and situations that are, they're the common lot of humanity."
"We all know suffering, we all know grief, we all know bereavement."
"But Jesus says, weigh up the costs, balance the account."
"And so we've said life is  it's gonna bring us problems, it's gonna bring us storms, it's tempests, and some of them are gonna be very, very fierce!"
"But you know, for the person who does not know Jesus Christ as their saviour, for the person who has never committed their life to God  listen to what God says for that person."
"He says, the wicked are like the tossing sea, and you know, as far the bible is concerned, the wicked is not necessarily the man or the woman who does terrible deeds, the wicked is not necessarily who is, who is a murderer, or a child molesterer , or a thief or or or a wife beater or something like that, the wicked is the person who rejects God, who turns their back on God, who says thank you, I can go through my life without, I don't need you, I don't even believe you exist, and even if I do believe you exist I'm gonna do things my way, I'm gonna go through life as I choose."
"And God says the wicked are like the tossing sea, for it cannot be quiet, and it's waters toss up refuse and mud."
There is no peace says my God for the wicked.
That's the word of God through Isaiah the prophet.
There is no peace for the wicked.
For the person who rejects and spurns God.
"Who, wants to go through life by themself.  , doesn't mean to say that all the kind of life is one big storm, not at all!"
"David the psalmist, he could see the wicked, and he said why do they prosper?"
"Why do I have a hard time, and there's the Godless person prospering?"
He said but David only saw the surface.
"And you know, the surface is not all i , you look out on the sea, and it looks like the proverbial mill pond, it's calm, it's  barely a ripple of water but it's not still."
"I remember many years ago, we had friends who had a fishing boat, er herring drifter, and in Fraserburgh the there's a young lad going out with them for a night's fishing  and it was a beautiful summer's night!"
"And the sea was, it was as calm as the mill pond."
I've never been as sea sick in all my life!
"Because you see that surface water,it was only surface water , because when that boat was drifting there was an awful lot of movement."
"It was, it was going from side to side."
It was going up and down.
There was a lot of movement under those first few inches of surface water.
"And that's the picture that, God through Isaiah uses."
"And this particular  it, it maybe  all nice and calm on the surface, but underneath there is a whole maelstrom of, of of agitation."
the name of the association shall be the Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Association.
"The, the association shall be non party and non sectarian , you understand my meaning by that?"
"That we advocate the immediate implementation of the Scottish Old People's Chapter, to strive to maintain and improve the standard of living of pensioners by ensuring that the pension will rise according to the cost of living or er or livings or earnings,which er whichever is the most advantageous ."
"And number, and two,to press for the provision of suitable houses for old people at rents they can afford."
"And social services as may be required to ensure the welfare of the aged, as set out in our declaration of intent."
In cooper in cooperation with bodies on all questions affecting the welfare of pensioners .
That's er br
Is it er was it a very large organization?
"Well we er it's a, it's a national organization in fact, it's, it's all over the country, all over er Scotland."
From as far up as er In er Inverness down to the er borders.
Er  branches  approximately thirty one branches in Edinburgh which I myself er er attend to.
As far as the financial side of things goes.
"And er a g a good er and er, can be er the mi the name itself, the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association is not to be mistaken from er, sometimes it's misread as the Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Association."
"Now if you use that, that g gives the people the wrong impression that you must be a pensioner before you can join it, but this is not so."
"It's, it's known as the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association."
Not the Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Association.
You can join this association any time after the age of eighteen.
Do you have a lot of er younger members?
"That's what we er we want, that's what we require, because don't forget old people er, in fact our present national treasurer, a Mrs Mary , is now serving as the national treasurer and has done for the last thirty five years."
"Still national treasurer and she's o well over eighty, she's still the national treasurer."
"Board of conference, every year for two, two days conference, and we go to different parts of the country, Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow, Stirling, you name it, we have conference in."
"It changes every year so we go to these conference and we fight on our declaration of intent, on pensions, pensions reviews, that's er reviewing a pension what we're trying to get  for the government of the day to review the pensions every six months instead of at the present every year."
"are as an instance do that, the present government er last year, in fact since it some over, it was the seventy nine, er nineteen seventy nine."
We were getting paid our pensions on the first week of Nove November.
"Now if anyone like to look at the present day and er pension book, they'll discover that since then, for the last three years, they've done the people of this country out of one week's pension every year."
"They've now, this government has actually made a, a fifty three year or a fifty four week year."
"Is it a very er lobby,"
Ooh yes yes yes.
"We're, I am up at least, anything from ten to twelve times a year up at Lothian regional council or the district council in deputations concerning, anything concerning the Old Age Pensions Associations."
And  has been imposed on old people of er Edinburgh and er .
"So the, they're, the old people have been  been done o out of a lot of money."
"This year in itself, the single person has been done out of two pound ninety pence and er after  the er older ones that's four pound odd."
"It was again Aisa Briggs who said now come on, you know, we've helped you with the movie, come and do some work for the university, and I didn't need any encouragement."
"I mean it seemed to me that the whole concept of an Arts Centre of that stature and calibre on campus was simply marvellous — not unique, but of a very remarkable concept — and I became, as you say, Chairman of the Gardener Centre through Aisa Briggs' persuasion."
A very persuasive man.
"Oh very, oh very, yes."
"And since then you've gone your own way and the Gardener Centre's gone its own way and it's, to be honest, gone down and up and down and"
mhm
it's up now — did you know that?
It's
"Well I gather it is, yes."
"The awful thing is that the movies that I've been involved with in the last erm few years have entailed my being abroad a great deal, and I   was made in New York entirely and I was there for six or seven months, and the difficulty is that when you then make the movie and you take it round the world, you're away for another three or four months and so you end up being out of the country for quite a long time, so I've been nothing like as active with the university."
I'm rather ashamed.
I'm a very absentee Pro-Chancellor I'm afraid.
"That was Aisa, too, I might say, who persuaded me into that quite strange position  for an old ham actor to be in, but erm"
"Well you may be an old ham actor, but I note you've picked up about five or six, I think, honourary degrees now."
erm have I?
"Yes, well, yes."
So somebody must think something of you.
"You very humbly describe yourself as an absent Pro-Chancellor, but you have taken a considerable interest in this university over the years, and we've been grateful for it."
How do you perceive the flavour of Sussex?
"It's unique, there's no question about that."
I don't know any university that's quite like it.
I think it's disciplines are extremely interesting.
I love them.
"The whole concept of the various courses here and schools here, I think they work marvellously and I think they're stimulating and I think, from my own point of view, admirable in this breadth of examination and erm investigation and enlightenment, which personally I think is desperately erm important in our current erm communities and that to  specialising too soon erm really can be almost counter-productive."
I think that Sussex in a way perhaps isn't quite as identifiable as it was and I think this doesn't necessarily cause by any particular circumstance or group of individuals or individual or whatever.
"I think to a large degree fashion has something to do with it — the innovatory concept of Sussex was very exciting in the Sixties, it's a bit old had not."
"I think Sussex has got to find a new, new hat, and got to express itself and demonstrate that it is in no sense relying on twenty five years of erm of erm fairly high reputation that the next twenty five years and the next twenty five years after that are just as challenging, perhaps even more so."
"Again, I repeat with this problem of unemployment and so on, and the really obscene level of unemployment in this country at the moment — absolutely shocking I think — and I think the universities have to address themselves to that problem."
Thank you for that.
I'm all in favour.
All I can say is Amen in respect of what you were saying there.
"All right, let's go and talk about films now."
"And when Mrs Thatcher, when Lady Thatcher, talks about the Thatcher inheritance, that much more sincure being that much more secure ."
I I have always been worried about the personalization of er what I believe is the great traditions in the Tory party.
"I know I've worked for Churchill, Eden, MacMillan, Hulme, Heath, Thatcher, we never had this personalization of the great traditions until very recently."
"And frankly I think it and I hope to God that John I d I know he doesn't want to see it happen to him, I hope to God it doesn't."
"Because it it's it's it's a I mean frankly it it gives the impression that this remarkable political force which has governed a democracy longer than any other political f party in history, has somehow or other created a new philosophy in the last ten years."
Mi
What have we been doing all this time?
"Michael Heseltine I'll have to stop you there, thank you very much indeed."
Thank you.
Michael Heseltine talking to me a little earlier today.
And now to the government's plan to sell off British Rail.
"Before the summer holidays, the House of Lords carried an amendment moved by Lord Peyton a former Conservative minister, which allows British rail to bid against private companies for franchises to operate services."
the transport secretary John Macgregor has been totally opposed to that because it would mean nothing changing in effect.
"B R would still run B R. However, as David Walter discovered, he may not have enough troops in the Commons to reverse that amendment."
"The Gatwick express, on the fast track to the private sector."
"today this becomes the first railway shadow franchise, its operations hived off into a separate company ready to be sold."
"These plans are running to schedule, the rest of rail privatization is not."
The problem is Lord Peyton's amendment in the Lords last Summer.
"That allowed British Railways itself to bid for franchises, something the original bill rules out."
"The government fears that it wrecks the bill, that b R with an unfair advantage over its competitors, could keep lines like this in its clutches."
But lord Peyton has many fellow travellers in the Commons.
"Since we had the debates in June, we've had the unfortunate experience er of stagecoach."
Which basically found it couldn't make a railway service run and dropped it.
"We've had the winter timetable which er proposes some quite serious cuts in services, and we've had of course, the constant rumour off fairs increases."
"So for all those reasons, I think my colleagues may be more inclined to go for a cautious approach that's enshrined in the Peyton approach, than they were back in er June."
"I think the government should slow down on all its activities at the present time and concentrate on getting the economy right, and everything else put on the back burner."
And that should apply also w with the railways.
There's no great enthusiasm in in this country for railway privatization.
The railways must be kept together say on the on the Peyton amendment and they could raise money on the private market.
"but it keeps together The idea that they're going to broke up br broken up into competing er items, worries people in my constituency and it also alarms me."
"Tories who feel rebellious about the railways, may not have to push their protest to the point of voting against the government."
"A humiliating defeat which he suffered at the hands of Lord Peyton in the house of Lords, has concentrated John Macgregor's mind."
"There will be the closures and mothballing of pits, there will be a reduction of Apex jobs under the reorganization now taking place and steps towards privatization will begin."
"Colleagues, the government's inertia in tackling the crisis in industry stems from the fact that it has convinced itself, if not the general public, that there is no problem."
This must be remedied.
I commend my report.
Thank you very much Duncan.
"Page forty, forty one, forty two, forty three, forty four, forty five, yes."
"President, congress."
"Mike , Midlands and East Coast Region."
"Duncan, two things."
First a note of caution on your report on Aerospace.
"You mentioned the Saudi deal has been announced, but so far it's only for the Tornado and not the full go ahead to ."
Excuse me.
Also there's been no announcement so far on the Hawk Trainer which involves most of the four and a half thousand at  as many more in British Aerospace and other companies.
Secondly  for your efforts in putting for the recent joint Delegates Conference on the out-sourcing and that's a company's way and not mine.
"Of the Information and Technology Department by British Aerospace,and that thanks is not used from Apex, it's also from M S S at  or acknowledged it was your efforts and not their  that brought that conference about."
This out-sourcing could put the software technology for the defence of the country into the hands of a foreign-controlled company and it could cost another two thousand British Aerospace jobs.
Thank you Duncan.
"Forty six, forty seven, yes."
"President, congress, Ron , Yorkshire and North Derbyshire, at the moment, as far as I'm aware still employed by British Coal."
"Duncan, Salary and Conditions claim I quote  due to the turmoil within the industry at the time of compiling this report, we have not as yet presented a claim ."
"Duncan, we have now gone seven months without presenting a claim, during which time our members have continued to work hard for the Corporation."
"We are doing our jobs, it is not our fault that the Board Members and the government cannot do theirs, but as usual it is always the workforce who are suffering."
"Don't let us lost a year, if we let them use turmoil in the industry as an excuse for not meeting us, we will never sit round a table with them again."
"We are going to be asking our members to pay a further ten pence a week to maintain front-line services, but they feel they are not getting any."
"Simply Duncan, when are we going to get in there and negotiate before we start losing membership for reasons other than redundancy?"
Thank you.
And forty eight.
Yes.
"President, congress, Ed , Westminster trade union and Political Staffs Branch for the London Region."
"Congress, I think it's only right to draw to your attention that in item five B USDAW that at the last USDAW Conference there was a motion passed saying that there should be recognition for the independent trade union within USDAW which is ourselves, G M B Apex."
"However since that time, there has been no recognition granted by USDAW, the main reason for which is the General Secretary, who allegedly had said that because his organization is not a profit making organization, there is no reason to have a trade union there."
Now these are the kind of people we have to deal with and I know Duncan has a problem in USDAW there's Gerry  the negotiator for the London Region.
"So the first point is if you're going to show something show it, let everybody deal with it let everybody look at it then when you've finished with that turn it off because you want the centre of attention to come back to you, presumably."
Even if you've got a series of slides I recommend that you turn it off between each one so that you know the audience don't see the things being put into position or moved about because that can be a bit distracting so er it does mean that you'd obviously need to know where the on off switch is and and this is a nice one because it's it's right there.
"Now, this this material that we use technically called acetate and the nice thing about is that you can write on with if you get acetate pens so you can freehand to produce sketches, diagrams etcetera."
"Obviously you can have photocopies or laser prints copied on to this material, but I have here some pens and a box of blank acetates which you will have the opportunity later to use if you so wish."
Now we've got a variety of colours there.
"We've got two four six eight colour, okay."
If you want to make a point if something's you want to make more emphasis than others then there is a hierarchy to these colours on this transmitted light.
Okay this is light being transmitted through these colours and up on to the screen.
So I have a list here now it isn't in the notes so you might just want to make a note of this.
The hierarchy of colours
What's the theory behind that?
It's it's the brain right brain response to colour and it's the response through the eye to the colour.
Some things have more they have more emphasis and they appear more important than others.
You'll be interested in some of these colours I I find the order of these quite interesting.
"So the hierarchy of colour, I'm going to just kneel down there I hope you can all see."
"Right at the top of the colours I have here are is purple, I often wonder whether that is the reason why royalty is asso or purple is associated with the royalty, purple robes etcetera."
I don't know interesting.
Interesting question.
"But of the colours we've got here in this list purple is the one that has the most impact, followed by blue"
"Erm, a number of issues will come through in a moment or two, but first of all can we start this morning's business by calling on the Chair of the Standing Orders Committee John , to give report number three."
John.
Thank you.
Standing Orders Committee report number three.
Settle down colleagues please.
"President, congress."
I wish to move a short report on behalf of Standing Orders Committee.
"London Region have withdrawn motion fifty two, due for debate on Wednesday afternoon."
"Northern Region have withdrawn motion eighty two, due for debate on Wednesday morning."
The Committee has accepted an emergency motion Proposed Redundancies at A B B Transport Limited to be moved by Midlands and East Coast Region as emergency motion number three.
We would ask national officers to respect a time limit allowed for their reports.
"President, congress, I move this report."
"I don't think that's a serious problem, but it nonetheless is the fact that this is now the method of measuring  of weighing atoms."
You don't hurl them through space and put them through an electric field and a magnetic field and the rest of it.
The accuracy comes from literally counting the number of atoms in a single crystal of silicone and weighing it.
"Sandy, this is the first of these courses that you've run, and I deliberately said first of these courses — do you have any plans for running future courses?"
It seems a great idea and it's a shame only to have one of them.
I think that'll depend on where the money comes from.
It always looms large.
"These courses are funded by Shell, and we're very grateful for their help."
They're quite expensive at the outset because what we've got to do is pay the lecturers to put a lot of work in on those lectures — it's not a simple thing writing this lecture for a thirteen year old  and we also pay the school teachers for coming along and helping the lecturers.
"Provided Shell were willing, we probably would go ahead next year, although the question you could ask is, having helped a group of thirty six kids in Sussex this year, shouldn't Shell, if they were going to run these master classes, help a group of kids in Westmorland next year, rather than another group down in Sussex next year."
It's very much up in the air about the continuation of these classes.
Remember this is the very first class.
"Between Christmas and New Year, sitting writing the notes for this course, I was very twitchy about how successful it would be, and now quite happy talking to the children and school teachers and listening to the hubbub of questions and pleasure as they do it, that the thing is working."
"It seems to have worked very well, and congratulations Sandy."
Thank you very much for talking to us about it.
That's all that we have time for today.
"My guest today is Sir Richard Attenbrough, or Dickie to his many friends."
"Actor, film maker, entrepreneur, he's a many of many parts, including, for example, an association for the past seventeen or eighteen years with the University of Sussex."
I think it was Oh What a Lovely War that I first remember seeing you round about the university.
Was that your first contact with us?
"Yes, it was."
What I can't actually remember is whether Lovely War preceded  my son and daughter came to Sussex.
I remember Michael.
"And I can't remember — I think Michael must have come after A Lovely War, or maybe contemporary with it, I'm not sure."
"But it was about then — you're absolutely right — about that time, about nineteen sixty nine, nineteen seventy."
"It was simply that we were shooting the picture down in Brighton on the front to a large extent and on the rubbish dump, I remember, which we turned into the fields of northern France, and we needed that terrible phrase from the First World War, cannon fodder."
"We needed young men who were dragooned into the services in the fourteen/eighteen war and erm who never came back, and we needed a lot of them."
And we provided them.
"And the university provided them, greatly goosed on, I might say, by the then Vice Chancellor Aisa Briggs, who was very excited by the project, and that's really how I came to be connected with the university."
"And not many years later than that you were involved with the Gardener Centre in one of its previous incarnations, if I could put it that way."
"Chairman of the Board, weren't you?"
Yes I was.
"Yeah, no this happens a lot."
"Brigadier, life is er hard enough in the Army when you're being toughened up for the sort of rigours you have to face on the streets of Belfast for example"
that's just inhuman.
"I couldn't agree more, that offends decency and of course there is a distinction, a complete distinction between toughness of training and in the infantry in particular it's very tough, and bullying."
"But I'd just like to just go back to pick up something that the the lawyer, the barrister said."
And that is that
Pick that up briefly then we wanna talk about James again .
Very quickly.
"Because of course we're looking at the importance of bringing this on right from the time that a man joins as a recruit, and I realize that's when they're very vulnerable indeed, they're unfit probably, they're nervous, they're not a team yet, and we've developed all sorts of things."
"For example, we now brief recruits on their rights and tell them and encourage them to actually come forward with their complaints, we very carefully brief and select our N C Os, we have open days for parents, we bring parents in so that they can feel part of the set up right from the start and  so that their sons join the army and they tell their other friends to make sure they do to."
"We've introduced Women's Royal Volunteer Service people, outside the chain of command so that young soldiers can go along and speak to them"
"And you deal yourself with new recruits and so forth as a sort of P R man, you you deal with new recruits?"
I personally don't deal with recruits but there's as you know there's a depot which er
Sure.
So what are the army saying
"and this is where it really matters and really counts, what are the army saying to new recruits who might be going into the careers' office, army careers' office tomorrow,"
Mhm.
what are they gonna be saying to those new recruits about the dangers of bullying?
They're not gonna be saying anything about the dangers of bullying in the recruiting office .
Well that's that's shocking.
From what we've heard tonight.
Well I don't think it is because you're again you're back to the line that everyone is bullying and I don't believe that everyone is bullying.
"I I don't I don't I don't have any more time, we're just gonna have to leave it on that very er worrying note, but thanks all very much for taking part."
Thank you.
Mm.
And thank you for phoning in.
"Thank you Stephen from Leicestershire, he says that he has seen people tied to posts and set on fire."
It's terrible.
"Erm anonymous, my son joined the paras five years ago and he was bullied, and another anonymous person from Rugby, my two children were in the army and though they weren't bullied they did see horrific things happening to other lads."
"Ian from Earlsbury, I spent fourteen years in the air force,bull bullying has always gone on but only when soldiers didn't conform."
"And someone who's and ex-military policeman called to say, a lot of bullying does go undetected, but i if it was left to the Royal Military Police, bullying would decrease."
And Darren from Stoke on Trent was in the forces for three years and he didn't see any bullying at all.
And this could be
Yeah.
We are getting on very well with the student green movements.
Both of which are also non-political so that's that's a good step forward.
Erm
We've been concentrating a lot maintain the links with the with the university and the St James .
Erm  a lot of our members who were students in York stay on and and become you know active  or in other parts of the country when they move on.
It's very good good erm good thing for the party and they're usually quite starved of practical campaigning ideas and so we regularly try every at least every year to go and do a tour and erm we've been giving them we we're trying to rope them in on the various activities because they're crying out for
"Poor Steve walking into the meeting at St James and there were about twenty people in the room and you said, This is the  green meeting isn't it ?"
I can't believe it there's too many people.
They're they're both by a fluke at the moment they're both very strong.
They went into a quiet period a few years ago it was very quiet erm but er yes they're they're going strong.
We have informal links or have had  er our main contact has just left.
I've been trying to liaise with the Save our Forests which is  and forestry privatization and technically I'm on the committee.
But my other commitments prevent me from turning up to their committee meetings now so erm I'm sort of stepping back on to I'm just on to their mailing list.
But the orig the whole idea behind that was really to to keep the Green Party's finger on the pulse with that.
Get people along get the information networked and also to to maintain a political presence amongst the people who are writing to to or potentially to vote for us.
Erm because the the national policy is obviously to target the green movement erm as our natural constituency.
Erm and the only way we're going to raise a profile with them is by is by making sure that whenever can we support their actions.
Anybody seen this?
Can I suggest that we wind up the meeting and er.
Yeah thanks for thanks for facilitating Andy that's great.
The  question that most of today's youngsters seem to ask is What was life like in Orkney when you were my age?
Well looking back on it now it seems almost a life time away but it's amazing just how well you can remember those far off days.
I don't think that I shall every forget the day when sugar came off the ration and at last we could make toffee.
Prior to that the only way that you could get sweets was if you had the necessary ration coupons.
"And to this day I shall never be able to understand why so many of my generation, by the time they were in their teens, had a mouthful of dentures because it was not due to eating sweets."
And despite the wartime rationing the general health of the country by the end of World War two had never been better.
However the one dark shadow on our lives in those days was the alarming growth of the number of people with tuberculosis which affected the lungs.
The hospitals were crammed full of the flower of Orkney's youth and many coughed and spluttered their way to an early death.
"However, the arrival on the scene of wonder drugs developed in Britain and America at long last conquered this disease which for decades had struck down young and old."
Theresa Smith.
What will be different this time next year?
"Well erm if I'm crystal ball gazing, I would hope that all the women in this country, whatever their colour and whatever their class, would have access to first-class provision for their young children, so that if they wished to work they could actually work in jobs that paid them enough and gave them job satisfaction."
Currently that's true for very few women.
"I would hope  that's a hope  I would hope that enough women who wanted to could actually be in parliament if that's what they wanted, could be runners, could be models."
I would hope that this government would actually be recognising those sorts of aspirations.
Your question about why aren't women angry — maybe people don't express anger until they can see that there is some point in being angry and that being angry actually helps you to change things.
Maybe that's what I would say by this time next year.
Maybe we ought to hope that more people will be angry in ways that actually mean that we can change things.
Do you believe that women feel more empowered or less empowered now than they did last year?
I think that's a very difficult question.
"erm the women that I talk to in groups up and down this county, I think some are angrier than they were, some are  feel more empowered erm if they have  if they've had these sorts of experiences that I was talking about earlier."
"Talking in Leicester this week and last week to groups of black women, some black women are saying I have never thought before about being able to talk about what I am and making up my own mind."
"I think when I meet — and maybe would count them not in hundreds, but in tens — when I meet women who make those sorts of comments and say this time last year I would not have said that, then those sorts of things encourage me very much."
"Ann Mobbs, which way do you think the pendulum's swinging."
"Next year, what do you think will have changed; not what you hope will have changed, but what do you see as practical?"
I don't think there's going to be any  dramatic changes at all really.
I don't think life is like that.
"I mean unless we had erm a change of government, say, and we had a women's ministry where someone was putting a lot of thought into the role of women in our society, and what one could do to improve the position for women, but we haven't got a government that's thinking in those kinds of ways."
Mhm.
And Brenda Thornton.
"erm I, I agree with Ann, not about the government, but I agree that I don't think anything very obvious will have changed in a year erm but I don't think it depends on the government."
Just four years ago I was working in China and I celebrated International Women's Day in China.
In China they have written into the constitution the equality of women in opportunity and everything else.
"So, very exciting, erm and there celebrating there will be the women representing all sorts of different bodies; there were only two men there — why were there only two men?"
Because the two men were the chairmen and all the women had all the lower positions .
"Now, no, erm if there isn't a ministry for women, and if there isn't a government change I don't think that's a bad thing."
"And Barbara Bryan, next year what will be on the cards?"
"I think much the same as is on the cards this year, that women are angry, in my view, erm women are proud of what they're doing."
"Some women, and hopefully more women, will turn that into political action — whether that's demanding a playgroup for  or whether it's demanding that their political leaders were mainly male, pay more attention to women."
They have to keep fighting.
"Well, many thanks indeed for fighting for the last hour on this programme."
"Women used seventy five percent effective tags and twenty five percent modal tags, so in general their tags were to show concern rather than to actual seek agreement, so it wasn't showing a lack of power according to this study."
Whereas the men had sixty percent effective tags and forty percent modal which is still the same direction but to a lesser extent.
"Which shows that perhaps a misindica In this situation perhaps the men are seeking agreement rather than the women are, because the women seem to be doing it to actually show concern, rather than to seek agreement, which doesn't Turns a lot of the traditional thing about tag questions on it head."
"pointed out how tag questions  there's only certain structures you can put them in, that were going to direct it rather than proper questions say someone who's asking all proper questions,is he going to use as many tag questions anyway?"
Mhm.
and that sort of the
"that's something else which you might find, a lot of the time in er literature about interaction with children, you might find that er where parents are asking their children to do something, like if they're playing a game, you might find some You'll find that mothers and fathers talk differently to sons and daughters er so you start off with a direct ac action like Put that one there, if they're playing lego or something, straight prom Put that on there down to er Wouldn't it be a good idea to put that on there down to Could you put that on there or Let's put it on there."
"And you find more or more or less forceful ways of of giving directives, and one way of making some things perhaps a bit less forceful is to put a tag question on cos it's sort of adding a sort of pleading note on to it, to ask somebody to do it, I think."
Has anyone read anything about turn-taking in conversation?
Yes.
And how that works.
"sort of there's a model, a conversational model and if it  if it's if it's  conversation is following a model then it's It means that it's running smoothly"
Mhm.
and you erm  you know your next big  and the  mean a  signals as to whether or not it sort of the floor's being offered.
Mhm.
And you've just go to to  generally in single sex conversation it follows the model.
Quite often erm when it's men and women speaking the men will interrupt a little more erm which makes the women fall silent.
Whereas women hardly ever overlapped
Mhm okay.
So in the two things that can happen in conversation to to give it To make it stop running smoothly  are overlapping and interruption and like some of them are quite difficult to tell apart but usually it's If you're transcribing stuff it's fairly obvious.
What's Can you remember what the point in a conversation is where a speaker has a chance to to become a new speaker?
Like it's it's
T R P
transition relevance point?
Yeah that's the thing I was thinking of the T R P like you say the transition relevance point.
I mean that is like a point in the conversation where a change in turn-taking could ha potentially happen.
Now when you get to a T R P what are the three things that can happen?
I don't know if any of the li any of the stuff you read mentioned this or not.
Erm the the  somebody speaking includes erm address someone to make it really obvious who the next speaker's going to be.
Mhm.
"Or it you leave it open and one of the other speakers in the  More than One or more of the other speakers in the conversation could decide to start to talking, or no one could erm start talking  the present speaker at the moment gets another chance to carry on."
"Okay that's right, yeah."
He won't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time.
Erm it's an adventure and it gives you a sense of freedom.
"I don't want to do anything too energetic, I just like erm the sound of the water on the boat, wind in the sails"
You can be as serious about it as you want to be.
It stops you sitting on the beach and just doing nothing all summer.
and I've been out of there for three hours and loved every minute of it.
You can go from being a total novice to someone who's got a reasonably good idea by the end of one week.
"When you're on your own you will thrive in it, it's a really good feeling."
"All these people have discovered a passion for one of the most popular recreational sports, sailing, and as you can see, you can take it up at any age."
"Now sailing encompasses windsurfing, dinghy sailing and ocean cruising and if you've got millions of pounds to spend you can enter the Fastnet or the Admiral's Cup but whatever level or whatever part of sailing you want to take up, the basic techniques are best learnt in a dinghy or sail boat because it's less expensive and a lot more simple to operate and that's the purpose of this video to learn the most basic techniques as quickly as possible and to be at one with the wind."
Now since I take to water like a duck does to orange sauce I enlisted the help of Suzanne here because if there's any fooling in the water to be done I'd rather she did it and not me.
"That's alright by you, isn't it Suzanne?"
Well it seems just a little bit unfair but I'm sure I could put up with it.
"Well we're in the fabulous surroundings of Menorca and as well as being a wonderful holiday resort, it's also recognized by the Royal Yachting Association as a training centre."
"Now since I've just about learnt the difference between the sharp end and the blunt end of a boat, I've decided to go straight to the top and get some expert advice from the R Y A and who better than the R Y A's national coach John , Hi John."
Hi.
First of all what exactly is the role of the R Y A?
"Well the R Y A is Britain's National Authority for the sport of sailing, simple as that, we look after every aspect of sailing and powerboating but our particular role in training is to set the syllabi pre to the courses, to train the instructors and to make sure the standard of teaching in every centre is up to scratch."
"That beautiful white sail belongs to a Topper, doesn't it?"
Now why do the R Y A specifically recommend these sail boats?
"Well we know that a lot of beginners are put off by the complexity of larger boats and one great advantage of the Topper is that it's so quick to raise and easy to sail, so great for beginners."
The second point is that the Topper's hull is made of polypropylene which is remarkably tough and resilient.
Now that's important for sailing schools dealing with a lot of beginners.
It's also important for the first time buyer.
Right I'm convinced  such a good breed and you very kindly rigged this Topper up for me so well  you won't mind if I take it for a spin will you?
Just hang on a minute.
I know I said it's easy but it's not that easy.
Before you go out there are some important safety considerations we should talk about and the first one is personal preparation.
I think you're having me on now John.
This is the Mediterranean so why am I squeezed into this  number?
"Well in really warm weather a T-shirt and shorts may be enough but as it gets colder so you need to add layers of sweaters, trousers and top the whole thing up with a wind and waterproof spray suit but all that can make you a little clumsy, so the answer for most British sailors is a wetsuit like the ones that you and Suzanne are wearing."
Okay let me do the prog right er  Noel  that's a funny name Noel by the way isn't it?
It's erm appropriate for the time of the year nearly .
Mm It's like pulse but not.
Oh oh  er yes.
Is that how you pronounce it?
Erm it it is pronounce to
Not the Noel y yeah okay.
Anyway right so erm head teachers  in the area have been complaining their schools are not tidy not cleaned sufficiently.
Yes.
Why?
I mean why  why are our children going to school in in pig sties?
Well I think it's er down to the competitive tendering process where the County Council has had to put out the cleaning contracts for schools to tender.
There were problems a few years ago when it first started with th the initial contract which was was won by the the County's own direct service organization and now it seems we're having a repeat of of those problems.
Er with the new contracts that started in September erm basically it seems that some teachers are having to do bits of cleaning themselves to keep their their classroom up to up to scratch up to the standards they ought they ought to be.
Erm we're hearing reports that parts of schools having to to be closed or th threatened to be closed because they're not sufficiently hygienic for pupils or teachers to work in.
Oh how disgusting.
And er
That is isn't that disgusting?
It certainly is yes .
That is disgusting yes.
So all these  a lot of these firms are not up to the job why do why don't you sack them people are not up to the job why don't they get sacked?
Well there are monitoring systems which are meant to be in place a and which may be er are not are not effective enough erm.
I mean I've heard representatives for County Council th this week saying that er as far as they were concerned th the standards weren't sufficiently low yet for them t to take action.
"But basically th every time the contract comes up for renewal, what will happen for a company to attempt to win the contract it's got to cut the hours of its employees and its also got to try and c cut the costs erm by cutting pay and that's the way that's the way contracts are won in this situation and as long as that keeps happening then the situation's going to get steadily worse."
What are we going I mean we we've heard also I'm changing the subject now because that was the the sort of political answer I'd expect and er I suppose until I get somebody else come on and say he's talking absolute whatever er I mean I think it is down to the people who live and work with the school.
I think if you all make a mess you should be severely reprimanded quite frankly expect other people to come round and pick up your mess.
Well that's something that a as a teacher we're erm in my school we're constantly saying t to the pupils I mean if they ha they have a they have a certain responsibility t to tidy up after them and t to try and keep their work area tidy that's not the same as er as cleaning at the end of the day as sweeping up all all the dust and and so on.
What about this mum's army of teachers is this going to come to fruition as some point or not?
I don't I don't believe it is erm at the mo well earlier this week a report was published by the National Commission on Education which was er an independent erm Commission that was set up erm and they they've said that basically what we need to be doing is t if we're trying to raise standards is to keep the idea of having an all graduate profess profession followed up by high quality for train training for teachers once they've actually started work.
The problem there is that graduates are so terribly boring and uninteresting people basically aren't they that they find it difficult to impart their er
You would?
I would yes.
"Certainly to the extent that er Richard has experienced it, no."
"But it was a fairly common way of getting people who  perhaps wasn't up to standard or whatever, other recruits would grab them, and as he's described take them into the bathroom ,"
throw them into a bath filled with whatever they chose to erm
So it's a fairly common occurrence?
It happened certainly two or three times during my training.
In your own training you saw it?
Mhm.
Er the so-called regimental bath.
"Now there's another case here we've heard of er of racism, and I mean racism is the pretext very often for for bullying and bruta brutality and intimidation."
And er er Paul  your stepbrother er   he died while he was with his regiment.
What happened to him?
Yes my brother  er joined the Army about two years ago until he took his own life earlier on this summer.
"Erm he started his life er in Vietnam in the violence of Vietnam, and had therefore a lot of violence in his early life, which I think really stayed with him, but when he did join the Army, he was very proud to be doing so, and very proud to be wanting to be part of Britain and serving Britain in whatever way he could."
"And a I would say that actually during the early period in the Army, I think he probably gave as good as he got."
"I mean it was tough, life was tough for him and I know that he faced quite a lot of comments both of racist and other other things ."
he was Vietnamese presumably the comments were of a  racist nature ?
Yes er Yes that's right.
And and he took quite a lot of them but in the time that
Name calling?
"Oh all of that, name calling and and quite a bit more."
"But during that time when things were going well, he managed it."
"I think the thing that worries me most is that later on, he didn't manage it too well, a lot of other things were going wrong in his life, and at that point the name calling continued, and the stuff that maybe wasn't so hurtful early on seemed to become very hurtful then."
"And my main concern and complaint is that the Army, with its its emphasis on being macho, on being strong, on being okay, doesn't allow people to have their own weaknesses and in  's case, I just wish somebody somewhere in authority had spotted that he was a lad in trouble."
"But if you do have pe people will say if you do h have those weaknesses and if er there were times that he could was quite up to the joshing and the name calling, there were times when he wasn't, the very fact that there were times when he wasn't, doesn't that tell you that perhaps the Army wasn't the place for him?"
"Well I don't know about that because I don't think that anybody stays the same all the way through their life, and I don't think there's anybody in life that's strong in every circumstance."
I believe everybody at some point needs support.
"Now one of the problems is in the Army, that if you do need support, it's a sign of weakness, it's a sign of failure, it's almost impossible for you to get the kind of counselling and help that a lot of young lads need, and I think that a lot of young people in the Army today who maybe have got a lot of worries in their soul, and they don't have the courage at the moment or the possibility of getting that help because of the Army culture."
"Sergeant Major , you've been in the Army for about nigh on twenty years now, do you think that a soldier has to be able to cope with that sort of taunting and name calling when he's on the streets of Belfast for example."
"When a soldier goes to Belfast, he is abused,verbally abused"
Yeah
"on the streets, he has to react or or react in a manner that erm really when he's on there, he doesn't he doesn't react to that particular incident that's happening in front of him."
He he must be taught that and he's taught that through his training.
Mr
Thank you chairman.
If I could just briefly address three or four of the points.
Firstly Miss  's correct.
"It, it isn't being approached very vigorously at the moment, er in a general sense because of two things."
"One is, none of the departments are resourced to give this a lot of attention, and secondly we have been waiting for further guidance from the Government on the outcome, particularly from local government, in respect of agenda twenty-one."
"Now this week the Government are publishing four papers on, and I quote, The U K's Government first strategy for sustainable development."
"So Miss  's point is very appropriate to bring a report back to a future committee in the near future, er, that covers the queries that have been raised by members, and the Government's new policies or new proposals, I will take instructions from the Chief Executive on that, and will, er subject to the Chief Executive's review, also cover matters such as structure plan, and the co-ordination of this er, within, within the local authority."
"And, to try and give options for members, at different expenditure levels of how we may move forward, because it isn't a cheap process, or not if we follow the Lancashire model it isn't a cheap process, but of course we can scale our proposals down."
"So subject to me taking advice from the Chief Executive, er I feel we can do what members require."
Thank you chairman.
"May I just  I think that this has all party support, erm, the actual scheme was produced, erm,f and if the Government is a signatory to that, erm, unfortunately the signatory to it was the environmen ,environmen , environment minister Tim Yeo, who has now departed but"
"it, you know, it does have, it does have Government, Government support, so that it isn't, we're not trying to do anything which erm, the Government isn't supporting as well."
"And, er, you know, that's just, so that Mr  is aware that we're trying to do what John Major agreed at Rio."
"Okay, I er, we've got a motion, let's put it to the vote."
"It's paragraph seventeen, eighteen and the additional item added by Miss  about a report to the April meeting on what action can be taken to implement the District Auditor's recommendations, and from what we've heard I think that report will also contain reference to today's, the correct response to today's Government four papers erm, on the policy with regard to the Rio summit ."
"And I hope that, and indeed the point about the, the er, what might be added from the environmental strategy into the structured plan, which Mr  made."
"Erm, so we'll look forward to that report, er, those in favour of the recommendations please say aye."
aye.
And the against.
They're carried.
Miss .
Thank you.
"Erm, as the person who mo , moved the original motion, I would be very happy to move the recommendations, and to thank Mr , Mrs , Mr  and Mr , who are the only members here present who voted for it at the time."
"Erm, it has actually worked, erm, in that it seems that there's a very fair chance that er, in spite of the very discouraging things that were said by some of the people on my right when I moved this, erm, there is a very good chance now for a reasonable er, settlement in South Africa, which I think should erm, make everyone in this chamber very happy, and it is that, undoubtedly the case that economic pressure had a great deal to do with that."
Thank you chairman.
Miss  moved .
"You have already second, but I was going to second it, and say how very pleased I am to have the opportunity to second it."
"Those in favour, please shout it."
aye.
And the against.
That's carried.
"Thank you for saying that to us, yes, I wouldn't have actually picked it up."
"Chair, can I just ask, I mean, so it's organisations that are Oxfordshire rather than Oxford City."
Yes.
That's tended to be our line.
"They've not been tested solely on that, but it's on the question."
"Well, unless people have specific to Katherine, as I say it's presented in such a way, this report, that essentially we're asked to agree the number of permits to match the number of applications."
"I would suggest to the committee on page sixteen on our recommendations that we do make the point about Avarag and NovaSports, just in terms of consistency, and I would expect you to want to continue to do that."
So does that mean we still grant twenty-three Saturday city centre permits?
"That doesn't alter that position, Katherine?"
"No, Well, it will go down to twenty-one."
Quite.
Could I ask on page seventeen about Blue Cross?
"We have got erm some organisations, the ones I can think of is the Animal Sanctuary that we are all familiar with."
"erm I, does Blue Cross have any connection with Oxfordshire?"
"Yes, they've got a farm in Burford."
Ahh.
"Can I ask that you agree on eight one A to grant them twenty-one Saturday city centre permits, and you're clear that you've left out NovaSports and AvaRag, and you understand why?"
Graham?
"I have a great deal of sympathy with all these organisations anyway, and the tremendous number of volunteers that come out on the days."
"I'm just wondering whether in fact every Saturday that you've got, bearing in mind this is not flag days, this is in the street."
"Yes, these are street collections."
"That we really are putting a tremendous number of people on the street over the course of the year, erm that the general public are facing."
"And while I think we ought to do what we can, I think there's a line which ought to be drawn, and I do honestly wonder whether twenty-one, it was eighteen last year, and I just wonder if perhaps we should erm try and switch some of these to mid-week, so that we're not seeing it virtually every Saturday of the year."
"Okay, Betty?"
"I just wanted to say to you, firstly I declare an interest in OxRad, not pecuniary, of course, with money, however, but it is on behalf of charities, it is the only way they can generally raise some two three hundred pounds in a day, or sometimes a little more, that is a tremendous help to charities."
"And I think that erm twenty-one is nothing like too many, in fact that's not even half a year."
"It doesn't mean that in fact that erm that there are twenty, my maths are right, that does mean that there are thirty one"
Thirty-one.
"Where there is not a collection, I think that's perfectly reasonable."
"Well, of course, there's flag days as well ."
"Yes, well then we're also making provision for disaster funds coming up, emergency funds."
"Can I say that we are now organising quite tightly the business of street collections, and I think if committee are minded to reduce the number of collections that we allow, we should decide that before we come to this meeting, because I think it's very difficult in practical terms to do it at this stage, and therefore I would suggest that we do agree twenty-one, not withstanding what Graham said, we can take on board some of what he said, and maybe the month before we are asked to take this decision, we have an item on the agenda where we discuss the principle before we get down to the practicalities."
"Now you think about News at Ten, bong, you get the headlines"
yeah
"and you get the headlines, and so it prepares you it emotionally prepares you for what's coming."
"Give you headlines and then they start and they go they expand on each headline, don't they?"
"And then at the end they give you the headlines again, they summarise it."
"Absolutely, and it does because it a it what Dave says it's an emotional whole and you start off and you come back to where you started."
"It's a whole a complete, and so it it emotionally prepares with the headlines, tell them what you're gonna tell them then you tell them it and then it satisfies them by coming back to where you started."
So in other words it's about an introduction  an expansion and an end  Now as I've said tomorrow I'll fill in a bit more detail on those so if you leave some some gaps there between those three sections.
So an introduction
"Do you remember what I said about the the er structured thought pattern you've now got in front of you, let me go to mine which is all blank."
The introduction is good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my name is  I'd like to talk to you about flying and I hope to persuade you to come along on Saturday and take part in some flying.
"And I'm going to talk to you about three things about the safety of flying, about the cost aspects of flying and the enjoyment that you're going to get out of it when you take part."
"And that's my introduction, I've told you what I'm gonna tell you."
"And then expand on it, and so I go into each of these and I go to the  and I say a few words about each of these particular themes."
I won't go all through that again.
"And when I've expanded and I've told you then I then come back to my ending and I say, okay so what I've done I've told you about three aspects of flying, about the safety of it,ab about the costs involved in taking part in flying and about the enjoyment you're gonna get out of flying and I hope that I've persuaded you that you will come along  on Saturday to take part, and that's the ending."
So it's use the red obviously the title and the red's for your introduction to say what you're going to say then say it by using your greens and then say what you've said by going back to the red and coming back to your objective.
Now coming back to the objective I say it leaves you on a high note then rather than the  and that's all I'm gonna say  tell them what you're gonna tell them then tell them then tell them what you've told them.
Okay?
So that in a nutshell is is what it's about.
"So you've all got your structured thought pattern now, yeah?"
yeah
"Right, erm three minutes again so you can spot your timing now, it's under a minute on each of those red things because you've got your introduction and your ending as well, okay?"
"So three minutes, set the clock again as you did before and er one other thing I'd like you to do is as you come up is do something that athletes do huh and that is to er give an affirmation."
Now you may see athletes you know when you see the Olympics there's the the lady with er erm
javelin
"javelin, thank you, there's the lady with the javelin"
then you see or somebody you know looking at the long jump and they're muttering away to themselves.
Well there're not normally saying will you get out the way before I throw this thing or I'll stab you with it.
What they're actually doing is they're affirming to themselves they're verbalising the performance improvement or the performance they're going to give.
"Remember I asked you this morning to just  just after lunch to jot down what it was that you need to improve on just as you're setting the clock just say something like by the end of this talk I'd like you to congratulate me on having moved around a bit more having not put me hands in me pockets, whatever it might be."
Yeah so just an aff an affirmation of of what you intended.
I ventured.
"No no, he answered, this is Maoist ancestor worship, just the Tory variety."
The crisis only seems to eased because of ruthless conference management and because Tories have looked over the precipice and seen the disastrous consequences of disunity.
At least some of them saw that.
Others on the right saw the fearsome prospect of a Kenneth Clarke leadership.
Clarke himself believes the party simply couldn't bear another leadership contest coming so soon after the Thatcher dismissal.
"Tories are not much given to Freudian analysis, but one minister said, the party remained psychotic after the trauma of three years ago."
"The victor, presumably Ken Clarke, would be like a Goth or Vandal marching into the smoking ruins of Rome."
But what if John Major's party does badly in the European and council elections next year.
"This Loyalist replied, Ah well if John were blamed for that, he'd be in trouble."
"Another major enemy said, with ostentatious sadness, that he feared once the public decided a Prime Minister was not up to the job, he'd find it all but impossible to eradicate that impression."
"One insider speculated whether if party opinion remained against him, Major would like the more sporting of his cricketing heros, walk from the wicket, even before the umpire's dismissive finger went up."
"Those who know him best think, he's more of a fighter than that."
"The received wisdom is that if the leadership crisis does erupt, it'll happen this time next year."
Meanwhile prospective runners move with studied casualness into the saddling enclosure.
Clarke's the unchallenged hero of one nation Tories.
"Michael Howard, the senior right winger now, might not have as much support as the more philosophical Michael Portillo."
Two junior ministers complained to me of Portillo's ideological zeal in cabinet committee.
"When others urge caution for electoral reasons, he argues that it's not worth being in government if you can't do the things you believe in."
"The minister himself recognizes this portrait but delights in the political clout he has as the treasury man on many such committees, able to range over the whole field of policy."
"But Portillo whose Spanish name meaning the narrow gate, is very citable to a man responsible for sanctioning public spending bids, would need a department of his own before he became a serious leadership candidate."
"Oddly, if the P M risks giving him one in the next reshuffle, it might be a sign that his own confidence is returning."
Ministers and whips are worried what the mood of their MPs will be when they get back to Westminster.
"Most fears centre on whether the Maastricht rebels and populists like the Wintertons, Tony Marlowe"
"Good morning, everyone."
I think  we have nearly a full house but there may be one or two more people to come.
"Erm  taking part within the presentation this morning  ah  are Frank  who is the fr managing director of Pearsons, and James   er, who's the finance director."
Er  we're going to take questions at the end  er  the camera there is for internal use only  and at the end we'll hand out copies of the slides to anyone who wants them.
"Our profits are disappointingly small in relation to, er  er, the, er  first half of last year  er then, we had buoyant conditions and we made  more money than we ever had before."
"Recession had already promised a slow start to this year  er, but in January when worry about the Gulf actually gave way to the war itself  erm, the trading climate which was already weak  erm  worsened still further."
"Er, consumer confidence fell away and U K consumers kept more of their cash in their pockets  er, in fact, erm, they saved over two and a half billion pounds more in the first quarter of ninety one  than they had in the same  er, quarter of last year."
we're all going out for a drink with yourselves I think.
Good.
That sounds like a good idea.
"Me, I don't drink."
No don't drink  any more
Not at this moment.
starts tonight dunnit?
It was funny
I'll see if he can arrange the old erm
the guy's er filling out the form for the er mortgage and he's er  said non-smoker?
"Yeah, yeah and Lynette yeah non-smoker, you know."
When we got outside I said I couldn't very well offer him one I only had two left in the packet
"That makes quite a difference on your policy, the premium"
Yeah
if you're non-smokers.
"She laughed, she thought it was hilarious."
It's not my day really  earlier today I had to admit to being grateful to John Gummer  now I'm gonna have to be.
I know it's terrible isn't it  I never thought I'd say that.
Now I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna be grateful to Mr   it's a really bad day.
"No I am grateful to Mr  because he's finally crystallised in my mind something that's been bugging me  the longer I stay on this council  about exactly what the Tories see their role here  as  and it's now very clear to me, more than ever  and that is that if you want to be obstructive  and negative  and if you go on long enough being obstructive and negative what you can end up doing is that you'll find yourself eventually in a position going on long enough that you can make totally meaningless speeches but at least you'll get nice headlines in the paper and that seems to me the whole essence of the Tory strategy."
"When  my colleague to my right here, Roger  and myself put forward a motion at last council on this issue  ably led by  our glorious leader to my left   I would like to say  that we've set up."
"Now  what I would like to say is that we've made clear that we're with certain very clear objectives in pushing forward, in saying that certain things had to be achieved and when I read the lilac piece of paper or whatever colour we want to call it."
"I see a set of conclusions that achieve almost everything that was demanded at that time and I am grateful to everybody concerned who's actually sat down and actually really thought about what we're trying to do and everybody has made some compromise here and I shall certainly support this amendment and I shall make the compromise because the one thing in here that I thought was necessary that isn't there is the statement that there will be a head of centre and having actually worked in a project, head of sorry, head of project and having actually worked in a situation where I was a joint manager erm  in the long run I think people will see the the wisdom of of a single  head of project."
But that's up fo that's up to people experience t t t t to conclude.
"But the main there 'ere is, we haven't actually changed our position  we have actually stated clearly that we wanted to achieve something, we wanted to make sure that what was being provided in that community was the best  best thing possible within the resources available  and that things developed on  This amendment takes us that way forward and we are at least being clear to our principles rather than just being negatively obstructive."
Mr
Thanks Chair.
"I just like to start off by saying and just reminding  the council  well in particular Mr  in light of what he said that he doesn't understand what Mr  is on about, well he's never understood the issue of the merger in Highfields."
Mr  has made more publicity on this issue  than any other councillor.
I think there's no issue in his patch that he might want to talk about.
But he's made national headlines  local  and every other headlines that comes about regarding this issue of the merger.
But I think  in seconding this motion I think it's a way forward and I think it's better late than never  I think what it talks about  that we would not be here today Mr Chairman  if this would have been agreed by what was  put  by the officers two and half years ago.
"I, I"
bring up this point about the masses being  were the masses revolutionary or not
Yeah.
"and I remember doing my first, one of my first essays  erm saying that I didn't think they were and all that they were  erm  was the fact that er er of  and you said to me at the end  that's fine as far you've argued it but I think you'll change your views as you go on and I don't know if I have."
Right .
"So erm I don't whether or not I s I still don't think they were ultimately revolutionary, I think they were just erm   people who they think were exploiting them at the time  sort of erm you know in a certain situation"
Just because they weren't revolutionary doesn't mean that they didn't have the potential to become revolutionary
I know.
Sure.
Yeah.
and erm it was
"But they di didn't have the idea of revolution in themselves, they didn't have the idea of overthrowing the landlords themselves."
"But maybe cos there was no opportunity, they didn't see there to be  I mean like they didn't know any better but as soon as, I mean things are rapidly changing they're given the opportunity to erm I mean through the struggles  to actually take charge of the conditions and to gain so some material and  perhaps there was beginnings of them seeing that well  perhaps we ought to look more to this sub-culture and to erm"
Well I mean it's
change their values.
it's very  Party initiated isn't it?
The Party's giving
putting these ideas into their heads of erm  creating a society in which
But then the peasants surely should be able to choose to accept or reject what the Party is trying to  instil  in a way.
Yeah.
"But I mean it's the idea, the idea is coming, is not coming from themselves, it's coming from the Party that, that er that you can create a system without landlords."
"It has to though because if in the pa if they've had this  long-term sort of culture for all this time they need to be given ideas but essentially if their traditional values were so strong they would have rejected what the Communist Party was trying to say, but because they accepted it it meant they ha they did actually have the potential to be revolutionary."
"And  going on from that surely we argue that the May the fourth directive  came about or certainly was, was put out as this is what the peasants  three times the peasants had demanded land return  I E they were in advance of the Party, they were more radical, they, they were, in a way they were saying look this, this rent reduction is not enough  we want a much stronger programme, we actually want the land reform."
And that's what the directive says?
Yes.
Well maybe they
"but that's, that's entirely logical"
"the, the more you argue for this  economy, and the more you argue no this is, this really is how the peasant felt and he  that the peasant really erm  didn't have any ideas of changing society at that  of  the landlord system  the more I assume that  one would support this kind of rent reduction, interest rate reduction campaign which allows you to slowly build up that mobilization which is necessary."
"The,th th th the o the other thing that is  I think, I think there is something in this, is that there was, at least within some sections of the peasantry, erm er a, a kind of erm revolutionary zeal which they were building themselves and they were wanting to go beyond the Party."
"And, and that would derive from cases where landlord exploitation was particularly severe and therefore peasants were saying no  rent reduction, interest rate reduction is not enough, we want to go further than that now."
And I think there is that element there.
Mm.
"For the moment we move forward believing that we are going in a direction to which we have already been prompted, and in the confidence that the holy spirit is working among us."
Thank you.
I'm delighted Bishop you took the opportunity to so address us and it underlines our benefit in being able to have our delegates participate in our debates and discussions.
Thank you for your contribution.
I put to the assembly deliverance number twenty three  approved.
Deliverance number twenty four  thank you.
three three five.
"I am s one that has just been recently appointed to one of these er regional  ecumenical teams and at a meeting that was held for the three presbytery areas in the sort of west coast of Scotland, around the Greenoch area, erm  it was, it became apparent that all these people who are being appointed er through their, their churches are  in the main  clergy and the convenor of the local committee himself a ruling elder of the Church of Scotland expressed concern about this, that there is no real er and I would just put it to the, to the assembly, there is  there is no need for these members to be members of the clergy, in fact it would be good if presbyteries remembered when making a nomination  eh that it, er it needn't be, it could be a, a an elder or indeed er a lay person holding no particular office within the church."
"That would sustain what eh Bishop  has just referred to, the grass roots of, of this movement."
Twenty four approved then?
Thank you.
Twenty five  local involvement number twenty six  twenty seven  yes?
Reverend  eleven twenty six.
I've read number twenty seven says draw attention to the possibilities for church members to take part in overseas and exchange visits and I would simply like to do that.
"Yesterday a minister from an urban priority area  er while er welcoming the thought of a an urban priority area fund or urban and rural priority area fund, said that people were at least as important as money in many situations."
None of us can doubt the economic plight of many of the countries where our mission partners work  but the relationship of people is every bit as important and visits play a large part in that.
A small group er  from my own parish went to India two and a half years ago to visit our missionary partner.
She had visited us many times over a nu number of years and said it was our turn to visit her and we just laughed.
Us go to Darjeeling?
But eventually she persuaded us she meant it and we went and it was an invaluable experience  meeting not only our missionary partner but the people among whom she lives and  and works and has done for many years.
The warmth of the welcome from the girls in the school hostel  would have gladdened anyone's heart.
They were not well off and they didn't welcome us because we had brought gifts  they simply welcomed us because we had had the interest to go and see them and talk to them.
We enjoyed their music and shared their worship and we came back changed and enriched and I commend number twenty seven to everyone's attention.
Thank you Moderator.
Number twenty seven approved?
Thank you.
Number twenty eight  approved.
"I've got a new number, twenty nine, and you'll find that on the pale blue papers  page number sixty five  the first notice of   I put number twenty nine to the general assembly  is that approved?"
Number thirty  approved.
"Number thirty one  approved  the deliverance as a whole and as amended, approved."
Now before we  move further I'd like to take this opportunity of expressing on your behalf  our thanks to Hugh  here for the service that he's rendered our church to this point in time but particularly as the convenor of the Board of World Mission and Unity.
"Hugh you've been minister of the parish of Inverleith here in Edinburgh for the past seventeen years, and I understand you were one of the very first vice convenors of the Board when it was set up eight years ago  having already served the church on the former Interchurch Relations Committee."
"And when you do find its, its beautiful"
up there
"sharing your life with someone, you want to be with that person and you know that if any thing happens you've got that person to rely on and I think if your alone you don't have that."
"If you can find that person, yes."
Yeah well I did because my husband before were married was my bus driver on the S M T buses
he certainly found me  and from there we just went from strength to strength and erm were still have together.
"lo , yes"
"If your looking for love and your absolutely desperate there's always a thing called date line which I believe is very successful and I know at least two people who've got very happy marriages from that, so"
really?
oh yes
advertising?
"yes, advertising it seems incred incredible to me, but erm if any, if any thing"
I haven't tried that but thank you
"well no, er lets put, lets, lets, lets put that to the vote, erm have you ever advertised for love?, either through a dating agency or of course many many newspapers carry erm, what, what they called, lonely hearts columns, now its alright you can vote, I'm not going to pick on you particularly"
"because er so few, so few of you have admitted to doing it, well five people here have, dare I ask if any one would like to say whether or not it was successful, yes."
"Well yes and no, erm, every body that seemed to get involved there seemed to be some strange thing missing"
"erm, like finance for instance"
oh
"you know, they were willing to share what I had but could give nothing financially in return."
"I don't know, I'm very sceptical."
you've heard a lot of wisdom on this programme tonight
yes
I didn't advertise for a partner but I went to the single's and divorcee club and met my second husband and its magic the second time around.
"yes, any other yes"
"Hi, I haven't advertised myself but I'm aware of friends who have and the biggest problem seems to be that when they respond to the ads and then they meet the gentleman in question who's described themselves as six feet two who's blonde and extremely handsome"
"turns out to be five foot two, dark hair and really not all that good looking after all, and so the problem with the advertising is that you know how one person sees themselves and advertises themselves not always the way they actually appear so its er pitfall"
ah so the message there is erm there's short dark men out there if that's your fancy
"Is there advertising for a partner I mean is it, can't, does it come under trade description act?"
"can they be, can they be sued afterwards"
"okay well I think we'll er, we'll probably have to stop this as we've run out of time, let me, let me ask the people here one final question, are you in love right now?, button one for yes and button two for no  my goodness, sixty two people are rushing home, the other thirty eight"
are staying for a coffee good night.
"I went to my G P, having avoided her for fifteen years, having getting  the old story every time you went  well you must go on a diet!"
"I had been on diets  and to put it in context, over twenty years I've lost a hundred and twenty stone!"
Which if you break it down is only about a pound and three quarters a week
and I think a lot of people are like that.
"But, when you look at it in that context it becomes very much  erm, part of your life, and it takes an awful lot to break that habit  and there's no help."
Up there.
I think it's very easy to fall into the trap of feeling guilty.
Mm.
"Erm, I went on a diet last year, to one of these  clubs  and, within record time got to the weight I was supposed to be, calorie counting  and then I had to come off  and I found for weeks after  feelings of terrible guilt if I ate"
Mm.
a chocolate biscuit!
"I was mentally calorie counting every time, it took me ages to get back to a sort of normal life."
"Can you identify th that the point at which  worrying about food, we've all agreed we shouldn't be, but there it is we do, er  pitches you into eating disorder and er  I know ca , is is there preventive action to be taken apart from changing society completely?"
Yes?
"I think it's when you become inappropriately absorbed around the areas of food  I think, too, because I work with teenagers"
Mm.
"that early intervention  is  the best way of coping with it, and certainly it demands that parents and friends and teachers, and people concerned  are aware of any change which is sustained over a period  because by early intervention then you're probably coping with the problem rather than the eating disorder, because the problem is there before the eating disorder."
"Erm, can intervention, as you call it, be effective do you think?"
Very!
"If it's early, before the pattern's  really entrenched."
Yes?
"I think it's wrong to underestimate  erm i i it's particularly initially, how, how positively reinforced it can, it can be around you  erm, just this  the idea of losing weight  and that er  you know, people will be  wha , for whatever reasons are, either envious or they want to know how you can do it, they want to know, and particularly if it's linked with exercise then it's all very good things to do and  you know, the media's telling you and  a , everyone's telling that this healthy lifestyle that actually then goes out of control through  being so controlled  erm e e , there's a, well there's a thin line between it, being a very positive experience, and you're suddenly buying smaller jeans and erm  you know, it's just  everything is is feeding, if that's the right word, this idea that it, that that it's tremendous to be"
Mm.
"losing weight, to realising that you can't do anything about it."
I think the advice I would give any mother of an anorexic is to tell them how awful they look!
I wish I'd been told early on  what I looked like  and what I was doing to my body.
Nobody  wanted to be cruel enough to hurt me because they thought I was so vulnerable at that time  and I really wish I'd been told that I looked disgusting!
"But at another level, if we could show love, respect and acceptance for each other in the magnificent diversity that that we show as women, instead of patronising and attacking each other on the basis of our body shapes, that would be a great step forward!"
Hooray!
Yes?
"I'd like, I'd just say that I the the are professionals now that do know more about eating disorders and I do think there are clinics being set up."
"Erm, we do know quite a lot about  erm, why it is that when you diet you start to think about food all the time, and why it is that certain things happen, and I think that there's more and more information and knowledge being gathered  and yes, the  na , the desire to change has to come from the individual but perhaps, having clinics available where people can go when they're ready to change or where they can get help."
"With the playback that in fact erm as  has said it showed me what in fact I was doing right and wrong, erm I've been on television before once when I was running the London marathon but this time it was actually me and me alone in a work element and I could in fact see what I was doing and why I was doing it and understand in fact the corrections from the morning to in fact the afternoon presentation when I came back for the second one."
So the main elements for me were the thought process the cluster and the playback.
Now let's
John
John
"Erm the three things I I er got most out of yesterday were the structured thought patterns, playback and the audience contact."
The structured the structured thought patterns gave me  an actual er organisation to my talk be it only just a few words on a piece of paper it was simple yet er gave the organisation to the actual talk while you stood up in front of an audience.
er the audience contact when you were actually stood up in the front and you're there on your own just getting a little bit of feedback from the audience itself er does help and then the playback which erm I think it helped a lot to see how you faired particularly on that fir first attempt  what areas you had to concentrate on to rectify your problems.
So in summary the three main things I got out of yesterday were the structured thought patterns the playback and the audience contact.
Great thank you all very much indeed.
"So I hope you see, that this Aldershot method which several people have mentioned is is a very effective way of structuring what you do here it can also be used very simply in in a meeting just to be able to put your point across simply but effectively."
So that's another situation and as we'll talk about and I hinted at yesterday er the dreaded vote of thanks situation and the the er giving of the gold watch and er and the being a best man at a wedding or even a bride or groom at a wedding  er again is a is a way of helping this  Aldershot method is a way of helping you to to get your thoughts together and put them across effectively.
So what else are we going to do today then.
Two things I want to just touch on er fairly briefly er because of the time factor but I do want to touch on before you get into continuing with your er development for your third presentation.
Er the questions of how to handle questions and also the use of visual aids.
Let's do them the other way round let's talk first of all about the visual aids.
Why do we why do we use visual aids like the overhead projector and the flip chart why do we use the things at all?
About ninety per cent
It is it is in a way isn't it well very much so not just in a way it's very much because we have what's that saying we say a picture is paints a thousand words yeah?
If we can put something pictorially it saves probably half an hour's explanation doesn't it if you don't have that so very much er the use of the right brain getting the point across visually er gets it across er much more quickly.
So that's one one benefit of using a visual aid is to is to put a point over er much more quickly.
What others?
going back to the same point again
"You could indeed, you could indeed it it reinforces a point doesn't it, so I mean I so went back a few times with the flipchart yesterday with things that we need to re reinforce yes?"
Jeff you've a lot of experience of doing lecturing what what does it do for you as a presenter?
I've used it to erm to develop the lecture.
I let the audience draw their own thought patterns
yep
That produces something that then moves on to discussions
right
I call it  no notes at all
right
"We  absolutely no, no, you'll find we won't leave  this topic cos there's three people who actually want to come in now and I'm going to bring them in round the table."
Clifford first and then er
"Can I take you back to the er the Good Report er about Trust Law,i it the report er concludes that it should be retained as the  framework for er occupation of pension schemes."
Now  I M P A C say that they believe there should be a dedicated pensions act to replace trust law and the National Federation Post Office and B T pensioners say trust law should continue to be the basis of pension funds.
Could  tell  could each of you tell us why you take a different view?
"One way or another, I'm not quite sure what the  the state of the"
"We believe  now outdated, it was never designed to deal with the current situation the modern situation and when you are talking about"
"debts of some four hundred thousand million pounds, trust law does fall down."
"The only recompe the only resource anyone has is to go to the courts, for the courts to decide what the law is at that present moment."
"Now that's a costly business as we know to our cost, we didn't have to pay the three hundred thousand pounds, the pension fund did, but we had to risk paying those to go to court."
"Now next year something else might happen and somebody may be forced to go to court, if they cannot go to court they cannot get justice and they have to wait to see what happens."
"Now we have in the Companies Act a Table A which gives you a suggested er model, Memorandum of Association and Articles Association, why not a dedicated pensions act which says in here these are the minimum terms you must contain in your Trust Deed."
"You can better them if you wish, but you cannot go below them."
People would know exactly where they stood then and we wouldn't have to go keep going to the courts to develop the theory of Trust Law.
"So you'd leave the Trust Law in existence, so you wouldn't call cause a total legal revolution, but you would impose on that a spy  of legal requirements which if trusts wish to through Trust Law enhance, they could, but they h all have to bring their agreements up to that minimum?"
Up to that minimum yes
"Yeah, very good."
"A model, model trust deed."
Yeah.
"Yes, B T?"
page two of your submission
Yes.
paragraph
"We felt that erm Trust Law had worked effectively erm you know over the years erm w we were happy with the extra powers that the er committee were recommending and the extra precautions that the committee were recommending that we brought in, but erm we would be happy with that backup to continue with the Trust Law."
"Even in the situation that we find ourselves in with the Maxwell Pension situation, where we find that the  the erm Trust Law didn't prevent the things from happening which did happen."
Do you still take that view?
But they hadn't got the backup of erm like th the regulator  appointed.
"I'm sorry I couldn't hear everything that the Maxwell people were saying, sitting behind me,you you've lost their, their voice and you  you know, I couldn't hear what they were saying."
"But wi with the appointment of er of the regulator and the oth the other erm  recommendations that were made by the report, we think with that backup w w we are still basically happy to continue with Trust Law."
"Well I er er we I wasn't speaking about the, the evidence today, I'm speaking about evidences that have been taken in the past, where we had even trustees before the committee."
"We informed the committee that regardless to the fact that they were trustees, they were in no position to challenge Mr Maxwell  and under those conditions then they felt that the  the law should be changed  that the Trust Law wasn't sufficient  to er look after pensions, because they felt that in certain circumstances in fact gave evidence to the committee, various people gave evidence along those lines, that they were almost powerless against Mr Maxwell and that's ."
"That's why I'm surprised you, you take this"
"Tonight, and during the next two Tuesday programmes, we are going to look at cultural links and influences."
"This evening I have with me Norbert Lynton, who is Professor of History of Art at the University."
"Norbert, is British art influenced at all by what goes on in the Continent?"
"I think British artists, much more than the general public, British artists are pretty aware of what's going on on the Continent."
Influenced is more difficult to say.
I think very often the influence goes the other way.
"Now that's something we in England, in Britain I should say, are not particularly aware of, but a lot of British artists who are very well known on the Continent, that in Britain would seem, you know, too avant-garde to be known to the wider public."
"Could you give me an example, or examples?"
"Well, I could, but they'd be meaningless in a sense."
"I mean, well, by coincidence there's an exhibition at this moment at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London; upstairs there's a show of Tony Cragg."
"Now I'd not seen his work before, that's partly because I'm in Brighton and not in London and don't get up that often perhaps, but he has hardly shown in England, whereas he's very well known in Europe, using Europe for the Continent."
"He's had many one-man shows in European galleries, but this Whitechapel show is his first real sort of public display in this country."
Now this applies to many other artists.
"A man like Richard Hamilton, for instance, who's now pretty well known in this country, was much better known on the Continent of Europe and in America, in Switzerland, in Germany, in Northern Italy — Milan particularly — much better known there than he was for decades."
"Traditionally, I always feel that the influence goes the other way."
"I think of people, grand old British artists, like Turner for example, going on grand tours and coming back to Britain and going through, as it were , a period of painting where he is influenced by what he's seen and heard and experienced in Europe, and then more latterly I think of France as being, Paris as being the centre of art and British artists going and spending their period in Paris and coming back and going through an impressionist or an expressionist phase."
I don't sort of think of it as art going in the other direction.
"Well, you're suffering from, if I may put it that crudely, of a well-known British disease of a lack of self-regard in a sense."
"The British in their quiet way think of themselves as the salt of the earth, and quite rightly too, but where matters of culture are concerned they do have this tendency to think that the best things happen abroad and at best can be borrowed from abroad."
In Turner's time art was very international.
"Rome was, I suppose, the capital of the art world, but Rome was essentially an international place where many a Britisher was famous; where Flaxman, for instance, had established himself as one of the most famous artists in the world."
We hardly mention him nowadays.
"Turner did the grand tour, certainly; he learnt a lot in Italy, but he learnt equally a great deal from English artists and from Dutch artists  and in so far as he used the grand tour, and used what Rome and other countries had to offer, that's what every artist did, every European artist, not just the English."
And of course there have been many moments when English art was very important on the Continent indeed.
"An obvious example is the Pre-Raphaelites, who, whilst still being spurned in England, except that they were collected by, I don't know, Manchester businessmen, spurned in London, let's say, were enormously influential in Brussels, in Paris, and in Germany and Austria."
Can I ask you a rather difficult question?
"As an amateur person, as it were, interested in art, I get very confused about what's been happening in the past fifty to eighty years."
"I think I can more or less understand in general terms what happens up until sort of the impressionist time, maybe just post-impressionist."
After that it all gets rather confusing.
"There seem to be so many different terms — action paintings, abstract impressionisms, realisms, geometrical art, monochromes, dozens of other different terms."
Is there any real development and trend that could be explained perhaps in rather simple language to people like myself?
There's no one dominant trend at the moment I don't think.
"And then, and then did it, did it go the way someone suggested that, that, the you fell in love again, I mean Katie said"
"Yes,one , once the children had gone it was different and I think its, I'm a widow now and I think love still remains somewhere."
up there
"I think apart from loving them, you must like them"
"mm, mm"
"and that's the basis, if you like them they'll become your best friend, there's times you don't love them, but you still like them"
"mm, mm, were, were talking about what happens when people who have fallen in love get together and decide to stay together for a bit and its been suggested that marriage can put some strains on er what started off as a very heady mutual experience, if your lucky, let me ask you this, do you think marriage destroys love?, button one for yes and button two for no, does marriage destroy love?, as you understand it  mm  a few are not sure but thirty people have said yes, who said yes"
"Erm I, I said yes to er marr being married for, for love and I must admit I think, when I fell in love my head completely went some where else"
mm
"and my heart went some where else and I think erm, the, the marriage erm, the love in my marriage was definitely killed by an act which my partner did and I would fall into the crimes of passion I think because I mean to, to me he committed the deadly sin of all and that was adultery and I could never forgive him for that and I think that picks up on a lot, many issues which have been raised tonight about you have to have trust in a partnership, you have to give and take and people change and some people can accept all that but I was not willing to do so."
So you didn't go on loving him?
"No, I stopped instantly"
"Yeah, er yes"
"I think the problem is perhaps that when we love that we no , we never love the same degree, the two people don't li , love exactly the same way that in every relationship there is one who loves and one who is loved, one who kisses and one who is kissed and I think perhaps this balance if the relationship is weak, this kind of works it out that, that then they eventually split up, that one goes the other way and the can't stay together."
"I feel erm personally when I was younger that I was taught about love long before I feel in love sort of idea you know comics, the old movies, gave us expectations about what love was all about and I felt that had a, has a big influence in how yeah, when you grow up you feel, you meet this man and"
"mm, mm"
it just all starts then were taught
And I think
about it as well
"was it a good influence, I mean do you think the magazines and the books did"
"well I don't think so, I mean its getting beyond real perspective I think sometimes."
"Right now we have, well we've already heard from Sandra who's says she's er, er, a romantic writer and there are some other writer's here Jean erm Margaret, Elizabeth are you, you are you pedalling illusions which are er completely deluding people like Sadie when she was young are you worried that your actually affecting young particularly female minds in a dangerous way?"
"Mm, no"
I asked for that didn't I?
erm
what do you think or are you satisfying a market?
yes and if you can make somebody think from your writing well that's good.
Yes dear
"Its the, the market is there because people want it and this about er, I think its just too easy to say that people are mislead by them."
"People live in the real world, their not really going to be influenced, its about as sensible as saying er a Mills and Boon novel for example tells people about love are saying M I five use from Russia with Love as a training manual its the same kind of level of"
"things, people read them because they want to enjoy them, they know that real life's different, but its fun."
"but your a writer, yes"
They started paying
"Yes, at fifty instead of sixty, they said you retire at age fifty and we will make your pension up to what you would have got at age sixty and we will also do the same with you lump sum  and so now you know, this and they did that with thirty thousand I think went in one year, it doesn't take long to get rid of one point seven billion pounds when you're doing for that er that number of people erm and"
I think the problem is that this one point seven billion was er an actuarial assessment by Watsons i it may never have been that amount of money.
"Directly  directly B T started erm saying well thirty thousand employees will go this year under B T ninety-two scheme i.e. they will go at fifty, they will draw their pension at fifty, which isn't  the trust deed and for many years Inland Revenue point blank refused to let anybody draw a pension below sixty."
"They changed that, so the money er it's a bit different than the Maxwell, the money hasn't been erm a switched over to the Cayman Islands and all over the place, it's  it's stayed in, in the  but of course we're told by the trustees and by our legal advice that nothing illegal's taken place, the money's been used to st er finance early voluntary retirement etcetera, etcetera."
"If the Trust Deed says the pension has to be paid at sixty, then the Trust Deed says it has to be paid at sixty, surely that you know, that's something you can't get rid of."
"The schemes now are paid a pension at fifty, but the only, the only snag I understand is it isn't inflation, inflation proofed until fifty-five, but people are drawing their pensions and they get their lump sums at fifty and it's enhanced to take into account the actual and expected earnings for the next three years, so er you take thirty thousand people, one point seven billion can soon erm"
Disappear.
Can soon disappear.
Clarify a point here.
I if someone's their pension at fifty
Yes.
"and they had joined British Telecom at twenty,"
Yes.
Then they will have paid some thirty years
thirty years yes.
into the pension fund
Yes.
Presumably the maximum was about forty or was forty-five
Forty-eight er yes.
"Forty eight and and presumably many of the people who are perhaps seventy drawing pensions, they may not have even paid in thirty years themselves, I mean they may be many of them may not have been around for that period of time."
"So in fact there may be a quality of treatment actually between someone retiring at fifty or fifty-five in terms of the number of years paid into the pension fund, as someone say age seventy."
Well I doubt it actually at the moment.
Pardon?
The operative word there is might.
"Yes  erm because I doubt it, erm at the moment with the fund that we're talking about the erm the close scheme, because most of these people in B T were originally erm in the Post Office, and of course when the they split erm then the erm Post Office workers went over to B T, they get a B T pension but in actual fact they paid into a pension scheme erm for many of them for forty years because they come into that age group, where so many people, you took a job when you were twenty o or or sixteen and you stayed with it for life, you didn't chop and change like people do these days and the majority of our members erm we can go down and I would say the vast majority of our members have actually worked for the Post Office or starting with the Post Office and then B T or staying with the Post Office for forty years, there's no end of them they've got in there forty years service."
"So no, I can't agree there, that there is erm unequality, they think they are being hard done by."
"also history if I might just say that when the Post Office er split from the Civil Service, the firm was in deficit for twenty years and of course Post Office management say quite clearly that they were putting in sums of eighteen per cent of the pay bill  when it was only supposed to be nine per cent of the pay bill and that's why they're entitled to the  to the surplus."
"B T say the same, that for twenty years the firm was in deficit and both managements put in much more than the Trust Deed says to keep us to keep the fund afloat."
But that
Employees paid their six per cent of their erm salary.
"Mm, yeah."
"Military stores, every musketeer had to have at least two metres of match which was a fairly thick cord, which was used to ignite his musket, and if you start thinking about how many musketeers there were around in Oxford, a whole lot of match had to be stored."
"That's quite combustible, sort of oiled cord."
"erm And there was, of course, powder had to be stored as well ."
"And as well as that, beyond the city walls, fortifications were being erected all the way round the north of Oxford, the bits that weren't covered by the river."
"That's another story, where they were, and if you're interested, downstairs there's a very good map that shows you superimposed on a modern map of Oxford where they were, but they very much affected citizens in the St Aldate's, because every citizen, and every scholar who was still in the university, between the ages of 16 and 60 had to work on the fortifications at least one day a week, or pay a shilling fine."
"And getting them to work was a constant problem and collecting the fines, and we do actually know about this."
"If you would like to look at the second sheet on your erm of the two that you've got, erm this really brings to mind , one day in St Aldate's, in the summer of 1643, when a very hard working, methodical loyal official, Edward Heath, was ordered by the King and his Council to walk around St Aldate's, and make a list of all the defaulters, all those who had failed to work on the fortifications."
"erm And there are erm it's quite difficult to read until you get used to it, but erm the title is nice and easy, could I just have a copy, erm down there?"
I don't want to deprive you.
"erm Now, if you look at the top, you see the widow Smith's house, and then it says ‘the officers would not speak with him’."
"Next to that would be a sort of double stroke in the margin, erm can you see the name Holloway erm Well, on the line below that, erm it's talking about the Earl of Newark and his servants, and then on the following line it says, ‘removed to Trinity College and son gone out of town’."
"erm Now, there's a very nice one, if you move down to the single stroke, you see there are two 2s written, and below that there's a single stroke."
"erm And if you look at the second line, and begin three words in, it says ‘the mistress,’ the mistress is abbreviated, ‘answers her man cannot work, nor can she spare him till she be paid for what her husband did for the King's soldiers’."
"You can just imagine her standing arms, you know, just telling the man where he ."
erm Perhaps you can begin to pick out where it keeps saying no Answer.
"The next two in the margin, if you go further in you'll see a ‘noe answere’."
"(It's always spelt N O E, and answer has an E.) One does have this feeling that people were getting wind of Mr Edward Heath walking down the street, and were going out the back doors of the house."
"erm Yes, now if we get to about half way down there's a plus in the margin, and the third line in the bracket below that plus, more or less on a level with a three dot, and a little bit below, it says, William, I think it's Wilkinson, a minister, curate of St Ebbe's Parish, ‘his answer that he must attend the burials and christenings’, so obviously he couldn't work on the fortifications."
"And then, if we go right down to the bottom, there's a whole lot bracketed together against the ."
"‘No answer, but that they would not pay’, they ought not to pay."
erm And one can go on picking out a great many of these people once you get used to the writing.
"It is fairly easy to read, once you begin to get ."
"Now, as well as the fortifications, I think one wants to erm very much keep in mind that the citizens of St Aldate's were constantly being asked for money."
"There were these big loans for instance, £2,500 once the city had to make to the king."
"And this was collected by the parishes, and we know that St Aldate's had to pay £280, which along with All Saints, the city church, was the highest amount from all the various parishes."
"And then there was money for maimed soldiers, for what they called visited persons, which was the plague, fire and candles for the courts of guards, that was paying for fire and candles for all the little sentinel posts round Oxford."
"If they were freemen, they had to give up their right to graze in Port Meadow, because erm the hay was to be grown there, to be promised to His Majesty."
"They had to perhaps give up their pots and pans, or they were supposed to."
"Actually, a remarkably few were collected, to provide brass for armaments."
And there were actually arms collections too.
"They were supposed to raiding the city regiments and paying for it, there was constant trouble for this, and the man who was appointed colonel by the king, Nicholas Selby, was very unpopular."
"But I think the main thing that they all had to bear to survive, was a tremendous amount of overcrowding. erm Now, we're fast running out of time, aren't we."
"I mean, how can you help someone with a  a problem like this?"
How best can you help someone with a problem like this?
"It was really, really difficult!"
"Erm, she started really by, well th well there is two of them involved at the time, but they started by reading a book on the subject  and really  just talking to me about it certainly, because I mean they really didn't understand, you know  because food to them is just food, you know it was just some meal they had to eat because they were hungry and  they couldn't understand why I had got this whole thing completely distorted."
"Erm  there was a, I mean there was a lot of friction, I mean, I mean I'm really lucky to have the strength of a friendship that I did because  you know, if, I wouldn't have got, you know where I am, sort of without it, I think."
"Aye, so you related to that more than you would rela , related to a professional, a doctor or someone"
"Erm, when I first approached"
trying to help you?
"doctors they started putting me on anti-depressants, tranquilizers, sleeping pills  erm, and you know, they were, their whole manner was just absolutely terrible!"
"I mean, I felt that, it made me worse as well, by going to them and I decided that I would never go back to them again, you know."
That's quite interesting!
"Is it a , yes there?"
"Can I just sort of say I'm I'm somebody working  on a team er, that deals with eating disorders."
"I think things have changed quite dramatically in the last few years certainly, we admit very few people and we see them mostly as an outpatient."
I think it actually depends where you go to to seek help and who your first  erm person that you go to
Mhm.
"I mean there is a, I don't know if anybody saw there was a  a programme on, it was actually B B C, erm, this week, it was about somebody who felt that she was very overweight and actually had her stomach stapled!"
"And I mean, I find that really horrendous!"
"I think your G P is maybe one of the first places to go but the trouble, I think, with people with eating problems is it's very hard to explain what the problem is."
Mhm.
"And I think that's  what a lot of problem with condemned by the G P is is they're not able to articulate the unhappiness that's coming from the eating disorder, so they're told to go away and put on a couple of pounds  and because they haven't expressed that feeling the G P can't  or isn't  thinking enough to try and and poke into it a little bit more."
So what would be better?
"I think, one of the most important things is finding a trusting friend or a member of family so that you can then try express some of the feelings so that you're in a better position  erm, to try and explain the problem."
One of the great difficulties is that many young people find it extremely difficult to admit that they have a problem.
"And in fact, even with as many professionals as one would wish it's often extremely difficult to actually engage people in treatment  erm, and the whole process of getting people into treatment or into health can be very difficult, both for the young person and for the  therapist or helper involved."
I don't want to give the impression that professionals are unhelpful at all.
"I mean Carole said earlier, it's a question of eventually making your mind up that you want to do something about it, but then  professionals are maybe there to assist."
"What you've described must be something that erm  that that families of people who are suffering from eating disorders must feel very much, that there's nothing that they can do  to, to to help."
"Families feel very rejected by professionals  erm, in my research I've found that  er, the  families of younger sufferers tend to be involved in treatment but they feel very much that they're under the microscope, that they disapprove, that they're seen as being pathological families."
"With older sufferers, erm, usually families are excluded from treatment, they're kept out, they're told that they're daughter erm must be seen on her own  and they feel very helpless and very unloved and unsupported by  by the professionals."
Mm.
"Erm, in fact, I've found that the families are no different from any other families, there's no typical anorexic family."
"of being needed, and being er allowed to care for someone"
up there
I think the mother and child love isn't always pleasant and I think that's quite worrying to some mother's if they can't love their child in the way that people expect them to.
"Sheena, can I be the odd one out and say I've been in love with one man for forty five years, I haven't heard any body saying any thing very nice about that, I would like to say its wonderful."
oh I
"Here, here"
"there, here, here they, they, a lot of them say, I don't know if you are the odd one out I mean there are"
"No I quite agree, I also agree with the lady who said that one of the important things is that you like the person, I well speaking from experience, I started out liking somebody"
"mm, mm"
"for whom that I had to decide whether I was going to marry him or give him up and decided I couldn't give him up so I married him and was extremely happy and was shattered when he died and I, I, a, it went from you know I, I never real , thought I would be as happy, could be as happy as I was"
mm
"er, but I quite agree one person er there's nothing, nothing greater."
"Yeah I'm, I'm interested that that so many of you go from love to marriage as er swiftly as the horse and carriage similarly would suggest, I mean it, every one's experience of love is, is different, every body here is, we've been talking about love between er men and women, but there's also love between women and women which we haven't talked about at all."
"Do you think society er smiles on all forms of love or do you think some kinds of love and loving are, are actually seen as being lesser than others there, there seems to be less sympathetic for er I mean, yes"
"Well you've just got to look at section twenty eight, now section twenty five, how like we are being discriminated against how  even  like"
"sorry, erm your not like getting"
"start again, start again"
"getting attacked in pubs you know like that's happened to me, being verbally assaulted in the street has happened to me because I am with my lover who is a woman, who publicly I cannot show like that love, publicly you know cos oh I'm scared of violence you know, I like my face the way it is."
who has threatened you?
"Men basically feel really erm threatened and intimidated like by women loving each other or by men loving each other, you know."
"any other views on that, I mean is that a, yes"
"Its just the very fact that erm there's no equivalent to marriage for lesbian's and gay men, it means that society is looking down on it."
do you think there should be?
yes
Not so much now I don't think.
"I, I, I feel that erm  a bit like yourself, what I object is the fact that its again we use"
the illusion of love and the actual wording of love
"mm, mm"
"conjures up images and I just object to the fact that people impose on us, degrenality, I mean I, I think lesbian's and gay men have got a right to their life style as we have and I don't think we should be actually imposing and I think that's what a lot of society and what people come out with does er more or less we don't agree with that and its wrong and its objectional"
"Its not so bad now either way, it was years ago always look down on people like that but not so much now"
"oh I can assure you I work, I work in a women's unit and I can assure you its still frowned on by lots of people."
"I was gonna say its interesting to hear you saying that its men who attack you, but again with gay men its men who attack them."
Well the three things that er were most significant for me yesterday were the cluster the thought patterns and the Aldershot method.
Erm the cluster makes you realise how you presented things to people what you can improve them having things in your hand that it it just makes you erm more nervous because you're fumbling about what makes me more nervous you're fumbling about with something trying to to do something that you don't really need to do.
Erm moving around er feet movement I didn't quite master that yesterday but it it's something that er I know that will come with time and er it'll it'll all come together.
The thought patterns like Joanne and others the the concept of putting a little circle down and one word in it and expanding that out and being able to stand around and talk erm for three minutes or ten minutes or whatever for a significant amount of time erm that that was also a revelation to me.
And along along with that erm the Aldershot method erm an introduction and expansion and an ending all on the same subject erm makes it a nice concise er little parcel erm for you to talk through.
"So the end the three things for me yesterday cluster, thought patterns and the Aldershot method"
Thank you very much
"Well for me exactly the same as Bob sorry Robert, the Aldershot method plus er the thought processes."
The Aldershot method because er it it sort of explained to me the most effect way of getting across whatever you want to say so that made me a feel a bit happier about that.
It also made me think that perhaps I had more control over the whole presentation generally which is my biggest concern so get up there and just do some  and therefore it's going to go on to the confidence side of it.
The cluster erm I was always very aware of this bit so it made me you know aware that there are things you can do and watching everybody just seemed just the answer inside you.
It didn't look er odd it looked okay so that would make me a bit more confident I think a bit less self conscious.
But the most important thing I thought was the thought process I mean just just saying this while you were just going on I just jotted down in the same way you could come off with three ideas that  around and I felt that was that was ideal.
It keeps the your your presentation  and it stops those pregnant er pauses you know suddenly you realise Christ I've forgotten  lost the thing.
"So for me Aldershot method, cluster but most important was the thought patterns."
Gordon
Er yes there the three things I got out of erm yesterday's course was the thought patterns the Aldershot method and the delivery.
"The thought patterns allow me to erm put down what I wanted to talk about, expand on it and at the same time break it down into areas and on the other and spend some time on each area."
The Aldershot method erm because it showing you how you broke that subject down allows you to erm introduce it expand on it and summarise at the end.
Er the delivery part it was more the cluster but the overall delivery allowed me to prepare how I was going to be standing er how to get the audience in contact with me the eye the eye contact and also the way I spoke.
So to summarise the  thought patterns the Aldershot method  Jeff
The three things that came out of yesterday for meself were the the Aldershot method the delivery .
The Aldershot principally because it gave a structure to what I had to say at least went up there fairly confident of what I had .
The delivery because it gave me what I had to think about when I was up there  language body language  and then the playbacks  I could look at the two things that Mike just highlighted as one and two.
The Aldershot method the structure of what I said and the way the delivery had come across.
The feedback gave me a review of those questions.
So out of yesterday it was how to put the structure together as  the delivery of how it came across and what the audience's reaction was to it.
Morning ladies and gentlemen
carry on Mike and then  to John
good morning ladies and gentlemen the three main items I got out of yesterday was the er structured thought patterns the cluster and the playback
the structured thought patterns I found that the most important because when I was up at the table on the second presentation I was able to have my thoughts relating to the layout  already and with in fact just the single element of the subject shown on my paper I could immediately focus on that and in fact give the details of that right the way through.
On the cluster erm not having in fact had any erm work on this type of thing before I didn't realise that holding a paper could close you down and in fact without moving my feet I wasn't getting movement I was just static and with no use of the hands you were  to express yourself sufficiently.
If you go there afterwards and what they say.
Er right okay then.
"Right erm these notes are sort of based on a lecture that I went to when I was in sixth form erm and the theme for it is, Men And Women, Do We Speak The Same Language?"
Erm so first of all sounds and pronunciation.
"Er men tend to have a lower pitch on the whole, erm th they're louder and the's due to their physiological differences, erm Jacqueline  once said that, Men try to talk bigger than they are whereas women talk as though they're smaller."
Erm it's been shown that women strive for a  pronunciations and and sort of go more towards the .
"Erm some women tend to have more pitch variation and they're more emotional so they're more likely to use encouraging tones er which can sometimes be seen to be slightly patronizing, whereas boys think it's soppy to be  emotional or  expressive way, so that if you're in school and you're asking people to read out in class, erm a girl would be more likely to be more expressive, whereas a boy would be a little bit more monotonous, and just sort of read it out and not put any emotion into it."
"And go to words of meaning, erm and the descriptions of colours where men are more likely to say purple whereas women would describe it as aubergine or plum and go into more detail about the shading than the colour."
"Then erm names, babies I if a baby's christened Timothy er it gets called Timmy or Nicholas gets called Nicky, which sort of ties in with the biscuits being called bickie and horsie and doggie and all this sort of ee things that you say to babies."
"But as soon as the n the kid Nicky hits teenage years then he wants to be called Nick, whereas if the girl's been christened Nicola and she's called Nicky through her childhood, when she hits teens she's still called Nicky."
So girls don't seem to mind the ee thing whereas the the boys do.
"Erm also if you look at entertainment, like James Saville calls himself Jimmy Saville, Terence Wogan is Terry Wogan, so but then you look at people like Charlie Chaplin, when he was doing his comedian role he was c he called himself Charlie Chaplin, and when he's directing films he called himself Charles Chaplin, so maybe it's all like a bit  of a serious thing."
So maybe that implies that when  do  the kids have got that ee ending.
"Then we go to the taboo language and if you talk about when you go to the toilet, if you Everybody excuses themselves to leave and that's both men and women and then somehow you have to say where you're going, so the women are more likely to use the polite sort of euphemistic kinds of things like they'd say toilet or loo, whereas the men are more likely to say bog."
And they actually say what they do when they get there.
"Oh, younger men are more likely to use coarser tones and be more explicit erm although they wouldn't use those sort terms to their father or elder men, and the women are more likely to use euphemisms like Spend a penny, Powder your nose and things like that."
And then we go to grammar.
Women tend to use more standard forms er and men are more likely to use regional dialect forms.
"So that shows women are more status conscious and men are more Maybe could be more concerned with their macho image, and they associate the non-standard with macho image."
"Erm there is a study where they looked into erm men in the workforce and women and in the workforce and er if men worked together in factories it sort of reinforces their speech patterns, their workmates are reinforcing their speech pattern so they're more likely to use non- standard."
"And then there was a study into and area of Belfast where most of the men were unemployed and it was the women who were going out to work in the factory and it was found to be the other way round, and the women spoke more of a non-standard than the men did  when the men were staying at home."
It was the women going out to work.
Then we get use and interaction.
"Women tend to use more  questions which sort of softens the effect of what they're saying, so they'll say things like, There we go and the men say things like, Let's go."
"Erm women are more likely to use the words such as may, might, possibly, perhaps which seem to be a little less forceful."
"In turn-taking men have be shown to interrupt women more than they interrupt other men, er and then there's the use of mm."
"Erm it's been shown that men seem to er connect the word mm with I agree, that's what they use it to mean whereas the women tend to use mm as I understand."
Erm so where do these differences come from?
"They come from the way  socializes children er during the early school years, boys and girls tend to have different activity, the boys in the groups Are in groups outdoors and the girls and in tos and fros and they're sharing their little secrets and being loyal to each other and whispering away in little corners."
So that women aren't taken seriously.
So do we speak the same language?
"Yes, but with differences and we don't always  the same message."
Er what is necessary for me to also convey to you is that the theme that I was given today was one of forgiveness .
Er  the only difference between the situation now and the situation when I was a teacher is that there are a lot of Christians in this room per square metre than there would have been in a school where I taught  and that  applies to where I work now er because er  the number of Christians who are around me in in the workplace are actually even smaller I guess  and er that may be something that er you will need to recognise is an unusual feature of your school life and that er as you leave school so you're going to go into very different environments where people behave very differently.
When a colleague discovered that I was coming here to do this er she saw it as laughable  and she also saw it as something that I would prefer to keep quiet from my colleagues and tried a bit of moral blackmail on me as well to say I'm going to tell them about that if you don't them about this sort of thing.
Er  to contact when you're talking about forgiveness er well that was just the end you know  that point.
Life isn't always like that for me and there are times when I do have
Christians around me when I am  on Sundays and on Sundays I'm often involved in my own church with er preaching appointments and for me when I'm preaching the  the good news that is the heart of  is actually one of forgiveness.
"I know from my own life of faith that my thoughts, my words and my  often fail to match up to the Christian ideal  there is much that I do that hurts other people and there is much that I do that does not reflect Christ."
The Christians good news is that guilt and shame that I have of such behaviour is actually taken away from me.
"I don't deserve that forgiveness, but the God who loves me who has actually died on the cross for me has actually taken all of that away and more than that has made me new, has actually raised me as a new life with him."
I've been lifted out of my selfishness.
"Now you think that because I am  I am forgiven and I preach forgiveness that I would be pretty good as  up people, but that's part of my human failure  and I must admit that I've given plenty of opportunity to practice at home and at work er the opportunity to forgive, but it doesn't come easily  and certainly it isn't a strong feature of the non-Christian world in which I work and which you will be working soon."
Forgiveness is not a strong feature of life.
"You've been brought up in a television age and  you've been particularly been brought up in an age of card cartoons and soap operas and in all of those you would er expect to see good being oppressed that's part of the plot in every cartoon there is a plot in every soap opera, that the good  the good people actually end up in difficult situations  and the way that results in the cartoons and in the soap operas is usually find revenge or punishment."
Let me give an example Dirty Den got his comeuppance in Eastenders  erm the Road Runner always er wants er always manages to get that crafty bull er to the follies of his own tracks.
It's all to do with revenge and punishment rather than with forgiveness.
"The only trouble with storylines like that is that life is for more complicated er we may want to see justice be done, we may want to see virtue being rewarded, we may want to see er all of those things happen, but when we make mistakes  when we make mistakes, when we are not virtuous, we actually end up not being too keen, but justice should be applied straight away."
"We actually want mercy, we want forgiveness, we want leniency."
"I've got on the tape here a song which is by Manny Fryer he used to sing in Steel Ice Band er now I know that that's sort of very old hat, I'm sorry, but I sort of live in the past and er this er I I believe also that  these days so that er you know I can sort of justify that  but this is a song that er she has sung which er reminds us that each of us has the potential to commit the crime  I'll try not to play it fast forward, let's see how we go."
.consider today and it's two things.
"I'm inviting you to consider how far a Christian should go in forgiving and to how far a Christian organisation like this school should go, in showing forgiveness  er I just want to kick you off with one or two points on each of those."
That  I  On the first point about us and our own showing of forgiveness.
"Jesus himself has  things to say, for example his disciples asked him how many times should I forgive somebody else."
"I was actually looking at you before I came in, but just come out here for a second  There are two ways I can hurt you."
Actually there's probably  probably three ways that I can hurt you.
One way I can hurt you is physically all right?
And another way I can hurt you is er mentally  and the third way I can hurt you is by combining the two together.
All right?
But I think that basically there's either two or three ways that each one of us has the ability to hurt somebody else.
You've been doing it to each other all the time  but if I were to hurt you or if anybody else here were to hurt you physically or mentally  how many times would you forgive them?
"If they did it once, would you forgive them?"
Yes.
"Yeah, probably."
"It's not  a federated system, it actually, positively talks about  moving  forward  as Professor  states it  in the economical situation the council is in."
It talks about one budget covering for the two centres  and it also talks about two heads of centres which is more practicable  and more rational than any other s situation that would have been if the merger decision would have stayed.
"There has never been an argument  put  by anyone  to convince myself or people who have protested against the merger, a rational argument has never been put against what people have said that the merger is a rational way forward."
I think it would have been a disaster  and a recipe for disaster because practically if you know what the situation is  in the Moat Centre  and the Highfields youth and community centre then people  would have never resisted to that change.
"I'm not saying that  people would have never changed their ideas but if it would have been done in the manner that it would have been done in in the first place  and if people would have been told about their future lives  and if people had been, would've accepted what was going on  in light of all the decisions that have been taken  previously regarding  the merger issue."
"I think these proposals not only  are a way forward  but also  in light of what is actually happening in the area of  Highfields with er the high numbers of unemployment, with the high rate of people underachieving in education  I think  for the last two and a half years there has been  no clear guidelines or structure that has  systematically brought about any results in the two centres to move forward where people have lost out by this issue being  bureaucratic and a political football that's being kicked about and I think it's about time  where we now have cross party consensus  that we move positively forward and work towards these proposals."
"I mean in  so I I come here today  with a petition that I presented  that also  talks about  proposing to  abolish the merger, I mean this is a move  just one step away from that  but I still feel in what was proposed at the last full council meeting and I would express my views to the officers  that in light of what has been  suggested  today is actually implemented  to the  wording as it stands because the joint working party that had been er  written up previously  never did meet  although if I can inform it was only the officers who actually met up and I hope that in light of all the  working group and the two heads of centres covering for each other would be  implicitly applied."
In light of er
Near time
"all the consultation  that also talks about in this paper is  met with the two centres, the management committee of Highfields youth and commune centre and also the users of the Moat Centre  and I think in light of everything that's gone on  I think it's substantially a  success  to stand here and say that we have at least achieved some result  and I I formally would welcome the Libs supporting this this afternoon and I'm grateful for the  turn that the Libs have made and in light of er  what  er Mr  the involvement Mr  has put in."
Time  time  time now please.
Thank you.
Thanks Chair.
Mr  do you wish the right of reply.
No it's Mr
Mr
Not really Chair .
I'm mean we've discussed it often but I I would be grateful if we could
It's Mr  I'd hate to stop Mr  in full cry
Okay then chairman I I would er  recommend that we support the amendment moved by Mr .
"Right, those in favour."
Welcome back.
"Right, this week an Army lieutenant was jailed for fifteen months after a court martial heard him plead guilty to seven charges relating to bullying and humiliating new recruits."
The sentence on the Staffordshire Regiment officer is subject to confirmation but the question we're asking is how often are other recruits subject to bullying and intimidation?
"Brigadier, how often?"
"Well of course I can't possibly give you any figure of how often, but bullying occasionally happens in the Army."
"And may I say very clearly and unequivocally at the outset, that it is abhorrent when it does happen to us because there's no place for it, quite simply because er it is counterproductive to cohesion, and cohesion is the basis for operational effectiveness, and when there is an incident of bullying then we very promptly and thoroughly investigate it, and that investigation is followed, if there's a case to be brought, by a trial of the chap that's guilty."
And may I say also
Please do.
"that we're well aware of the fact that when we're doing this, of course there's usually a degree of adverse publicity."
That is subordinate to the business of routing out the cancer where it occurs.
"Good one, doc, yes,"
"And erm, I mean er, the last eighteen months of his presidency he erm, settled with Mrs Wilson  because he would be incapable"
"Yeah, the, of course, er, Freud had one advantage here, and that was Bullitt."
"Erm, as we know, Bullitt was a member of the delegation and an intimate of, of Wilson, so the book is er co- authored, so in a sense we should know as we're paying for, for all of it, because er, obviously, he relied on Bullitt to give him all this biographical information, and er, consequently what you see Freud doing in this in this book is, is er trawling through, as it were, the things that Bullitt told him, that, that Bullitt had found out, to erm, draw a kind of psy psychoanalytic portrait of Woodrow Wilson, that erm, tried to explain his problem, why did he not deliver the goods as it were ."
"And the  if you put the character of Woodrow Wilson aside, the, the central theme which comes out of this book, which is I think why it's important, worth reading  certainly the introduction is worth reading."
"There is a three or four page brief introduction er, to the book, which is presumably by Freud himself, because it's about psychoanalysis, and I don't think Bullitt could have written it."
"Erm, what's worth reading about that, and it comes out strongly in the introduction, is that this is a kind of case stu study of a particular kind of person."
"Er, er, a man who grows up under the shadow of his father, as it were."
"So it's quite an interesting, whatever you think about Woodrow Wilson in the First World War  is quite a interesting book, in drawing a character study of the kind of person who Freud must have seen many times in his practice."
"The man who grows up idealizing his father, and whose relationship with his father is a largely passive one."
"So he tends to regard his father as a kind of ideal he can never equal, and tends if anything to identify with er, with his own mother, and play a kind of passive role to his, to his father."
"And this is how Freud explains Wilson's inability to stand up to the other men, like Woodrow, like Cle Clements or Lloyd George, who were rather aggressive, and er, were, were kind of pushing all the time, what they could out of the, out of the peace settlement, and what, er the book shows, is that Woodrow Wilson would have confrontations with them and say a lot of fine words, and then the next day, he would, he would give it all away, as it were, he would, he would be ill or he'll backtrack, or when the actual agreements came to be signed, he, he wouldn't do what he said he would, er,wh what he did."
"So Freud has to explain this weakness of Wilson, in the face of erm, these much more dominant aggressive men he was up against in these very hard er hitting negotiations, about what to do about the world after, after World War One."
"So, Freud's view is that he was, this passive erm nature of, of, of, retiring er nature of, of Woodrow Wilson, which explains his inte intellectuality as  says, erm, Wilson was a very intellectual man."
He had a great fondness for speeches and oratory.
"Apparently, in his childhood, he'd give speeches to an empty barn, er, had, would stand in the, in the family barn, erm, giving lectures to the hay, you know, and he, he, he loved this, and he, he was, he had a great erm sense of grandiloquent language and, Freud and Bullitt's interpretation is that, Woodrow Wilson, in a sense, was a typical politician."
"Very good at words, not so good at, at, at actions and actually delivering the goods as it were"
"So, why, why do you ?"
"Well, er  I asked   this, because erm, when I was having my house  it came up, and I and I pointed out to her th the astonishing anomaly, I said, look erm, everybody knows about manuscript, Ernest  and his biography of Freud mentions it and says he read it and reports rather well of it, actually, was really quite impressed with it."
"I said  knew about it, erm, you must have known about it, erm, that standard edition of the complete psychological works of Freud, that's its title, and you're one of the editors, one of the editors, I said, there's no evidence that you ever intended to include this book in it, even though, you know, I understand that it couldn't be published as long as Woodrow Wilson's family was still alive, but erm, you know, why wasn't it published in the standard edition?"
And  said I don't know.
"Now, she could have been lying."
"I don't think she would have told me a, a lie."
"When I asked her things like that, she didn't want to tell me on other occasions, she said I know that I can't tell you."
"Er, she was an honest person."
I think that's what she would have said.
"If, if, if that had been the case, she'd say, oh, I do know, but I'm afraid I can't tell you."
"When she said, I don't know, I think she was telling me the truth, she didn't know."
"Erm, the fact is, she didn't play a dominant part in the standard tradition, although she was one of the editors, of course."
"Er, she was mainly one of the editors because she was erm, her father's, you know she even inherited her father's estate."
"So, so that was in her share of the management ."
"I don't think she'd taken erm prominent role in the day to day planning of the standard edition, this was done by erm, calculable spreadsheet."
"It leaves it unsolved, but all right, given that our ancestors had this because they wanted to swim sinusoidally and eat, you know, filter feed and do things like that, we don't swim sinusoidally and filter feed  why on earth do we  are we so conservative?"
And I've no doubt at all that the answer to that question has to lie in an understanding of the mechanics of development.
"If it wasn't that we had to develop from an egg in every generation, I don't think that kind of conservatism would be observed."
So I do think the development at that level has something pretty profound to say.
"erm I'm conscious of the fact that I've been going on for perhaps too long and I may not have said quite enough about Darwin, but let me just finish by saying this  that it's not possible today, I believe, to discuss any important problem in biology without Darwin's thought being absolutely central to what you're saying all the time."
"I mean biologists , when they're talking to one another, are, by and large , talking about Darwin and that's what I've been trying to do."
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think you'll agree that some of John Maynard-Smith's early engineering training showed through, as it were, in reverse order, if that's not too heretical a statement to make in this context, in the gentle good natured demolition job that he did on the main current critical attacks on Darwin's mechanism, and particularly on the rhythms of change that Darwin adumbrated within his own time scale."
"I think that with John Maynard-Smith around — and I hope he'll be around for some time yet in the University of Sussex, and I hope the University of Sussex will be too"
"In these circumstances I think that Darwin can rest quietly in his grave, that is to say of the acidulous palaeontologists haven't already been trying to dig him up to prove something."
"As John Maynard-Smith knows, I've always been, in a less expert way than he, a Darwinist and I've always felt, and you exemplified that tonight, I think, John, the beauty if the situation was that these profound theories corresponded with what a man of good sense, rationality, unswayed by prejudice and emotion, would be bound to belief when faced with the evidence."
"And I think as far as the critics are concerned, John Maynard-Smith may allow me to adapt erm the critical misjudgement of all time, which was made by a Dublin Professor when The Origin of Species first came out, which you will remember no doubt"
"when she said  when she said that what was new in the theory was false, and what was true was old."
"I think that John has suggested that much of what the critics are now getting up to, where it's new it's false, and where it is true, it's already subsumed in Darwin's theory as modified by John Maynard-Smith."
"Thank you very much, John."
Hello.
"We're always being told that what this country needs is more scientists, but often something seems to go wrong at school."
"When children are thirteen or fourteen instead of being excited and stimulated by subjects such as physics and chemistry, they're bored by them, and many of the brightest minds turn away to history or english, the arts and humanities."
Sandy Grassie is physicist at the university — an enthusiast who likes to share his keen sense of adventure in physics with young people.
"Sandy, tell me about your physics master classes for young people."
Well to a certain extent these are a development of master classes that were running in mathematics across the country.
The Royal Institution had tried this and they would have a set of Saturday mornings where they had mathematicians talking to children of about thirteen or fourteen.
"They felt it would be a good idea if they extended these ideas to the subject of physics, and we were asked at the university to try for the very first time to run a set of these master classes for children aged thirteen to fourteen in physics, to see if we could transmit some of the excitement and pleasure of doing physics to children at that crucial stage in their scientific development in schools."
Where do the children come from?
"The children come from East and West Sussex, although to my astonishment there's one who comes from the far reaches of West Sussex, right away over erm the other side of Chichester."
She travels in every Saturday morning.
"The parents bring her in, and the catchment are Horsham, Worth Abbey, Crawley, Oldbourne."
"Going eastwards into East Sussex, not so far out, mainly Lewes, Newhaven, Brighton area."
And they are put forward by the schools themselves?
"They are put forward by the schools through the local authorities, except that of course there are a large number of independent schools in East and West Sussex, and these schools have  I wrote to these ones asking if they had any children that they wanted to nominate."
"Roughly speaking, there are thirty six children in the class — what is it, it's thirteenish from East Sussex, thirteenish from West Sussex and nine from the independent sector spread across the county."
And what are you trying to do with these children?
"Quite simply, give them an exciting perspective of what the ideas of physics are."
"They may not have thought of it as expertise, but when people said to me a particular ward is dirty, I went and looked at it, and in a very short time, within about ten minutes, that ward had got a massive clean-up team in there, that's the sort of thing that I felt was useful."
"That being said, I mean, you've lost now local, local erm expertise there."
"What I want to ask is, firstly, who are you funded by, and these teams, I note erm paragraphs three erm these nurses and so on, are they existing staff, or is this a new team, erm management team which has been set up at yet more expense to the health authority?"
"So, basically, I want to know are they taken from erm a team which is already in the health service, or are they new posts funded, and funded by whom, bearing in mind the constant complaints we get from the health authority about lack of funds?"
"Thank you, Betty."
Liz?
Thank you.
"I'm finding myself somewhat confused, I mean, I was interested that Ian had mentioned the practical voluntary services as one of the groups that he would wish to work with."
"I think that recently we seem to have had such, so many changes in the health authority, so many different peoples in the post who all seem to be doing the same sort of thing, who've got the Family Health Services Authority set up, but it would seem to me that some of the things that are on this piece of paper are things that I understood were being done by the Family Health Services Authority."
"We have a joint planning officer, and we've got quite a lot of joint erm of joint planning going on between the voluntary sector and the Health Authority and the Social Services."
"We've got a whole erm, a whole erm organisation  that in fact the Council for Voluntary Service only this week made an appointment with a very, very, very, very small amount of money that's been made available on a very, very part-time basis, to actually assist with that, with the planning that's going on in the voluntary sector."
"And I think that we're constantly hearing about new people, new systems of working."
"erm New people who are being put in posts to liaise and to do this, that and the other, with a shrinking voluntary sector."
With a voluntary sector that is erm constantly needing small amounts of resource in order to deliver an enormous amount of service to vulnerable people.
"And I think that the time will come some point, when the voluntary sector will say, ‘Well, we actually don't have time to talk erm to carry on talking about what we're doing and how we're doing it."
"We actually much prefer to get on with what we're there to do, and to, to offer services, to find, to find ways of supporting vulnerable people."
"So, I think my questions are, one, where does this post fit in the Family Health Services Authority?"
"Two, how does it fit in with the Joint Planning Officer who's also ready in post?,"
"Three, how will it fit in with all the locality planning and all the work that's already been done in joint planning between the voluntary sector and the local authority and the health authority."
"Thank you very much, Liz."
"We'll keep you going all afternoon at this rate, won't we Ian."
I've seen Anne and Nonnie and I don't particularly want to see anybody else.
I'm glad Liz is confused because as one of her predecessors I'm also confused.
"I mean, you know, we've lived with this planning."
"There's always been planning with the people on planning, and it seems to me that the paragraph that begins ‘A key area’, we've got some more planning."
"And I think really what's needed is actually going out, I mean, it could be a useful new thing that, a new departure that other people haven't done."
"In other words not sitting there and asking people to, erm people in authority, erm sort of people of influence, ask them what they think, but actually going out and visiting people and groups, and I was going to ask whether this would be copied to the women's sub-committee, because there are many, many groups of women who never have a chance of saying what they really want, and I don't mean patients, I mean potential users of the health service."
erm The Health Service has been very much male-orientated.
"I'm very glad to see that there's quite a lot of nurses here, and I presume that quite a lot of those are women nurses, and I think that this is terribly important, and I think a useful thing with this new service could do is to go out and talk for instance to the meetings of women's organisations, to old peoples' clubs in the afternoon, and actually ask people what they would like, and get them talking in a nice informal way, rather than waiting for somebody to let them know what they think, because I don't think they're going to get it."
"So, I think that would be a useful thing for a new planning section to do."
"erm My ears pricked up when Mr Waterhouse did in fact say, I though he said that it wasn't necessarily help in monetary terms, but some of these people might be willing to help in kind, or in sort of helping as people with some voluntary organisations, and I think, if that was what he meant, I think there again that might be very useful, because voluntary organisations are always looking for people to help."
"So those are my few comments, thank you."
"I think this idea that these magazines are read only by the young is totally wrong, er, elderly women go to the libraries and the Mills and Boon's section is one of their favourite places, its got more stock there than any of the more serious fiction, so there must be something in it that is satisfying their need for romance perhaps."
"mm, mm, yes"
Yes because I think its a form of escaping
"Mm, mm"
"as the lady says its not real life, erm"
is that because real life is very disappointing?
yes
"I think, I think when your reading it, I mean the, the female always gets her man and he's always perfect and er, I mean real life is just isn't like that, so its nice to see that it works out for someone."
nice idea.
"Well actually I think your quite right, but I think the problem is that the older reader reads it for escapism and enjoyment, its, its fun, but I think the younger reader reads it and thinks that's what life is should be like and that's when the trouble starts."
"Is this your problem?, is this why you ended up with a"
I think I'm gonna have to read one of these books
"so, so that that was, that wasn't the case in your, that that wasn't the case for you?"
"no, no"
no
"I just feel that even if you have read the book I mean my point would be, I would maybe be reading the book and have a look and say oh god"
that would be me.
I read one once and it was the best comedy I'd ever read in my life.
"I think there's more to love than just simply romantic love erm, I'm a volunteer campaigner with Oxfam and to me love includes love of my fellow man and fellow women throughout the world and I find it very hard at the moment that millions of people are starving in this world and I feel that I've got to show my love by helping them"
"mm, mm"
I think that's important.
"Its my own personal opinion that the only true love and er I have to honestly say I've never heard love here defined as I would as the totally unconditional love that happens between a woman and a child, probably from the moment of birth that bonds them through life, that's the only love that I could ever admit to."
"That's two different kinds of love though then, love, loving your neighbour I suppose is the widest sense and er and the love between a parent and child, are those more recognisable as, as true love if you like than the kind of romantic love, sexual love that we've been talking about, yes"
"Third kind of love, a bit more flippant, love of chocolate"
"which I was, which I was very worried about because I was told it was a substitute for sex"
"and then I read this amazing article which said no its completely the other way around, sex is when you, you get sex when you don't get enough chocolate."
"I'm beginning to wonder if we need more words for love, I mean if, if love is the only word we have for chocolate er"
"for your fellow man, for your child and for your, for your partner, is there a prosody of vocabulary here."
"I, er I was gonna spring another type of love because we all spend a lot of money on it, the love of pets of animals"
"mm, mm"
"and there's a lot of er of what people even leave their, their fortunes to look after some animal and they don't leave it to people like er the lady sitting here who are, folk, folk are starving, but then its because people are needed and people are needed by their children, but there also needed by their men folk and I think its when they turn to being a mother to their men that, you know, even the, the love that they have, er whether its been a sexual love at one time, er friendly love becomes a very caring love and er I think that's what we all remember erm those of us who have lost our husbands, that would like to have that, that part back again"
"mm, mm"
On that very point sir I'm grateful to the honourable member for giving way but would he not agree with me that actually the failure of G A T at the end was that by which Caribbean bananas failed to be protected.
"Mr Deputy Speaker I I wouldn't be in order to go into this but I don't agree at all, as the honourable gentleman's well aware, that filthy protectionism of the C A P forces up prices of food for the average family in Britain by twenty eight pounds a week."
"I must insist we get back to the boundaries, I've repeatedly had to do so this afternoon I would have thought it that the message would have got over to me honourable members before now."
Sir Teddy Taylor.
Absolutely right Mr Deputy Speaker and I just wish that members wouldn't raise these irrelevant points.
"What I do say to the honourable gentleman is  his argument is rubbish, bad for the third world, bad for the people of Europe and outside Mr Deputy Speaker I'd be glad to give him his answer although quite rightly to say I can't give it here."
But this particular case Mr Deputy Speaker what we want to know from the minister is  on these new boundaries what do we actually have to do?
"My understanding is that the European parliament has got so many buildings now including a great new building at  Brussels built at huge cost, enormous cost and a new building they want to build at Strasbourg."
They're now paying rentals of twenty four million pounds a year.
"Now quite frankly Mr Deputy Speaker, if we want these new constituencies, including South Essex, it seems we're going to have to say to the French they can have lots and lots of money to build lots and lots of new buildings for this rather ridiculous parliament and quite honestly Mr Deputy Speaker, members tonight in voting on the new boundaries will really have to decide what we want to do."
"Are we  simply to chuck out these extra six constituencies and say no to the French, we're not going to agree to extra silly expenditure or are we in fact going to cave in as we've done so often."
I think members should bear in mind the costs of caving in to French blackmail.
"We did it over G A T at great expense to the people of this country and of Europe, great damage to the third world."
"It seems if we agree to these new constituents coming through, we'll only do it by having additional buildings which are utterly wasteful and quite honestly Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you'll  your constituents a very distressed indeed about the waste, the fraud and the mismanagement of the E C, of course Sir."
I'm most grateful to the honourable gentleman er of course these buildings are all related to the orders were discussing in order that M E Ps can be elected in the first place and is it not interesting to note that if agreement can't be reached as indeed is the position of the moment er in u what is called the European union over where actually the parliament is going to sit.
One would have thought the agreement could be reached easily on that matter.
What on earth is the possibility of reaching agreement on much more substantial matters?
"A aren't we supposed to believe this European union is won, that it's all unanimous on the rest of it, there doesn't seem to be much evidence of that, even when it comes to where  the M E Ps should actually sit."
"How right you are Mr Deputy Speaker, of course I couldn't go into this because it's out of order but on the other hand I would simply say to the honourable gentleman if he looks at the basic policies, the basic flaw of the E C is it can't solve problems and all these new M E Ps we're thinking of sending over  I think we should bear in mind the problem, they're going over to something  where problems can't be solved."
"The ideal example of course the C A P, we've had reform after reform  but nothing happens."
"The final point Mr Deputy Speaker and of course the honourable gentleman knows this is absolutely right, expenditure at an all time high, mountains at an all time high and also of course the gap between consumer prices and world prices the highest ever recorded."
"As the Secretary of State for foreign affairs said to me, twenty eight pounds a week extra per family, including the honourable gentleman's constituents ."
really it's er testing my patience now I'm afraid.
"I must insist the honour honourable gentleman and interventions too  should be in accordance with the with the debate and wi o o on the boundaries, so Teddy Taylor."
"Mr Deputy Speaker how right you are Mr Deputy Speaker, I've been trying very hard methodically to stick these regulations, unfortunately when you get members ask you direct questions  if one doesn't get any kind of answer it gives the impression you're ignoring them."
"What I can say to the honourable gentleman who I know always attends these European debates with great regularity, I'll be only too glad to speak to him outside as well as the honourable gentleman to try and clarify these matters."
"The final point I want to make Mr Deputy Speaker which I think is very, very important indeed, bearing in mind that fact that so few people bothered to vote in these is  is there any possibility that before these regulations come into effect  we can have at the same time, a little pamphlet put out saying exactly what these additional M E Ps and the existing ones actually can do."
"I think quite honestly in the progress of democracy, people sometimes gain the impression that the European parliament can do things it can't do."
I know a lot of people who study it carefully take the view if it closed down tomorrow nobody would notice apart from the taxi drivers in Strasbourg.
But the kind of things people write about now will say  can we do anything about the export of live cattle?
The answer's no.
Can we stop the Euro plug?
"What I am going to talk about next is erm I'll just mention that, about another 5 minutes, I think, will get us to the other great bit of work that poor old Edward Heath had to do in St Aldate's, which again, that gives us a great deal about the insight as to what it was like there."
"erm I just put that up, which should have been up while we were talking about money, which is erm the beautiful Oxford crown, which you can see downstairs, which was minted at New Inn Hall, the college that emptied, and was turned into the mint, mostly from college plate."
"erm And, of course, that was a symbol of all the problems of money that the king had, and the ordinary citizens of Oxford had in trying to provide him with it, mostly very reluctantly and unwillingly."
"With everything going on about the Poll tax, it's extremely easy for us to understand how they felt."
"Now, this is not an Oxford cartoon either, but it's a looting soldier, and very much, I think, underlines what people felt about soldiers around the place, and to go back to the overcrowding, erm the great problem was that constantly not only soldiers, but a great many other people, court officials, court servants, barbers, whoever, erm all had to found accommodation, and because St Aldate's was so near the court, a great many of them were of course connected with the court, they had some high ranking ones."
"Now once again we know about this because Edward Heath was given another job, just about nine months later, the king had decided he would summon a parliament in Oxford erm and in January '44 it was due to meet, but where were the members who were going to come into Oxford to stay."
"And so Edward Heath was sent round in January 1644, all the houses in St Aldate's to find out how many people were in them to see if there was any more room."
"And once again of course, meticulously, he kept his records."
"erm You can see, probably recognise the writing erm we've just been looking at."
"This is his final total after he'd been all the way round St Aldate's, he went round 73 houses, and he says here, I think this is a sort of hieroglyphic that would probably mean something like 'item'."
"Gentlemen and their men servants — 267, these are the extra people staying in the houses, not the people who lived in St Aldate's normally, women — 66, children under 16 years of age — 13, soldiers of the life-guards — 62, total in this parish — 408."
So that's 408 extra people living in St Aldate's houses.
"Now, I think there's probably a very nice parallel here, I can't help thinking it was probably a bit better, must have been better organised in the Second World War, but there's going to be a erm special exhibition here isn't there, on memories of change on Oxford in the Second World War, and of course there were a great many extra people there too."
"And, because Edward Heath is so meticulous, we do know who were in all these different houses."
"erm I won't go through too many of them, erm but Blue Boar Inn, for instance, had 21 extra people, had some of the King's servants, some of the prince's servants, they had two Scottish peers, and their servants, £ 21 extra people, in a big inn, there were 14 rooms, I think, that were, could be called living rooms, but never-the-less, I think it must have been pretty crowded."
"£ But I think to give us perhaps a more vivid idea of what it must have been like for ordinary people, these are 3 houses in St Aldate's that don't exist any more, they're down more-or-less where the police station is, erm and we do know exactly who lived there, and who was actually there during the war."
"Sorry, I'm trying to find the right bit of paper."
There we are.
"Right, now £ This is, yes, this is a fairly big house that was put together 31 and 32."
"Then there was a erm largish house, this one, and then a very small one on the end."
"And erm there has been some research done, they produced a plan of what they actually consisted of in the 17th century."
"The top layer was built, that you saw in the photograph, was built later, so 31 and 32 had two rooms, erm on the ground floor, and 2 on the first floor, 33, which was smaller, but it does have a fair sized room, and another upstairs, and then the very small one is 34."
"Now, in 31 and 32, lived a prosperous widow, the widow of a butcher, a mistress Jane Hawks, who was carrying on her husbands business, and doing quite well at it."
"She had a step-son and a wife, but we don't quite know whether they were there or not."
"But she also had living there a Colonel Stringer who was quite an important Scots Officer, three of his servants and a sergeant and one other soldier, so she had 6 extra people."
"Next door was a parchment maker, who had one corporal billeted on him, but we also know that 2 soldiers died in his house, and so it's possible that he actually looked after wounded soldiers, which was, of course happening all over Oxford."
"£ And then in the tiny house lived a widow, Elizabeth Treadwell, with one sergeant and two other lifeguards, so she had 3 soldiers in that tiny house."
"What we don't know, of course, is how they organized their living accommodation, whether they ever got paid, they were given these sort of , £ tickets that were supposed to be honoured later on, but as far as we can make out, they hardly ever were, erm and how the people got on, we just have to use our imagination, but it is interesting that here for instance in these three, we actually apart from anything else have two women house-holders, who are obviously erm women who are carrying on business of some independence."
"£ Well, I think I really had better stop there, and then if you want to ask any questions erm we can go into them, but perhaps I could just mention two things that I would like to have said more about, one was, that you probably know, there were three or two major epidemics in Oxford, of what they call plague, but it was probably a form of typhus, in 1643 and 44, and a good deal of sickness, I think, still in 1645, and the other was that there was a very serious fire, which almost certainly arose from these kind of living conditions, because Anthony Wood says it was a soldier roasting pig, erm and I think a lot of cooking went on in very unsuitable situations."
"And the fire actually started beyond the North Wall, just by the North Gate, but the wind was blowing from the North, and it blew it down, and although it didn't burn the rather better stone houses, facing onto St Aldate's, erm behind I think a lot of the poorer houses did suffer, and St Ebbe's parish, next door, suffered a great deal, and because it was war, I think they just, the city council, city records lament that there how hard it is for people, and there's no money to help them."
"So it's erm there was in fact a great petition made to the king on these very lines, really because of the fire."
"So I think life was erm boring, tough, hard-working, pretty unpleasant during the war, erm and I think most of the citizens must have been very very relieved when the surrender finally came, and it brought no actual fighting, and at least the city was left reasonably unscathed."
"This is a particularly good performance, specially in the U S A where there's been a very serious downturn in natural gas."
"We've increased our market shares virtually everywhere  er  two very strong  er  improvements  Venezuela and Nigeria  and the  the initiative we've taken with the Soviets to rework their wells  er  should be onstream by the end of the year  and we're hoping that may lead to other  opportunities  er, both in Russia and er  and there's the possibility from that of some business in Eastern Europe as well."
"Investment banking  although this year it's a very different difficult environment for investment banking particularly a house that concentrates on, on corporate finance  er  there hasn't been a great deal of M and A activity and if, if there has it hasn't been a very high erm very high ticket."
Er but there have been a lot of issues and we've done well in that field but of course it doesn't produce the same kind of  fee income as the M and A activity.
Lazzards New York managed to maintain their figures of last year in dollar terms  and if we take the Lazzard houses as a whole  we're second only to Goldman Sachs now in the erm  in the M and A table internationally  and that's on the value of bids on which we've advised.
Fine China  we had a very poor first four months  but then in May world sales were nine point nine percent ahead of last year  and in the U S A over the last ten weeks we've actually been ahead of nineteen ninety.
"One factor in this is our exporting the very successful Bridal Collection that we developed in the U K, we've exported that to Canada and the U S and that's gone down very well indeed."
"We've also had significant growth in our chain store business  in this country  we've signed a new two-year contract with Air Canada  and we're much more optimistic about the rest of the year  we've got orders, production and sales all nicely in equilibrium  ready for the second half."
Now I'll pass you to er  James.
"I'd just like to make  two or three points  first of all the exchange factor which Frank touched upon when, when talking about  profits  you probably all totally familiar but I have forgotten quite how much the dollar has strengthened recently  beginning of the year it was nearly two dollars  and the result of that is that for the erm first half as a whole  the impact of er exchange translation was adverse for our profits compared with last year to the tune of about one and a half million pounds."
It's not enormous but it's perhaps  er not the way people er were thinking.
Now the consequence of the fact that the dollar end of June  er relatively strong at around one sixty of course did impinge on er our  er borrowings since we do have a considerable percentage of our gross  in dollar terms  and if we turn to the next slide  er we can see  er the summary of the balance sheet at thirtieth of June.
"Now  you'll be familiar with the fact since we went through it in April  that there has been a sharp jump in our known assets  brought about by the sale of Elsivir and the fact that it had a very substantially written down value in our books, seventy five million pounds."
"So you've had a sharp increase in our shareholders' funds during the six months  and a reduction in our net debt which may not be quite as er  substantial as you expected but it is the combination of on the one hand the proceeds of Elsivir less some reinvestment which Frank mentioned, we put a little more money in B S B and the minority interests and   we do have traditionally in the first half an adverse net movement of funds from operation  about ninety five million  and then we had thirty two million odd  er of simply revaluation as a result of translating our dollar debt  at er  the one sixty as opposed to the  year ending rate."
"So  net debt is two sixty four million  er and therefore the pro forma debt equity ratio's halved from fifty seven percent to twenty eight percent  we do of course expect it to be somewhat lower by the year end as our working capital  which is coming to its peak season, unwinds."
I'd like to go into a little more  the composition of the net debt which again is something that er interests some of you  we have er a reduction both on gross debt and equally an increase in cash as you would expect as a result of the Elsivir sale  the increases are not fixed  debt  fixed term fixed rate debt is a function again of the exchange rate we haven't in issued any more  the whole of the reduction of debt therefore is confined to our floating rate or variable debt and that amount's ready to the repayment of the gilder drawings we had under our  to hedge  or partially to hedge our holding in Elsivir We have increased our cash holdings and they remain concentrated in sterling as part of our sterling er asset er portfolio which is managed from Millbank and which we regard as our investable funds as and when needed.
The child victims of war.
Images that are now a daily occurrence in dozens of countries across the world.
Millions of young lives have now been devastated.
It's all placing an intolerable burden on charities like Save The Children who say far too often the international community is not pulling its weight.
In Somalia the combination of war and famine claimed a quarter of a million children dead last year.
"Today in the capital Mogadishu a hundred thousand more driven from their homes, are dependent on food aid for survival."
In Bosnia the war has been especially cruel on children.
One estimate puts the number dead in Sarajevo alone at twelve hundred and some fourteen thousand wounded.
In Northern Iraq over a hundred thousand Kurdish children are still unable to return to their homes after being forced to flee Saddam Hussein's army.
Many are living in appalling conditions without clean water and proper sanitation.
"In Mozambique, more than two hundred thousand have been orphaned or separated from their families."
"Three quarters of a million children have been forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries, others are disabled for life."
"In the West African republic of Liberia where eighty five per cent of the population have been displaced, children, some as young as eight are being placed in secure compounds to prevent them from going back to fight for the waring factions."
"Children who've been given at a far too tender age, the terrible power of holding a loaded gun and be able to command everything in sight as a result of that, have actually got to get back and rediscover childhood."
"Lost innocence, a pattern that's sadly being repeated across the world's battle grounds."
One immediate casualty of the change in conditions was advertising.
"Recruitment adversiding advertising for example virtually ground to a halt as businesses started to shed  er, people, rather than to look for them."
So what happened to our trading profit?
"In this analysis  er, if you set aside the effect of our sale of Elsivir er, the variance was forty nine million  seventy percent of which relates to the U K. The drop in profits from our newspapers was the biggest  and probably the  most  widely expected  a substantial proportion of their costs are fixed  and, er, they therefore are particularly sensitive to, er  changes in volume."
"Fine china and investment banking inevitably  er, er er er er suffered from the economic conditions  so did entertainment  er, which also brought two extra burdens  er, firstly the er marked reduction in tourism  and, er, for the first time, a three and a half million pound  er, bill for Alton Towers' loss-making winter quarter  which I think we, we've flagged  er, quite consistently."
"After newspapers, books showed  the largest decline  er, and the fifteen million variance is shared roughly one fifth by Addison Wesley and two fifths apiece by Penguin and Longman."
"Two of the abiding characteristics of these businesses are first that like newspapers  a high proportion of their costs are fixed  and secondly, unlike newspapers  er, their main selling season is in the second half of the year."
"Outside AW's erm, specialists books  er, er, markets  er, book sales have been almost universally slow  there were very high returns as book sellers everywhere reacted to reduced  er, demand by replacing or winding down their stock."
This particularly affected Penguin  substantially increasing its spec i its expected first half loss.
"Penguin also incurred losses of two million on Smithmark its American remainder book businesses  er, before selling it."
"Longman  the least seasonally biased of the three  struggled to break even in the first half and this removed the normal pattern of Longman's half-year profits helping to offset the first half losses of the other two businesses  but before we get too depressed  er  I  point out that Addison Wesley s sales were up by eleven percent and the size of the first half loss reflects the company's decision to gear up in advance  er, for what we w believe will be a very strong  er, second  er, half performance."
"Er, overall  I think it's right to say that we're disappointed by these results but we're not downhearted."
"All of our businesses have maintained or improved their market shares  as managers  we concentrate on the full year rather on either half  and because of our seasonal bias  er, those of you who've been, er, to our interim presentations before  er, will remember that without fail I tell you  our results at the half-way stage are not a clear guide to the outcome of the year as a whole."
"The major part of our profits are made in the second half  er, and this year  er  will certainly be no exception."
"To underline the point I thought I'd show you this four year average  one thing that the exercise shows is that between them  our book, entertainment and fine china businesses normally account for about seven percent of Pearson's annual profit in their first half  and for about thirty three percent of our profit in the full year."
"This year their net first half contribution was negative  which will strongly exaggerate the seasonal bias towards the second half  er, conditions will still be far from ideal  but with the Gulf factor out of the way and some visible improvement in our overseas markets, particularly North America  we think the trading environment will be broadly equivalent to that of the second half of last year."
"Now, er, before I hand over to Frank  er, a word about the dividend  er, in recent years we've paid an interim dividend which was half the total of the previous year's dividends  and so, er, had a built-in increase."
"This year we thought it right to reserve our judgment  er, until the end of the year so we matched last year's interim."
Frank.
"Well  as Michael says, we're not proud of the results  er, and we're not going to try and dress them up, Michael hasn't tried to do that and I certainly don't intend to."
"But nevertheless I do want to  er, bring home to you the underlying strength of our businesses  there's no question, we're very wel very well faced for, for an upturn."
"But before doing that  er, you may reasonably ask what action we've taken  er, during this year when it's been such a difficult year."
"Do you remember  at the announcement of last year's results we erm  we mentioned that we were concentrating on four themes  one's cost reduction  er  driving for cash  erm, improving our market share  and investing for the future."
"Starting with cost reduction  any cost reduction programme always involves a lot of redundancy  and, and  this is no exception  and from the slide you'll see that we've er  we've had a staff reduction  er, from the  the plan for this year  of one thousand and thirty three  er  and that's the, that will save us in a full year something like fifteen point nine, sixteen million pounds."
"This year  er, there's been a negative benefit in the first half of two million  and there'll be a positive benefit  in the second half  of two million."
"Incidentally, it doesn't include the disposal  of Smithmark We've also  er  we've also gone in for other cost reduction  exercises, for instance at er Dalton  with a review of warehousing and distribution  er, we should save about a million pounds in a full year  and we've been ramming home to our chief executives  the need for annual payroll reviews  to be geared  to the profitability of the company  rather than t rather than to the rate of inflation  er, or even, er  in, even the market place."
"Driving for cash  er  well an indication of how strongly we, we've been driving for cash is that er  the reduction i in er operating cash flow  is less than the reduction in profit."
"We've been telling our chief executives that even though you can't get the sales then at least try to work on your working capital, try and get your working capital  er, ratio down."
"And there's been quite a bit of success in  in that area  both of the newspaper companies  er, are doing better than last year  and er  Longmans for instance expect er  expect their operating cash flow  erm  their working capital rather to be lower this year than last year by  by year end."
"Erm  improving market share, well all of our businesses have improved their market share during this recession  and I'll, I'll mention them as I go through the individual companies."
"Investing for the future  although, although we've been keen to drive for cash  er, we really wanted to, to use the benefit of having a strong balance sheet  and so where investment has seemed sensible and sound, we've made those investments, of course we've put er, cash in the B Sky B  er  and we've also invested further in the er  Spanish group, the Recollectors Group  taking our stake in expansion, adding some cash and getting a stake in the bigger  bigger grouping."
If we look at the individual businesses  there we er see the individual profits.
"Well, Charles immediately set up the kind of court that he'd had in London as far as he could, with a very set routine."
"He had his two elder sons with him, he had quite a lot of time for enjoyment, certainly to start with, he went hunting round Woodstock quite often, and they played tennis, The erm Racquet Sport, and I think they played tennis in The Racquet Sport, I'm not absolutely certain, was actually just erm facing onto Blue Boar Street, erm behind the Unicorn Inn."
"erm They had great services were held in Christchurch Cathedral, and the King would have looked out from the Deans House, and this is the view of Tom Quad, a modern view, of course, of how you can look out onto the Great Quad of Christchurch, but of course it wasn't like that."
"erm Tom Tower wasn't there, the elegant pool in the middle wasn't and in fact the whole thing was probably rather chaotic."
We know for instance that quite often erm pillaged flocks of cows and sheep were driven into the quad as one of the few open spaces within the city walls.
Anthony Wood gleefully recalls this.
"erm So I think you want to regard it not as a sort of glamorous place where the troops were drilling and the drums were beating, but a slightly chaotic and rather dirty place, despite the kings  existence."
"Another person the people in St Aldate's would have seen was the kings nephew, Prince Rupert, erm only 23 but one of the King's major assets, a brilliant cavalry commander."
"This is painted just before the war, and it's interesting to compare it with  a painting by the court painter, William Dobson who worked in Oxford during the war, his studio was just around the corner in the High Street, because that's Rupert very much at the end when things were going badly wrong for him, erm and it's unfinished, perhaps because Dobson was beginning to run out of paint, and the experts at  allow, and I think just  that face tells the whole story about tension and unhappiness, Dobson's an interesting painter, one of the first English painters who sort of get to the top in this way, and he painted a lot of the cavaliers at Charles' court, erm this is Sir John Byron who clattered down the main street at St Aldate's, before the king even arrived before the Battle of Edgehill, the one that caused trouble for John Smith, erm and he was very much a swash-buckling character, but he didn't spend a lot of time in Oxford later, but he was there enough to have his portrait painted."
"That black mark is erm a scar patch, if you got a scar during the war you got a wound in a scuffle erm you won in the war, you did sort of emphasise this in that way."
"And so Charles Cockshall, who is the owner of  court out to the north of Oxford, who is the King's master of ceremonies, and I think that's an interesting contrast, because here again you get this feeling of tension, and sadness."
"erm There was a great deal of difficulty I think at the court, as well as the rather glamorous exterior."
"erm The Queen didn't arrive till 1643, she'd been in the Netherlands raising money for the war effort, very successfully, because she finally came to Oxford with 2,000 foot and 1,000 horsemen, and erm a hundred wagons full of equipment as well as cannons and so on."
"I don't know if it all came to Oxford, but certainly most of it did, and erm the city council actually spent six shillings and sixpence strewing the streets with flowers to welcome her, which erm when we have a look at the amount of money that was being, having to be raised elsewhere it was quite generous really."
And she got the pair of gloves as usual at the Penniless Bench.
"erm Then she came down to Christchurch and was welcomed by the heads of the university, her husband had already greeted her outside Oxford, on the site of , actually, and then Charles escorted her to her own household in Merton College."
"I think she undoubtedly added to the intrigue erm and difficulties of her court, erm one example, she was always getting people that she approved of, getting them plum jobs, and one example was one of the governors of Oxford, the most unpopular, one Sir Arthur Aston, who was so unpopular that he got attacked on the street, and then had to have a body guard paid for the city council, and then was curvetting on his horse in front of some ladies, and fell off and broke his leg so badly that he had to have it amputated, so from then on he had a wooden leg, erm that meant he had to stop being governor, and later on in the war, a countryman was coming into Oxford, and asked the sentinel ‘who was governor still’, and by that time a friend of prince Rupert's Sir William Leg was governor, and the answer was ‘one Leg’, and the countryman's reply was ‘pox on him, is he governor still?’."
(Aston).
"erm I think two people have had tremendous problems and again must have been going up and down St Aldate's, because they were very busy officials, was Edward Hyde, who later became Earl of Clarendon and wrote his story of the war, again of course from the Royalist point of view, and his great friend, Lord Falkland, who was Secretary of State for the King, and became so upset and worried by the rash policies of the Queen's party and the general atmosphere of intrigue, and by the war itself, that he does seem to have more or less committed suicide at the battle of Newbury, by riding ahead of his troops into the enemy."
"And erm Edward Hyde wrote an elegiac mourning comment on this, which we really haven't got time for unfortunately."
"erm Sorry, I think we'll just stick with Faulkner for a moment, because I think that leads us on to the constant tragedies of battle casualties, which were obviously very much brought in into Oxford whenever people were wounded outside they were often brought in to Oxford to be cared for, there was a hospital out of Yarnton too, but a great many were cared for all over Oxford, and the greatest of course were buried at Christchurch."
"erm The tombs bear witness to this, there's two governors actually, Sir William Pendon who died of one of the epidemics in Oxford and Sir Henry Gage who was another governor, who was only governor for a month because he was killed in a scuffle near Abingdon."
"erm But the grandest funeral of the lot was the King's cousin, erm which was, erm and the funeral procession came from Magdalen down to Christchurch, the footman soldiers came, he was, sorry, killed at the battle of Edgehill, and the funeral took place on January 13th 1643."
"‘The footman soldiers came first with their muskets under their arms, the noses of the muskets being behind them."
"The pikemen trailed their pikes on the ground, the horsemen followed with their pistols in their hands, the handles being upwards."
"The tops of the colours also were borne behind, a chariot, covered in black velvet where the body was, drawn by six horses, and the man that drove the chariot strewed money about the streets as he passed."
"Three great volleys of shot at the interring of the body, and lastly an herald of arms proclaimed his titles.’"
"Well, if death can ever be glamorous, that, I suppose, is the glamorous side of war casualties, but I think we need to spend the rest of our time very much looking at what it was like for the ordinary people of St Aldate's. erm And here, I apologise for producing a modern slide of Carfax, but I think just to remind you that we are talking about a very busy crowded city area, and erm about a city whose whole aspect was changing during the war."
"The university buildings, all around St Aldate's, the Bodleian had become a warehouse, full of corn, coal, cheese and the uniforms for the King's lifeguards were made there."
"New College was an arsenal, Magdalen College had the heavy ordnance, which was clattering through the streets drawn by horses, whenever it was brought in."
There were mills all round the city that were grinding gunpowder or sword blades.
"erm I think the city must have become a real mess, there were stores piled up everywhere, wood, coal, corn, often I think they had to build sort of, something to hold the corn, there's a lot of the evidence for that in the college accounts certainly."
Er but the truth of the matter is that the British government would not .
interesting but when are we gonna hear something about the boundaries.
Mr Geoffrey Holn.
I I'm grateful Mr Deputy Speaker and I I will certainly er stay in order but  the British electorate coming up to June the ninth and the European er elections will not know even if we pass these particular proposals tonight er in which constituencies they will be voting and if I may give an illustration as the honourable member for Truro did er er as far as his European constituency is concerned er the European constituency of Derbyshire Ashfield will d be divided into three different directions as the result of this particular order in council if we pass it tonight.
There will be a a a series of new constituencies created across the East Midlands.
The electorate will expect to know who the candidates are  in those er er particular constituencies.
Indeed the political parties preparing for those elections are in the process of selecting the candidates  er there will in fact be an extra constituency in the East Midlands as a result of this particular order in council er and indeed the political parties at some stage will have to select new candidates for the six extra seats across the united kingdom.
That process is under way and the processes of political parties in choosing candidates are an important part of our democratic process.
"If that is the case that each of the political parties, as I assume is the case for  er the Conservative party, I know it to be the case of the Labour party I assume the same is true for the Liberal Democrats and other parties represented in this house, that they undertake the very considerable organisational er er process of selecting candidates only to find a few weeks before June the ninth, that as a result of the difficulties that I've described as far as the French government attitude towards these elections is concerned, that er in fact we have to revert to the existing arrangements and that we cannot have these new er  boundaries in place."
That will cause astonishing confusion to the electorate.
It will something which  the government will seek er to blame on the French and therefore Mr Deputy Speaker I do think it important that the record is set straight er as far as the French government are concerned.
"The British government er not only went along with this agreement at the time of the Edinburgh summit, they positively endorsed this arrangement er as being something that they er strongly supported and urged upon other member states in the European community er and that I think is a relevant matter with respect er Mr Deputy Speaker, I I appreciate that er there are other issues relating to these er er constituencies that are of  greater concern perhaps to er honourable and right honourable members but this question of  who actually is to pay for any new building in the European parliament is something that I believe the government cannot avoid."
I appreciate the minister's difficulty representing the Home Office with no  specific responsibility for these matters as far as er er Europe is concerned er but nevertheless this is a matter that does affect the electorate and one that I think the house should take er notice of.
I'm grateful Mr Deputy Speaker.
Morgan.
Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker.
"Erm I'm er rising to take the opportunity to sum up the debate er for those of us on this side of the house and to say that on this side of the house we do  welcome these orders actually coming through, delayed though they are and er besmirched though they are by the usual examples of government incompetence in failing to send them to the scrutiny committee in the proper manner to allow the usual processes to take place but wi that's par for the course these days."
"I want to welcome obviously particularly er the order relating to Wales because it confers on Wales er one additional seat, giving us  five altogether because of the rise in the Welsh population over the last ten years and that er although Wales was under represented under the previous erm  er  you know distribution of seats which gave us only four  we will be slightly over represented when we have five because you simply can't have four and a half seats, it's got to be one or the other but since the Welsh population is continuing to rise very rapidly then it is likely that that will be put right."
"I mean the Welsh population  in percentage terms is now rising more rapidly than that of England and therefore by the year two thousand and one when the next review would take place er we er will certainly fully occupy if you like, that fifth seat in terms of the average size because Welsh Euro constituencies were during the past ten years, very slightly larger on average than those in England and so er  we are moving from under representation to slight over representation for a temporary period er simply because er you know Wales is regarded as indivisible for this purpose and that's why we welcomed this debate."
I give way  briefly to the honourable member.
I'm grateful to the honourable member and listening very carefully to this argument.
Obviously the integrity of Wales is very important to him otherwise he would p p presumably be prepared to accept that part of England could have gone with one of the new seats.
Would he care to address the fact that because these orders are being taken separately for Wales and England it is not possible to make the quota applicable in the same way in the same  parts of the United Kingdom.
Wales is being given a quite different quota  to England and because Cornwall is being included in England for this purpose we are being unfairly treated by Wales' being generously treated.
Would the honourable member care to  comment on that inequality?
"I I obviously Cornwall is a special case which we obviously as our Celtic cousins it is the only non-Anglo Saxon county in England and as a result we feel a very, very strong  erm er almost a kind of Uncle erm Nephew relationship to Cornwall, whereas the Cornish are certainly not Welsh but they're certainly not Anglo Saxon English either."
We have a great deal of sympathy er but whereas I don't think some of the ideas that have been floated tonight for a Cornwall and Gibraltar  West seat er or erm any kind of link up between Cornwall and any tail end of a Welsh seat we don't think is practical and I think he's gotta solve this problem er within the confines of Cornwall being regarded as part of England if not Anglo Saxon.
"That's not a problem that I can actually deal with er but Wales certainly er you know takes the sort of interest in Europe that we have seen from most of the Conservative speakers er in trying to sum up this debate you have to refer to them er of not being able to show, there's a definite sort of anti European theme coming through from most of the speakers from the back benches who've chosen to take part in this debate tonight from the other side and it's difficulty to avoid summing up the debate without some reference to the points that they have made which is in complete contrast to the attitude that we have erm in Wales er towards Europe and that we are."
"Poor practices at the bank which the auditors were aware of for years, a crashing indictment er of the auditors."
"It did, if you look at that report er th th that the curry curry gold or whatever, curry report erm  i i i it shows that B C C I actually provided loads of financial benefits to some of the auditors  er these benefits included loans to two Price Waterhouse partnerships in the Caribbean er in addition it said there were serious questions concerning the acceptance of payment and possibly housing from B C C I and its affiliates by Price Waterhouse partners er the in Grand Caymans er and possible acceptance of sexual favours."
The report is more interesting than  by the member for South East Derbyshire  er  not that there's  much sex in it but if er er i it's more interesting er sexual favours  provided by B C C I officials to certain persons affiliated er with  the firm.
"Now  this is an appalling situation, er th the B C C I's books were certified by the auditors as a true and fair record from December nineteenth er December thirty first nineteen er eighty seven forward a and that meant that people had confidence in B C C I, here we're told that the auditors are giving it er a certificate of a a true and fair record er encouraging therefore people to in t to to invest and yet prior to nineteen eighty nine Price Waterhouse knew of gross irregularities er in B C C I's handling of loads, particularly the load to C C A H which was the holding company for First American er bank shares."
"Yeah I, I er thought about self defence but I keep thinking about things like that's fine but if someone has a knife or a gun, the one might of self defence that I have been trained on or taught in can possibly help and I can't really see it as being very very helpful because"
"mm, mm"
very seldom is er one to one situation where the perpetrator does not have a gun or a weapon of some description so I don't see it as being very helpful.
"do you think in this country that's the case?, people have a weapon now certainly if they"
I think so
"were doing this programme in the United States that'll be, but then of course you living in the States you'll probably all have guns"
"I mean I don't, I wonder, do, do any of you have a gun?, let me ask you that"
"do you, do, do you have a gun?, button one for yes and button two for no  well I'm not going to ask you to identify yourselves the three of you"
"who have, well in fact, I must ask you this would you, would you like to have a gun?, button one for yes, button two for no, I'll tell you my own view on this after you've voted  and nine of you say yes you would, what, what, would any body liked to say why they'd like to have a gun?, yes"
"Well I erm, I was, I was burgled about a year ago and I'm am ex er, I'm a retired criminal lawyer, and, but I, I felt that if I lived in the States and trained in the States and I carried a gun then and I felt very vulnerable in not having a gun because he, I was in my own home and he fist me with a knife"
"mm, mm"
"you, er, it had happened because I had been, I had had a lot of training and a lot of swindles and thing, I was able to talked to him and I talked to him for an hour and a half er, I was curious for one thing to find out why he was, he, he was breaking into people's houses, so that the fact that he was doing it for, to, to get money for drugs"
"mm, mm"
"and I, I told him I wasn't stupid enough to keep money in the house as an ex er as an ex lawyer and erm, where, er it so happened as I say that I talked to he, he didn't take any thing in fact at the end he apologise for having chosen the wrong house and he"
"went to put the, he, he went away again, but I, I did mention to the police, who I might say were very helpful were ninety per cent of burglars don't get cleared up so of course it wasn't important and I never expected it would be, but I did mention to the police at the time that I would like an future occasion because I've been trying to use guns in America er to have a gun in the house but they er, but they wouldn't erm agree to it at all"
"mm, mm"
"I asked if I could have a fire arm, she said oh no, no, no, they"
mm
"but, but I think that we'll get into that stage in Britain"
do you?
"but erm , er at a stage that they are in and been for a long time in the States as we will have to er get armed, well I'm sorry to say this but it seems like it"
"well no its your view, although ninety one of the women here said no and er, if I had a vote I'd, I'd probably say no because I'm absolutely convinced I would use it if I had it"
"and er, and well, well, one can be abrupt at times and the that could lead"
"to other things, we've kind of veered of the, one of the subjects that we were er, we did get onto which was how the police and the courts er handle er well victims and indeed criminals, I wonder if I might conflate erm both those groups into one question, its a very broad question, but I wonder if you think by and large the police do a good job, erm button one for yes and button two for no, erm  and the majority here say yes, seventy  seventy people say yes the, the police do a good job and since we've talked about the courts do you think the courts do a good job by and large?, we've been talking specifically about erm some of the more bizarre erm statements that have come from the bench, particularly in with reference to crimes erm, that have treated against women, well now, seventy nine say no, so the police comes thumbs up, but the courts are way down, now not surprisingly there aren't many representatives from the courts er amongst this hundred"
"because er there weren't all that many er available, what, what do you think of, twenty one of you said yes, of the twenty one who said yes are you surprised that the great majority of this hundred women are so unimpressed by, by the courts system, who said yes and would you like to defend your answer?, yes"
"Er, I must declare an, an interest because I am a, a court lawyer, but I think that a lot of people say no because of the media pres , presentation, you only hear bad stories, they don't hear the good, good stories about the attempts to make the courts more efficient and I think that on the whole and with the circumstances that the courts have to deal with they do a very good job."
so its my fault again
"the media  any, any, yes, up there."
You've got to mention in Scotland the one thing that we've got to be proud of is the children's panel system because
mm
"we, its one of the only countries in the world where children can go and in a non judged mental way, a panel can work out what the best thing is to do with them, its unique."
"We've hardly managed to touch on prisons at all, or though, although, I know that we have amongst us hundred people who er, who are, are responsible for and er and have dedicated much time to working in prisons and I don't know whether there is sufficient people here qualified to comment or not whether the prisons do a good job, so I'll ask some one who's bound to be a slightly partial Audrey , there's only one women's prison as some one said earlier, now your an ex-governor, now is that right?"
"`` Come aboard , Mr. Hands , '' I said ironically ."
"He rolled his eyes round heavily , but he was too far gone to express surprise ."
"All he could do was to utter one word , `` Brandy . ''"
"It occurred to me there was no time to lose , and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck , I slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin ."
It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy .
All the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart .
The floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp .
"The bulkheads , all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt , bore a pattern of dirty hands ."
Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship .
"One of the doctor 's medical books lay open on the table , half of the leaves gutted out , I suppose , for pipelights ."
"In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow , obscure and brown as umber ."
"I went into the cellar ; all the barrels were gone , and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away ."
"Certainly , since the mutiny began , not a man of them could ever have been sober ."
"Foraging about , I found a bottle with some brandy left , for Hands ; and for myself I routed out some biscuit , some pickled fruits , a great bunch of raisins , and a piece of cheese ."
"With these I came on deck , put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain 's reach , went forward to the water-breaker , and had a good deep drink of water , and then , and not till then , gave Hands the brandy ."
He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth .
"`` Aye , '' said he , `` by thunder , but I wanted some o ' that ! ''"
I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat .
`` Much hurt ? ''
I asked him .
"He grunted , or rather , I might say , he barked ."
"`` If that doctor was aboard , '' he said , `` I 'd be right enough in a couple of turns , but I do n't have no manner of luck , you see , and that 's what 's the matter with me ."
"As for that swab , he 's good and dead , he is , '' he added , indicating the man with the red cap ."
`` He war n't no seaman anyhow .
And where mought you have come from ? ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I 've come aboard to take possession of this ship , Mr. Hands ; and you 'll please regard me as your captain until further notice . ''"
He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing .
"Some of the colour had come back into his cheeks , though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about ."
"`` By the by , '' I continued , `` I ca n't have these colours , Mr. Hands ; and by your leave , I 'll strike 'em ."
Better none than these . ''
"And again dodging the boom , I ran to the colour lines , handed down their cursed black flag , and chucked it overboard ."
`` God save the king ! ''
"Imagine , when we returned here , we met some linnets who , just as the spring and the flowers and the long days had come , were setting out for the north and the cold ?"
Out of pure compassion we tried to persuade them to give up this folly ; but they only replied with the utmost insolence . '
` How shocking ! '
exclaimed the city swallow .
"` Yes , it was ."
"And worse than that , the crested lark , that was formerly so timid and shy , is now no better than a thief , and steals maize and corn whenever she can find them . ' '"
I am astonished at what you say . '
` You will be more astonished when I tell you that on my arrival here for the summer I found my nest occupied by a shameless sparrow !
"`` This is my nest , '' I said ."
`` Yours ? ''
"he answered , with a rude laugh ."
"`` Yes , mine ; my ancestors were born here , and my sons will be born here also . ''"
And at that my husband set upon him and threw him out of the nest .
I am sure nothing of this sort ever happens in a town . '
"` Not exactly , perhaps ."
But I have seen a great deal -- if you only knew ! '
` Oh !
do tell us !
do tell us ! '
cried they all .
"And when they had settled themselves comfortably , the city swallow began : ` You must know , then that our king fell in love with the youngest daughter of a tailor , who was as good and gentle as she was beautiful ."
"His nobles hoped that he would have chosen a queen from one of their daughters , and tried to prevent the marriage ; but the king would not listen to them , and it took place ."
"Not many months later a war broke out , and the king rode away at the head of his army , while the queen remained behind , very unhappy at the separation ."
"When peace was made , and the king returned , he was told that his wife had had two babies in his absence , but that both were dead ; that she herself had gone out of her mind and was obliged to be shut up in a tower in the mountains , where , in time , the fresh air might cure her . '"
` And was this not true ? '
asked the swallows eagerly .
"` Of course not , ' answered the city lady , with some contempt for their stupidity ."
"` The children were alive at that very moment in the gardener 's cottage ; but at night the chamberlain came down and put them in a cradle of crystal , which he carried to the river ."
"` For a whole day they floated safely , for though the stream was deep it was very still , and the children took no harm ."
In the morning -- so I am told by my friend the kingfisher -- they were rescued by a fisherman who lived near the river bank . '
"The children had been lying on the bench , listening lazily to the chatter up to this point ; but when they heard the story of the crystal cradle which their foster-mother had always been fond of telling them , they sat upright and looked at each other ."
"` Oh , how glad I am I learnt the birds ' language ! '"
She even tried to make her heart go softly .
Will they reach the nursery in time ?
"If so , how delightful for them , and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief , but there will be no story ."
"On the other hand , if they are not in time , I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end ."
They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them .
"Once again the stars blew the window open , and that smallest star of all called out : ` Cave , Peter ! '"
Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose .
"` Come , ' he cried imperiously , and soared out at once into the night , followed by John and Michael and Wendy ."
Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late .
The birds were flown .
"-LSB- Illustration : THE BIRDS WERE FLOWN -RSB- CHAPTER IV THE FLIGHT ` Second to the right , and straight on till morning . '"
"That , Peter had told Wendy , was the way to the Neverland ; but even birds , carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners , could not have sighted it with these instructions ."
"Peter , you see , just said anything that came into his head ."
"At first his companions trusted him implicitly , and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy ."
"John and Michael raced , Michael getting a start ."
They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room .
Not so long ago .
But how long ago ?
They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously .
John thought it was their second sea and their third night .
"Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light , and now they were very cold and again too warm ."
"Did they really feel hungry at times , or were they merely pretending , because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them ?"
"His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them ; then the birds would follow and snatch it back ; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles , parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will ."
"But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter , nor even that there are other ways ."
"Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy , they were sleepy ; and that was a danger , for the moment they popped off , down they fell ."
The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny .
` There he goes again ! '
"he would cry gleefully , as Michael suddenly dropped like a stone ."
"` Save him , save him ! '"
"cried Wendy , looking with horror at the cruel sea far below ."
"Eventually Peter would dive through the air , and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea , and it was lovely the way he did it ; but he always waited till the last moment , and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life ."
"Also he was fond of variety , and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him , so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go ."
"You see , sir , here it is ."
"I get a rough answer , do I not ?"
"Well , if I speak back , pikes will be going in two shakes ; if I do n't , Silver will see there 's something under that , and the game 's up ."
"Now , we 've only one man to rely on . ''"
`` And who is that ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` Silver , sir , '' returned the captain ; `` he 's as anxious as you and I to smother things up ."
"This is a tiff ; he 'd soon talk 'em out of it if he had the chance , and what I propose to do is to give him the chance ."
Let 's allow the men an afternoon ashore .
"If they all go , why we 'll fight the ship ."
"If they none of them go , well then , we hold the cabin , and God defend the right ."
"If some go , you mark my words , sir , Silver 'll bring 'em aboard again as mild as lambs . ''"
"It was so decided ; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men ; Hunter , Joyce , and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for , and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew ."
"`` My lads , '' said he , `` we 've had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts ."
"A turn ashore 'll hurt nobody -- the boats are still in the water ; you can take the gigs , and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon ."
I 'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown . ''
"I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed , for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage ."
The captain was too bright to be in the way .
"He whipped out of sight in a moment , leaving Silver to arrange the party , and I fancy it was as well he did so ."
"Had he been on deck , he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation ."
It was as plain as day .
"Silver was the captain , and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it ."
The honest hands -- and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board -- must have been very stupid fellows .
"Or rather , I suppose the truth was this , that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders -- only some more , some less ; and a few , being good fellows in the main , could neither be led nor driven any further ."
It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men .
"At last , however , the party was made up ."
"Six fellows were to stay on board , and the remaining thirteen , including Silver , began to embark ."
Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives .
"If six men were left by Silver , it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship ; and since only six were left , it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance ."
It occurred to me at once to go ashore .
"In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat , and almost at the same moment she shoved off ."
"No one took notice of me , only the bow oar saying , `` Is that you , Jim ?"
"`` Budge , you skulk ! ''"
cried Pew .
`` Dirk was a fool and a coward from the first -- you would n't mind him .
They must be close by ; they ca n't be far ; you have your hands on it .
"Scatter and look for them , dogs !"
"Oh , shiver my soul , '' he cried , `` if I had eyes ! ''"
"This appeal seemed to produce some effect , for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber , but half-heartedly , I thought , and with half an eye to their own danger all the time , while the rest stood irresolute on the road ."
"`` You have your hands on thousands , you fools , and you hang a leg !"
"You 'd be as rich as kings if you could find it , and you know it 's here , and you stand there skulking ."
"There was n't one of you dared face Bill , and I did it -- a blind man !"
And I 'm to lose my chance for you !
"I 'm to be a poor , crawling beggar , sponging for rum , when I might be rolling in a coach !"
If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still . ''
"`` Hang it , Pew , we 've got the doubloons ! ''"
grumbled one .
"`` They might have hid the blessed thing , '' said another ."
"`` Take the Georges , Pew , and do n't stand here squalling . ''"
"Squalling was the word for it ; Pew 's anger rose so high at these objections till at last , his passion completely taking the upper hand , he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one ."
"These , in their turn , cursed back at the blind miscreant , threatened him in horrid terms , and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp ."
"This quarrel was the saving of us , for while it was still raging , another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet -- the tramp of horses galloping ."
"Almost at the same time a pistol-shot , flash and report , came from the hedge side ."
"And that was plainly the last signal of danger , for the buccaneers turned at once and ran , separating in every direction , one seaward along the cove , one slant across the hill , and so on , so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew ."
"Him they had deserted , whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not ; but there he remained behind , tapping up and down the road in a frenzy , and groping and calling for his comrades ."
"Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me , towards the hamlet , crying , `` Johnny , Black Dog , Dirk , '' and other names , `` you wo n't leave old Pew , mates -- not old Pew ! ''"
"Just then the noise of horses topped the rise , and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope ."
"At this Pew saw his error , turned with a scream , and ran straight for the ditch , into which he rolled ."
"But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash , now utterly bewildered , right under the nearest of the coming horses ."
"The rider tried to save him , but in vain ."
Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night ; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by .
"He fell on his side , then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more ."
I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders .
"They were pulling up , at any rate , horrified at the accident ; and I soon saw what they were ."
"My eyes turned instinctively in that direction , and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine ."
"What it was , whether bear or man or monkey , I could in no wise tell ."
It seemed dark and shaggy ; more I knew not .
But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand .
"I was now , it seemed , cut off upon both sides ; behind me the murderers , before me this lurking nondescript ."
And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not .
"Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods , and I turned on my heel , and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder , began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats ."
"Instantly the figure reappeared , and making a wide circuit , began to head me off ."
"I was tired , at any rate ; but had I been as fresh as when I rose , I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary ."
"From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer , running manlike on two legs , but unlike any man that I had ever seen , stooping almost double as it ran ."
"Yet a man it was , I could no longer be in doubt about that ."
I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals .
I was within an ace of calling for help .
"But the mere fact that he was a man , however wild , had somewhat reassured me , and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion ."
"I stood still , therefore , and cast about for some method of escape ; and as I was so thinking , the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind ."
"As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless , courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him ."
"He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk ; but he must have been watching me closely , for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me ."
"Then he hesitated , drew back , came forward again , and at last , to my wonder and confusion , threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication ."
At that I once more stopped .
`` Who are you ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ben Gunn , '' he answered , and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward , like a rusty lock ."
"`` I 'm poor Ben Gunn , I am ; and I have n't spoke with a Christian these three years . ''"
I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing .
"His skin , wherever it was exposed , was burnt by the sun ; even his lips were black , and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face ."
"Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied , he was the chief for raggedness ."
"He was clothed with tatters of old ship 's canvas and old sea-cloth , and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings , brass buttons , bits of stick , and loops of tarry gaskin ."
"About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt , which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement ."
`` Three years ! ''
I cried .
`` Were you shipwrecked ? ''
"`` Nay , mate , '' said he ; `` marooned . ''"
"He was on the point of turning homeward , with an unreasoning sense of disappointment , when one of Lynde 's dogs broke down through the hedge of spruces , barking loudly ."
"Alan looked for Lynde to follow , but she did not , and he speedily saw that there was something unusual about the dog 's behaviour ."
"The animal circled around him , still barking excitedly , then ran off for a short distance , stopped , barked again , and returned , repeating the manoeuvre ."
"It was plain that he wanted Alan to follow him , and it occurred to the young minister that the dog 's mistress must be in danger of some kind ."
"Instantly he set off after him ; and the dog , with a final sharp bark of satisfaction , sprang up the low bank into the spruces ."
"Alan followed him across the peninsula and then along the further shore , which rapidly grew steep and high ."
"Half a mile down the cliffs were rocky and precipitous , while the beach beneath them was heaped with huge boulders ."
Alan followed the dog along one of the narrow paths with which the barrens abounded until nearly a mile from Four Winds .
"Then the animal halted , ran to the edge of the cliff and barked ."
"It was an ugly-looking place where a portion of the soil had evidently broken away recently , and Alan stepped cautiously out to the brink and looked down ."
He could not repress an exclamation of dismay and alarm .
"A few feet below him Lynde Oliver was lying on a mass of mossy soil which was apparently on the verge of slipping over a sloping shelf of rock , below which was a sheer drop of thirty feet to the cruel boulders below ."
"The extreme danger of her position was manifest at a glance ; the soil on which she lay was stationary , yet it seemed as if the slightest motion on her part would send it over the brink ."
"Lynde lay movelessly ; her face was white , and both fear and appeal were visible in her large dilated eyes ."
Yet she was quite calm and a faint smile crossed her pale lips as she saw the man and the dog .
"`` Good faithful Pat , so you did bring help , '' she said ."
"`` But how can I help you , Miss Oliver ? ''"
said Alan hoarsely .
`` I can not reach you -- and it looks as if the slightest touch or jar would send that broken earth over the brink . ''
`` I fear it would .
You must go back to Four Winds and get a rope . ''
`` And leave you here alone -- in such danger ? ''
`` Pat will stay with me .
"Besides , there is nothing else to do ."
You will find a rope in that little house where you put the water for Emily .
Father and Emily are away .
I think I am quite safe here if I do n't move at all . ''
"Alan 's own common sense told him that , as she said , there was nothing else to do and , much as he hated to leave her alone thus , he realized that he must lose no time in doing it ."
"`` I 'll be back as quickly as possible , '' he said hurriedly ."
Alan had been a noted runner at college and his muscles had not forgotten their old training .
"Yet it seemed to him an age ere he reached Four Winds , secured the rope , and returned ."
At every flying step he was haunted by the thought of the girl lying on the brink of the precipice and the fear that she might slip over it before he could rescue her .
Its name is Ben Alder .
"it is a wild , desert mountain full of hills and hollows , and if we can win to it before the morn , we may do yet . ''"
"`` But , Alan , '' cried I , `` that will take us across the very coming of the soldiers ! ''"
"`` I ken that fine , '' said he ; `` but if we are driven back on Appin , we are two dead men ."
"So now , David man , be brisk ! ''"
"With that he began to run forward on his hands and knees with an incredible quickness , as though it were his natural way of going ."
"All the time , too , he kept winding in and out in the lower parts of the moorland where we were the best concealed ."
"Some of these had been burned or at least scathed with fire ; and there rose in our faces -LRB- which were close to the ground -RRB- a blinding , choking dust as fine as smoke ."
"The water was long out ; and this posture of running on the hands and knees brings an overmastering weakness and weariness , so that the joints ache and the wrists faint under your weight ."
"Now and then , indeed , where was a big bush of heather , we lay awhile , and panted , and putting aside the leaves , looked back at the dragoons ."
"They had not spied us , for they held straight on ; a half-troop , I think , covering about two miles of ground , and beating it mighty thoroughly as they went ."
"I had awakened just in time ; a little later , and we must have fled in front of them , instead of escaping on one side ."
"Even as it was , the least misfortune might betray us ; and now and again , when a grouse rose out of the heather with a clap of wings , we lay as still as the dead and were afraid to breathe ."
"The aching and faintness of my body , the labouring of my heart , the soreness of my hands , and the smarting of my throat and eyes in the continual smoke of dust and ashes , had soon grown to be so unbearable that I would gladly have given up ."
Nothing but the fear of Alan lent me enough of a false kind of courage to continue .
"As for himself -LRB- and you are to bear in mind that he was cumbered with a great-coat -RRB- he had first turned crimson , but as time went on the redness began to be mingled with patches of white ; his breath cried and whistled as it came ; and his voice , when he whispered his observations in my ear during our halts , sounded like nothing human ."
"Yet he seemed in no way dashed in spirits , nor did he at all abate in his activity , so that I was driven to marvel at the man 's endurance ."
"At length , in the first gloaming of the night , we heard a trumpet sound , and looking back from among the heather , saw the troop beginning to collect ."
"A little after , they had built a fire and camped for the night , about the middle of the waste ."
At this I begged and besought that we might lie down and sleep .
`` There shall be no sleep the night ! ''
said Alan .
"`` From now on , these weary dragoons of yours will keep the crown of the muirland , and none will get out of Appin but winged fowls ."
"We got through in the nick of time , and shall we jeopard what we 've gained ?"
"Na , na , when the day comes , it shall find you and me in a fast place on Ben Alder . ''"
"`` Alan , '' I said , `` it 's not the want of will : it 's the strength that I want ."
"If I could , I would ; but as sure as I 'm alive I can not . ''"
"`` Very well , then , '' said Alan ."
`` I 'll carry ye . ''
"I looked to see if he were jesting ; but no , the little man was in dead earnest ; and the sight of so much resolution shamed me ."
`` Lead away ! ''
said I. `` I 'll follow . ''
"By these and many other tricks he soon became so celebrated that his fame reached the king 's ears , and his majesty was filled with curiosity to see the man who had managed to outwit everybody ."
So he commanded his guards to capture the young man and bring him before him .
"And when the young man stood before the king , the king spoke to him and said , ` By your tricks and the pranks that you have played on other people , you have , in the eye of the law , forfeited your life ."
"But on one condition I will spare you , and that is , if you will bring me the flying horse that belongs to the great dragon ."
"Fail in this , and you shall be hewn in a thousand pieces . '"
"` If that is all , ' said the youth , ` you shall soon have it . '"
So he went out and made his way straight to the stable where the flying horse was tethered .
"He stretched his hand cautiously out to seize the bridle , when the horse suddenly began to neigh as loud as he could ."
"Now the room in which the dragon slept was just above the stable , and at the sound of the neighing he woke and cried to the horse , ` What is the matter , my treasure ?"
is anything hurting you ? '
"After waiting a little while the young man tried again to loose the horse , but a second time it neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out to know why the horse was making such a noise ."
"But when the same thing happened the third time , the dragon lost his temper , and went down into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating ."
"This offended the horse and made him angry , and when the young man stretched out his hand to untie his head , he made no further fuss , but suffered himself to be led quietly away ."
"Once clear of the stable the young man sprang on his back and galloped off , calling over his shoulder , ` Hi !"
dragon !
dragon !
"if anyone asks you what has become of your horse , you can say that I have got him ! '"
"But the king said , ` The flying horse is all very well , but I want something more ."
"You must bring me the covering with the little bells that lies on the bed of the dragon , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '"
` Is that all ? '
answered the youth .
` That is easily done . '
And when night came he went away to the dragon 's house and climbed up on to the roof .
"Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down the chain from which the kettle usually hung , and tried to hook the bed covering and to draw it up ."
"But the little bells all began to ring , and the dragon woke and said to his wife , ` Wife , you have pulled off all the bed-clothes ! '"
"and drew the covering towards him , pulling , as he did so , the young man into the room ."
"Then the dragon flung himself on the youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot , ` To-morrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and cook him , and when I get back we will eat him together . '"
So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him .
"But as she untied the cords the better to get hold of him , the prisoner caught her by the legs , threw her to the ground , seized her and speedily cut her throat , just as she had been about to do for him , and put her body in the oven ."
Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to the king .
The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and spread out the covering with a deep bow .
"` That is not enough , ' said his majesty ; ` you must bring me the dragon himself , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '"
You had better go there and look for it ; I have no more time to waste . '
And he went his way .
"So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft , which was at the top of the storehouse , and there he found the wooden chest , so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces ."
` What use is this old thing to me ? '
he said to himself .
"` Oh , well , it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself ; so things might be worse after all . '"
"Placing the chest on his back , the man , whose name was Jose , set out for his inn , and , borrowing a hatchet , began to chop up the box ."
"In doing so he discovered a secret drawer , and in it lay a paper ."
"He opened the paper , not knowing what it might contain , and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father ."
"Putting the precious writing in his pocket , he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside , and he ran out at once in search of him ."
"The debtor proved to be an old miser , who lived at the other end of the village ."
"He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed , and , indeed , when he saw it , was very unwilling to pay what he owed ."
"However , the stranger threatened to drag him before the king , and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one ."
"The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket , and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man ."
"A few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town , when he met a poor woman crying bitterly ."
"He stopped and asked her what was the matter , and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying , and , to make matters worse , a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison ."
"` Comfort yourself , ' said the stranger kindly ; ` they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods ."
"I will not only pay his debts but , if he dies , the cost of his burial also ."
"And now go home , and nurse him as well as you can . '"
"And so she did ; but , in spite of her care , the husband died , and was buried by the stranger ."
"But everything cost more than he expected , and when all was paid he found that only three gold pieces were left ."
` What am I to do now ? '
said he to himself . '
"I think I had better go to court , and enter into the service of the king . '"
"At first he was only a servant , who carried the king the water for his bath , and saw that his bed was made in a particular fashion ."
"But he did his duties so well that his master soon took notice of him , and in a short time he rose to be a gentleman of the bedchamber ."
"Now , when this happened the younger brother had spent all the money he had inherited , and did not know how to make any for himself ."
"He then bethought him of the king 's favourite , and went whining to the palace to beg that his brother , whom he had so ill-used , would give him his protection , and find him a place ."
"The elder , who was always ready to help everyone spoke to the king on his behalf , and the next day the young man took up is work at court ."
"Unfortunately , the new-comer was by nature spiteful and envious , and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself ."
"By dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors , he learned that the king , old and ugly though he was , had fallen in love with the Princess Bella-Flor , who would have nothing to say to him , and had hidden herself in some mountain castle , no one knew where ."
"` That will do nicely , ' thought the scoundrel , rubbing his hands ."
"It stood wide open ; within , every corner of the pavement was crowded with fugitive burghers , surrounded by their families and laden with the most precious of their possessions , while , at the high altar , priests in full canonicals were imploring the mercy of God ."
"Even as Dick entered , the loud chorus began to thunder in the vaulted roofs ."
"He hurried through the groups of refugees , and came to the door of the stair that led into the steeple ."
And here a tall churchman stepped before him and arrested his advance .
"`` Whither , my son ? ''"
"he asked , severely ."
"`` My father , '' answered Dick , `` I am here upon an errand of expedition ."
Stay me not .
I command here for my Lord of Gloucester . ''
`` For my Lord of Gloucester ? ''
repeated the priest .
"`` Hath , then , the battle gone so sore ? ''"
"`` The battle , father , is at an end , Lancaster clean sped , my Lord of Risingham -- Heaven rest him !"
-- left upon the field .
"And now , with your good leave , I follow mine affairs . ''"
"And thrusting on one side the priest , who seemed stupefied at the news , Dick pushed open the door and rattled up the stairs four at a bound , and without pause or stumble , till he stepped upon the open platform at the top ."
"Shoreby Church tower not only commanded the town , as in a map , but looked far , on both sides , over sea and land ."
"It was now near upon noon ; the day exceeding bright , the snow dazzling ."
"And as Dick looked around him , he could measure the consequences of the battle ."
"A confused , growling uproar reached him from the streets , and now and then , but very rarely , the clash of steel ."
"Not a ship , not so much as a skiff remained in harbour ; but the sea was dotted with sails and row-boats laden with fugitives ."
"On shore , too , the surface of the snowy meadows was broken up with bands of horsemen , some cutting their way towards the borders of the forest , others , who were doubtless of the Yorkist side , stoutly interposing and beating them back upon the town ."
"Over all the open ground there lay a prodigious quantity of fallen men and horses , clearly defined upon the snow ."
"To complete the picture , those of the foot soldiers as had not found place upon a ship still kept up an archery combat on the borders of the port , and from the cover of the shoreside taverns ."
"In that quarter , also , one or two houses had been fired , and the smoke towered high in the frosty sunlight , and blew off to sea in voluminous folds ."
"Already close upon the margin of the woods , and somewhat in the line of Holywood , one particular clump of fleeing horsemen riveted the attention of the young watcher on the tower ."
"It was fairly numerous ; in no other quarter of the field did so many Lancastrians still hold together ; thus they had left a wide , discoloured wake upon the snow , and Dick was able to trace them step by step from where they had left the town ."
"While Dick stood watching them , they had gained , unopposed , the first fringe of the leafless forest , and , turning a little from their direction , the sun fell for a moment full on their array , as it was relieved against the dusky wood ."
`` Murrey and blue ! ''
cried Dick .
`` I swear it -- murrey and blue ! ''
The next moment he was descending the stairway .
"As soon as he saw this proclamation the boy called his sister , and they hastened to the palace ."
"The bird was buttoned inside his tunic , but , as might have been expected , the courtiers barred the way , and told the child that he could not enter ."
"It was in vain that the boy declared that he was only obeying the king 's commands ; the courtiers only replied that his majesty was not yet out of bed , and it was forbidden to wake him ."
"They were still talking , when , suddenly , the bird settled the question by flying upwards through an open window into the king 's own room ."
"Alighting on the pillow , close to the king 's head , she bowed respectfully , and said : ` My lord , I am the Bird of Truth whom you wished to see , and I have been obliged to approach you in the manner because the boy who brought me is kept out of the palace by your courtiers . '"
"` They shall pay for their insolence , ' said the king ."
"And he instantly ordered one of his attendants to conduct the boy at once to his apartments ; and in a moment more the prince entered , holding his sister by the hand ."
` Who are you ? '
asked the king ; ` and what has the Bird of Truth to do with you ? '
"` If it please your majesty , the Bird of Truth will explain that herself , ' answered the boy ."
And the bird did explain ; and the king heard for the first time of the wicked plot that had been successful for so many years .
"He took his children in his arms , with tears in his eyes , and hurried off with them to the tower in the mountains where the queen was shut up ."
"The poor woman was as white as marble , for she had been living almost in darkness ; but when she saw her husband and children , the colour came back to her face , and she was as beautiful as ever ."
"They all returned in state to the city , where great rejoicings were held ."
"The wicked courtiers had their heads cut off , and all their property was taken away ."
"As for the good old couple , they were given riches and honour , and were loved and cherished to the end of their lives ."
"The Mink and the Wolf -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-"
In a big forest in the north of America lived a quantity of wild animals of all sorts .
"They were always very polite when they met ; but , in spite of that , they kept a close watch one upon the other , as each was afraid of being killed and eaten by somebody else ."
But their manners were so good that no one would ever had guessed that .
"One day a smart young wolf went out to hunt , promising his grandfather and grandmother that he would be sure to be back before bedtime ."
"He trotted along quite happily through the forest till he came to a favourite place of his , just where the river runs into the sea ."
"There , just as he had hoped , he saw the chief mink fishing in a canoe . '"
"I want to fish too , ' cried the wolf ."
But the mink said nothing and pretended not to hear . '
I wish you would take me into your boat ! '
"shouted the wolf , louder than before , and he continued to beseech the mink so long that at last he grew tired of it , and paddled to the shore close enough for the wolf to jump in ."
"` Sit down quietly at that end or we shall be upset , ' said the mink ; ` and if you care about sea-urchins ' eggs , you will find plenty in that basket ."
"But be sure you eat only the white ones , for the red ones would kill you . '"
"So the wolf , who was always hungry , began to eat the eggs greedily ; and when he had finished he told the mink he thought he would have a nap ."
"` Well , then , stretch yourself out , and rest your head on that piece of wood , ' said the mink ."
"And the wolf did as he was bid , and was soon fast asleep ."
Hook -RSB- .
Instant obedience was the only safe thing .
Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings .
"The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy 's suspicions , but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready , which , against her will , she was making for him out of some of Hook 's wickedest garments ."
"It was afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook 's cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched , all but for the forefinger , which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook ."
"Instead of watching the ship , however , we must now return to that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago ."
It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time ; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us .
"If we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her , she would probably have cried , `` Do n't be silly ; what do I matter ?"
Do go back and keep an eye on the children . ''
So long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them ; and they may lay to -LSB- bet on -RSB- that .
Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful occupants are on their way home ; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not go out for the evening .
We are no more than servants .
"Why on earth should their beds be properly aired , seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry ?"
Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end in the country ?
It would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them ; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us .
"One thing I should like to do immensely , and that is to tell her , in the way authors have , that the children are coming back , that indeed they will be here on Thursday week ."
This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward .
"They have been planning it out on the ship : mother 's rapture , father 's shout of joy , Nana 's leap through the air to embrace them first , when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding ."
"How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance ; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth , and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly , `` Dash it all , here are those boys again . ''"
"However , we should get no thanks even for this ."
"We are beginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time , and may be sure that she would upbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure ."
"`` But , my dear madam , it is ten days till Thursday week ; so that by telling you what 's what , we can save you ten days of unhappiness . ''"
"`` Yes , but at what a cost !"
By depriving the children of ten minutes of delight . ''
"`` Oh , if you look at it in that way ! ''"
`` What other way is there in which to look at it ? ''
"You see , the woman had no proper spirit ."
"I had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about her ; but I despise her , and not one of them will I say now ."
"She does not really need to be told to have things ready , for they are ready ."
"All the beds are aired , and she never leaves the house , and observe , the window is open ."
"For all the use we are to her , we might well go back to the ship ."
"However , as we are here we may as well stay and look on ."
Sidney liked the letter and answered it .
Since then they had written to each other regularly .
"There was nothing sentimental , hinted at or implied , in the correspondence ."
"Whatever the faults of Sidney 's romantic visions were , they did not tend to precocious flirtation ."
"The Plainfield boys , attracted by her beauty and repelled by her indifference and aloofness , could have told that ."
"She never expected to meet John Lincoln , nor did she wish to do so ."
In the correspondence itself she found her pleasure .
"John Lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the far western plains , so alien and remote from snug , humdrum Plainfield life that Sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she opened a letter from the Bar N ."
"As for Sidney 's own letter , this is the way it read as she wrote it : `` The Evergreens , '' Plainfield ."
Dear Mr. Lincoln : The very best letter I can write in the half-hour before the carriage will be at the door to take me to Mrs. Braddon 's dance shall be yours tonight .
"I am sitting here in the library arrayed in my smartest , newest , whitest , silkiest gown , with a string of pearls which Uncle James gave me today about my throat -- the dear , glistening , sheeny things !"
And I am looking forward to the `` dances and delight '' of the evening with keen anticipation .
You asked me in your last letter if I did not sometimes grow weary of my endless round of dances and dinners and social functions .
"No , no , never !"
"I enjoy every one of them , every minute of them ."
"I love life and its bloom and brilliancy ; I love meeting new people ; I love the ripple of music , the hum of laughter and conversation ."
Every morning when I awaken the new day seems to me to be a good fairy who will bring me some beautiful gift of joy .
The gift she gave me today was my sunset gallop on my grey mare Lady .
The thrill of it is in my veins yet .
"I distanced the others who rode with me and led the homeward canter alone , rocking along a dark , gleaming road , shadowy with tall firs and pines , whose balsam made all the air resinous around me ."
"Before me was a long valley filled with purple dusk , and beyond it meadows of sunset and great lakes of saffron and rose where a soul might lose itself in colour ."
"On my right was the harbour , silvered over with a rising moon ."
"Oh , it was all glorious -- the clear air with its salt-sea tang , the aroma of the pines , the laughter of my friends behind me , the spring and rhythm of Lady 's grey satin body beneath me !"
"I wanted to ride on so forever , straight into the heart of the sunset ."
Then home and to dinner .
"We have a houseful of guests at present -- one of them an old statesman with a massive silver head , and eyes that have looked into people 's thoughts so long that you have an uncanny feeling that they can see right through your soul and read motives you dare not avow even to yourself ."
"I was terribly in awe of him at first , but when I got acquainted with him I found him charming ."
He is not above talking delightful nonsense even to a girl .
"I sat by him at dinner , and he talked to me -- not nonsense , either , this time ."
He told me of his political contests and diplomatic battles ; he was wise and witty and whimsical .
"I felt as if I were drinking some rare , stimulating mental wine ."
What a privilege it is to meet such men and take a peep through their wise eyes at the fascinating game of empire-building !
When Sara was fifteen she had gone away to school .
Jeff had missed her sorely .
"For four years he saw her only in the summers , and each year she had seemed taller , statelier , further from him ."
"When she graduated her father took her abroad for two years ; then she came home , a lovely , high-bred girl , dimpling on the threshold of womanhood ; and Jeffrey Miller was face to face with two bitter facts ."
"One was that he loved her -- not with the boy-and-girl love of long ago , but with the love of a man for the one woman in the world ; and the other was that she was as far beyond his reach as one of those sunset stars of which she had always reminded him in her pure , clear-shining loveliness ."
"He looked these facts unflinchingly in the face until he had grown used to them , and then he laid down his course for himself ."
"He loved Sara -- and he did not wish to conquer his love , even if it had been possible ."
"It were better to love her , whom he could never win , than to love and be loved by any other woman ."
"His great office in life was to be her friend , humble and unexpectant ; to be at hand if she should need him for ever so trifling a service ; never to presume , always to be faithful ."
Sara had not forgotten her old friend .
"But their former comradeship was now impossible ; they could be friends , but never again companions ."
"Sara 's life was full and gay ; she had interests in which he had no share ; her social world was utterly apart from his ; she was of the hill and its traditions , he was of the valley and its people ."
"The democracy of childhood past , there was no common ground on which they might meet ."
Only one thing Jeffrey had found it impossible to contemplate calmly .
"Some day Sara would marry -- a man who was her equal , who sat at her father 's table as a guest ."
"In spite of himself , Jeffrey 's heart filled with hot rebellion at the thought ; it was like a desecration and a robbery ."
"But , as the years went by , this thing he dreaded did not happen ."
"Sara did not marry , although gossip assigned her many suitors not unworthy of her ."
"She and Jeffrey were always friends , although they met but seldom ."
Sometimes she sent him a book ; it was his custom to search for the earliest mayflowers and take them to her ; once in a long while they met and talked of many things .
"Jeffrey 's calendar from year to year was red-lettered by these small happenings , of which nobody knew , or , knowing , would have cared ."
"So he and Sara drifted out of youth , together yet apart ."
"Her mother had died , and Sara was the gracious , stately mistress of Pinehurst , which grew quieter as the time went on ; the lovers ceased to come , and holiday friends grew few ; with the old colonel 's failing health the gaieties and lavish entertaining ceased ."
"Jeffrey thought that Sara must often be lonely , but she never said so ; she remained sweet , serene , calm-eyed , like the child he had met on the hill ."
"Only , now and then , Jeffrey fancied he saw a shadow on her face -- a shadow so faint and fleeting that only the eye of an unselfish , abiding love , made clear-sighted by patient years , could have seen it ."
"It hurt him , that shadow ; he would have given anything in his power to have banished it ."
And now this long friendship was to be broken .
Sara was going away .
"At first he had thought only of her pain , but now his own filled his heart ."
How could he live without her ?
How could he dwell in the valley knowing that she had gone from the hill ?
Never to see her light shine down on him through the northern gap in the pines at night !
"` Oh , heaven , help me ! '"
cried he .
` Cross !
cross ! '
answered a voice .
"The boy leapt for joy as he recognised the note of the owl of which the swallow had spoken , and he said softly in the bird 's language : ` Oh , wise owl , I pray you to protect and guide me , for I have come in search of the Bird of Truth ."
And first I must fill this far with the many-coloured water in the courtyard of the castle . '
"` Do not do that , ' answered the owl , ` but fill the jar from the spring which bubbles close by the fountain with the many-coloured water ."
"Afterwards , go into the aviary opposite the great door , but be careful not to touch any of the bright-plumaged birds contained in it , which will cry to you , each one , that he is the Bird of Truth ."
"Choose only a small white bird that is hidden in a corner , which the others try incessantly to kill , not knowing that it can not die ."
"And , be quick !"
"-- for at this very moment the giant has fallen asleep , and you have only a quarter of an hour to do everything . '"
"The boy ran as fast as he could and entered the courtyard , where he saw the two spring close together ."
"He passed by the many-coloured water without casting a glance at it , and filled the jar from the fountain whose water was clear and pure ."
"He next hastened to the aviary , and was almost deafened by the clamour that rose as he shut the door behind him ."
"Voices of peacocks , voices of ravens , voices of magpies , each claiming to be the Bird of Truth ."
"With steadfast face the boy walked by them all , to the corner , where , hemmed in by a hand of fierce crows , was the small white bird he sought ."
"Putting her safely in his breast , he passed out , followed by the screams of the birds of Bad Faith which he left behind him ."
"Once outside , he ran without stopping to the witch 's tower , and handed to the old woman the jar she had given him ."
` Become a parrot ! '
"cried she , flinging the water over him ."
"But instead of losing his shape , as so many had done before , he only grew ten times handsomer ; for the water was enchanted for good and not ill ."
"Then the creeping multitude around the witch hastened to roll themselves in the water , and stood up , human beings again ."
"When the witch saw what was happening , she took a broomstick and flew away ."
"Who can guess the delight of the sister at the sight of her brother , bearing the Bird of Truth ?"
"But although the boy had accomplished much , something very difficult yet remained , and that was how to carry the Bird of Truth to the king without her being seized by the wicked courtiers , who would be ruined by the discovery of their plot ."
"Soon -- no one knew how -- the news spread abroad that the Bird of Truth was hovering round the palace , and the courtiers made all sorts of preparations to hinder her reaching the king ."
"They got ready weapons that were sharpened , and weapons that were poisoned ; they sent for eagles and falcons to hunt her down , and constructed cages and boxes in which to shut her up if they were not able to kill her ."
They declared that her white plumage was really put on to hide her black feathers -- in fact there was nothing they did not do in order to prevent the king from seeing the bird or from paying attention to her words if he did .
"As often happens in these cases , the courtiers brought about that which they feared ."
"They talked so much about the Bird of Truth that at last the king heard of it , and expressed a wish to see her ."
"The more difficulties that were put in his way the stronger grew his desire , and in the end the king published a proclamation that whoever found the Bird of Truth should bring her to him without delay ."
`` But this would seem to involve my meeting the man Thomson ? ''
"says he , when I had done ."
"`` I think so , indeed , sir , '' said I. `` Dear doctor ! ''"
"cries he , rubbing his brow ."
`` Dear doctor !
"No , Mr. David , I am afraid your scheme is inadmissible ."
"I say nothing against your friend , Mr. Thomson : I know nothing against him ; and if I did -- mark this , Mr. David !"
-- it would be my duty to lay hands on him .
Now I put it to you : is it wise to meet ?
He may have matters to his charge .
He may not have told you all .
His name may not be even Thomson ! ''
"cries the lawyer , twinkling ; `` for some of these fellows will pick up names by the roadside as another would gather haws . ''"
"`` You must be the judge , sir , '' said I ."
"But it was clear my plan had taken hold upon his fancy , for he kept musing to himself till we were called to dinner and the company of Mrs. Rankeillor ; and that lady had scarce left us again to ourselves and a bottle of wine , ere he was back harping on my proposal ."
"When and where was I to meet my friend Mr. Thomson ; was I sure of Mr. T. 's discretion ; supposing we could catch the old fox tripping , would I consent to such and such a term of an agreement -- these and the like questions he kept asking at long intervals , while he thoughtfully rolled his wine upon his tongue ."
"When I had answered all of them , seemingly to his contentment , he fell into a still deeper muse , even the claret being now forgotten ."
"Then he got a sheet of paper and a pencil , and set to work writing and weighing every word ; and at last touched a bell and had his clerk into the chamber ."
"`` Torrance , '' said he , `` I must have this written out fair against to-night ; and when it is done , you will be so kind as put on your hat and be ready to come along with this gentleman and me , for you will probably be wanted as a witness . ''"
"`` What , sir , '' cried I , as soon as the clerk was gone , `` are you to venture it ? ''"
"`` Why , so it would appear , '' says he , filling his glass ."
`` But let us speak no more of business .
"The very sight of Torrance brings in my head a little droll matter of some years ago , when I had made a tryst with the poor oaf at the cross of Edinburgh ."
"Each had gone his proper errand ; and when it came four o'clock , Torrance had been taking a glass and did not know his master , and I , who had forgot my spectacles , was so blind without them , that I give you my word I did not know my own clerk . ''"
And thereupon he laughed heartily .
"I said it was an odd chance , and smiled out of politeness ; but what held me all the afternoon in wonder , he kept returning and dwelling on this story , and telling it again with fresh details and laughter ; so that I began at last to be quite put out of countenance and feel ashamed for my friend 's folly ."
"Towards the time I had appointed with Alan , we set out from the house , Mr. Rankeillor and I arm in arm , and Torrance following behind with the deed in his pocket and a covered basket in his hand ."
"All through the town , the lawyer was bowing right and left , and continually being button-holed by gentlemen on matters of burgh or private business ; and I could see he was one greatly looked up to in the county ."
"At last we were clear of the houses , and began to go along the side of the haven and towards the Hawes Inn and the Ferry pier , the scene of my misfortune ."
"I could not look upon the place without emotion , recalling how many that had been there with me that day were now no more : Ransome taken , I could hope , from the evil to come ; Shuan passed where I dared not follow him ; and the poor souls that had gone down with the brig in her last plunge ."
"All these , and the brig herself , I had outlived ; and come through these hardships and fearful perils without scath ."
My only thought should have been of gratitude ; and yet I could not behold the place without sorrow for others and a chill of recollected fear .
"And now , '' said she when I had done so , `` we have to get the key off THAT ; and who 's to touch it , I should like to know ! ''"
and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words .
I went down on my knees at once .
"On the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper , blackened on the one side ."
"I could not doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT ; and taking it up , I found written on the other side , in a very good , clear hand , this short message : `` You have till ten tonight . ''"
"`` He had till ten , Mother , '' said I ; and just as I said it , our old clock began striking ."
"This sudden noise startled us shockingly ; but the news was good , for it was only six ."
"`` Now , Jim , '' she said , `` that key . ''"
"I felt in his pockets , one after another ."
"A few small coins , a thimble , and some thread and big needles , a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end , his gully with the crooked handle , a pocket compass , and a tinder box were all that they contained , and I began to despair ."
"`` Perhaps it 's round his neck , '' suggested my mother ."
"Overcoming a strong repugnance , I tore open his shirt at the neck , and there , sure enough , hanging to a bit of tarry string , which I cut with his own gully , we found the key ."
At this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival .
"It was like any other seaman 's chest on the outside , the initial `` B '' burned on the top of it with a hot iron , and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long , rough usage ."
"`` Give me the key , '' said my mother ; and though the lock was very stiff , she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling ."
"A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior , but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes , carefully brushed and folded ."
"They had never been worn , my mother said ."
"Under that , the miscellany began -- a quadrant , a tin canikin , several sticks of tobacco , two brace of very handsome pistols , a piece of bar silver , an old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make , a pair of compasses mounted with brass , and five or six curious West Indian shells ."
"I have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering , guilty , and hunted life ."
"In the meantime , we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets , and neither of these were in our way ."
"Underneath there was an old boat-cloak , whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar ."
"My mother pulled it up with impatience , and there lay before us , the last things in the chest , a bundle tied up in oilcloth , and looking like papers , and a canvas bag that gave forth , at a touch , the jingle of gold ."
"`` I 'll show these rogues that I 'm an honest woman , '' said my mother ."
"`` I 'll have my dues , and not a farthing over ."
Hold Mrs. Crossley 's bag . ''
And she began to count over the amount of the captain 's score from the sailor 's bag into the one that I was holding .
"It was a long , difficult business , for the coins were of all countries and sizes -- doubloons , and louis d'ors , and guineas , and pieces of eight , and I know not what besides , all shaken together at random ."
"The guineas , too , were about the scarcest , and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count ."
"When we were about half-way through , I suddenly put my hand upon her arm , for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth -- the tap-tapping of the blind man 's stick upon the frozen road ."
"It drew nearer and nearer , while we sat holding our breath ."
"Then it struck sharp on the inn door , and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter ; and then there was a long time of silence both within and without ."
"At last the tapping recommenced , and , to our indescribable joy and gratitude , died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard ."
`` But I will be cruelly avenged .
"I will tell a secret to my Lady Shelton -- she that is to be , '' she added , curtseying ."
"`` Joanna , '' she continued , `` I believe , upon my soul , your sweetheart is a bold fellow in a fight , but he is , let me tell you plainly , the softest-hearted simpleton in England ."
Go to -- ye may do your pleasure with him !
"And now , fool children , first kiss me , either one of you , for luck and kindness ; and then kiss each other just one minute by the glass , and not one second longer ; and then let us all three set forth for Holywood as fast as we can stir ; for these woods , methinks , are full of peril and exceeding cold . ''"
`` But did my Dick make love to you ? ''
"asked Joanna , clinging to her sweetheart 's side ."
"`` Nay , fool girl , '' returned Alicia ; `` it was I made love to him ."
"I offered to marry him , indeed ; but he bade me go marry with my likes ."
These were his words .
"Nay , that I will say : he is more plain than pleasant ."
"But now , children , for the sake of sense , set forward ."
"Shall we go once more over the dingle , or push straight for Holywood ? ''"
"`` Why , '' said Dick , `` I would like dearly to get upon a horse ; for I have been sore mauled and beaten , one way and another , these last days , and my poor body is one bruise ."
But how think ye ?
"If the men , upon the alarm of the fighting , had fled away , we should have gone about for nothing ."
"'T is but some three short miles to Holywood direct ; the bell hath not beat nine ; the snow is pretty firm to walk upon , the moon clear ; how if we went even as we are ? ''"
"`` Agreed , '' cried Alicia ; but Joanna only pressed upon Dick 's arm ."
"Forth , then , they went , through open leafless groves and down snow-clad alleys , under the white face of the winter moon ; Dick and Joanna walking hand in hand and in a heaven of pleasure ; and their light-minded companion , her own bereavements heartily forgotten , followed a pace or two behind , now rallying them upon their silence , and now drawing happy pictures of their future and united lives ."
"Still , indeed , in the distance of the wood , the riders of Tunstall might be heard urging their pursuit ; and from time to time cries or the clash of steel announced the shock of enemies ."
"But in these young folk , bred among the alarms of war , and fresh from such a multiplicity of dangers , neither fear nor pity could be lightly wakened ."
"Content to find the sounds still drawing farther and farther away , they gave up their hearts to the enjoyment of the hour , walking already , as Alicia put it , in a wedding procession ; and neither the rude solitude of the forest , nor the cold of the freezing night , had any force to shadow or distract their happiness ."
"At length , from a rising hill , they looked below them on the dell of Holywood ."
"The great windows of the forest abbey shone with torch and candle ; its high pinnacles and spires arose very clear and silent , and the gold rood upon the topmost summit glittered brightly in the moon ."
"All about it , in the open glade , camp-fires were burning , and the ground was thick with huts ; and across the midst of the picture the frozen river curved ."
"`` By the mass , '' said Richard , `` there are Lord Foxham 's fellows still encamped ."
The messenger hath certainly miscarried .
"Well , then , so better ."
We have power at hand to face Sir Daniel . ''
"But if Lord Foxham 's men still lay encamped in the long holm at Holywood , it was from a different reason from the one supposed by Dick ."
"They had marched , indeed , for Shoreby ; but ere they were half way thither , a second messenger met them , and bade them return to their morning 's camp , to bar the road against Lancastrian fugitives , and to be so much nearer to the main army of York ."
"For Richard of Gloucester , having finished the battle and stamped out his foes in that district , was already on the march to rejoin his brother ; and not long after the return of my Lord Foxham 's retainers , Crookback himself drew rein before the abbey door ."
"A dense forest lay all round the cottage , and there was hardly a path or a tree in the whole wood that was not familiar to the peasant from his boyhood ."
"In one of his wanderings he had made friends with a hare , and many an hour the two passed together , when the man was resting by the roadside , eating his dinner ."
"Now this strange friendship was observed by the Tanuki , a wicked , quarrelsome beast , who hated the peasant , and was never tired of doing him an ill turn ."
"Again and again he had crept to the hut , and finding some choice morsel put away for the little hare , had either eaten it if he thought it nice , or trampled it to pieces so that no one else should get it , and at last the peasant lost patience , and made up his mind he would have the Tanuki 's blood ."
"So for many days the man lay hidden , waiting for the Tanuki to come by , and when one morning he marched up the road thinking of nothing but the dinner he was going to steal , the peasant threw himself upon him and bound his four legs tightly , so that he could not move ."
"Then he dragged his enemy joyfully to the house , feeling that at length he had got the better of the mischievous beast which had done him so many ill turns ."
"` He shall pay for them with his skin , ' he said to his wife ."
"` We will first kill him , and then cook him . '"
"So saying , he hanged the Tanuki , head downwards , to a beam , and went out to gather wood for a fire ."
Meanwhile the old woman was standing at the mortar pounding the rise that was to serve them for the week with a pestle that made her arms ache with its weight .
"Suddenly she heard something whining and weeping in the corner , and , stopping her work , she looked round to see what it was ."
"That was all that the rascal wanted , and he put on directly his most humble air , and begged the woman in his softest voice to loosen his bonds , which her hurting him sorely ."
"She was filled with pity for him , but did not dare to set him free , as she knew that her husband would be very angry ."
"The Tanuki , however , did not despair , and seeing that her heart was softened , began his prayers anew ."
"` He only asked to have his bonds taken from him , ' he said ."
"` He would give his word not to attempt to escape , and if he was once set free he could soon pound her rice for her . '"
"` Then you can have a little rest , ' he went on , ` for rice pounding is very tiring work , and not at all fit for weak women . '"
"These last words melted the good woman completely , and she unfastened the bonds that held him ."
Poor foolish creature !
"In one moment the Tanuki had seized her , stripped off all her clothes , and popped her in the mortar ."
"In a few minutes more she was pounded as fine as the rice ; and not content with that , the Tanuki placed a pot on the hearth and made ready to cook the peasant a dinner from the flesh of his own wife !"
"When everything was complete he looked out of the door , and saw the old man coming from the forest carrying a large bundle of wood ."
"Quick as lightning the Tanuki not only put on the woman 's clothes , but , as he was a magician , assumed her form as well ."
"Then he took the wood , kindled the fire , and very soon set a large dinner before the old man , who was very hungry , and had forgotten for the moment all about his enemy ."
"But when the Tanuki saw that he had eaten his fill and would be thinking about his prisoner , he hastily shook off the clothes behind a door and took his own shape ."
"Then he said to the peasant , ` You are a nice sort of person to seize animals and to talk of killing them !"
You are caught in your own net .
"It is your own wife that you have eaten , and if you want to find her bones you have only to look under the floor . '"
With these words he turned and made for the forest .
"The old peasant grew cold with horror as he listened , and seemed frozen to the place where he stood ."
"When he had recovered himself a little , he collected the bones of his dead wife , buried them in the garden , and swore over the grave to be avenged on the Tanuki ."
"After everything was done he sat himself down in his lonely cottage and wept bitterly , and the bitterest thought of all was that he would never be able to forget that he had eaten his own wife ."
"says I , quite cheerily ; but I was thinking in to myself : `` O , man , if you would only take one point of the compass and let me take any other , it would be the best for both of us . ''"
"`` Well , then , east , ye see , we have the muirs , '' said Alan ."
"`` Once there , David , it 's mere pitch-and-toss ."
"Out on yon bald , naked , flat place , where can a body turn to ?"
"Let the red-coats come over a hill , they can spy you miles away ; and the sorrow 's in their horses ' heels , they would soon ride you down ."
"It 's no good place , David ; and I 'm free to say , it 's worse by daylight than by dark . ''"
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` hear my way of it ."
"Appin 's death for us ; we have none too much money , nor yet meal ; the longer they seek , the nearer they may guess where we are ; it 's all a risk ; and I give my word to go ahead until we drop . ''"
Alan was delighted .
"`` There are whiles , '' said he , `` when ye are altogether too canny and Whiggish to be company for a gentleman like me ; but there come other whiles when ye show yoursel ' a mettle spark ; and it 's then , David , that I love ye like a brother . ''"
"The mist rose and died away , and showed us that country lying as waste as the sea ; only the moorfowl and the pewees crying upon it , and far over to the east , a herd of deer , moving like dots ."
"Much of it was red with heather ; much of the rest broken up with bogs and hags and peaty pools ; some had been burnt black in a heath fire ; and in another place there was quite a forest of dead firs , standing like skeletons ."
"A wearier-looking desert man never saw ; but at least it was clear of troops , which was our point ."
"We went down accordingly into the waste , and began to make our toilsome and devious travel towards the eastern verge ."
"There were the tops of mountains all round -LRB- you are to remember -RRB- from whence we might be spied at any moment ; so it behoved us to keep in the hollow parts of the moor , and when these turned aside from our direction to move upon its naked face with infinite care ."
"Sometimes , for half an hour together , we must crawl from one heather bush to another , as hunters do when they are hard upon the deer ."
"It was a clear day again , with a blazing sun ; the water in the brandy bottle was soon gone ; and altogether , if I had guessed what it would be to crawl half the time upon my belly and to walk much of the rest stooping nearly to the knees , I should certainly have held back from such a killing enterprise ."
"Toiling and resting and toiling again , we wore away the morning ; and about noon lay down in a thick bush of heather to sleep ."
Alan took the first watch ; and it seemed to me I had scarce closed my eyes before I was shaken up to take the second .
"We had no clock to go by ; and Alan stuck a sprig of heath in the ground to serve instead ; so that as soon as the shadow of the bush should fall so far to the east , I might know to rouse him ."
"But I was by this time so weary that I could have slept twelve hours at a stretch ; I had the taste of sleep in my throat ; my joints slept even when my mind was waking ; the hot smell of the heather , and the drone of the wild bees , were like possets to me ; and every now and again I would give a jump and find I had been dozing ."
"The last time I woke I seemed to come back from farther away , and thought the sun had taken a great start in the heavens ."
"I looked at the sprig of heath , and at that I could have cried aloud : for I saw I had betrayed my trust ."
"My head was nearly turned with fear and shame ; and at what I saw , when I looked out around me on the moor , my heart was like dying in my body ."
"For sure enough , a body of horse-soldiers had come down during my sleep , and were drawing near to us from the south-east , spread out in the shape of a fan and riding their horses to and fro in the deep parts of the heather ."
"When I waked Alan , he glanced first at the soldiers , then at the mark and the position of the sun , and knitted his brows with a sudden , quick look , both ugly and anxious , which was all the reproach I had of him ."
`` What are we to do now ? ''
I asked .
"`` We 'll have to play at being hares , '' said he ."
`` Do ye see yon mountain ? ''
pointing to one on the north-eastern sky .
"`` Ay , '' said I. `` Well , then , '' says he , `` let us strike for that ."
"`` Yes , it 's quite true ."
And of course we made up our minds to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of duty and all that .
"But now , thank goodness , there is no need of such wholesale immolation ."
So just let 's forgive each other . ''
"`` Oh , '' sighed Edith happily , `` it is almost too good to be true . ''"
"`` It is really providentially ordered , is n't it ? ''"
said Katherine .
"`` Ned and I would never have got on together in the world , and you and Sidney would have bored each other to death ."
"As it is , there will be four perfectly happy people instead of four miserable ones ."
I 'll tell Ned so tomorrow . ''
Four Winds Alan Douglas threw down his pen with an impatient exclamation .
"It was high time his next Sunday 's sermon was written , but he could not concentrate his thoughts on his chosen text ."
"For one thing he did not like it and had selected it only because Elder Trewin , in his call of the evening before , had hinted that it was time for a good stiff doctrinal discourse , such as his predecessor in Rexton , the Rev. Jabez Strong , had delighted in ."
"Alan hated doctrines -- `` the soul 's staylaces , '' he called them -- but Elder Trewin was a man to be reckoned with and Alan preached an occasional sermon to please him ."
"`` It 's no use , '' he said wearily ."
"`` I could have written a sermon in keeping with that text in November or midwinter , but now , when the whole world is reawakening in a miracle of beauty and love , I ca n't do it ."
"If a northeast rainstorm does n't set in before next Sunday , Mr. Trewin will not have his sermon ."
"I shall take as my text instead , ` The flowers appear on the earth , the time of the singing of birds has come . ' ''"
"He rose and went to his study window , outside of which a young vine was glowing in soft tender green tints , its small dainty leaves casting quivering shadows on the opposite wall where the portrait of Alan 's mother hung ."
"She had a fine , strong , sweet face ; the same face , cast in a masculine mould , was repeated in her son , and the resemblance was striking as he stood in the searching evening sunshine ."
"The black hair grew around his forehead in the same way ; his eyes were steel blue , like hers , with a similar expression , half brooding , half tender , in their depths ."
"He had the mobile , smiling mouth of the picture , but his chin was deeper and squarer , dented with a dimple which , combined with a certain occasional whimsicality of opinion and glance , had caused Elder Trewin some qualms of doubt regarding the fitness of this young man for his high and holy vocation ."
"The Rev. Jabez Strong had never indulged in dimples or jokes ; but then , as Elder Trewin , being a just man , had to admit , the Rev. Jabez Strong had preached many a time and oft to more empty pews than full ones , while now the church was crowded to its utmost capacity on Sundays and people came to hear Mr. Douglas who had not darkened a church door for years ."
"All things considered , Elder Trewin decided to overlook the dimple ."
There was sure to be some drawback in every minister .
"Alan from his study looked down on all the length of the Rexton valley , at the head of which the manse was situated , and thought that Eden might have looked so in its innocence , for all the orchards were abloom and the distant hills were tremulous and aerial in springtime gauzes of pale purple and pearl ."
"But in any garden , despite its beauty , is an element of tameness and domesticity , and Alan 's eyes , after a moment 's delighted gazing , strayed wistfully off to the north where the hills broke away into a long sloping lowland of pine and fir ."
"Beyond it stretched the wide expanse of the lake , flashing in the molten gold and crimson of evening ."
Its lure was irresistible .
Alan had been born and bred beside a faraway sea and the love of it was strong in his heart -- so strong that he knew he must go back to it sometime .
"Meanwhile , the great lake , mimicking the sea in its vast expanse and the storms that often swept over it , was his comfort and solace ."
"As often as he could he stole away to its wild and lonely shore , leaving the snug bounds of cultivated home lands behind him with something like a sense of relief ."
"Now they knew why they lined their nests with mud , and when Mrs. Finch called out , ` We do n't place our nests on the Serpentine , ' they did what they should have done at first -- chased her from the meeting ."
After this it was most orderly .
"What they had been brought together to hear , said Solomon , was this : their young friend , Peter Pan , as they well knew , wanted very much to be able to cross to the Gardens , and he now proposed , with their help , to build a boat ."
"At this the thrushes began to fidget , which made Peter tremble for his scheme ."
Solomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the cumbrous boats that humans use ; the proposed boat was to be simply a thrush 's nest large enough to hold Peter .
"But still , to Peter 's agony , the thrushes were sulky ."
"` We are very busy people , ' they grumbled , ` and this would be a big job . '"
"` Quite so , ' said Solomon , ` and , of course , Peter would not allow you to work for nothing ."
"You must remember that he is now in comfortable circumstances , and he will pay you such wages as you have never been paid before ."
Peter Pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid sixpence a day . '
"Then all the thrushes hopped for joy , and that very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat ."
All their ordinary business fell into arrears .
"It was the time of the year when they should have been pairing , but not a thrush 's nest was built except this big one , and so Solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland ."
"The stout , rather greedy children , who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk , were all young thrushes once , and ladies often ask specially for them ."
What do you think Solomon did ?
"He sent over to the house-tops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes ' nests , and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes !"
"It was known afterwards on the island as the Sparrows ' Year ; and so , when you meet grown-up people in the Gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are , very likely they belong to that year ."
You ask them .
"-LSB- Illustration : When you meet grown-up people in the Gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are -RSB- Peter was a just master , and paid his work-people every evening ."
"They stood in rows on the branches , waiting politely while he cut the paper sixpences out of his bank-note , and presently he called the roll , and then each bird , as the names were mentioned , flew down and got sixpence ."
It must have been a fine sight .
"And at last , after months of labour , the boat was finished ."
O the glory of Peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great thrush 's nest !
"From the very beginning of the building of it he slept by its side , and often woke up to say sweet things to it , and after it was lined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it ."
"He sleeps in his nest still , and has a fascinating way of curling round in it , for it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a kitten ."
"It is brown inside , of course , but outside it is mostly green , being woven of grass and twigs , and when these wither or snap the walls are thatched afresh ."
"There are also a few feathers here and there , which came off the thrushes while they were building ."
"The other birds were extremely jealous , and said that the boat would not balance on the water , but it lay most beautifully steady ; they said the water would come into it , but no water came into it ."
"Next they said that Peter had no oars , and this caused the thrushes to look at each other in dismay ; but Peter replied that he had no need of oars , for he had a sail , and with such a proud , happy face he produced a sail which he had fashioned out of his nightgown , and though it was still rather like a nightgown it made a lovely sail ."
"And that night , the moon being full , and all the birds asleep , he did enter his coracle -LRB- as Master Francis Pretty would have said -RRB- and depart out of the island ."
"And first , he knew not why , he looked upward , with his hands clasped , and from that moment his eyes were pinned to the west ."
"He had promised the thrushes to begin by making short voyages , with them as his guides , but far away he saw the Kensington Gardens beckoning to him beneath the bridge , and he could not wait ."
"Charmed by this suggestion , the children arranged the doomed village , laid a line of coals along the main street , and then sat down to watch the conflagration ."
"It was somewhat slow to kindle owing to the paint , but at last one ambitious little cottage blazed up , fired a tree of the palm species , which fell on to the roof of a large family mansion , and in a few minutes the whole town was burning merrily ."
"The wooden population stood and stared at the destruction like blockheads , as they were , till they also caught and blazed away without a cry ."
"It took some time to reduce the town to ashes , and the lookers-on enjoyed the spectacle immensely , cheering as each house fell , dancing like wild Indians when the steeple flamed aloft , and actually casting one wretched little churn-shaped lady , who had escaped to the suburbs , into the very heart of the fire ."
"The superb success of this last offering excited Teddy to such a degree , that he first threw his lamb into the conflagration , and before it had time even to roast , he planted poor Annabella on the funeral pyre ."
"Of course she did not like it , and expressed her anguish and resentment in a way that terrified her infant destroyer ."
"Being covered with kid , she did not blaze , but did what was worse , she squirmed ."
"First one leg curled up , then the other , in a very awful and lifelike manner ; next she flung her arms over her head as if in great agony ; her head itself turned on her shoulders , her glass eyes fell out , and with one final writhe of her whole body , she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins of the town ."
This unexpected demonstration startled every one and frightened Teddy half out of his little wits .
"He looked , then screamed and fled toward the house , roaring `` Marmar '' at the top of his voice ."
"Mrs. Bhaer heard the outcry and ran to the rescue , but Teddy could only cling to her and pour out in his broken way something about `` poor Bella hurted , '' `` a dreat fire , '' and `` all the dollies dorn . ''"
"Fearing some dire mishap , his mother caught him up and hurried to the scene of action , where she found the blind worshippers of Kitty-mouse mourning over the charred remains of the lost darling ."
`` What have you been at ?
"Tell me all about it , '' said Mrs. Jo , composing herself to listen patiently , for the culprits looked so penitent , she forgave them beforehand ."
"With some reluctance Demi explained their play , and Aunt Jo laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks , the children were so solemn , and the play was so absurd ."
`` I thought you were too sensible to play such a silly game as this .
"If I had any Kitty-mouse I 'd have a good one who liked you to play in safe pleasant ways , and not destroy and frighten ."
"Just see what a ruin you have made ; all Daisy 's pretty dolls , Demi 's soldiers , and Rob 's new village beside poor Teddy 's pet lamb , and dear old Annabella ."
"I shall have to write up in the nursery the verse that used to come in the boxes of toys , `` The children of Holland take pleasure in making , What the children of Boston take pleasure in breaking . ''"
`` Only I shall put Plumfield instead of Boston . ''
"`` We never will again , truly , truly ! ''"
"cried the repentant little sinners , much abashed at this reproof ."
"`` Demi told us to , '' said Rob ."
"`` Well , I heard Uncle tell about the Greece people , who had altars and things , and so I wanted to be like them , only I had n't any live creatures to sackerryfice , so we burnt up our toys . ''"
"`` Dear me , that is something like the bean story , '' said Aunt Jo , laughing again ."
"`` Tell about it , '' suggested Daisy , to change the subject ."
"`` Once there was a poor woman who had three or four little children , and she used to lock them up in her room when she went out to work , to keep them safe ."
"On day when she was going away she said , ` Now , my dears , do n't let baby fall out of window , do n't play with the matches , and do n't put beans up your noses . '"
"Now the children had never dreamed of doing that last thing , but she put it into their heads , and the minute she was gone , they ran and stuffed their naughty little noses full of beans , just to see how it felt , and she found them all crying when she came home . ''"
`` Did it hurt ? ''
"asked Rob , with such intense interest that his mother hastily added a warning sequel , lest a new edition of the bean story should appear in her own family ."
"`` Very much , as I know , for when my mother told me this story , I was so silly that I went and tried it myself ."
"Dick had crossed the greater part of the open ground between Shoreby and the forest , and had reached the bottom of the little hill , some hundred yards below the Cross of St. Bride , when , through the stillness of the black morn , there rang forth the note of a trumpet , so shrill , clear , and piercing , that he thought he had never heard the match of it for audibility ."
"It was blown once , and then hurriedly a second time ; and then the clash of steel succeeded ."
"At this young Shelton pricked his ears , and drawing his sword , ran forward up the hill ."
"Presently he came in sight of the cross , and was aware of a most fierce encounter raging on the road before it ."
"There were seven or eight assailants , and but one to keep head against them ; but so active and dexterous was this one , so desperately did he charge and scatter his opponents , so deftly keep his footing on the ice , that already , before Dick could intervene , he had slain one , wounded another , and kept the whole in check ."
"Still , it was by a miracle that he continued his defence , and at any moment , any accident , the least slip of foot or error of hand , his life would be a forfeit ."
"`` Hold ye well , sir !"
Here is help ! ''
"cried Richard ; and forgetting that he was alone , and that the cry was somewhat irregular , `` To the Arrow !"
to the Arrow ! ''
"he shouted , as he fell upon the rear of the assailants ."
"These were stout fellows also , for they gave not an inch at this surprise , but faced about , and fell with astonishing fury upon Dick ."
"Four against one , the steel flashed about him in the starlight ; the sparks flew fiercely ; one of the men opposed to him fell -- in the stir of the fight he hardly knew why ; then he himself was struck across the head , and though the steel cap below his hood protected him , the blow beat him down upon one knee , with a brain whirling like a windmill sail ."
"Meanwhile the man whom he had come to rescue , instead of joining in the conflict , had , on the first sign of intervention , leaped aback and blown again , and yet more urgently and loudly , on that same shrill-voiced trumpet that began the alarm ."
"Next moment , indeed , his foes were on him , and he was once more charging and fleeing , leaping , stabbing , dropping to his knee , and using indifferently sword and dagger , foot and hand , with the same unshaken courage and feverish energy and speed ."
But that ear-piercing summons had been heard at last .
"There was a muffled rushing in the snow ; and in a good hour for Dick , who saw the sword-points glitter already at his throat , there poured forth out of the wood upon both sides a disorderly torrent of mounted men-at-arms , each cased in iron , and with visor lowered , each bearing his lance in rest , or his sword bared and raised , and each carrying , so to speak , a passenger , in the shape of an archer or page , who leaped one after another from their perches , and had presently doubled the array ."
"The original assailants ; seeing themselves outnumbered and surrounded , threw down their arms without a word ."
`` Seize me these fellows ! ''
"said the hero of the trumpet ; and when his order had been obeyed , he drew near to Dick and looked him in the face ."
"Dick , returning this scrutiny , was surprised to find in one who had displayed such strength , skill and energy , a lad no older than himself -- slightly deformed , with one shoulder higher than the other , and of a pale , painful , and distorted countenance ."
"-LCB- 2 -RCB- The eyes , however , were very clear and bold ."
"`` Sir , '' said this lad , `` ye came in good time for me , and none too early . ''"
"`` My lord , '' returned Dick , with a faint sense that he was in the presence of a great personage , `` ye are yourself so marvellous a good swordsman that I believe ye had managed them single-handed ."
"Howbeit , it was certainly well for me that your men delayed no longer than they did . ''"
`` How knew ye who I was ? ''
demanded the stranger .
"`` Even now , my lord , '' Dick answered , `` I am ignorant of whom I speak with . ''"
`` Is it so ? ''
asked the other .
`` And yet ye threw yourself head first into this unequal battle . ''
"`` I saw one man valiantly contending against many , '' replied Dick , `` and I had thought myself dishonoured not to bear him aid . ''"
"The first peep of morning , then , showed us this horrible place , and I could see Alan knit his brow ."
"`` This is no fit place for you and me , '' he said ."
`` This is a place they 're bound to watch . ''
"And with that he ran harder than ever down to the water-side , in a part where the river was split in two among three rocks ."
It went through with a horrid thundering that made my belly quake ; and there hung over the lynn a little mist of spray .
"Alan looked neither to the right nor to the left , but jumped clean upon the middle rock and fell there on his hands and knees to check himself , for that rock was small and he might have pitched over on the far side ."
"I had scarce time to measure the distance or to understand the peril before I had followed him , and he had caught and stopped me ."
"So there we stood , side by side upon a small rock slippery with spray , a far broader leap in front of us , and the river dinning upon all sides ."
"When I saw where I was , there came on me a deadly sickness of fear , and I put my hand over my eyes ."
"Alan took me and shook me ; I saw he was speaking , but the roaring of the falls and the trouble of my mind prevented me from hearing ; only I saw his face was red with anger , and that he stamped upon the rock ."
"The same look showed me the water raging by , and the mist hanging in the air : and with that I covered my eyes again and shuddered ."
"The next minute Alan had set the brandy bottle to my lips , and forced me to drink about a gill , which sent the blood into my head again ."
"Then , putting his hands to his mouth , and his mouth to my ear , he shouted , `` Hang or drown ! ''"
"and turning his back upon me , leaped over the farther branch of the stream , and landed safe ."
"I was now alone upon the rock , which gave me the more room ; the brandy was singing in my ears ; I had this good example fresh before me , and just wit enough to see that if I did not leap at once , I should never leap at all ."
"I bent low on my knees and flung myself forth , with that kind of anger of despair that has sometimes stood me in stead of courage ."
"Sure enough , it was but my hands that reached the full length ; these slipped , caught again , slipped again ; and I was sliddering back into the lynn , when Alan seized me , first by the hair , then by the collar , and with a great strain dragged me into safety ."
"Never a word he said , but set off running again for his life , and I must stagger to my feet and run after him ."
"I had been weary before , but now I was sick and bruised , and partly drunken with the brandy ; I kept stumbling as I ran , I had a stitch that came near to overmaster me ; and when at last Alan paused under a great rock that stood there among a number of others , it was none too soon for David Balfour ."
"A great rock I have said ; but by rights it was two rocks leaning together at the top , both some twenty feet high , and at the first sight inaccessible ."
"Even Alan -LRB- though you may say he had as good as four hands -RRB- failed twice in an attempt to climb them ; and it was only at the third trial , and then by standing on my shoulders and leaping up with such force as I thought must have broken my collar-bone , that he secured a lodgment ."
"Once there , he let down his leathern girdle ; and with the aid of that and a pair of shallow footholds in the rock , I scrambled up beside him ."
"Then I saw why we had come there ; for the two rocks , being both somewhat hollow on the top and sloping one to the other , made a kind of dish or saucer , where as many as three or four men might have lain hidden ."
"All this while Alan had not said a word , and had run and climbed with such a savage , silent frenzy of hurry , that I knew that he was in mortal fear of some miscarriage ."
"Even now we were on the rock he said nothing , nor so much as relaxed the frowning look upon his face ; but clapped flat down , and keeping only one eye above the edge of our place of shelter scouted all round the compass ."
"The dawn had come quite clear ; we could see the stony sides of the valley , and its bottom , which was bestrewed with rocks , and the river , which went from one side to another , and made white falls ; but nowhere the smoke of a house , nor any living creature but some eagles screaming round a cliff ."
Then at last Alan smiled .
"`` Ay '' said he , `` now we have a chance ; '' and then looking at me with some amusement , `` Ye 're no very gleg * at the jumping , '' said he ."
* Brisk .
"At this I suppose I coloured with mortification , for he added at once , `` Hoots !"
small blame to ye !
"To be feared of a thing and yet to do it , is what makes the prettiest kind of a man ."
The room was small -- a mere box above the kitchen which Sidney shared with two small cousins .
Her bed and the cot where the little girls slept filled up almost all the available space .
"The furniture was poor , but everything was neat -- it was the only neat room in the house , indeed , for tidiness was no besetting virtue of Aunt Jane 's ."
"Opposite Sidney was a small muslined and befrilled toilet-table , above which hung an eight-by-six-inch mirror , in which Sidney saw herself reflected as she devoutly hoped other people did not see her ."
"Just at that particular angle one eye appeared to be as large as an orange , while the other was the size of a pea , and the mouth zigzagged from ear to ear ."
Sidney hated that mirror as virulently as she could hate anything .
It seemed to her to typify all that was unlovely in her life .
The mirror of existence into which her fresh young soul had looked for twenty years gave back to her wistful gaze just such distortions of fair hopes and ideals .
"Half of the little table by which she sat was piled high with books -- old books , evidently well read and well-bred books , classics of fiction and verse every one of them , and all bearing on the flyleaf the name of Sidney Richmond , thereby meaning not the girl at the table , but her college-bred young father who had died the day before she was born ."
"Her mother had died the day after , and Sidney thereupon had come into the hands of good Aunt Jane , with those books for her dowry , since nothing else was left after the expenses of the double funeral had been paid ."
One of the books had Sidney Richmond 's name printed on the title-page instead of written on the flyleaf .
"It was a thick little volume of poems , published in his college days -- musical , unsubstantial , pretty little poems , every one of which the girl Sidney loved and knew by heart ."
"Sidney dropped her pointed chin in her hands and looked dreamily out into the moonlit night , while she thought her letter out a little more fully before beginning to write ."
"Her big brown eyes were full of wistfulness and romance ; for Sidney was romantic , albeit a faithful and understanding acquaintance with her father 's books had given to her romance refinement and reason , and the delicacy of her own nature had imparted to it a self-respecting bias ."
"Presently she began to write , with a flush of real excitement on her face ."
In the middle of things the baby choked on a small twist spool and Sidney had to catch him up by the heels and hold him head downward until the trouble was ejected .
"Then she had to soothe him , and finally write the rest of her letter holding him on one arm and protecting the epistle from the grabs of his sticky little fingers ."
"It was certainly letter-writing under difficulties , but Sidney seemed to deal with them mechanically ."
Her soul and understanding were elsewhere .
"Four years before , when Sidney was sixteen , still calling herself a schoolgirl by reason of the fact that she could be spared to attend school four months in the winter when work was slack , she had been much interested in the `` Maple Leaf '' department of the Montreal weekly her uncle took ."
"It was a page given over to youthful Canadians and filled with their contributions in the way of letters , verses , and prize essays ."
"Noms de plume were signed to these , badges were sent to those who joined the Maple Leaf Club , and a general delightful sense of mystery pervaded the department ."
Often a letter concluded with a request to the club members to correspond with the writer .
One such request went from Sidney under the pen-name of `` Ellen Douglas . ''
"The girl was lonely in Plainfield ; she had no companions or associates such as she cared for ; the Maple Leaf Club represented all that her life held of outward interest , and she longed for something more ."
"Only one answer came to `` Ellen Douglas , '' and that was forwarded to her by the long-suffering editor of `` The Maple Leaf . ''"
"It was from John Lincoln of the Bar N Ranch , Alberta ."
"He wrote that , although his age debarred him from membership in the club -LRB- he was twenty , and the limit was eighteen -RRB- , he read the letters of the department with much interest , and often had thought of answering some of the requests for correspondents ."
"He never had done so , but `` Ellen Douglas 's '' letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her ."
Would she be kind enough to correspond with him ?
"Life on the Bar N , ten miles from the outposts of civilization , was lonely ."
"He was two years out from the east , and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times ."
"I had no beans , so I took some little pebbles , and poked several into my nose ."
"I did not like it at all , and wanted to take them out again very soon , but one would not come , and I was so ashamed to tell what a goose I been that I went for hours with the stone hurting me very much ."
"At last the pain got so bad I had to tell , and when my mother could not get it out the doctor came ."
"Then I was put in a chair and held tight , Rob , while he used his ugly little pincers till the stone hopped out ."
Dear me !
"how my wretched little nose did ache , and how people laughed at me ! ''"
"and Mrs. Jo shook her head in a dismal way , as if the memory of her sufferings was too much for her ."
Rob looked deeply impressed and I am glad to say took the warning to heart .
"Demi proposed that they should bury poor Annabella , and in the interest of the funeral Teddy forgot his fright ."
"Daisy was soon consoled by another batch of dolls from Aunt Amy , and the Naughty Kitty-mouse seemed to be appeased by the last offerings , for she tormented them no more ."
"`` Brops '' was the name of a new and absorbing play , invented by Bangs ."
"As this interesting animal is not to be found in any Zoological Garden , unless Du Chaillu has recently brought one from the wilds of Africa , I will mention a few of its peculiar habits and traits , for the benefit of inquiring minds ."
"The Brop is a winged quadruped , with a human face of a youthful and merry aspect ."
"When it walks the earth it grunts , when it soars it gives a shrill hoot , occasionally it goes erect , and talks good English ."
"Its body is usually covered with a substance much resembling a shawl , sometimes red , sometimes blue , often plaid , and , strange to say , they frequently change skins with one another ."
On their heads they have a horn very like a stiff brown paper lamp-lighter .
"Wings of the same substance flap upon their shoulders when they fly ; this is never very far from the ground , as they usually fall with violence if they attempt any lofty flights ."
"They browse over the earth , but can sit up and eat like the squirrel ."
"Their favorite nourishment is the seed-cake ; apples also are freely taken , and sometimes raw carrots are nibbled when food is scarce ."
"They live in dens , where they have a sort of nest , much like a clothes-basket , in which the little Brops play till their wings are grown ."
"These singular animals quarrel at times , and it is on these occasions that they burst into human speech , call each other names , cry , scold , and sometimes tear off horns and skin , declaring fiercely that they `` wo n't play . ''"
"The few privileged persons who have studied them are inclined to think them a remarkable mixture of the monkey , the sphinx , the roc , and the queer creatures seen by the famous Peter Wilkins ."
"This game was a great favorite , and the younger children beguiled many a rainy afternoon flapping or creeping about the nursery , acting like little bedlamites and being as merry as little grigs ."
"To be sure , it was rather hard upon clothes , particularly trouser-knees , and jacket-elbows ; but Mrs. Bhaer only said , as she patched and darned , `` We do things just as foolish , and not half so harmless ."
"If I could get as much happiness out of it as the little dears do , I 'd be a Brop myself . ''"
"Nat 's favorite amusements were working in his garden , and sitting in the willow-tree with his violin , for that green nest was a fairy world to him , and there he loved to perch , making music like a happy bird ."
"The lads called him `` Old Chirper , '' because he was always humming , whistling , or fiddling , and they often stopped a minute in their work or play to listen to the soft tones of the violin , which seemed to lead a little orchestra of summer sounds ."
"The birds appeared to regard him as one of themselves , and fearlessly sat on the fence or lit among the boughs to watch him with their quick bright eyes ."
"The robins in the apple-tree near by evidently considered him a friend , for the father bird hunted insects close beside him , and the little mother brooded as confidingly over her blue eggs as if the boy was only a new sort of blackbird who cheered her patient watch with his song ."
"The brown brook babbled and sparkled below him , the bees haunted the clover fields on either side , friendly faces peeped at him as they passed , the old house stretched its wide wings hospitably toward him , and with a blessed sense of rest and love and happiness , Nat dreamed for hours in this nook , unconscious what healthful miracles were being wrought upon him ."
"One listener he had who never tired , and to whom he was more than a mere schoolmate ."
"Poor Billy 's chief delight was to lie beside the brook , watching leaves and bits of foam dance by , listening dreamily to the music in the willow-tree ."
"`` Robin Oig , '' he said , when it was done , `` ye are a great piper ."
I am not fit to blow in the same kingdom with ye .
Body of me !
ye have mair music in your sporran than I have in my head !
"And though it still sticks in my mind that I could maybe show ye another of it with the cold steel , I warn ye beforehand -- it 'll no be fair !"
It would go against my heart to haggle a man that can blow the pipes as you can ! ''
"Thereupon that quarrel was made up ; all night long the brose was going and the pipes changing hands ; and the day had come pretty bright , and the three men were none the better for what they had been taking , before Robin as much as thought upon the road ."
"CHAPTER XXVI END OF THE FLIGHT : WE PASS THE FORTH The month , as I have said , was not yet out , but it was already far through August , and beautiful warm weather , with every sign of an early and great harvest , when I was pronounced able for my journey ."
"Our money was now run to so low an ebb that we must think first of all on speed ; for if we came not soon to Mr. Rankeillor 's , or if when we came there he should fail to help me , we must surely starve ."
"In Alan 's view , besides , the hunt must have now greatly slackened ; and the line of the Forth and even Stirling Bridge , which is the main pass over that river , would be watched with little interest ."
"`` It 's a chief principle in military affairs , '' said he , `` to go where ye are least expected ."
"Forth is our trouble ; ye ken the saying , ` Forth bridles the wild Hielandman . '"
"Well , if we seek to creep round about the head of that river and come down by Kippen or Balfron , it 's just precisely there that they 'll be looking to lay hands on us ."
"But if we stave on straight to the auld Brig of Stirling , I 'll lay my sword they let us pass unchallenged . ''"
"The first night , accordingly , we pushed to the house of a Maclaren in Strathire , a friend of Duncan 's , where we slept the twenty-first of the month , and whence we set forth again about the fall of night to make another easy stage ."
"The twenty-second we lay in a heather bush on the hillside in Uam Var , within view of a herd of deer , the happiest ten hours of sleep in a fine , breathing sunshine and on bone-dry ground , that I have ever tasted ."
"That night we struck Allan Water , and followed it down ; and coming to the edge of the hills saw the whole Carse of Stirling underfoot , as flat as a pancake , with the town and castle on a hill in the midst of it , and the moon shining on the Links of Forth ."
"`` Now , '' said Alan , `` I kenna if ye care , but ye 're in your own land again ."
"We passed the Hieland Line in the first hour ; and now if we could but pass yon crooked water , we might cast our bonnets in the air . ''"
"In Allan Water , near by where it falls into the Forth , we found a little sandy islet , overgrown with burdock , butterbur and the like low plants , that would just cover us if we lay flat ."
"Here it was we made our camp , within plain view of Stirling Castle , whence we could hear the drums beat as some part of the garrison paraded ."
"Shearers worked all day in a field on one side of the river , and we could hear the stones going on the hooks and the voices and even the words of the men talking ."
It behoved to lie close and keep silent .
"But the sand of the little isle was sun-warm , the green plants gave us shelter for our heads , we had food and drink in plenty ; and to crown all , we were within sight of safety ."
"As soon as the shearers quit their work and the dusk began to fall , we waded ashore and struck for the Bridge of Stirling , keeping to the fields and under the field fences ."
"The bridge is close under the castle hill , an old , high , narrow bridge with pinnacles along the parapet ; and you may conceive with how much interest I looked upon it , not only as a place famous in history , but as the very doors of salvation to Alan and myself ."
"The moon was not yet up when we came there ; a few lights shone along the front of the fortress , and lower down a few lighted windows in the town ; but it was all mighty still , and there seemed to be no guard upon the passage ."
I was for pushing straight across ; but Alan was more wary .
"`` It looks unco ' quiet , '' said he ; `` but for all that we 'll lie down here cannily behind a dyke , and make sure . ''"
"So we lay for about a quarter of an hour , whiles whispering , whiles lying still and hearing nothing earthly but the washing of the water on the piers ."
"At last there came by an old , hobbling woman with a crutch stick ; who first stopped a little , close to where we lay , and bemoaned herself and the long way she had travelled ; and then set forth again up the steep spring of the bridge ."
"The woman was so little , and the night still so dark , that we soon lost sight of her ; only heard the sound of her steps , and her stick , and a cough that she had by fits , draw slowly farther away ."
"And even as it was , I had paid for it pretty dear , not only in past sufferings , but in my present case ; being clothed like a beggar-man , scarce able to walk , and in great pain of my sore throat ."
"I have seen wicked men and fools , a great many of both ; and I believe they both get paid in the end ; but the fools first ."
"CHAPTER XV THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON : THROUGH THE ISLE OF MULL The Ross of Mull , which I had now got upon , was rugged and trackless , like the isle I had just left ; being all bog , and brier , and big stone ."
"There may be roads for them that know that country well ; but for my part I had no better guide than my own nose , and no other landmark than Ben More ."
I aimed as well as I could for the smoke I had seen so often from the island ; and with all my great weariness and the difficulty of the way came upon the house in the bottom of a little hollow about five or six at night .
"It was low and longish , roofed with turf and built of unmortared stones ; and on a mound in front of it , an old gentleman sat smoking his pipe in the sun ."
"With what little English he had , he gave me to understand that my shipmates had got safe ashore , and had broken bread in that very house on the day after ."
"`` Was there one , '' I asked , `` dressed like a gentleman ? ''"
"He said they all wore rough great-coats ; but to be sure , the first of them , the one that came alone , wore breeches and stockings , while the rest had sailors ' trousers ."
"`` Ah , '' said I , `` and he would have a feathered hat ? ''"
"He told me , no , that he was bareheaded like myself ."
"At first I thought Alan might have lost his hat ; and then the rain came in my mind , and I judged it more likely he had it out of harm 's way under his great-coat ."
"This set me smiling , partly because my friend was safe , partly to think of his vanity in dress ."
"And then the old gentleman clapped his hand to his brow , and cried out that I must be the lad with the silver button ."
"`` Why , yes ! ''"
"said I , in some wonder ."
"`` Well , then , '' said the old gentleman , `` I have a word for you , that you are to follow your friend to his country , by Torosay . ''"
"He then asked me how I had fared , and I told him my tale ."
"A south-country man would certainly have laughed ; but this old gentleman -LRB- I call him so because of his manners , for his clothes were dropping off his back -RRB- heard me all through with nothing but gravity and pity ."
"When I had done , he took me by the hand , led me into his hut -LRB- it was no better -RRB- and presented me before his wife , as if she had been the Queen and I a duke ."
"The good woman set oat-bread before me and a cold grouse , patting my shoulder and smiling to me all the time , for she had no English ; and the old gentleman -LRB- not to be behind -RRB- brewed me a strong punch out of their country spirit ."
"All the while I was eating , and after that when I was drinking the punch , I could scarce come to believe in my good fortune ; and the house , though it was thick with the peat-smoke and as full of holes as a colander , seemed like a palace ."
"The punch threw me in a strong sweat and a deep slumber ; the good people let me lie ; and it was near noon of the next day before I took the road , my throat already easier and my spirits quite restored by good fare and good news ."
"The old gentleman , although I pressed him hard , would take no money , and gave me an old bonnet for my head ; though I am free to own I was no sooner out of view of the house than I very jealously washed this gift of his in a wayside fountain ."
"Thought I to myself : `` If these are the wild Highlanders , I could wish my own folk wilder . ''"
"I not only started late , but I must have wandered nearly half the time ."
"True , I met plenty of people , grubbing in little miserable fields that would not keep a cat , or herding little kine about the bigness of asses ."
"The Highland dress being forbidden by law since the rebellion , and the people condemned to the Lowland habit , which they much disliked , it was strange to see the variety of their array ."
"Some went bare , only for a hanging cloak or great-coat , and carried their trousers on their backs like a useless burthen : some had made an imitation of the tartan with little parti-coloured stripes patched together like an old wife 's quilt ; others , again , still wore the Highland philabeg , but by putting a few stitches between the legs transformed it into a pair of trousers like a Dutchman 's ."
"All those makeshifts were condemned and punished , for the law was harshly applied , in hopes to break up the clan spirit ; but in that out-of-the-way , sea-bound isle , there were few to make remarks and fewer to tell tales ."
"They seemed in great poverty ; which was no doubt natural , now that rapine was put down , and the chiefs kept no longer an open house ; and the roads -LRB- even such a wandering , country by-track as the one I followed -RRB- were infested with beggars ."
And here again I marked a difference from my own part of the country .
"`` I will take Mr. Bangs and teach him the polka , for he does not know it fit to be seen , '' added the hostess , with a reproachful look that sobered Tommy at once ."
"Nat struck up , and the ball opened with two couples , who went conscientiously through a somewhat varied dance ."
"The ladies did well , because they liked it , but the gentlemen exerted themselves from more selfish motives , for each felt that he must earn his supper , and labored manfully toward that end ."
"When every one was out of breath they were allowed to rest ; and , indeed , poor Mrs. Smith needed it , for her long dress had tripped her up many times ."
The little maid passed round molasses and water in such small cups that one guest actually emptied nine .
"I refrain from mentioning his name , because this mild beverage affected him so much that he put cup and all into his mouth at the ninth round , and choked himself publicly ."
"`` You must ask Nan to play and sing now , '' said Daisy to her brother , who sat looking very much like an owl , as he gravely regarded the festive scene between his high collars ."
"`` Give us a song , mum , '' said the obedient guest , secretly wondering where the piano was ."
"Miss Smith sailed up to an old secretary which stood in the room , threw back the lid of the writing-desk , and sitting down before it , accompanied herself with a vigor which made the old desk rattle as she sang that new and lovely song , beginning `` Gaily the troubadour Touched his guitar , As he was hastening Home from the war . ''"
"The gentlemen applauded so enthusiastically that she gave them `` Bounding Billows , '' `` Little Bo-Peep , '' and other gems of song , till they were obliged to hint that they had had enough ."
"Grateful for the praises bestowed upon her daughter , Mrs. Smith graciously announced , `` Now we will have tea ."
"Sit down carefully , and do n't grab . ''"
"It was beautiful to see the air of pride with which the good lady did the honors of her table , and the calmness with which she bore the little mishaps that occurred ."
"The best pie flew wildly on the floor when she tried to cut it with a very dull knife ; the bread and butter vanished with a rapidity calculated to dismay a housekeeper 's soul ; and , worst of all , the custards were so soft that they had to be drunk up , instead of being eaten elegantly with the new tin spoons ."
"I grieve to state that Miss Smith squabbled with the maid for the best jumble , which caused Bess to toss the whole dish into the air , and burst out crying amid a rain of falling cakes ."
"She was comforted by a seat at the table , and the sugar-bowl to empty ; but during this flurry a large plate of patties was mysteriously lost , and could not be found ."
"They were the chief ornament of the feast , and Mrs. Smith was indignant at the loss , for she had made them herself , and they were beautiful to behold ."
"I put it to any lady if it was not hard to have one dozen delicious patties -LRB- made of flour , salt , and water , with a large raisin in the middle of each , and much sugar over the whole -RRB- swept away at one fell swoop ?"
"`` You hid them , Tommy ; I know you did ! ''"
"cried the outraged hostess , threatening her suspected guest with the milk-pot ."
`` I did n't ! ''
`` You did ! ''
"`` It is n't proper to contradict , '' said Nan , who was hastily eating up the jelly during the fray ."
"`` Give them back , Demi , '' said Tommy ."
"`` That 's a fib , you 've got them in your own pocket , '' bawled Demi , roused by the false accusation ."
`` Let 's take 'em away from him .
"It 's too bad to make Daisy cry , '' suggested Nat , who found his first ball more exciting than he expected ."
"Daisy was already weeping , Bess like a devoted servant mingled her tears with those of her mistress , and Nan denounced the entire race of boys as `` plaguey things . ''"
"Meanwhile the battle raged among the gentlemen , for , when the two defenders of innocence fell upon the foe , that hardened youth intrenched himself behind a table and pelted them with the stolen tarts , which were very effective missiles , being nearly as hard as bullets ."
"While his ammunition held out the besieged prospered , but the moment the last patty flew over the parapet , the villain was seized , dragged howling from the room , and cast upon the hall floor in an ignominious heap ."
"The conquerors then returned flushed with victory , and while Demi consoled poor Mrs. Smith , Nat and Nan collected the scattered tarts , replaced each raisin in its proper bed , and rearranged the dish so that it really looked almost as well as ever ."
"But their glory had departed , for the sugar was gone , and no one cared to eat them after the insult offered to them ."
"Of late David has been thinking back hard about the fairy tongue , with his hands clutching his temples , and he has remembered a number of their phrases which I shall tell you some day if I do n't forget ."
"He had heard them in the days when he was a thrush , and though I suggested to him that perhaps it is really bird language he is remembering , he says not , for these phrases are about fun and adventures , and the birds talked of nothing but nest-building ."
"He distinctly remembers that the birds used to go from spot to spot like ladies at shop-windows , looking at the different nests and saying , `` Not my colour , my dear , '' and `` How would that do with a soft lining ? ''"
and `` But will it wear ? ''
and `` What hideous trimming ! ''
and so on .
"The fairies are exquisite dancers , and that is why one of the first things the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry when you do it ."
"They hold their great balls in the open air , in what is called a fairy-ring ."
For weeks afterward you can see the ring on the grass .
"It is not there when they begin , but they make it by waltzing round and round ."
"Sometimes you will find mushrooms inside the ring , and these are fairy chairs that the servants have forgotten to clear away ."
"The chairs and the rings are the only tell-tale marks these little people leave behind them , and they would remove even these were they not so fond of dancing that they toe it till the very moment of the opening of the gates ."
David and I once found a fairy-ring quite warm .
But there is also a way of finding out about the ball before it takes place .
You know the boards which tell at what time the Gardens are to close to-day .
"Well , these tricky fairies sometimes slyly change the board on a ball night , so that it says the Gardens are to close at six-thirty for instance , instead of at seven ."
This enables them to get begun half an hour earlier .
"If on such a night we could remain behind in the Gardens , as the famous Maimie Mannering did , we might see delicious sights , hundreds of lovely fairies hastening to the ball , the married ones wearing their wedding-rings round their waists , the gentlemen , all in uniform , holding up the ladies ' trains , and linkmen running in front carrying winter cherries , which are the fairy-lanterns , the cloakroom where they put on their silver slippers and get a ticket for their wraps , the flowers streaming up from the Baby Walk to look on , and always welcome because they can lend a pin , the supper-table , with Queen Mab at the head of it , and behind her chair the Lord Chamberlain , who carries a dandelion on which he blows when Her Majesty wants to know the time ."
"The table-cloth varies according to the seasons , and in May it is made of chestnut-blossom ."
"The way the fairy-servants do is this : The men , scores of them , climb up the trees and shake the branches , and the blossom falls like snow ."
"Then the lady servants sweep it together by whisking their skirts until it is exactly like a table-cloth , and that is how they get their table-cloth ."
"They have real glasses and real wine of three kinds , namely , blackthorn wine , berberris wine , and cowslip wine , and the Queen pours out , but the bottles are so heavy that she just pretends to pour out ."
"There is bread and butter to begin with , of the size of a threepenny bit ; and cakes to end with , and they are so small that they have no crumbs ."
"The fairies sit round on mushrooms , and at first they are very well-behaved and always cough off the table , and so on , but after a bit they are not so well-behaved and stick their fingers into the butter , which is got from the roots of old trees , and the really horrid ones crawl over the table-cloth chasing sugar or other delicacies with their tongues ."
"When the Queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and put away , and then everybody adjourns to the dance , the Queen walking in front while the Lord Chamberlain walks behind her , carrying two little pots , one of which contains the juice of wall-flower and the other the juice of Solomon 's Seals ."
"Wall-flower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit , and Solomon 's Seals juice is for bruises ."
They bruise very easily and when Peter plays faster and faster they foot it till they fall down in fits .
"For , as you know without my telling you , Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra ."
"He sits in the middle of the ring , and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays without him ."
`` P. P. '' is written on the corner of the invitation-cards sent out by all really good families .
"They are grateful little people , too , and at the princess 's coming-of-age ball -LRB- they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every month -RRB- they gave him the wish of his heart ."
The way it was done was this .
"This brought down the house , and Tommy joined in the admiring cries which greeted the accomplished gymnast as he righted himself , and looked at them with an air of calm superiority ."
`` Do you think I could learn to do it without its hurting me very much ? ''
"Tom meekly asked , as he rubbed the elbows which still smarted after the last attempt ."
`` What will you give me if I 'll teach you ? ''
said Dan .
"`` My new jack-knife ; it 's got five blades , and only one is broken . ''"
"`` Give it here , then . ''"
Tommy handed it over with an affectionate look at its smooth handle .
"Dan examined it carefully , then putting it into his pocket , walked off , saying with a wink , `` Keep it up till you learn , that 's all . ''"
"A howl of wrath from Tommy was followed by a general uproar , which did not subside till Dan , finding himself in a minority , proposed that they should play stick-knife , and whichever won should have the treasure ."
"Tommy agreed , and the game was played in a circle of excited faces , which all wore an expression of satisfaction , when Tommy won and secured the knife in the depth of his safest pocket ."
"`` You come off with me , and I 'll show you round , '' said Nat , feeling that he must have a little serious conversation with his friend in private ."
"What passed between them no one knew , but when they appeared again , Dan was more respectful to every one , though still gruff in his speech , and rough in his manner ; and what else could be expected of the poor lad who had been knocking about the world all his short life with no one to teach him any better ?"
"The boys had decided that they did not like him , and so they left him to Nat , who soon felt rather oppressed by the responsibility , but too kind-hearted to desert him ."
"Tommy , however , felt that in spite of the jack-knife transaction , there was a bond of sympathy between them , and longed to return to the interesting subject of somersaults ."
"He soon found an opportunity , for Dan , seeing how much he admired him , grew more amiable , and by the end of the first week was quite intimate with the lively Tom ."
"Mr. Bhaer , when he heard the story and saw Dan , shook his head , but only said quietly , `` The experiment may cost us something , but we will try it . ''"
"If Dan felt any gratitude for his protection , he did not show it , and took without thanks all that was give him ."
"He was ignorant , but very quick to learn when he chose ; had sharp eyes to watch what went on about him ; a saucy tongue , rough manners , and a temper that was fierce and sullen by turns ."
"He played with all his might , and played well at almost all the games ."
"He was silent and gruff before grown people , and only now and then was thoroughly sociable among the lads ."
"Few of them really liked him , but few could help admiring his courage and strength , for nothing daunted him , and he knocked tall Franz flat on one occasion with an ease that caused all the others to keep at a respectful distance from his fists ."
"Mr. Bhaer watched him silently , and did his best to tame the `` Wild Boy , '' as they called him , but in private the worthy man shook his head , and said soberly , `` I hope the experiment will turn out well , but I am a little afraid it may cost too much . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer lost her patience with him half a dozen times a day , yet never gave him up , and always insisted that there was something good in the lad , after all ; for he was kinder to animals than to people , he liked to rove about in the woods , and , best of all , little Ted was fond of him ."
"What the secret was no one could discover , but Baby took to him at once gabbled and crowed whenever he saw him preferred his strong back to ride on to any of the others and called him `` My Danny '' out of his own little head ."
"Teddy was the only creature to whom Dan showed an affection , and this was only manifested when he thought no one else would see it ; but mothers ' eyes are quick , and motherly hearts instinctively divine who love their babies ."
"So Mrs. Jo soon saw and felt that there was a soft spot in rough Dan , and bided her time to touch and win him ."
"But an unexpected and decidedly alarming event upset all their plans , and banished Dan from Plumfield ."
"Tommy , Nat , and Demi began by patronizing Dan , because the other lads rather slighted him ; but soon they each felt there was a certain fascination about the bad boy , and from looking down upon him they came to looking up , each for a different reason ."
"Tommy admired his skill and courage ; Nat was grateful for past kindness ; and Demi regarded him as a sort of animated story book , for when he chose Dan could tell his adventures in a most interesting way ."
"It pleased Dan to have the three favorites like him , and he exerted himself to be agreeable , which was the secret of his success ."
"The Bhaers were surprised , but hoped the lads would have a good influence over Dan , and waited with some anxiety , trusting that no harm would come of it ."
"At this point the bell rang , and the entire population went down to dinner , which meal was enlivened by each of the boys giving Daisy a list of things he would like to have cooked for him as fast as he earned them ."
"Daisy , whose faith in her stove was unlimited , promised everything , if Aunt Jo would tell her how to make them ."
"This suggestion rather alarmed Mrs. Jo , for some of the dishes were quite beyond her skill wedding-cake , for instance , bull 's - eye candy ; and cabbage soup with herrings and cherries in it , which Mr. Bhaer proposed as his favorite , and immediately reduced his wife to despair , for German cookery was beyond her ."
"Daisy wanted to begin again the minute dinner was done , but she was only allowed to clear up , fill the kettle ready for tea , and wash out her apron , which looked as if she had a Christmas feast ."
"She was then sent out to play till five o'clock , for Uncle Fritz said that too much study , even at cooking stoves , was bad for little minds and bodies , and Aunt Jo knew by long experience how soon new toys lose their charm if they are not prudently used ."
Everyone was very kind to Daisy that afternoon .
"Tommy promised her the first fruits of his garden , though the only visible crop just then was pigweed ; Nat offered to supply her with wood , free of charge ; Stuffy quite worshipped her ; Ned immediately fell to work on a little refrigerator for her kitchen ; and Demi , with a punctuality beautiful to see in one so young , escorted her to the nursery just as the clock struck five ."
"It was not time for the party to begin , but he begged so hard to come in and help that he was allowed privileges few visitors enjoy , for he kindled the fire , ran errands , and watched the progress of his supper with intense interest ."
"Mrs. Jo directed the affair as she came and went , being very busy putting up clean curtains all over the house ."
"`` Ask Asia for a cup of sour cream , then your cakes will be light without much soda , which I do n't like , '' was the first order ."
"Demi tore downstairs , and returned with the cream , also a puckered-up face , for he had tasted it on his way , and found it so sour that he predicted the cakes would be uneatable ."
"Mrs. Jo took this occasion to deliver a short lecture from the step-ladder on the chemical properties of soda , to which Daisy did not listen , but Demi did , and understood it , as he proved by the brief but comprehensive reply : `` Yes , I see , soda turns sour things sweet , and the fizzling up makes them light ."
"Let 's see you do it , Daisy . ''"
"`` Fill that bowl nearly full of flour and add a little salt to it , '' continued Mrs. Jo ."
"`` Oh dear , everything has to have salt in it , seems to me , '' said Sally , who was tired of opening the pill-box in which it was kept ."
"`` Salt is like good-humor , and nearly every thing is better for a pinch of it , Posy , '' and Uncle Fritz stopped as he passed , hammer in hand , to drive up two or three nails for Sally 's little pans to hang on ."
"`` You are not invited to tea , but I 'll give you some cakes , and I wo n't be cross , '' said Daisy , putting up her floury little face to thank him with a kiss ."
"`` Fritz , you must not interrupt my cooking class , or I 'll come in and moralize when you are teaching Latin ."
How would you like that ? ''
"said Mrs. Jo , throwing a great chintz curtain down on his head ."
"`` Very much , try it and see , '' and the amiable Father Bhaer went singing and tapping about the house like a mammoth woodpecker ."
"`` Put the soda into the cream , and when it ` fizzles , ' as Demi says , stir it into the flour , and beat it up as hard as ever you can ."
"Have your griddle hot , butter it well , and then fry away till I come back , '' and Aunt Jo vanished also ."
"Such a clatter as the little spoon made , and such a beating as the batter got , it quite foamed , I assure you ; and when Daisy poured some on to the griddle , it rose like magic into a puffy flapjack that made Demi 's mouth water ."
"To be sure , the first one stuck and scorched , because she forgot the butter , but after that first failure all went well , and six capital little cakes were safely landed in a dish ."
"`` I think I like maple-syrup better than sugar , '' said Demi , from his arm-chair where he had settled himself after setting the table in a new and peculiar manner ."
"`` Then go and ask Asia for some , '' answered Daisy , going into the bath-room to wash her hands ."
While the nursery was empty something dreadful happened .
"You see , Kit had been feeling hurt all day because he had carried meat safely and yet got none to pay him ."
"He was not a bad dog , but he had his little faults like the rest of us , and could not always resist temptation ."
"Happening to stroll into the nursery at that moment , he smelt the cakes , saw them unguarded on the low table , and never stopping to think of consequences , swallowed all six at one mouthful ."
"I am glad to say that they were very hot , and burned him so badly that he could not repress a surprised yelp ."
"Now she had lost her chance , and Daisy would n't do it half so well ."
"Tears rose to her eyes as she remembered that it was all her own fault ; and she said aloud , addressing a fat bee who was rolling about in the yellow heart of a rose just under the window , `` If you have run away , you 'd better go right home , and tell your mother you are sorry , and never do so any more . ''"
"`` I am glad to hear you give him such good advice , and I think he has taken it , '' said Mrs. Jo , smiling , as the bee spread his dusty wings and flew away ."
"Nan brushed off a bright drop or two that shone on the window-sill , and nestled against her friend as she took her on her knee , adding kindly for she had seen the little drops , and knew what they meant , `` Do you think my mother 's cure for running away a good one ? ''"
"`` Yes , ma'am , '' answered Nan , quite subdued by her quiet day ."
`` I hope I shall not have to try it again . ''
"`` I guess not ; '' and Nan looked up with such an earnest little face that Mrs. Jo felt satisfied , and said no more , for she liked to have her penalties do their own work , and did not spoil the effect by too much moralizing ."
"Here Rob appeared , bearing with infinite care what Asia called a `` sarcer pie , '' meaning one baked in a saucer ."
"`` It 's made out of some of my berries , and I 'm going to give you half at supper-time , '' he announced with a flourish ."
"`` What makes you , when I 'm so naughty ? ''"
"asked Nan , meekly ."
`` Because we got lost together .
"You ai n't going to be naughty again , are you ? ''"
"`` Never , '' said Nan , with great decision ."
"`` Oh , goody !"
now let 's go and get Mary Ann to cut this for us all ready to eat ; it 's ` most tea time ; '' and Rob beckoned with the delicious little pie .
"Nan started to follow , then stopped , and said , `` I forgot , I ca n't go . ''"
"`` Try and see , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , who had quietly untied the cord sash while she had been talking ."
"Nan saw that she was free , and with one tempestuous kiss to Mrs. Jo , she was off like a humming-bird , followed by Robby , dribbling huckleberry juice as he ran ."
CHAPTER XIII .
"GOLDILOCKS After the last excitement peace descended upon Plumfield and reigned unbroken for several weeks , for the elder boys felt that the loss of Nan and Rob lay at their door , and all became so paternal in their care that they were rather wearying ; while the little ones listened to Nan 's recital of her perils so many times , that they regarded being lost as the greatest ill humanity was heir to , and hardly dared to put their little noses outside the great gate lest night should suddenly descend upon them , and ghostly black cows come looming through the dusk ."
"`` It is too good to last , '' said Mrs. Jo ; for years of boy-culture had taught her that such lulls were usually followed by outbreaks of some sort , and when less wise women would have thought that the boys had become confirmed saints , she prepared herself for a sudden eruption of the domestic volcano ."
"One cause of this welcome calm was a visit from little Bess , whose parents lent her for a week while they were away with Grandpa Laurence , who was poorly ."
"The boys regarded Goldilocks as a mixture of child , angel , and fairy , for she was a lovely little creature , and the golden hair which she inherited from her blonde mamma enveloped her like a shining veil , behind which she smiled upon her worshippers when gracious , and hid herself when offended ."
"Her father would not have it cut and it hung below her waist , so soft and fine and bright , that Demi insisted that it was silk spun from a cocoon ."
"Every one praised the little Princess , but it did not seem to do her harm , only to teach her that her presence brought sunshine , her smiles made answering smiles on other faces , and her baby griefs filled every heart with tenderest sympathy ."
"Unconsciously , she did her young subjects more good than many a real sovereign , for her rule was very gentle and her power was felt rather than seen ."
"Her natural refinement made her dainty in all things , and had a good effect upon the careless lads about her ."
"She would let no one touch her roughly or with unclean hands , and more soap was used during her visits than at any other time , because the boys considered it the highest honor to be allowed to carry her highness , and the deepest disgrace to be repulsed with the disdainful command , `` Do away , dirty boy ! ''"
"Lour voices displeased her and quarrelling frightened her ; so gentler tones came into the boyish voices as they addressed her , and squabbles were promptly suppressed in her presence by lookers-on if the principles could not restrain themselves ."
"She liked to be waited on , and the biggest boys did her little errands without a murmur , while the small lads were her devoted slaves in all things ."
"They begged to be allowed to draw her carriage , bear her berry-basket , or pass her plate at table ."
"`` If you 've done all your own mending , there 's a heap of socks to be looked over ."
Then I 'll show you about darning the tablecloths .
"I do hate to have a stitch of work left over till Monday , '' said Mrs. Grant , who never took naps , and prided herself on sitting down to her needle at 3 P.M. every day ."
"`` Yes , mother ; '' and Merry went slowly upstairs , feeling that a part of Saturday ought to be a holiday after books and work all the week ."
"As she braided up her hair , her eye fell upon the reflection of her own face in the glass ."
"Not a happy nor a pretty one just then , and Merry was so unaccustomed to seeing any other , that involuntarily the frown smoothed itself out , the eyes lost their weary look , the drooping lips curved into a smile , and , leaning her elbows on the bureau , she shook her head at herself , saying , half aloud , as she glanced at Ivanhoe lying near , -- `` You need n't look so cross and ugly just because you ca n't have what you want ."
"Sweeping , baking , and darning are not so bad as being plagued with lovers and carried off and burnt at the stake , so I wo n't envy poor Rebecca her jewels and curls and romantic times , but make the best of my own . ''"
"Then she laughed , and the bright face came back into the mirror , looking like an old friend , and Merry went on dressing with care , for she took pleasure in her own little charms , and felt a sense of comfort in knowing that she could always have one pretty thing to look at if she kept her own face serene and sweet ."
"It certainly looked so as it bent over the pile of big socks half an hour later , and brightened with each that was laid aside ."
"Her mother saw it , and , guessing why such wistful glances went from clock to window , kindly shortened the task of table-cloth darning by doing a good bit herself , before putting it into Merry 's hands ."
"She was a good and loving mother in spite of her strict ways , and knew that it was better for her romantic daughter to be learning all the housewifery lessons she could teach her , than to be reading novels , writing verses , or philandering about with her head full of girlish fancies , quite innocent in themselves , but not the stuff to live on ."
"So she wisely taught the hands that preferred to pick flowers , trim up rooms and mould birds , to work well with needle , broom , and rolling-pin ; put a receipt-book before the eyes that loved to laugh and weep over tender tales , and kept the young head and heart safe and happy with wholesome duties , useful studies , and such harmless pleasures as girls should love , instead of letting them waste their freshness in vague longings , idle dreams , and frivolous pastimes ."
"But it was often hard to thwart the docile child , and lately she had seemed to be growing up so fast that her mother began to feel a new sort of tenderness for this sweet daughter , who was almost ready to take upon herself the cares , as well as triumphs and delights , of maidenhood ."
"Something in the droop of the brown head , and the quick motion of the busy hand with a little burn on it , made it difficult for Mrs. Grant to keep Merry at work that day , and her eye watched the clock almost as impatiently as the girl 's , for she liked to see the young face brighten when the hour of release came ."
`` What next ? ''
"asked Merry , as the last stitch was set , and she stifled a sigh on hearing the clock strike four , for the sun was getting low , and the lovely afternoon going fast ."
"`` One more job , if you are not too tired for it ."
"I want the receipt for diet drink Miss Dawes promised me ; would you like to run down and get it for me , dear ? ''"
"`` Yes , mother ! ''"
"and that answer was as blithe as a robin 's chirp , for that was just where Merry wanted to go ."
"Away went thimble and scissors , and in five minutes away went Merry , skipping down the hill without a care in the world , for a happy heart sat singing within , and everything seemed full of beauty ."
"She had a capital time with Molly , called on Jill , did her shopping in the village , and had just turned to walk up the hill , when Ralph Evans came tramping along behind her , looking so pleased and proud about something that she could not help asking what it was , for they were great friends , and Merry thought that to be an artist was the most glorious career a man could choose ."
"`` I know you 've got some good news , '' she said , looking up at him as he touched his hat and fell into step with her , seeming more contented than before ."
"`` I have , and was just coming up to tell you , for I was sure you would be glad ."
"It is only a hope , a chance , but it is so splendid I feel as if I must shout and dance , or fly over a fence or two , to let off steam . ''"
"`` Do tell me , quick ; have you got an order ? ''"
"asked Merry , full of interest at once , for artistic vicissitudes were very romantic , and she liked to hear about them ."
`` I may go abroad in the autumn . ''
"`` Oh , how lovely ! ''"
`` Is n't it ?
"David German is going to spend a year in Rome , to finish a statue , and wants me to go along ."
"Grandma is willing , as cousin Maria wants her for a long visit , so everything looks promising and I really think I may go . ''"
PART FIVE -- My Sea Adventure 22 How My Sea Adventure Began THERE was no return of the mutineers -- not so much as another shot out of the woods .
"They had `` got their rations for that day , '' as the captain put it , and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner ."
"Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the danger , and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at , for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor 's patients ."
"Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action , only three still breathed -- that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole , Hunter , and Captain Smollett ; and of these , the first two were as good as dead ; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor 's knife , and Hunter , do what we could , never recovered consciousness in this world ."
"He lingered all day , breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit , but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling , and some time in the following night , without sign or sound , he went to his Maker ."
"As for the captain , his wounds were grievous indeed , but not dangerous ."
No organ was fatally injured .
"Anderson 's ball -- for it was Job that shot him first -- had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung , not badly ; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf ."
"He was sure to recover , the doctor said , but in the meantime , and for weeks to come , he must not walk nor move his arm , nor so much as speak when he could help it ."
My own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite .
Doctor Livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the bargain .
"After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain 's side awhile in consultation ; and when they had talked to their hearts ' content , it being then a little past noon , the doctor took up his hat and pistols , girt on a cutlass , put the chart in his pocket , and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly through the trees ."
"Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house , to be out of earshot of our officers consulting ; and Gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again , so thunder-struck he was at this occurrence ."
"`` Why , in the name of Davy Jones , '' said he , `` is Dr. Livesey mad ? ''"
"`` Why no , '' says I. `` He 's about the last of this crew for that , I take it . ''"
"`` Well , shipmate , '' said Gray , `` mad he may not be ; but if HE 'S not , you mark my words , I am . ''"
"`` I take it , '' replied I , `` the doctor has his idea ; and if I am right , he 's going now to see Ben Gunn . ''"
"I was right , as appeared later ; but in the meantime , the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun , I began to get another thought into my head , which was not by any means so right ."
"What I began to do was to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines , while I sat grilling , with my clothes stuck to the hot resin , and so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear ."
"All the time I was washing out the block house , and then washing up the things from dinner , this disgust and envy kept growing stronger and stronger , till at last , being near a bread-bag , and no one then observing me , I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit ."
"I was a fool , if you like , and certainly I was going to do a foolish , over-bold act ; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in my power ."
"These biscuits , should anything befall me , would keep me , at least , from starving till far on in the next day ."
"The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols , and as I already had a powder-horn and bullets , I felt myself well supplied with arms ."
"As for the scheme I had in my head , it was not a bad one in itself ."
"I was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea , find the white rock I had observed last evening , and ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat , a thing quite worth doing , as I still believe ."
"But as I was certain I should not be allowed to leave the enclosure , my only plan was to take French leave and slip out when nobody was watching , and that was so bad a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong ."
"But I was only a boy , and I had made my mind up ."
"Well , as things at last fell out , I found an admirable opportunity ."
"The squire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages , the coast was clear , I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the thickest of the trees , and before my absence was observed I was out of cry of my companions ."
"This was my second folly , far worse than the first , as I left but two sound men to guard the house ; but like the first , it was a help towards saving all of us ."
"I took my way straight for the east coast of the island , for I was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage ."
"It was already late in the afternoon , although still warm and sunny ."
"`` Well , if I could not be as I was , I 'd like to be a woman like that ."
"Only , I hope I shall not ! ''"
"answered Jill , thoughtfully at first , then coming out so decidedly with the last words that it was evident the life of a bedridden saint was not at all to her mind ."
`` So do I ; and I mean to believe that you will not .
"Meantime , we can try to make the waiting as useful and pleasant as possible ."
"This painful little back will be a sort of conscience to remind you of what you ought to do and leave undone , and so you can be learning obedience ."
"Then , when the body is strong , it will have formed a good habit to make duty easier ; and my Lucinda can be a sweet example , even while lying here , if she chooses . ''"
`` Can I ? ''
"and Jill 's eyes were full of softer tears as the comfortable , cheering words sank into her heart , to blossom slowly by and by into her life , for this was to be a long lesson , hard to learn , but very useful in the years to come ."
"When the boys returned , after the Latin was recited and peace restored , Jack showed her a recovered stamp promptly paid by Frank , who was as just as he was severe , and Jill asked for the old red one , though she did not tell why she wanted it , nor show it put away in the spelling-book , a little seal upon a promise made to be kept ."
Chapter VIII .
Merry and Molly Now let us see how the other missionaries got on with their tasks .
"Farmer Grant was a thrifty , well-to-do man , anxious to give his children greater advantages than he had enjoyed , and to improve the fine place of which he was justly proud ."
"Mrs. Grant was a notable housewife , as ambitious and industrious as her husband , but too busy to spend any time on the elegancies of life , though always ready to help the poor and sick like a good neighbor and Christian woman ."
"The three sons -- Tom , Dick , and Harry -- were big fellows of seventeen , nineteen , and twenty-one ; the first two on the farm , and the elder in a store just setting up for himself ."
"Kind-hearted but rough-mannered youths , who loved Merry very much , but teased her sadly about her `` fine lady airs , '' as they called her dainty ways and love of beauty ."
"Merry was a thoughtful girl , full of innocent fancies , refined tastes , and romantic dreams , in which no one sympathized at home , though she was the pet of the family ."
"It did seem , to an outsider , as if the delicate little creature had got there by mistake , for she looked very like a tea-rose in a field of clover and dandelions , whose highest aim in life was to feed cows and help make root beer ."
"When the girls talked over the new society , it pleased Merry very much , and she decided not only to try and love work better , but to convert her family to a liking for pretty things , as she called her own more cultivated tastes ."
"`` I will begin at once , and show them that I do n't mean to shirk my duty , though I do want to be nice , '' thought she , as she sat at supper one night and looked about her , planning her first move ."
"Not a very cheering prospect for a lover of the beautiful , certainly , for the big kitchen , though as neat as wax , had nothing lovely in it , except a red geranium blooming at the window ."
"Nor were the people all that could be desired , in some respects , as they sat about the table shovelling in pork and beans with their knives , drinking tea from their saucers , and laughing out with a hearty `` Haw , haw , '' when anything amused them ."
"Yet the boys were handsome , strong specimens , the farmer a hale , benevolent-looking man , the housewife a pleasant , sharp-eyed matron , who seemed to find comfort in looking often at the bright face at her elbow , with the broad forehead , clear eyes , sweet mouth , and quiet voice that came like music in among the loud masculine ones , or the quick , nervous tones of a woman always in a hurry ."
"Merry 's face was so thoughtful that evening that her father observed it , for , when at home , he watched her as one watches a kitten , glad to see anything so pretty , young , and happy , at its play ."
"`` Little daughter has got something on her mind , I mistrust ."
"Come and tell father all about it , '' he said , with a sounding slap on his broad knee as he turned his chair from the table to the ugly stove , where three pairs of wet boots steamed underneath , and a great kettle of cider apple-sauce simmered above ."
"`` When I 've helped clear up , I 'll come and talk ."
"Now , mother , you sit down and rest ; Roxy and I can do everything , '' answered Merry , patting the old rocking-chair so invitingly that the tired woman could not resist , especially as watching the kettle gave her an excuse for obeying ."
"`` Well , I do n't care if I do , for I 've been on my feet since five o'clock ."
"Be sure you cover things up , and shut the buttery door , and put the cat down cellar , and sift your meal ."
I 'll see to the buckwheats last thing before I go to bed . ''
"Mrs. Grant subsided with her knitting , for her hands were never idle ; Tom tilted his chair back against the wall and picked his teeth with his pen-knife ; Dick got out a little pot of grease , to make the boots water-tight ; and Harry sat down at the small table to look over his accounts , with an important air , -- for every one occupied this room , and the work was done in the out-kitchen behind ."
"`` You can tell me when I 've worked through that , '' says he , looking as fierce as a commander ."
"And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke , he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast , but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike ."
"The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the Royal George , that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast , and hearing ours well spoken of , I suppose , and described as lonely , had chosen it from the others for his place of residence ."
And that was all we could learn of our guest .
He was a very silent man by custom .
All day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope ; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong .
"Mostly he would not speak when spoken to , only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn ; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be ."
Every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road .
"At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question , but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them ."
"When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow -LRB- as now and then some did , making by the coast road for Bristol -RRB- he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour ; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present ."
"For me , at least , there was no secret about the matter , for I was , in a way , a sharer in his alarms ."
He had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my `` weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg '' and let him know the moment he appeared .
"Often enough when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage , he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down , but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it , bring me my four-penny piece , and repeat his orders to look out for `` the seafaring man with one leg . ''"
"How that personage haunted my dreams , I need scarcely tell you ."
"On stormy nights , when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs , I would see him in a thousand forms , and with a thousand diabolical expressions ."
"Now the leg would be cut off at the knee , now at the hip ; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg , and that in the middle of his body ."
To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares .
"And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece , in the shape of these abominable fancies ."
"But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg , I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him ."
"There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry ; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked , old , wild sea-songs , minding nobody ; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing ."
"Often I have heard the house shaking with `` Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum , '' all the neighbours joining in for dear life , with the fear of death upon them , and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark ."
"For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known ; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round ; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question , or sometimes because none was put , and so he judged the company was not following his story ."
Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed .
His stories were what frightened people worst of all .
"Dreadful stories they were -- about hanging , and walking the plank , and storms at sea , and the Dry Tortugas , and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main ."
"By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea , and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described ."
"My father was always saying the inn would be ruined , for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down , and sent shivering to their beds ; but I really believe his presence did us good ."
"People were frightened at the time , but on looking back they rather liked it ; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life , and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him , calling him a `` true sea-dog '' and a `` real old salt '' and such like names , and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea ."
"In one way , indeed , he bade fair to ruin us , for he kept on staying week after week , and at last month after month , so that all the money had been long exhausted , and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more ."
"If ever he mentioned it , the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared , and stared my poor father out of the room ."
"I have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff , and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death ."
All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker .
"Jill had more leisure as well as taste and skill than the other girls , so she amused herself with making a goodly store of pretty baskets of all shapes , sizes , and colors , quite confident that they would be filled , though not a flower had shown its head except a few hardy dandelions , and here and there a small cluster of saxifrage ."
"The violets would not open their blue eyes till the sunshine was warmer , the columbines refused to dance with the boisterous east wind , the ferns kept themselves rolled up in their brown flannel jackets , and little Hepatica , with many another spring beauty , hid away in the woods , afraid to venture out , in spite of the eager welcome awaiting them ."
"But the birds had come , punctual as ever , and the bluejays were screaming in the orchard , robins were perking up their heads and tails as they went house-hunting , purple finches in their little red hoods were feasting on the spruce buds , and the faithful chip birds chirped gayly on the grapevine trellis where they had lived all winter , warming their little gray breasts against the southern side of the house when the sun shone , and hiding under the evergreen boughs when the snow fell ."
"`` That tree is a sort of bird 's hotel , '' said Jill , looking out at the tall spruce before her window , every spray now tipped with a soft green ."
"`` They all go there to sleep and eat , and it has room for every one ."
"It is green when other trees die , the wind ca n't break it , and the snow only makes it look prettier ."
"It sings to me , and nods as if it knew I loved it . ''"
"`` We might call it ` The Holly Tree Inn , ' as some of the cheap eating-houses for poor people are called in the city , as my holly bush grows at its foot for a sign ."
"You can be the landlady , and feed your feathery customers every day , till the hard times are over , '' said Mrs. Minot , glad to see the child 's enjoyment of the outer world from which she had been shut so long ."
"Jill liked the fancy , and gladly strewed crumbs on the window ledge for the chippies , who came confidingly to eat almost from her hand ."
"She threw out grain for the handsome jays , the jaunty robins , and the neighbors ' doves , who came with soft flight to trip about on their pink feet , arching their shining necks as they cooed and pecked ."
"Carrots and cabbage-leaves also flew out of the window for the marauding gray rabbit , last of all Jack 's half-dozen , who led him a weary life of it because they would not stay in the Bunny-house , but undermined the garden with their burrows , ate the neighbors ' plants , and refused to be caught till all but one ran away , to Jack 's great relief ."
"This old fellow camped out for the winter , and seemed to get on very well among the cats and the hens , who shared their stores with him , and he might be seen at all hours of the day and night scampering about the place , or kicking up his heels by moonlight , for he was a desperate poacher ."
"Jill took great delight in her pretty pensioners , who soon learned to love `` The Holly Tree Inn , '' and to feel that the Bird Room held a caged comrade ; for , when it was too cold or wet to open the windows , the doves came and tapped at the pane , the chippies sat on the ledge in plump little bunches as if she were their sunshine , the jays called her in their shrill voices to ring the dinner-bell , and the robins tilted on the spruce boughs where lunch was always to be had ."
"The first of May came on Sunday , so all the celebrating must be done on Saturday , which happily proved fair , though too chilly for muslin gowns , paper garlands , and picnics on damp grass ."
"Being a holiday , the boys decided to devote the morning to ball and the afternoon to the flower hunt , while the girls finished the baskets ; and in the evening our particular seven were to meet at the Minots to fill them , ready for the closing frolic of hanging on door-handles , ringing bells , and running away ."
"`` Now I must do my Maying , for there will be no more sunshine , and I want to pick my flowers before it is dark ."
"Come , Mammy , you go too , '' said Jill , as the last sunbeams shone in at the western window where her hyacinths stood that no fostering ray might be lost ."
"It was rather pathetic to see the once merry girl who used to be the life of the wood-parties now carefully lifting herself from the couch , and , leaning on her mother 's strong arm , slowly take the half-dozen steps that made up her little expedition ."
"But she was happy , and stood smiling out at old Bun skipping down the walk , the gold-edged clouds that drew apart so that a sunbeam might give her a good-night kiss as she gathered her long-cherished daisies , primroses , and hyacinths to fill the pretty basket in her hand ."
"`` Who is it for , my dearie ? ''"
"asked her mother , standing behind her as a prop , while the thin fingers did their work so willingly that not a flower was left ."
"`` For My Lady , of course ."
"Who else would I give my posies to , when I love them so well ? ''"
"answered Jill , who thought no name too fine for their best friend ."
"`` I fancied it would be for Master Jack , '' said her mother , wishing the excursion to be a cheerful one ."
"`` I 've another for him , but she must have the prettiest ."
"He is going to hang it for me , and ring and run away , and she wo n't know who it 's from till she sees this ."
"She will remember it , for I 've been turning and tending it ever so long , to make it bloom to-day ."
Is n't it a beauty ? ''
"and Jill held up her finest hyacinth , which seemed to ring its pale pink bells as if glad to carry its sweet message from a grateful little heart ."
`` Indeed it is ; and you are right to give your best to her .
"""Heaven bless and help us! what a stout heart you have got!"" said the old dame. ""Don't you see we have got amongst Trolls?"""
"""Stuff and nonsense!"" said the lad; ""no harm if we have."""
"In a little while, back came the man with an ox so fat and big, the lad had never seen its like, and he gave it one blow with his fist under the ear, and down it fell dead on the floor. When that was done, he took it up by all the four legs and laid it on the glowing embers, and turned it and twisted it about till it was burnt brown outside."
"After that, he went to a cupboard and took out a great silver dish, and laid the ox on it; and the dish was so big that none of the ox hung over on any side. This he put on the table, and then he went down into the cellar and fetched a cask of wine, knocked out the head, and put the cask on the table, together with two knives, which were each six feet long. When this was done he bade them go and sit down to supper and eat. So they went, the lad first and the old dame after, but she began to whimper and wail, and to wonder how she should ever use such knives. But her son seized one, and began to cut slices out of the thigh of the ox, which he placed before his mother. And when they had eaten a bit, he took up the cask with both hands, and lifted it down to the floor; then he told his mother to come and drink, but it was still so high she couldn't reach up to it; so he caught her up, and held her up to the edge of the cask while she drank; as for himself, he clambered up and hung down like a cat inside the cask while he drank. So when he had quenched his thirst, he took up the cask and put it back on the table, and thanked the man for the good meal, and told his mother to come and thank him too, and, a-feared though she was, she dared do nothing else but thank the man. Then the lad sat down again alongside the man and began to gossip, and after they had sat a while the man said:"
"""Well! I must just go and get a bit of supper too;"" and so he went to the table and ate up the whole ox hoofs, and horns, and all and drained the cask to the last drop, and then went back and sat on the bench."
"""As for beds,"" he said, ""I don't know what's to be done. I've only got one bed and a cradle; but we could get on pretty well if you would sleep in the cradle, and then your mother might lie in the bed yonder."""
"""Thank you kindly, that'll do nicely,"" said the lad; and with that he pulled off his clothes and lay down in the cradle; but, to tell you the truth, it was quite as big as a four-poster. As for the old dame, she had to follow the man who showed her to bed, though she was out of her wits for fear."
"""Well!"" thought the lad to himself, ""'twill never do to go to sleep yet. I'd best lie awake and listen how things go as the night wears on."""
"So, after a while, the man began to talk to the old dame, and at last he said:"
"""We two might live here so happily together, could we only be rid of this son of yours."""
"""But do you know how to settle him? Is that what you're thinking of?"""
said she.
"""Nothing easier,"" said he; at any rate he would try. He would just say he wished the old dame would stay and keep house for him a day or two, and then he would take the lad out with him up the hill to quarry corner-stones, and roll down a great rock on him. All this the lad lay and listened to."
"Next day the Troll for it was a Troll as clear as day asked if the old dame would stay and keep house for him a few days; and as the day went on he took a great iron crowbar, and asked the lad if he had a mind to go with him up the hill and quarry a few corner-stones. With all his heart, he said, and went with him; and so, after they had split a few stones, the Troll wanted him to go down below and look after cracks in the rock; and while he was doing this the Troll worked away, and wearied himself with his crowbar till he moved a whole crag out of its bed, which came rolling right down on the place where the lad was; but he held it up till he could get on one side, and then let it roll on."
"""Oh!"" said the lad to the Troll, ""now I see what you mean to do with me. You want to crush me to death; so just go down yourself and look after the cracks and refts in the rock, and I'll stand up above."""
"The Troll did not dare to do otherwise than the lad bade him, and the end of it was that the lad rolled down a great rock, which fell upon the Troll and broke one of his thighs."
"""Well! you are in a sad plight,"" said the lad, as he strode down, lifted up the rock, and set the man free. After that he had to put him on his back and carry him home; so he ran with him as fast as a horse, and shook him so that the Troll screamed and screeched as if a knife were run into him. And when he got home, they had to put the Troll to bed, and there he lay in a sad pickle."
"When the night wore on, the Troll began to talk to the old dame again, and to wonder how ever they could be rid of the lad."
"""Well,"" said the old dame, ""if you can't hit on a plan to get rid of him, I'm sure I can't."""
"""Let me see,"" said the Troll; ""I've got twelve lions in a garden; if they could only get hold of the lad, they'd soon tear him to pieces."""
"So the old dame said it would be easy enough to get him there. She would sham sick, and say she felt so poorly, nothing would do her any good but lion's milk. All that the lad lay and listened to; and when he got up in the morning his mother said she was worse than she looked, and she thought she should never be right again unless she could get some lion's milk."
"""Then I'm afraid you'll be poorly a long time, mother,"" said the lad, ""for I'm sure I don't know where any is to be got."""
"""Oh! if that be all,"" said the Troll, ""there's no lack of lion's milk, if we only had the man to fetch it;"" and then he went on to say how his brother had a garden with twelve lions in it, and how the lad might have the key if he had a mind to milk the lions. So the lad took the key and a milking pail, and strode off; and when he unlocked the gate and got into the garden, there stood all the twelve lions on their hind-paws, rampant and roaring at him. But the lad laid hold of the biggest, and led him about by the fore-paws, and dashed him against stocks and stones till there wasn't a bit of him left but the two paws. So when the rest saw that, they were so afraid that they crept up and lay at his feet like so many curs. After that they followed him about wherever he went, and when he got home, they lay down outside the house, with their fore-paws on the door sill."
"""Now, mother, you'll soon be well,"" said the lad, when he went in, ""for here is the lion's milk."""
He had just milked a drop in the pail.
"But the Troll, as he lay in bed, swore it was all a lie. He was sure the lad was not the man to milk lions."
"When the lad heard that, he forced the Troll to get out of bed, threw open the door, and all the lions rose up and seized the Troll, and at last the lad had to make them leave their hold."
"That night the Troll began to talk to the old dame again. ""I'm sure I can't tell how to put this lad out of the way he is so awfully strong; can't you think of some way?"""
"""No,"" said the old dame, ""if you can't tell, I'm sure I can't."""
"""Well!"" said the Troll, ""I have two brothers in a castle; they are twelve times as strong as I am, and that's why I was turned out and had to put up with this farm. They hold that castle, and round it there is an orchard with apples in it, and whoever eats those apples sleeps for three days and three nights. If we could only get the lad to go for the fruit, he wouldn't be able to keep from tasting the apples, and as soon as ever he fell asleep my brothers would tear him in pieces."""
"The old dame said she would sham sick, and say she could never be herself again unless she tasted those apples; for she had set her heart on them."
All this the lad lay and listened to.
"While watching the immense destruction of these insects we were startled by the outbreak of the thunderstorm high up on the mountains, but far above the peals of thunder rose the terrible sound of rushing water. Animals now came tearing out of the lowlands too terrified to notice whither they went, so that I stood ready, gun in hand, in case any of the dangerous kind should try to seek an asylum on my particular hill; but with the exception of a huge wild boar, who had to be shot as he charged up the slope, all took refuge elsewhere."
"Soon the water burst through the river bank, spreading over the country, sweeping down the tall grass jungle and surging and roaring round our hill. Packing all that was valuable in small parcels, we gathered them in a heap, hoping that the flood would subside ere it reached the building. All round about large trees, uprooted by the terrible force of the deluge, were swept along, several animals vainly trying to keep a footing among their roots and branches. At last the water reached the steps of the house; so, pulling our boat close up, we stepped in with what we could save and hung to the wooden posts of the building, vainly trusting that the worst had come; but it was not so, for we soon had to leave go the post and pass the boat's rope round a tree. The water then rushed in, the house toppled over, and it and its contents were swept away by the flood."
"In a short time the tree began to shake and bend, so we knew that it was being uprooted; therefore, letting go the rope, we launched forth upon the seething waste of waters and were whirled away. Onward we rushed through masses of logs, branches, the remains of houses, and such like wreck, having to be very careful that our frail vessel did not get upset or crushed. Twice we made for the tops of hills that showed themselves above water, but on approaching them we found that they had been taken possession of by wild animals."
"Here a tiger crouched on a branch of a tree, seemingly too much alarmed at his perilous position to molest the half-dozen deer that crowded timidly together right underneath his perch. Up above him the smaller branches were stocked with monkeys, who looked very disconsolate at their enforced imprisonment. As we swept past, the tiger raised his head, gave a deep growl and showed his teeth, then crouched down again as if fully aware of his helplessness, and we had too much to think of ourselves to interfere with him."
"Gaining the open country, the scene was one of desolation; but the current was not so strong, so we turned round, seeing the flood was going down, and by nightfall we had got back to where the house had stood. Every vestige of the once pretty homestead had disappeared, with sheep and cattle, though the fowls had managed to find a roost on the topmost branches of some orange trees, which alone remained to mark the spot."
"As the moon rose, the mountaineers came down from the villages, and, embarking on rafts and in canoes, went round the different hills, shooting and spearing the animals that had swum there; and truly the sight of such a hunting scene was an exciting one. Here a stout stag, defending himself with his antlers as best he might against the spearsmen, kept up a gallant fight till death."
"The tiger we had seen in the morning took to swimming, and on being wounded with a spear turned on the nearest canoe, upsetting the hunters into the water, where a desperate encounter took place; but he was eventually dispatched by a blow from an ax not, however, before he had clawed some of his pursuers most severely."
"At daylight the water had entirely gone down, and a thick, muddy deposit covered all the lowland, while an immense number of snakes, scorpions, and other unpleasant creatures lay dead in all directions, upon which and the drowned animals vultures, crows and kites were feeding."
Queen Margaret and the Robbers.
There were once two kings of England at the same time. One was Henry VI.
"He was the rightful king, but a very weak and feeble man, and quite unfit to rule his kingdom."
"The other was young Edward, Duke of York, called Edward IV. He was made king by some of the nobles, who grew weary of Henry and his foolish deeds."
"A number of the English people were faithful to King Henry, but many others went over to King Edward's side, and there were quarrels between the two parties, which ended in a war. This war was called the War of the Roses, because the followers of Henry wore a red rose as their badge, and Edward's friends wore a white one."
"In one battle, fought at Hexham, the White Roses beat the Red ones, and King Henry was taken prisoner and sent to the Tower of London. His wife, Queen Margaret, with her little son, Prince Edward, escaped after the battle, and hid themselves in a wild forest. As they wandered among the trees, seeking some place where they might be safe from their enemies, they met a band of robbers. These rough men took away the queen's money and her jewels, tearing her necklace from her neck, and her rings from her fingers. Then they began to dispute as to who should have most of the stolen goods. And while they quarrelled, Queen Margaret took her little boy by the hand and ran away to a thick part of the wood. There they stayed until the angry voices of the robbers could no longer be heard, and then, in the growing darkness, they came stealthily from their hiding-place. They wandered on, knowing not where to go, hoping much to meet some of their friends, and fearing still more to be found by their enemies, the soldiers of the White Rose. But, alas! they saw no kind face, and night came on. Then, as they crept fearfully from tree to tree, they met another robber."
"The poor queen was much afraid that this robber, who looked very fierce, would kill her and the prince, because she had no riches left to give him. In despair she threw herself upon her knees before him, and said:"
"""My friend, this is the son of your king. I give him into your care."""
"The robber was much surprised to see the queen and the prince alone, with their clothes torn and stained, and their faces white from hunger and fatigue. But he was a kindhearted man, although his looks were rough, and before he became a robber he had been a follower of King Henry, so he was quite willing to do his best for the little prince. He took the boy in his arms, and led the way to a cave in the forest, where he lived with his wife. And in this poor shelter, the queen and her son stayed for two days, listening to every sound, and fearing that their enemies would find them. On the third day, however, the friendly robber met some of the lords of the Red Rose in the forest, and led them to the cave. The queen and prince were overjoyed to see their friends, and soon they escaped with them to a place of safety."
"Their hiding-place has been called ""Queen Margaret's Cave"" ever since that time. If you go to Hexham Forest, you will be able to see it."
William Caxton
"In old days, books were not printed as they are now; they were written by hand. This took a long time to do, so there were not many books, and they were so dear that only the rich could buy them."
"But after a time, some clever men made a machine, called a printing-press, which could print letters."
"About that time, an Englishman, named William Caxton, lived in Holland, and copied books for a great lady. He says his hand grew tired with writing, and his eyes became dim with much looking on white paper. So he learned how to print, and had a printing-press made for himself, which he brought to England. He set it up in a little shop in London, and then he began to print books. He printed books of all sorts tales, and poetry, and history, and prayers, and sermons. In the time which it had formerly taken him to write one book, he could now print thousands."
"All sorts of people crowded to his shop to see Caxton's wonderful press; sometimes the king went with his nobles. Many of them took written books with them, which they wished to have put into print. Some people asked Caxton to use in his books the most curious words he could find; others wished him to print only old and homely words. Caxton liked best the common, simple words which men used daily in their speech."
"Caxton did a very good thing when he brought the printing-press to England, for, after that, books became much cheaper, so that many people could buy them, and learning spread in the land."
Sir Philip Sidney
"When Elizabeth was Queen of England it was a time of great deeds and great men. The queen was brave and clever herself, so she liked to have brave and clever people around her. Great soldiers, and writers, and statesmen went to her court; and when brave seamen came back from their voyages to unknown lands far away, they were invited by the queen to visit her, and tell her of all the strange places and people they had seen. In this Elizabeth was wise, for men did their best to show themselves worthy of her favours."
"Among all the great men at court, none was more beloved than Sir Philip Sidney. He was called ""the darling of the court""."
"At that time, there was much trouble and many wars in some other countries, where people were fighting for the right to worship God in their own way. Philip Sidney heard of these things when he was a boy in his father's house, and his heart was stirred with pity. Later, when he was in France, a great number of people were cruelly killed because they would not pray in the way which the king ordered. Sidney never forgot the dreadful sights and sounds of that sad time, and when Queen Elizabeth sent an army to help the people of Holland, who were fighting for their freedom, he asked for leave to go with it. This was granted to him, and he was made one of the leaders."
"One eye, sleepest thou?”"
"until One-eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as Two-eyes saw that One-eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was satisfied, and then she again cried,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and in an instant all was gone. Two-eyes now awakened One-eye, and said, “One-eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to sleep while you are doing it, and in the meantime the goat might run all over the world. Come, let us go home again.” So they went home, and again Two-eyes let her little dish stand untouched, and One-eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and to excuse herself said, “I fell asleep when I was out.”"
"Next day the mother said to Three-eyes, “This time thou shalt go and observe if Two-eyes eats anything when she is out, and if any one fetches her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.” So Three-eyes went to Two-eyes, and said, “I will go with you and see if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.” But Two-eyes knew what was in Three-eyes’ mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, “We will sit down, and I will sing something to you, Three-eyes.” Three-eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes began the same song as before, and sang,"
"“Three eyes, are you waking?”"
"but then, instead of singing,"
"“Three eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"as she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang,"
"“Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"and sang all the time,"
"“Three eyes, are you waking?"
"Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"Then two of the eyes which Three-eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep. It is true that Three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very well. And when Two-eyes thought that Three-eyes was fast asleep, she used her little charm,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the table to go away again,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and Three-eyes had seen everything. Then Two-eyes came to her, waked her and said, “Have you been asleep, Three-eyes? You are a good care-taker! Come, we will go home.” And when they got home, Two-eyes again did not eat, and Three-eyes said to the mother, “Now, I know why that high-minded thing there does not eat. When she is out, she says to the goat,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and then a little table appears before her covered with the best of food, much better than any we have here, and when she has eaten all she wants, she says,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and all disappears. I watched everything closely. She put two of my eyes to sleep by using a certain form of words, but luckily the one in my forehead kept awake.” Then the envious mother cried, “Dost thou want to fare better than we do? The desire shall pass away,” and she fetched a butcher’s knife, and thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down dead."
"When Two-eyes saw that, she went out full of trouble, seated herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter tears."
"Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side, and said, “Two-eyes, why art thou weeping?” “Have I not reason to weep?” she answered. “The goat which covered the table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.” The wise woman said, “Two-eyes, I will give thee a piece of good advice; ask thy sisters to give thee the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in the ground in front of the house, and thy fortune will be made.” Then she vanished, and Two-eyes went home and said to her sisters, “Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat; I don’t wish for what is good, but give me the entrails.” Then they laughed and said, “If that’s all you want, you can have it.” So Two-eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door, as the wise woman had counselled her to do."
"Next morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there stood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit of gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was nothing more beautiful or precious. They did not know how the tree could have come there during the night, but Two-eyes saw that it had grown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the exact spot where she had buried them. Then the mother said to One-eye, “Climb up, my child, and gather some of the fruit of the tree for us.”"
"One-eye climbed up, but when she was about to get hold of one of the golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands, and that happened each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple, let her do what she might. Then said the mother, “Three-eyes, do you climb up; you with your three eyes can look about you better than One-eye.” One-eye slipped down, and Three-eyes climbed up. Three-eyes was not more skilful, and might search as she liked, but the golden apples always escaped her. At length the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but could get hold of the fruit no better than One-eye and Three-eyes, for she always clutched empty air. Then said Two-eyes, “I will just go up, perhaps I may succeed better.” The sisters cried, “You indeed, with your two eyes, what can you do?” But Two-eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did get out of her way, but came into her hand of their own accord, so that she could pluck them one after the other, and brought a whole apronful down with her. The mother took them away from her, and instead of treating poor Two-eyes any better for this, she and One-eye and Three-eyes were only envious, because Two-eyes alone had been able to get the fruit, and they treated her still more cruelly."
"It so befell that once when they were all standing together by the tree, a young knight came up. “Quick, Two-eyes,” cried the two sisters, “creep under this, and don’t disgrace us!” and with all speed they turned an empty barrel which was standing close by the tree over poor Two-eyes, and they pushed the golden apples which she had been gathering, under it too. When the knight came nearer he was a handsome lord, who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and silver tree, and said to the two sisters, “To whom does this fine tree belong? Any one who would bestow one branch of it on me might in return for it ask whatsoever he desired.” Then One-eye and Three-eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him a branch. They both took great trouble, but they were not able to do it, for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time. Then said the knight, “It is very strange that the tree should belong to you, and that you should still not be able to break a piece off.” They again asserted that the tree was their property. Whilst they were saying so, Two-eyes rolled out a couple of golden apples from under the barrel to the feet of the knight, for she was vexed with One-eye and Three-eyes, for not speaking the truth. When the knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked where they came from. One-eye and Three-eyes answered that they had another sister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two eyes like any common person. The knight, however, desired to see her, and cried, “Two-eyes, come forth.” Then Two-eyes, quite comforted, came from beneath the barrel, and the knight was surprised at her great beauty, and said, “Thou, Two-eyes, canst certainly break off a branch from the tree for me.” “Yes,” replied Two-eyes, “that I certainly shall be able to do, for the tree belongs to me.” And she climbed up, and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and gave it to the knight."
"Then said the knight, “Two-eyes, what shall I give thee for it?”"
"“Alas!” answered Two-eyes, “I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and want, from early morning till late night; if you would take me with you, and deliver me from these things, I should be happy.” So the knight lifted Two-eyes on to his horse, and took her home with him to his father’s castle, and there he gave her beautiful clothes, and meat and drink to her heart’s content, and as he loved her so much he married her, and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. When Two-eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight, her two sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest. “The wonderful tree, however, still remains with us,” thought they, “and even if we can gather no fruit from it, still every one will stand still and look at it, and come to us and admire it. Who knows what good things may be in store for us?” But next morning, the tree had vanished, and all their hopes were at an end. And when Two-eyes looked out of the window of her own little room, to her great delight it was standing in front of it, and so it had followed her."
"Two-eyes lived a long time in happiness. Once two poor women came to her in her castle, and begged for alms. She looked in their faces, and recognized her sisters, One-eye, and Three-eyes, who had fallen into such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from door to door. Two-eyes, however, made them welcome, and was kind to them, and took care of them, so that they both with all their hearts repented the evil that they had done their sister in their youth."
184 The Nail
"A merchant had done good business at the fair; he had sold his wares, and lined his money-bags with gold and silver. Then he wanted to travel homewards, and be in his own house before nightfall. So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse, and rode away."
"At noon he rested in a town, and when he wanted to go farther the stable-boy brought out his horse and said, “A nail is wanting, sir, in the shoe of its left hind foot.” “Let it be wanting,” answered the merchant; “the shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles I have still to go. I am in a hurry.”"
"In the afternoon, when he once more alighted and had his horse fed, the stable-boy went into the room to him and said, “Sir, a shoe is missing from your horse’s left hind foot. Shall I take him to the blacksmith?”"
"“Let it still be wanting,” answered the man; “the horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which remain. I am in haste.”"
"He rode forth, but before long the horse began to limp. It had not limped long before it began to stumble, and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg. The merchant was forced to leave the horse where it was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it on his back, and go home on foot. And there he did not arrive until quite late at night. “And that unlucky nail,” said he to himself, “has caused all this disaster.”"
Hasten slowly.
185 The Poor Boy in the Grave
"There was once a poor shepherd-boy whose father and mother were dead, and he was placed by the authorities in the house of a rich man, who was to feed him and bring him up. The man and his wife, had however, bad hearts, and were greedy and anxious about their riches, and vexed whenever any one put a morsel of their bread in his mouth. The poor young fellow might do what he liked, he got little to eat, but only so many blows the more."
"One day he had to watch a hen and her chickens, but she ran through a quick-set hedge with them, and a hawk darted down instantly, and carried her off through the air. The boy called, “Thief! thief!"
rascal!” with all the strength of his body. But what good did that do?
"The hawk did not bring its prey back again. The man heard the noise, and ran to the spot, and as soon as he saw that his hen was gone, he fell in a rage, and gave the boy such a beating that he could not stir for two days. Then he had to take care of the chickens without the hen, but now his difficulty was greater, for one ran here and the other there. He thought he was doing a very wise thing when he tied them all together with a string, because then the hawk would not be able to steal any of them away from him. But he was very much mistaken. After two days, worn out with running about and hunger, he fell asleep; the bird of prey came, and seized one of the chickens, and as the others were tied fast to it, it carried them all off together, perched itself on a tree, and devoured them. The farmer was just coming home, and when he saw the misfortune, he got angry and beat the boy so unmercifully that he was forced to lie in bed for several days."
"When he was on his legs again, the farmer said to him, “Thou art too stupid for me, I cannot make a herdsman of thee, thou must go as errand-boy.” Then he sent him to the judge, to whom he was to carry a basketful of grapes, and he gave him a letter as well. On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy so violently that he ate two of the bunches of grapes. He took the basket to the judge, but when the judge had read the letter, and counted the bunches he said, “Two clusters are wanting.” The boy confessed quite honestly that, driven by hunger and thirst, he had devoured the two which were wanting. The judge wrote a letter to the farmer, and asked for the same number of grapes again. These also the boy had to take to him with a letter. As he again was so extremely hungry and thirsty, he could not help it, and again ate two bunches. But first he took the letter out of the basket, put it under a stone and seated himself thereon in order that the letter might not see and betray him. The judge, however, again made him give an explanation about the missing bunches. “Ah,” said the boy, “how have you learnt that? The letter could not know about it, for I put it under a stone before I did it.” The judge could not help laughing at the boy’s simplicity, and sent the man a letter wherein he cautioned him to keep the poor boy better, and not let him want for meat and drink, and also that he was to teach him what was right and what was wrong."
"“I will soon show thee the difference,” said the hard man, “if thou wilt eat, thou must work, and if thou dost anything wrong, thou shalt be quite sufficiently taught by blows.”"
"The next day he set him a hard task. He was to chop two bundles of straw for food for the horses, and then the man threatened: “In five hours,” said he, “I shall be back again, and if the straw is not cut to chaff by that time, I will beat thee until thou canst not move a limb.”"
"The farmer went with his wife, the man-servant and the girl, to the yearly fair, and left nothing behind for the boy but a small bit of bread. The boy seated himself on the bench, and began to work with all his might. As he got warm over it he put his little coat off and threw it on the straw. In his terror lest he should not get done in time he kept constantly cutting, and in his haste, without noticing it, he chopped his little coat as well as the straw. He became aware of the misfortune too late; there was no repairing it. “Ah,” cried he, “now all is over with me! The wicked man did not threaten me for nothing; if he comes back and sees what I have done, he will kill me. Rather than that I will take my own life.”"
"The boy had once heard the farmer’s wife say, “I have a pot with poison in it under my bed.” She, however, had only said that to keep away greedy people, for there was honey in it. The boy crept under the bed, brought out the pot, and ate all that was in it. “I do not know,” said he, “folks say death is bitter, but it tastes very sweet to me. It is no wonder that the farmer’s wife has so often longed for death.” He seated himself in a little chair, and was prepared to die. But instead of becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing food."
"“It cannot have been poison,” thought he, “but the farmer once said there was a small bottle of poison for flies in the box in which he keeps his clothes; that, no doubt, will be the true poison, and bring death to me.” It was, however, no poison for flies, but Hungarian wine."
"The boy got out the bottle, and emptied it. “This death tastes sweet too,” said he, but shortly after when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy him, he thought his end was drawing near. “I feel that I must die,” said he, “I will go away to the churchyard, and seek a grave.” He staggered out, reached the churchyard, and laid himself in a newly dug grave. He lost his senses more and more. In the neighbourhood was an inn where a wedding was being kept; when he heard the music, he fancied he was already in Paradise, until at length he lost all consciousness. The poor boy never awoke again; the heat of the strong wine and the cold night-dew deprived him of life, and he remained in the grave in which he had laid himself."
"When the farmer heard the news of the boy’s death he was terrified, and afraid of being brought to justice indeed, his distress took such a powerful hold of him that he fell fainting to the ground. His wife, who was standing on the hearth with a pan of hot fat, ran to him to help him. But the flames darted against the pan, the whole house caught fire, in a few hours it lay in ashes, and the rest of the years they had to live they passed in poverty and misery, tormented by the pangs of conscience."
186 The True Sweethearts
"There was once on a time a girl who was young and beautiful, but she had lost her mother when she was quite a child, and her step-mother did all she could to make the girl’s life wretched. Whenever this woman gave her anything to do, she worked at it indefatigably, and did everything that lay in her power. Still she could not touch the heart of the wicked woman by that; she was never satisfied; it was never enough. The harder the girl worked, the more work was put upon her, and all that the woman thought of was how to weigh her down with still heavier burdens, and make her life still more miserable."
"One day she said to her, “Here are twelve pounds of feathers which thou must pick, and if they are not done this evening, thou mayst expect a good beating. Dost thou imagine thou art to idle away the whole day?”"
"The poor girl sat down to the work, but tears ran down her cheeks as she did so, for she saw plainly enough that it was quite impossible to finish the work in one day. Whenever she had a little heap of feathers lying before her, and she sighed or smote her hands together in her anguish, they flew away, and she had to pick them out again, and begin her work anew. Then she put her elbows on the table, laid her face in her two hands, and cried, “Is there no one, then, on God’s earth to have pity on me?” Then she heard a low voice which said, “Be comforted, my child, I have come to help thee.” The maiden looked up, and an old woman was by her side. She took the girl kindly by the hand, and said, “Only tell me what is troubling thee.” As she spoke so kindly, the girl told her of her miserable life, and how one burden after another was laid upon her, and she never could get to the end of the work which was given to her. “If I have not done these feathers by this evening, my step-mother will beat me; she has threatened she will, and I know she keeps her word.” Her tears began to flow again, but the good old woman said, “Do not be afraid, my child; rest a while, and in the meantime I will look to thy work.” The girl lay down on her bed, and soon fell asleep. The old woman seated herself at the table with the feathers, and how they did fly off the quills, which she scarcely touched with her withered hands! The twelve pounds were soon finished, and when the girl awoke, great snow-white heaps were lying, piled up, and everything in the room was neatly cleared away, but the old woman had vanished."
"The maiden thanked God, and sat still till evening came, when the step-mother came in and marvelled to see the work completed. “Just look, you awkward creature,” said she, “what can be done when people are industrious; and why couldst thou not set about something else?"
"There thou sittest with thy hands crossed.” When she went out she said, “The creature is worth more than her salt. I must give her some work that is still harder.”"
"Next morning she called the girl, and said, “There is a spoon for thee; with that thou must empty out for me the great pond which is beside the garden, and if it is not done by night, thou knowest what will happen.”"
"The girl took the spoon, and saw that it was full of holes; but even if it had not been, she never could have emptied the pond with it. She set to work at once, knelt down by the water, into which her tears were falling, and began to empty it. But the good old woman appeared again, and when she learnt the cause of her grief, she said, “Be of good cheer, my child. Go into the thicket and lie down and sleep; I will soon do thy work.” As soon as the old woman was alone, she barely touched the pond, and a vapour rose up on high from the water, and mingled itself with the clouds. Gradually the pond was emptied, and when the maiden awoke before sunset and came thither, she saw nothing but the fishes which were struggling in the mud. She went to her step-mother, and showed her that the work was done. “It ought to have been done long before this,” said she, and grew white with anger, but she meditated something new."
"On the third morning she said to the girl, “Thou must build me a castle on the plain there, and it must be ready by the evening.” The maiden was dismayed, and said, “How can I complete such a great work?” “I will endure no opposition,” screamed the step-mother. “If thou canst empty a pond with a spoon that is full of holes, thou canst build a castle too."
"I will take possession of it this very day, and if anything is wanting, even if it be the most trifling thing in the kitchen or cellar, thou knowest what lies before thee!” She drove the girl out, and when she entered the valley, the rocks were there, piled up one above the other, and all her strength would not have enabled her even to move the very smallest of them. She sat down and wept, and still she hoped the old woman would help her. The old woman was not long in coming; she comforted her and said, “Lie down there in the shade and sleep, and I will soon build the castle for thee. If it would be a pleasure to thee, thou canst live in it thyself.” When the maiden had gone away, the old woman touched the gray rocks. They began to rise, and immediately moved together as if giants had built the walls; and on these the building arose, and it seemed as if countless hands were working invisibly, and placing one stone upon another. There was a dull heavy noise from the ground; pillars arose of their own accord on high, and placed themselves in order near each other. The tiles laid themselves in order on the roof, and when noon-day came, the great weather-cock was already turning itself on the summit of the tower, like a golden figure of the Virgin with fluttering garments. The inside of the castle was being finished while evening was drawing near. How the old woman managed it, I know not; but the walls of the rooms were hung with silk and velvet, embroidered chairs were there, and richly ornamented arm-chairs by marble tables; crystal chandeliers hung down from the ceilings, and mirrored themselves in the smooth pavement; green parrots were there in gilt cages, and so were strange birds which sang most beautifully, and there was on all sides as much magnificence as if a king were going to live there. The sun was just setting when the girl awoke, and the brightness of a thousand lights flashed in her face. She hurried to the castle, and entered by the open door. The steps were spread with red cloth, and the golden balustrade beset with flowering trees. When she saw the splendour of the apartment, she stood as if turned to stone."
"Who knows how long she might have stood there if she had not remembered the step-mother? “Alas!” she said to herself, “if she could but be satisfied at last, and would give up making my life a misery to me.”"
"The girl went and told her that the castle was ready. “I will move into it at once,” said she, and rose from her seat. When they entered the castle, she was forced to hold her hand before her eyes, the brilliancy of everything was so dazzling. “Thou seest,” said she to the girl, “how easy it has been for thee to do this; I ought to have given thee something harder.” She went through all the rooms, and examined every corner to see if anything was wanting or defective; but she could discover nothing. “Now we will go down below,” said she, looking at the girl with malicious eyes. “The kitchen and the cellar still have to be examined, and if thou hast forgotten anything thou shalt not escape thy punishment.” But the fire was burning on the hearth, and the meat was cooking in the pans, the tongs and shovel were leaning against the wall, and the shining brazen utensils all arranged in sight. Nothing was wanting, not even a coal-box and water-pail. “Which is the way to the cellar?” she cried. “If that is not abundantly filled, it shall go ill with thee.” She herself raised up the trap-door and descended; but she had hardly made two steps before the heavy trap-door which was only laid back, fell down. The girl heard a scream, lifted up the door very quickly to go to her aid, but she had fallen down, and the girl found her lying lifeless at the bottom."
157 The Sparrow And His Four Children
"A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow’s nest. When they were fledged, some naughty boys pulled out the nest, but fortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind. Then the old bird was grieved that as his sons had all gone out into the world, he had not first warned them of every kind of danger, and given them good instruction how to deal with each. In the autumn a great many sparrows assembled together in a wheatfield, and there the old bird met his four children again, and full of joy took them home with him. “Ah, my dear sons, what pain I have been in about you all through the summer, because you got away in the wind without my teaching; listen to my words, obey your father, and be well on your guard. Little birds have to encounter great dangers!” And then he asked the eldest where he had spent the summer, and how he had supported himself? “I stayed in the gardens, and looked for caterpillars and small worms, until the cherries got ripe.” “Ah, my son,” said the father, “tit-bits are not bad, but there is great risk about them; on that account take great care of thyself henceforth, and particularly when people are going about the gardens who carry long green poles which are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top.”"
"“Yes, father, but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole with wax?” said the son. “Where hast thou seen that?” “In a merchant’s garden,” said the youngster. “Oh, my son, merchant folks are quick folks,” said the father. “If thou hast been among the children of the world, thou hast learned worldly shiftiness enough, only see that thou usest it well, and do not be too confident.” After this he asked the next, “Where hast thou passed thy time?” “At court,” said the son."
"“Sparrows and silly little birds are of no use in that place—there one finds much gold, velvet, silk, armour, harnesses, sparrow-hawks, screech-owls and hen-harriers; keep to the horses’ stable where they winnow oats, or thresh, and then fortune may give thee thy daily grain of corn in peace.” “Yes, father,” said the son, “but when the stable-boys make traps and fix their gins and snares in the straw, many a one is caught fast.” “Where hast thou seen that?” said the old bird."
"“At court, among the stable-boys.” “Oh, my son, court boys are bad boys! If thou hast been to court and among the lords, and hast left no feathers there, thou hast learnt a fair amount, and wilt know very well how to go about the world, but look around thee and above thee, for the wolves devour the wisest dogs.” The father examined the third also:"
"“Where didst thou seek thy safety?” “I have broken up tubs and ropes on the cart-roads and highways, and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley.” “That is indeed dainty fare,” said the father, “but take care what thou art about and look carefully around, especially when thou seest any one stooping and about to pick up a stone, there is not much time to stay then.” “That is true,” said the son, “but what if any one should carry a bit of rock, or ore, ready beforehand in his breast or pocket?” “Where hast thou seen that?” “Among the mountaineers, dear father; when they go out, they generally take little bits of ore with them.” “Mountain folks are working folks, and clever folks. If thou hast been among mountain lads, thou hast seen and learnt something, but when thou goest thither beware, for many a sparrow has been brought to a bad end by a mountain boy.” At length the father came to the youngest son: “Thou, my dear chirping nestling, wert always the silliest and weakest; stay with me, the world has many rough, wicked birds which have crooked beaks and long claws, and lie in wait for poor little birds and swallow them. Keep with those of thine own kind, and pick up little spiders and caterpillars from the trees, or the house, and then thou wilt live long in peace.” “My dear father, he who feeds himself without injury to other people fares well, and no sparrow-hawk, eagle, or kite will hurt him if he specially commits himself and his lawful food, evening and morning, faithfully to God, who is the Creator and Preserver of all forest and village birds, who likewise heareth the cry and prayer of the young ravens, for no sparrow or wren ever falls to the ground except by his will.” “Where hast thou learnt this?” The son answered, “When the great blast of wind tore me away from thee I came to a church, and there during the summer I have picked up the flies and spiders from the windows, and heard this discourse preached. The Father of all sparrows fed me all the summer through, and kept me from all mischance and from ferocious birds.”"
"“In sooth, my dear son, if thou takest refuge in the churches and helpest to clear away spiders and buzzing flies, and criest unto God like the young ravens, and commendest thyself to the eternal Creator, all will be well with thee, and that even if the whole world were full of wild malicious birds.”"
"“He who to God commits his ways, In silence suffers, waits, and prays, Preserves his faith and conscience pure, He is of God’s protection sure.”"
158 The Story of Schlauraffen Land
"In the time of Schlauraffen I went there, and saw Rome and the Lateran hanging by a small silken thread, and a man without feet who outran a swift horse, and a keen sharp sword that cut through a bridge. There I saw a young ass with a silver nose which pursued two fleet hares, and a lime-tree that was very large, on which hot cakes were growing. There I saw a lean old goat which carried about a hundred cart-loads of fat on his body, and sixty loads of salt. Have I not told enough lies? There I saw a plough ploughing without horse or cow, and a child of one year threw four millstones from Ratisbon to Treves, and from Treves to Strasburg, and a hawk swam over the Rhine, which he had a perfect right to do. There I heard some fishes begin to make such a disturbance with each other, that it resounded as far as heaven, and sweet honey flowed like water from a deep valley at the top of a high mountain, and these were strange things. There were two crows which were mowing a meadow, and I saw two gnats building a bridge, and two doves tore a wolf to pieces; two children brought forth two kids, and two frogs threshed corn together. There I saw two mice consecrating a bishop, and two cats scratching out a bear’s tongue. Then a snail came running up and killed two furious lions. There stood a barber and shaved a woman’s beard off; and two sucking-children bade their mother hold her tongue. There I saw two greyhounds which brought a mill out of the water; and a sorry old horse was beside it, and said it was right. And four horses were standing in the yard threshing corn with all their might, and two goats were heating the stove, and a red cow shot the bread into the oven."
"Then a cock crowed, Cock-a-doodle-doo! The story is all told,—Cock-a-doodle-doo!"
159 The Ditmarsch Tale of Wonders
"I will tell you something. I saw two roasted fowls flying; they flew quickly and had their breasts turned to heaven and their backs to hell, and an anvil and a mill-stone swam across the Rhine prettily, slowly, and gently, and a frog sat on the ice at Whitsuntide and ate a ploughshare. Three fellows who wanted to catch a hare, went on crutches and stilts; one of them was deaf, the second blind, the third dumb, and the fourth could not stir a step. Do you want to know how it was done?"
"First, the blind man saw the hare running across the field, the dumb one called to the lame one, and the lame one seized it by the neck."
"There were certain men who wished to sail on dry land, and they set their sails in the wind, and sailed away over great fields. Then they sailed over a high mountain, and there they were miserably drowned. A crab was chasing a hare which was running away at full speed, and high up on the roof lay a cow which had climbed up there. In that country the flies are as big as the goats are here. Open the window, that the lies may fly out."
160 A Riddling Tale
"Three women were changed into flowers which grew in the field, but one of them was allowed to be in her own home at night. Then once when day was drawing near, and she was forced to go back to her companions in the field and become a flower again, she said to her husband, “If thou wilt come this afternoon and gather me, I shall be set free and henceforth stay with thee.” And he did so. Now the question is, how did her husband know her, for the flowers were exactly alike, and without any difference? Answer: as she was at her home during the night and not in the field, no dew fell on her as it did on the others, and by this her husband knew her."
161 Snow-White and Rose-Red
"There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her house-work, or read to her when there was nothing to do."
"The two children were so fond of each another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said, “We will not leave each other,” Rose-red answered, “Never so long as we live,” and their mother would add, “What one has she must share with the other.”"
"They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew."
"No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and had no distress on their account."
"Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went away into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children."
"Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the wrekin."
"The kettle was of copper and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said, “Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,” and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and span. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings."
"One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, some one knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said, “Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.” Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door."
"Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began to speak and said, “Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm!"
"I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.”"
"“Poor bear,” said the mother, “lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.” Then she cried, “Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.” So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said, “Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little;” so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out, “Leave me alive, children,"
"“Snowy-white, Rosy-red, Will you beat your lover dead?”"
"When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear, “You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.” As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest."
"Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived."
"""It'll come again, I'll be bound,"" thought Boots; but no, it didn't come again; still it was, and still it stayed; but after he had lain a little while, he heard a noise as if a horse were standing just outside the barn-door, and cropping the grass. He stole to the door, and peeped through a chink, and there stood a horse feeding away. So big, and fat, and grand a horse, Boots had never set eyes on; by his side on the grass lay a saddle and bridle, and a full set of armour for a knight, all of brass, so bright that the light gleamed from it."
"""Ho, ho!"" thought the lad; ""it's you, is it, that eats up our hay?"
"I'll soon put a spoke in your wheel, just see if I don't."""
"So he lost no time, but took the steel out of his tinder-box, and threw it over the horse; then it had no power to stir from the spot, and became so tame that the lad could do what he liked with it. So he got on its back, and rode off with it to a place which no one knew of, and there he put up the horse. When he got home, his brothers laughed and asked how he had fared?"
"""You didn't lie long in the barn, even if you had the heart to go so far as the field."""
"""Well,"" said Boots, ""all I can say is, I lay in the barn till the sun rose, and neither saw nor heard anything; I can't think what there was in the barn to make you both so afraid."""
"""A pretty story,"" said his brothers; ""but we'll soon see how you have watched the meadow;"" so they set off; but when they reached it, there stood the grass as deep and thick as it had been over night."
"Well, the next St. John's eve it was the same story over again; neither of the elder brothers dared to go out to the outlying field to watch the crop; but Boots, he had the heart to go, and everything happened just as it had happened the year before. First a clatter and an earthquake, then a greater clatter and another earthquake, and so on a third time; only this year the earthquakes were far worse than the year before. Then all at once everything was as still as death, and the lad heard how something was cropping the grass outside the barn-door, so he stole to the door, and peeped through a chink; and what do you think he saw? Why, another horse standing right up against the wall, and chewing and champing with might and main. It was far finer and fatter than that which came the year before, and it had a saddle on its back, and a bridle on its neck, and a full suit of mail for a knight lay by its side, all of silver, and as grand as you would wish to see."
"""Ho, ho!"" said Boots to himself; ""it's you that gobbles up our hay, is it? I'll soon put a spoke in your wheel;"" and with that he took the steel out of his tinder-box, and threw it over the horse's crest, which stood as still as a lamb. Well, the lad rode this horse, too, to the hiding-place where he kept the other one, and after that he went home."
"""I suppose you'll tell us,"" said one of his brothers, ""there's a fine crop this year too, up in the hayfield."""
"""Well, so there is,"" said Boots; and off ran the others to see, and there stood the grass thick and deep, as it was the year before; but they didn't give Boots softer words for all that."
"Now, when the third St. John's eve came, the two elder brothers still hadn't the heart to lie out in the barn and watch the grass, for they had got so scared at heart the nights they lay there before, that they couldn't get over the fright; but Boots, he dared to go; and, to make a very long story short, the very same thing happened this time as had happened twice before. Three earthquakes came, one after the other, each worse than the one which went before, and when the last came, the lad danced about with the shock from one barn wall to the other; and after that, all at once, it was still as death. Now when he had laid a little while, he heard something tugging away at the grass outside the barn, so he stole again to the door-chink, and peeped out, and there stood a horse close outside far, far bigger and fatter than the two he had taken before."
"""Ho, ho!"" said the lad to himself, ""it's you, is it, that comes here eating up our hay? I'll soon stop that I'll soon put a spoke in your wheel."" So he caught up his steel and threw it over his horse's neck, and in a trice it stood as if it were nailed to the ground, and Boots could do as he pleased with it. Then he rode off with it to the hiding-place where he kept the other two, and then went home. When he got home, his two brothers made game of him as they had done before, saying, they could see he had watched the grass well, for he looked for all the world as if he were walking in his sleep, and many other spiteful things they said, but Boots gave no heed to them, only asking them to go and see for themselves; and when they went, there stood the grass as fine and deep this time as it had been twice before."
"Now, you must know that the king of the country where Boots lived had a daughter, whom he would only give to the man who could ride up over the hill of glass, for there was a high, high hill, all of glass, as smooth and slippery as ice, close by the King's palace. Upon the tip top of the hill the King's daughter was to sit, with three golden apples in her lap, and the man who could ride up and carry off the three golden apples, was to have half the kingdom, and the Princess to wife. This the King had stuck up on all the church-doors in his realm, and had given it out in many other kingdoms besides. Now, this Princess was so lovely that all who set eyes on her fell over head and ears in love with her whether they would or no. So I needn't tell you how all the princes and knights who heard of her were eager to win her to wife, and half the kingdom beside; and how they came riding from all parts of the world on high prancing horses, and clad in the grandest clothes, for there wasn't one of them who hadn't made up his mind that he, and he alone, was to win the Princess."
"So when the day of trial came, which the king had fixed, there was such a crowd of princes and knights under the Glass Hill, that it made one's head whirl to look at them, and everyone in the country who could even crawl along was off to the hill, for they were all eager to see the man who was to win the Princess. So the two elder brothers set off with the rest; but as for Boots, they said outright he shouldn't go with them, for if they were seen with such a dirty changeling, all begrimed with smut from cleaning their shoes and sifting cinders in the dust-hole, they said folk would make game of them."
"""Very well,"" said Boots, ""it's all one to me. I can go alone, and stand or fall by myself."""
"Now when the two brothers came to the Hill of Glass, the knights and princes were all hard at it, riding their horses till they were all in a foam; but it was no good, by my troth; for as soon as ever the horses set foot on the hill, down they slipped, and there wasn't one who could get a yard or two up; and no wonder, for the hill was as smooth as a sheet of glass, and as steep as a house-wall. But all were eager to have the Princess and half the kingdom. So they rode and slipped, and slipped and rode, and still it was the same story over again. At last all their horses were so weary that they could scarce lift a leg, and in such a sweat that the lather dripped from them, and so the knights had to give up trying any more. So the king was just thinking that he would proclaim a new trial for the next day, to see if they would have better luck, when all at once a knight came riding up on so brave a steed, that no one had ever seen the like of it in his born days, and the knight had mail of brass, and the horse a brass bit in his mouth, so bright that the sunbeams shone from it. Then all the others called out to him he might just as well spare himself the trouble of riding at the Hill, for it would lead to no good; but he gave no heed to them, and put his horse at the hill, and went up it like nothing for a good way, about a third of the height; and when he had got so far, he turned his horse round and rode down again. So lovely a knight the Princess thought she had never yet seen; and while he was riding, she sat and thought to herself:"
"""Would to heaven he might only come up and down the other side."""
"And when she saw him turning back, she threw down one of the golden apples after him, and it rolled down into his shoe. But when he got to the bottom of the hill, he rode off so fast that no one could tell what had become of him. That evening all the knights and princes were to go before the king, that he who had ridden so far up the hill might show the apple which the Princess had thrown, but there was no one who had anything to show. One after the other they all came, but not a man of them could show the apple."
"At even the brothers of Boots came home too, and had such a long story to tell about the riding up the hill."
"""First of all,"" they said, ""there was not one of the whole lot who could get so much as a stride up; but at last came one who had a suit of brass mail, and a brass bridle and saddle, all so bright that the sun shone from them a mile off. He was a chap to ride, just! He rode a third of the way up the Hill of Glass, and he could easily have ridden the whole way up, if he chose; but he turned round and rode down, thinking, maybe, that was enough for once."""
"""Oh! I should so like to have seen him, that I should,"" said Boots, who sat by the fireside, and stuck his feet into the cinders, as was his wont."
"""Oh!"" said his brothers, ""you would, would you? You look fit to keep company with such high lords, nasty beast that you are, sitting there amongst the ashes."""
"Next day the brothers were all for setting off again, and Boots begged them this time, too, to let him go with them and see the riding; but no, they wouldn't have him at any price, he was too ugly and nasty, they said."
"""Well, well!"" said Boots; ""if I go at all, I must go by myself. I'm not afraid."""
"So when the brothers got to the Hill of Glass, all the princes and knights began to ride again, and you may fancy they had taken care to shoe their horses sharp; but it was no good they rode and slipped, and slipped and rode, just as they had done the day before, and there was not one who could get so far as a yard up the hill. And when they had worn out their horses, so that they could not stir a leg, they were all forced to give it up as a bad job. So the king thought he might as well proclaim that the riding should take place the day after for the last time, just to give them one chance more; but all at once it came across his mind that he might as well wait a little longer, to see if the knight in brass mail would come this day too. Well, they saw nothing of him; but all at once came one riding on a steed, far, far braver and finer than that on which the knight in brass had ridden, and he had silver mail, and a silver saddle and bridle, all so bright that the sunbeams gleamed and glanced from them far away. Then the others shouted out to him again, saying, he might as well hold hard, and not try to ride up the hill, for all his trouble would be thrown away; but the knight paid no heed to them, and rode straight at the hill, and right up it, till he had gone two-thirds of the way, and then he wheeled his horse round and rode down again. To tell the truth, the Princess liked him still better than the knight in brass, and she sat and wished he might only be able to come right up to the top, and down the other side; but when she saw him turning back, she threw the second apple after him, and it rolled down and fell into his shoe. But, as soon as ever he had come down from the Hill of Glass, he rode off so fast that no one could see what became of him."
"At even, when all were to go in before the king and the Princess, that he who had the golden apple might show it, in they went, one after the other, but there was no one who had any apple to show, and the two brothers, as they had done on the former day, went home and told how things had gone, and how all had ridden at the hill, and none got up."
"""But, last of all,"" they said, ""came one in a silver suit, and his horse had a silver saddle and a silver bridle. He was just a chap to ride; and he got two-thirds up the hill, and then turned back. He was a fine fellow, and no mistake; and the Princess threw the second gold apple to him."""
"""Oh!"" said Boots, ""I should so like to have seen him too, that I should."""
"""A pretty story,"" they said. ""Perhaps you think his coat of mail was as bright as the ashes you are always poking about, and sifting, you nasty dirty beast."""
"The third day everything happened as it had happened the two days before. Boots begged to go and see the sight, but the two wouldn't hear of his going with them. When they got to the hill there was no one who could get so much as a yard up it; and now all waited for the knight in silver mail, but they neither saw nor heard of him. At last came one riding on a steed, so brave that no one had ever seen his match; and the knight had a suit of golden mail, and a golden saddle and bridle, so wondrous bright that the sunbeams gleamed from them a mile off. The other knights and princes could not find time to call out to him not to try his luck, for they were amazed to see how grand he was. So he rode right at the hill, and tore up it like nothing, so that the Princess hadn't even time to wish that he might get up the whole way. As soon as ever he reached the top, he took the third golden apple from the Princess' lap, and then turned his horse and rode down again. As soon as he got down, he rode off at full speed, and was out of sight in no time."
"Now, when the brothers got home at even, you may fancy what long stories they told, how the riding had gone off that day; and amongst other things, they had a deal to say about the knight in golden mail."
"“Thou must say, ‘Get it full, get it full.’” After this he again walked a long time, and said, “Get it full, get it full,” until he came to the gallows, where they had got a poor sinner whom they were about to hang."
"Then said he, “Good morning; get it full, get it full.” “What sayst thou, knave, get it full? Dost thou want to make out that there are still more wicked people in the world is not this enough?” And he again got some blows on his back. “What am I to say, then?” said he. “Thou must say, may God have pity on the poor soul.”"
"Again the youth walked on for a long while and said, “May God have pity on the poor soul!” Then he came to a pit by which stood a knacker who was cutting up a horse. The youth said, “Good morning; God have pity on the poor soul!” “What dost thou say, thou ill-tempered knave?” and the knacker gave him such a box on the ear, that he could not see out of his eyes. “What am I to say, then?” “Thou must say, ‘There lies the carrion in the pit!’”"
"So he walked on, and always said, “There lies the carrion in the pit, there lies the carrion in the pit.” And he came to a cart full of people, so he said, “Good morning, there lies the carrion in the pit!”"
"Then the cart pushed him into a hole, and the driver took his whip and cracked it upon the youth, till he was forced to crawl back to his mother, and as long as he lived he never went out a-travelling again."
144 The Donkey
"Once on a time there lived a King and a Queen, who were rich, and had everything they wanted, but no children. The Queen lamented over this day and night, and said, “I am like a field on which nothing grows.” At last God gave her her wish, but when the child came into the world, it did not look like a human child, but was a little donkey. When the mother saw that, her lamentations and outcries began in real earnest; she said she would far rather have had no child at all than have a donkey, and that they were to throw it into the water that the fishes might devour it. But the King said, “No, since God has sent him he shall be my son and heir, and after my death sit on the royal throne, and wear the kingly crown.” The donkey, therefore, was brought up and grew bigger, and his ears grew up beautifully high and straight. He was, however, of a merry disposition, jumped about, played and had especial pleasure in music, so that he went to a celebrated musician and said, “Teach me thine art, that I may play the lute as well as thou dost.” “Ah, dear little master,” answered the musician, “that would come very hard to you, your fingers are certainly not suited to it, and are far too big. I am afraid the strings would not last.” No excuses were of any use. The donkey was determined to play the lute; he was persevering and industrious, and at last learnt to do it as well as the master himself. The young lordling once went out walking full of thought and came to a well, he looked into it and in the mirror-clear water saw his donkey’s form. He was so distressed about it, that he went out into the wide world and only took with him one faithful companion. They travelled up and down, and at last they came into a kingdom where an old King reigned who had an only but wonderfully beautiful daughter. The donkey said, “Here we will stay,” knocked at the gate, and cried, “A guest is without open, that he may enter.” As, however, the gate was not opened, he sat down, took his lute and played it in the most delightful manner with his two fore-feet. Then the door-keeper opened his eyes most wonderfully wide, and ran to the King and said, “Outside by the gate sits a young donkey which plays the lute as well as an experienced master!” “Then let the musician come to me,”"
"said the King. When, however, a donkey came in, every one began to laugh at the lute-player. And now the donkey was asked to sit down and eat with the servants. He, however, was unwilling, and said, “I am no common stable-ass, I am a noble one.” Then they said, “If that is what thou art, seat thyself with the men of war.” “No,” said he, “I will sit by the King.” The King smiled, and said good-humouredly, “Yes, it shall be as thou wilt, little ass, come here to me.” Then he asked, “Little ass, how does my daughter please thee?” The donkey turned his head towards her, looked at her, nodded and said, “I like her above measure, I have never yet seen anyone so beautiful as she is.” “Well, then, thou shalt sit next her too,” said the King. “That is exactly what I wish,”"
"said the donkey, and he placed himself by her side, ate and drank, and knew how to behave himself daintily and cleanly. When the noble beast had stayed a long time at the King’s court, he thought, “What good does all this do me, I shall still have to go home again?” let his head hang sadly, and went to the King and asked for his dismissal. But the King had grown fond of him, and said, “Little ass, what ails thee? Thou lookest as sour as a jug of vinegar, I will give thee what thou wantest. Dost thou want gold?” “No,” said the donkey, and shook his head. “Dost thou want jewels and rich dress?” “No.” “Dost thou wish for half my kingdom?” “Indeed, no.” Then said the King, “if I did but know what would make thee content. Wilt thou have my pretty daughter to wife?” “Ah, yes,” said the ass, “I should indeed like her,” and all at once he became quite merry and full of happiness, for that was exactly what he was wishing for. So a great and splendid wedding was held. In the evening, when the bride and bridegroom were led into their bed-room, the King wanted to know if the ass would behave well, and ordered a servant to hide himself there. When they were both within, the bridegroom bolted the door, looked around, and as he believed that they were quite alone, he suddenly threw off his ass’s skin, and stood there in the form of a handsome royal youth. “Now,” said he, “thou seest who I am, and seest also that I am not unworthy of thee.” Then the bride was glad, and kissed him, and loved him dearly. When morning came, he jumped up, put his animal’s skin on again, and no one could have guessed what kind of a form was hidden beneath it. Soon came the old King, “Ah,” cried he, “is the little ass merry? But surely thou art sad?” said he to his daughter, “that thou hast not got a proper man for thy husband?” “Oh, no, dear father, I love him as well as if he were the handsomest in the world, and I will keep him as long as I live.”"
"The King was surprised, but the servant who had concealed himself came and revealed everything to him. The King said, “That cannot be true.”"
"“Then watch yourself the next night, and you will see it with your own eyes; and hark you, lord King, if you were to take his skin away and throw it in the fire, he would be forced to show himself in his true shape.” “Thy advice is good,” said the King, and at night when they were asleep, he stole in, and when he got to the bed he saw by the light of the moon a noble-looking youth lying there, and the skin lay stretched on the ground. So he took it away, and had a great fire lighted outside, and threw the skin into it, and remained by it himself until it was all burnt to ashes. As, however, he was anxious to know how the robbed man would behave himself, he stayed awake the whole night and watched. When the youth had slept his sleep out, he got up by the first light of morning, and wanted to put on the ass’s skin, but it was not to be found. On this he was alarmed, and, full of grief and anxiety, said, “Now I shall have to contrive to escape.” But when he went out, there stood the King, who said, “My son, whither away in such haste? what hast thou in mind? Stay here, thou art such a handsome man, thou shalt not go away from me. I will now give thee half my kingdom, and after my death thou shalt have the whole of it.” “Then I hope that what begins so well may end well, and I will stay with you,” said the youth. And the old man gave him half the kingdom, and in a year’s time, when he died, the youth had the whole, and after the death of his father he had another kingdom as well, and lived in all magnificence."
145 The Ungrateful Son
"A man and his wife were once sitting by the door of their house, and they had a roasted chicken set before them, and were about to eat it together. Then the man saw that his aged father was coming, and hastily took the chicken and hid it, for he would not permit him to have any of it. The old man came, took a drink, and went away. Now the son wanted to put the roasted chicken on the table again, but when he took it up, it had become a great toad, which jumped into his face and sat there and never went away again, and if any one wanted to take it off, it looked venomously at him as if it would jump in his face, so that no one would venture to touch it. And the ungrateful son was forced to feed the toad every day, or else it fed itself on his face; and thus he went about the world without knowing rest."
146 The Turnip
"There were once two brothers who both served as soldiers; one of them was rich, and the other poor. Then the poor one, to escape from his poverty, put off his soldier’s coat, and turned farmer. He dug and hoed his bit of land, and sowed it with turnip-seed. The seed came up, and one turnip grew there which became large and vigorous, and visibly grew bigger and bigger, and seemed as if it would never stop growing, so that it might have been called the princess of turnips, for never was such an one seen before, and never will such an one be seen again."
"At length it was so enormous that by itself it filled a whole cart, and two oxen were required to draw it, and the farmer had not the least idea what he was to do with the turnip, or whether it would be a fortune to him or a misfortune. At last he thought, “If thou sellest it, what wilt thou get for it that is of any importance, and if thou eatest it thyself, why, the small turnips would do thee just as much good; it would be better to take it to the King, and make him a present of it.”"
"So he placed it on a cart, harnessed two oxen, took it to the palace, and presented it to the King. “What strange thing is this?” said the King. “Many wonderful things have come before my eyes, but never such a monster as this! From what seed can this have sprung, or are you a luck-child and have met with it by chance?” “Ah, no!” said the farmer, “no luck-child am I. I am a poor soldier, who because he could no longer support himself hung his soldier’s coat on a nail and took to farming land. I have a brother who is rich and well known to you, Lord King, but I, because I have nothing, am forgotten by every one.”"
"Then the King felt compassion for him, and said, “Thou shalt be raised from thy poverty, and shalt have such gifts from me that thou shalt be equal to thy rich brother.” Then he bestowed on him much gold, and lands, and meadows, and herds, and made him immensely rich, so that the wealth of the other brother could not be compared with his. When the rich brother heard what the poor one had gained for himself with one single turnip, he envied him, and thought in every way how he also could get hold of a similar piece of luck. He would, however, set about it in a much wiser way, and took gold and horses and carried them to the King, and made certain the King would give him a much larger present in return. If his brother had got so much for one turnip, what would he not carry away with him in return for such beautiful things as these? The King accepted his present, and said he had nothing to give him in return that was more rare and excellent than the great turnip."
"So the rich man was obliged to put his brother’s turnip in a cart and have it taken to his home. When there he did not know on whom to vent his rage and anger, until bad thoughts came to him, and he resolved to kill his brother. He hired murderers, who were to lie in ambush, and then he went to his brother and said, “Dear brother, I know of a hidden treasure, we will dig it up together, and divide it between us.” The other agreed to this, and accompanied him without suspicion. While they were on their way, however, the murderers fell on him, bound him, and would have hanged him to a tree. But just as they were doing this, loud singing and the sound of a horse’s feet were heard in the distance. On this their hearts were filled with terror, and they pushed their prisoner head first into the sack, hung it on a branch, and took to flight. He, however, worked up there until he had made a hole in the sack through which he could put his head. The man who was coming by was no other than a travelling student, a young fellow who rode on his way through the wood joyously singing his song. When he who was aloft saw that someone was passing below him, he cried, “Good day! You have come at a lucky time.” The student looked round on every side, but did not know whence the voice came. At last he said, “Who calls me?” Then an answer came from the top of the tree, “Raise your eyes; here I sit aloft in the Sack of Wisdom. In a short time have I learnt great things; compared with this all schools are a jest; in a very short time I shall have learnt everything, and shall descend wiser than all other men. I understand the stars, and the signs of the Zodiac, and the tracks of the winds, the sand of the sea, the healing of illness, and the virtues of all herbs, birds, and stones. If you were once within it you would feel what noble things issue forth from the Sack of Knowledge.”"
"The student, when he heard all this, was astonished, and said, “Blessed be the hour in which I have found thee! May not I also enter the sack for a while?” He who was above replied as if unwillingly, “For a short time I will let you get into it, if you reward me and give me good words; but you must wait an hour longer, for one thing remains which I must learn before I do it.” When the student had waited a while he became impatient, and begged to be allowed to get in at once, his thirst for knowledge was so very great. So he who was above pretended at last to yield, and said, “In order that I may come forth from the house of knowledge you must let it down by the rope, and then you shall enter it.” So the student let the sack down, untied it, and set him free, and then cried, “Now draw me up at once,” and was about to get into the sack. “Halt!” said the other, “that won’t do,” and took him by the head and put him upside down into the sack, fastened it, and drew the disciple of wisdom up the tree by the rope. Then he swung him in the air and said, “How goes it with thee, my dear fellow? Behold, already thou feelest wisdom coming, and art gaining valuable experience. Keep perfectly quiet until thou becomest wiser.” Thereupon he mounted the student’s horse and rode away, but in an hour’s time sent some one to let the student out again."
147 The Old Man Made Young Again
"In the time when our Lord still walked this earth, he and St. Peter stopped one evening at a smith’s and received free quarters. Then it came to pass that a poor beggar, hardly pressed by age and infirmity, came to this house and begged alms of the smith. St. Peter had compassion on him and said, “Lord and master, if it please thee, cure his torments that he may be able to win his own bread.” The Lord said kindly, “Smith, lend me thy forge, and put on some coals for me, and then I will make this ailing old man young again.” The smith was quite willing, and St. Peter blew the bellows, and when the coal fire sparkled up large and high our Lord took the little old man, pushed him in the forge in the midst of the red-hot fire, so that he glowed like a rose-bush, and praised God with a loud voice. After that the Lord went to the quenching tub, put the glowing little man into it so that the water closed over him, and after he had carefully cooled him, gave him his blessing, when behold the little man sprang nimbly out, looking fresh, straight, healthy, and as if he were but twenty. The smith, who had watched everything closely and attentively, invited them all to supper. He, however, had an old half-blind crooked, mother-in-law who went to the youth, and with great earnestness asked if the fire had burnt him much. He answered that he had never felt more comfortable, and that he had sat in the red heat as if he had been in cool dew. The youth’s words echoed in the ears of the old woman all night long, and early next morning, when the Lord had gone on his way again and had heartily thanked the smith, the latter thought he might make his old mother-in-law young again likewise, as he had watched everything so carefully, and it lay in the province of his trade. So he called to ask her if she, too, would like to go bounding about like a girl of eighteen. She said, “With all my heart, as the youth has come out of it so well.” So the smith made a great fire, and thrust the old woman into it, and she writhed about this way and that, and uttered terrible cries of murder. “Sit still; why art thou screaming and jumping about so?”"
"cried he, and as he spoke he blew the bellows again until all her rags were burnt. The old woman cried without ceasing, and the smith thought to himself, “I have not quite the right art,” and took her out and threw her into the cooling-tub. Then she screamed so loudly that the smith’s wife upstairs and her daughter-in-law heard, and they both ran downstairs, and saw the old woman lying in a heap in the quenching-tub, howling and screaming, with her face wrinkled and shrivelled and all out of shape. Thereupon the two, who were both with child, were so terrified that that very night two boys were born who were not made like men but apes, and they ran into the woods, and from them sprang the race of apes."
148 The Lord’s Animals and the Devil’s
"The Lord God had created all animals, and had chosen out the wolf to be his dog, but he had forgotten the goat. Then the Devil made ready and began to create also, and created goats with fine long tails. Now when they went to pasture, they generally remained caught in the hedges by their tails, then the Devil had to go there and disentangle them, with a great deal of trouble. This enraged him at last, and he went and bit off the tail of every goat, as may be seen to this day by the stump."
"Then he let them go to pasture alone, but it came to pass that the Lord God perceived how at one time they gnawed away at a fruitful tree, at another injured the noble vines, or destroyed other tender plants. This distressed him, so that in his goodness and mercy he summoned his wolves, who soon tore in pieces the goats that went there. When the devil observed this, he went before the Lord and said, “Thy creatures have destroyed mine.” The Lord answered, “Why didst thou create things to do harm?” The Devil said, “I was compelled to do it: inasmuch as my thoughts run on evil, what I create can have no other nature, and thou must pay me heavy damages.” “I will pay thee as soon as the oak leaves fall; come then, thy money will then be ready counted out.” When the oak-leaves had fallen, the Devil came and demanded what was due to him."
"But the Lord said, “In the church of Constantinople stands a tall oak-tree which still has all its leaves.” With raging and curses, the Devil departed, and went to seek the oak, wandered in the wilderness for six months before he found it, and when he returned, all the oaks had in the meantime covered themselves again with green leaves. Then he had to forfeit his indemnity, and in his rage he put out the eyes of all the remaining goats, and put his own in instead."
"This is why all goats have devil’s eyes, and their tails bitten off, and why he likes to assume their shape."
149 The Beam
"There was once an enchanter who was standing in the midst of a great crowd of people performing his wonders. He had a cock brought in, which lifted a heavy beam and carried it as if it were as light as a feather."
"But a girl was present who had just found a bit of four-leaved clover, and had thus become so wise that no deception could stand out against her, and she saw that the beam was nothing but a straw. So she cried, “You people, do you not see that it is a straw that the cock is carrying, and no beam?” Immediately the enchantment vanished, and the people saw what it was, and drove the magician away in shame and disgrace. He, however, full of inward anger, said, “I will soon revenge myself.”"
"After some time the girl’s wedding-day came, and she was decked out, and went in a great procession over the fields to the place where the church was. All at once she came to a stream which was very much swollen, and there was no bridge and no plank to cross it. Then the bride nimbly took her clothes up, and wanted to wade through it. And just as she was thus standing in the water, a man, and it was the enchanter, cried mockingly close beside her, “Aha! Where are thine eyes that thou takest that for water?” Then her eyes were opened, and she saw that she was standing with her clothes lifted up in the middle of a field that was blue with the flowers of blue flax. Then all the people saw it likewise, and chased her away with ridicule and laughter."
"After Penn's death his heirs ran the Colony up to 1779, when they disposed of it for five hundred thousand dollars or thereabouts, and the State became the proprietor."
"The seventeenth century must have been a very disagreeable period for people who professed religion, for America from Newfoundland to Florida was dotted with little settlements almost entirely made up of people who had escaped from England to secure religious freedom at the risk of their lives."
"In 1634 the first settlement was made by young Lord Baltimore, whose people, the Catholics, were fleeing from England to obtain freedom to worship God as they believed to be right. Thus the Catholics were added to the list of religious refugees, viz., the Huguenots, the Puritans, the Walloons, the Quakers, the Presbyterians, the Whigs, and the Menthol Healers."
"Terra Mariæ, or Maryland, was granted to Lord Baltimore, as the successor of his father, who had begun before his death the movement for settling his people in America. The charter gave to all freemen a voice in making the laws. Among the first laws passed was one giving to every human being upon payment of poll-tax the right to worship freely according to the dictates of his own conscience. America thus became the refuge for those who had any peculiarity of religious belief, until to-day no doubt more varieties of religion may be found here than almost anywhere else in the world."
"In 1635 the Virginia Colony and Lord Baltimore had some words over the boundaries between the Jamestown and Maryland Colonies. Clayborne was the Jamestown man who made the most trouble. He had started a couple of town sites on the Maryland tract, plotted them, and sold lots to Yorkshire tenderfeet, and so when Lord Baltimore claimed the lands Clayborne attacked him, and there was a running skirmish for several years, till at last the Rebellion collapsed in 1645 and Clayborne fled."
"The Protestants now held the best hand, and outvoted the Catholics, so up to 1691 there was a never-dying fight between the two, which must have been entertaining to the unregenerate outsider who was taxed to pay for a double set of legislators. This fight between the Catholics and Protestants shows that intolerance is not confined to a monarchy."
"In 1715 the fourth Lord Baltimore recovered the government by the aid of the police, and religious toleration was restored. Maryland remained under this system of government until the Revolution, which will be referred to later on in the most thrilling set of original pictures and word-paintings that the reader has ever met with."
CHAPTER X.
THE EARLY ARISTOCRACY.
"Lord Clarendon and several other noblemen in 1663 obtained from Charles II. a grant of lands lying south of Virginia which they called Carolina in honor of the king, whose name was not really Carolina. Possibly that was his middle name, however, or his name in Latin."
"The Albemarle Colony was first on the ground. Then there was a Carteret Colony in 1670. They ""removed the ancient groves covered with yellow jessamine"" on the Ashley, and began to build on the present site of Charleston."
"The historian remarks that the growth of this Colony was rapid from the first. The Dutch, dissatisfied with the way matters were conducted in New York, and worn out when shopping by the ennui and impudence of the salesladies, came to Charleston in large numbers, and the Huguenots in Charleston found a hearty Southern welcome, and did their trading there altogether."
"We now pass on to speak of the Grand Model which was set up as a five-cent aristocracy by Lord Shaftesbury and the great philosopher John Locke. The canebrakes and swamps of the wild and snake-infested jungles of the wilderness were to be divided into vast estates, over which were proprietors with hereditary titles and outing flannels."
"This scheme recognized no rights of self-government whatever, and denied the very freedom which the people came there in search of. So there were murmurings among those people who had not brought their finger-bowls and equerries with them."
"In short, aristocracy did not do well on this soil. Baronial castles, with hot and cold water in them, were often neglected, because the colonists would not forsake their own lands to the thistle and blue-nosed brier in order to come and cook victuals for the baronial castles or sweep out the baronial halls and wax the baronial floors for a journeyman juke who ate custard pie with a knife and drank tea from his saucer through a King Charles moustache."
"Thus the aristocracy was forced to close its doors, and the arms of Lord Shaftesbury were so humiliated that he could no longer put up his dukes (see Appendix)."
"There had also been a great deal of friction between the Albemarle or Carteret and the Charleston set, the former being from Virginia, while the latter was, as we have seen, a little given to kindergarten aristocracy and ofttimes tripped up on their parade swords while at the plough. Of course outside of this were the plebeian people, or copperas-culottes, who did the work; but Lord Shaftesbury for some time, as we have seen, lived in a baronial shed and had his arms worked on the left breast of his nighty."
"So these two Colonies finally became separate States in the Union, though there is yet something of the same feeling between the people."
"Wealthy people come to the mountains of North Carolina from South Carolina for the cool summer breezes of the Old North State, and have to pay two dollars per breeze even up to the past summer."
"Thus there was constant irritation and disgust up to 1729 at least, regarding taxes, rents, and rights, until, as the historian says, ""the discouraged Proprietors ceded their rights to the crown."""
"It will be noticed that the crown was well ceded by this time, and the poet's remark seems at this time far grander and more apropos than any language of the writer could be: so it is given here, viz., ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a seedy crown."" (See Appendix.)"
"The year of Washington's birth, viz., 1732, witnessed the birth of the baby colony of Georgia. James Oglethorpe, a kind-hearted man, with a wig that fooled more than one poor child of the forest, conceived the idea of founding a refuge for Englishmen who could not pay up. The laws were very arbitrary then, and harsh to a degree. Many were imprisoned then in England for debt, but those who visit London now will notice that they are at liberty."
"Oglethorpe was an officer and a gentleman, and this scheme showed his generous nature and philanthropic disposition. George II. granted him in trust for the poor a tract of land called, in honor of the king, Georgie, which has recently been changed to Georgia. The enterprise prospered remarkably, and generous and charitable people aided it in every possible way. People who had not been able for years to pay their debts came to Georgia and bought large tracts of land or began merchandising with the Indians. Thousands of acres of rich cotton-lands were exchanged by the Indians for orders on the store, they giving warranty deeds to same, reserving only the rights of piscary and massacre."
"Oglethorpe got along with the Indians first-rate, and won their friendship. One great chief, having received a present from Oglethorpe consisting of a manicure set, on the following Christmas gave Oglethorpe a beautiful buffalo robe, on the inside of which were painted an eagle and a portable bath-tub, signifying, as the chief stated, that the buffalo was the emblem of strength, the eagle of swiftness, and the bath-tub the advertisement of cleanliness. ""Thus,"" said the chief, ""the English are strong as the buffalo, swift as the eagle, and love to convey the idea that they are just about to take a bath when you came and interrupted them."""
"The Moravians also came to Georgia, and the Scotch Highlanders. On the arrival of the latter, the Georgia mosquitoes held a mass meeting, at which speeches were made, and songs sung, and resolutions adopted making the Highland uniform the approved costume for the entire coast during summer."
91 The Gnome
"There was once upon a time a rich King who had three daughters, who daily went to walk in the palace garden, and the King was a great lover of all kinds of fine trees, but there was one for which he had such an affection, that if anyone gathered an apple from it he wished him a hundred fathoms underground. And when harvest time came, the apples on this tree were all as red as blood. The three daughters went every day beneath the tree, and looked to see if the wind had not blown down an apple, but they never by any chance found one, and the tree was so loaded with them that it was almost breaking, and the branches hung down to the ground. Then the King’s youngest child had a great desire for an apple, and said to her sisters, “Our father loves us far too much to wish us underground, it is my belief that he would only do that to people who were strangers.” And while she was speaking, the child plucked off quite a large apple, and ran to her sisters, saying, “Just taste, my dear little sisters, for never in my life have I tasted anything so delightful.” Then the two other sisters also ate some of the apple, whereupon all three sank deep down into the earth, where they could hear no cock crow."
"When mid-day came, the King wished to call them to come to dinner, but they were nowhere to be found. He sought them everywhere in the palace and garden, but could not find them. Then he was much troubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife. Hereupon so many young men went about the country in search, that there was no counting them, for every one loved the three children because they were so kind to all, and so fair of face. Three young huntsmen also went out, and when they had travelled about for eight days, they arrived at a great castle, in which were beautiful apartments, and in one room a table was laid on which were delicate dishes which were still so warm that they were smoking, but in the whole of the castle no human being was either to be seen or heard. They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained warm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat down and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and live in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by casting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the King’s daughters. They cast lots, and the lot fell on the eldest; so next day the two younger went out to seek, and the eldest had to stay home. At mid-day came a small, small mannikin and begged for a piece of bread, then the huntsman took the bread which he had found there, and cut a round off the loaf and was about to give it to him, but whilst he was giving it to the mannikin, the latter let it fall, and asked the huntsman to be so good as to give him that piece again. The huntsman was about to do so and stooped, on which the mannikin took a stick, seized him by the hair, and gave him a good beating. Next day, the second stayed at home, and he fared no better. When the two others returned in the evening, the eldest said, “Well, how have you got on?”"
"“Oh, very badly,” said he, and then they lamented their misfortune together, but they said nothing about it to the youngest, for they did not like him at all, and always called him Stupid Hans, because he did not exactly belong to the forest. On the third day, the youngest stayed at home, and again the little mannikin came and begged for a piece of bread. When the youth gave it to him, the elf let it fall as before, and asked him to be so good as to give him that piece again. Then said Hans to the little mannikin, “What! canst thou not pick up that piece thyself? If thou wilt not take as much trouble as that for thy daily bread, thou dost not deserve to have it.” Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin, and gave him a thorough beating. Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, “Stop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King’s daughters are.” When Hans heard that, he left off beating him and the mannikin told him that he was an earth mannikin, and that there were more than a thousand like him, and that if he would go with him he would show him where the King’s daughters were. Then he showed him a deep well, but there was no water in it. And the elf said that he knew well that the companions Hans had with him did not intend to deal honourably with him, therefore if he wished to deliver the King’s children, he must do it alone. The two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the King’s daughters, but they did not want to have any trouble or danger. Hans was therefore to take a large basket, and he must seat himself in it with his hanger and a bell, and be let down. Below were three rooms, and in each of them was a princess, with a many-headed dragon, whose heads she was to comb and trim, but he must cut them off. And having said all this, the elf vanished. When it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got on, and he said, “pretty well so far,” and that he had seen no one except at mid-day when a little mannikin had come and begged for a piece of bread, that he had given some to him, but that the mannikin had let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again; but as he did not choose to do that, the elf had begun to lose his temper, and that he had done what he ought not, and had given the elf a beating, on which he had told him where the King’s daughters were. Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow. Next morning they went to the well together, and drew lots who should first seat himself in the basket, and again the lot fell on the eldest, and he was to seat himself in it, and take the bell with him. Then he said, “If I ring, you must draw me up again immediately.” When he had gone down for a short distance, he rang, and they at once drew him up again. Then the second seated himself in the basket, but he did just the same as the first, and then it was the turn of the youngest, but he let himself be lowered quite to the bottom. When he had got out of the basket, he took his hanger, and went and stood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon snoring quite loudly. He opened the door slowly, and one of the princesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon’s heads lying upon her lap, and was combing them. Then he took his hanger and hewed at them, and the nine fell off. The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck."
"Then he went to the second princess, who had a dragon with five heads to comb, and delivered her also, and to the youngest, who had a dragon with four heads, he went likewise. And they all rejoiced, and embraced him and kissed him without stopping. Then he rang very loud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one after the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it came to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told him that his comrades did not mean well by him. So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage."
"In the meantime the youngest huntsman was wandering about the three chambers in great trouble, fully expecting to have to end his days there, when he saw, hanging on the wall, a flute; then said he, “Why dost thou hang there, no one can be merry here?” He looked at the dragons, heads likewise and said, “You too cannot help me now.” He walked backwards and forwards for such a long time that he made the surface of the ground quite smooth. But at last other thoughts came to his mind, and he took the flute from the wall, and played a few notes on it, and suddenly a number of elves appeared, and with every note that he sounded one more came. Then he played until the room was entirely filled. They all asked what he desired, so he said he wished to get above ground back to daylight, on which they seized him by every hair that grew on his head, and thus they flew with him onto the earth again. When he was above ground, he at once went to the King’s palace, just as the wedding of one princess was about to be celebrated, and he went to the room where the King and his three daughters were. When the princesses saw him they fainted. Hereupon the King was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at once, because he thought he must have done some injury to the children. When the princesses came to themselves, however, they entreated the King to set him free again. The King asked why, and they said that they were not allowed to tell that, but their father said that they were to tell it to the stove. And he went out, listened at the door, and heard everything. Then he caused the two brothers to be hanged on the gallows, and to the third he gave his youngest daughter, and on that occasion I wore a pair of glass shoes, and I struck them against a stone, and they said, “Klink,” and were broken."
92 The King of the Golden Mountain
"There was a certain merchant who had two children, a boy and a girl; they were both young, and could not walk. And two richly-laden ships of his sailed forth to sea with all his property on board, and just as he was expecting to win much money by them, news came that they had gone to the bottom, and now instead of being a rich man he was a poor one, and had nothing left but one field outside the town. In order to drive his misfortune a little out of his thoughts, he went out to this field, and as he was walking forwards and backwards in it, a little black mannikin stood suddenly by his side, and asked why he was so sad, and what he was taking so much to heart. Then said the merchant, “If thou couldst help me I would willingly tell thee.” “Who knows?” replied the black dwarf. “Perhaps, I can help thee.” Then the merchant told him that all he possessed had gone to the bottom of the sea, and that he had nothing left but this field. “Do not trouble thyself,” said the dwarf. “If thou wilt promise to give me the first thing that rubs itself against thy leg when thou art at home again, and to bring it here to this place in twelve years’ time, thou shalt have as much money as thou wilt.” The merchant thought, “What can that be but my dog?” and did not remember his little boy, so he said yes, gave the black man a written and sealed promise, and went home."
"When he reached home, his little boy was so delighted that he held by a bench, tottered up to him and seized him fast by the legs. The father was shocked, for he remembered his promise, and now knew what he had pledged himself to do; as however, he still found no money in his chest, he thought the dwarf had only been jesting. A month afterwards he went up to the garret, intending to gather together some old tin and to sell it, and saw a great heap of money lying. Then he was happy again, made purchases, became a greater merchant than before, and felt that this world was well-governed. In the meantime the boy grew tall, and at the same time sharp and clever. But the nearer the twelfth year approached the more anxious grew the merchant, so that his distress might be seen in his face. One day his son asked what ailed him, but the father would not say. The boy, however, persisted so long, that at last he told him that without being aware of what he was doing, he had promised him to a black dwarf, and had received much money for doing so. He said likewise that he had set his hand and seal to this, and that now when twelve years had gone by he would have to give him up."
"Then said the son, “Oh, father, do not be uneasy, all will go well. The black man has no power over me.” The son had himself blessed by the priest, and when the time came, father and son went together to the field, and the son made a circle and placed himself inside it with his father. Then came the black dwarf and said to the old man, “Hast thou brought with thee that which thou hast promised me?” He was silent, but the son asked, “What dost thou want here?” Then said the black dwarf, “I have to speak with thy father, and not with thee.” The son replied, “Thou hast betrayed and misled my father, give back the writing.” “No,”"
"said the black dwarf, “I will not give up my rights.” They spoke together for a long time after this, but at last they agreed that the son, as he did not belong to the enemy of mankind, nor yet to his father, should seat himself in a small boat, which should lie on water which was flowing away from them, and that the father should push it off with his own foot, and then the son should remain given up to the water. So he took leave of his father, placed himself in a little boat, and the father had to push it off with his own foot. The boat capsized so that the keel was uppermost, and the father believed his son was lost, and went home and mourned for him."
"The boat, however, did not sink, but floated quietly away, and the boy sat safely inside it, and it floated thus for a long time, until at last it stopped by an unknown shore. Then he landed and saw a beautiful castle before him, and set out to go to it. But when he entered it, he found that it was bewitched. He went through every room, but all were empty until he reached the last, where a snake lay coiled in a ring."
"The snake, however, was an enchanted maiden, who rejoiced to see him, and said, “Hast thou come, oh, my deliverer? I have already waited twelve years for thee; this kingdom is bewitched, and thou must set it free.” “How can I do that?” he inquired. “To-night come twelve black men, covered with chains who will ask what thou art doing here; keep silent; give them no answer, and let them do what they will with thee; they will torment thee, beat thee, stab thee; let everything pass, only do not speak; at twelve o’clock, they must go away again. On the second night twelve others will come; on the third, four-and-twenty, who will cut off thy head, but at twelve o’clock their power will be over, and then if thou hast endured all, and hast not spoken the slightest word, I shall be released. I will come to thee, and will have, in a bottle, some of the water of life. I will rub thee with that, and then thou wilt come to life again, and be as healthy as before.” Then said he, “I will gladly set thee free.” And everything happened just as she had said; the black men could not force a single word from him, and on the third night the snake became a beautiful princess, who came with the water of life and brought him back to life again. So she threw herself into his arms and kissed him, and there was joy and gladness in the whole castle. After this their marriage was celebrated, and he was King of the Golden Mountain."
"They lived very happily together, and the Queen bore a fine boy. Eight years had already gone by, when the King bethought him of his father; his heart was moved, and he wished to visit him. The Queen, however, would not let him go away, and said, “I know beforehand that it will cause my unhappiness;” but he suffered her to have no rest until she consented. At their parting she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, “Take this ring and put it on thy finger, and then thou wilt immediately be transported whithersoever thou wouldst be, only thou must promise me not to use it in wishing me away from this place and with thy father.” That he promised her, put the ring on his finger, and wished himself at home, just outside the town where his father lived."
"Instantly he found himself there, and made for the town, but when he came to the gate, the sentries would not let him in, because he wore such strange and yet such rich and magnificent clothing. Then he went to a hill where a shepherd was watching his sheep, changed clothes with him, put on his old shepherd’s-coat, and then entered the town without hindrance. When he came to his father, he made himself known to him, but he did not at all believe that the shepherd was his son, and said he certainly had had a son, but that he was dead long ago; however, as he saw he was a poor, needy shepherd, he would give him something to eat. Then the shepherd said to his parents, “I am verily your son. Do you know of no mark on my body by which you could recognize me?” “Yes,”"
"said his mother, “our son had a raspberry mark under his right arm.” He slipped back his shirt, and they saw the raspberry under his right arm, and no longer doubted that he was their son. Then he told them that he was King of the Golden Mountain, and a king’s daughter was his wife, and that they had a fine son of seven years old. Then said the father, “That is certainly not true; it is a fine kind of a king who goes about in a ragged shepherd’s-coat.” On this the son fell in a passion, and without thinking of his promise, turned his ring round, and wished both his wife and child with him. They were there in a second, but the Queen wept, and reproached him, and said that he had broken his word, and had brought misfortune upon her. He said, “I have done it thoughtlessly, and not with evil intention,” and tried to calm her, and she pretended to believe this; but she had mischief in her mind."
"Then he led her out of the town into the field, and showed her the stream where the little boat had been pushed off, and then he said, “I am tired; sit down, I will sleep awhile on thy lap.” And he laid his head on her lap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she first drew the ring from his finger, then she drew away the foot which was under him, leaving only the slipper behind her, and she took her child in her arms, and wished herself back in her own kingdom. When he awoke, there he lay quite deserted, and his wife and child were gone, and so was the ring from his finger, the slipper only was still there as a token."
"“Home to thy parents thou canst not return,” thought he, “they would say that thou wast a wizard; thou must be off, and walk on until thou arrivest in thine own kingdom.” So he went away and came at length to a hill by which three giants were standing, disputing with each other because they did not know how to divide their father’s property. When they saw him passing by, they called to him and said little men had quick wits, and that he was to divide their inheritance for them. The inheritance, however, consisted of a sword, which had this property that if any one took it in his hand, and said, “All heads off but mine,” every head would lie on the ground; secondly, of a cloak which made any one who put it on invisible; thirdly, of a pair of boots which could transport the wearer to any place he wished in a moment. He said, “Give me the three things that I may see if they are still in good condition.” They gave him the cloak, and when he had put it on, he was invisible and changed into a fly. Then he resumed his own form and said, “The cloak is a good one, now give me the sword.” They said, “No, we will not give thee that; if thou were to say, All heads off but mine,’ all our heads would be off, and thou alone wouldst be left with thine.” Nevertheless they gave it to him with the condition that he was only to try it against a tree. This he did, and the sword cut in two the trunk of a tree as if it had been a blade of straw. Then he wanted to have the boots likewise, but they said, “No, we will not give them; if thou hadst them on thy feet and wert to wish thyself at the top of the hill, we should be left down here with nothing.” “Oh, no,” said he, “I will not do that.” So they gave him the boots as well. And now when he had got all these things, he thought of nothing but his wife and his child, and said as though to himself, “Oh, if I were but on the Golden Mountain,” and at the same moment he vanished from the sight of the giants, and thus their inheritance was divided. When he was near his palace, he heard sounds of joy, and fiddles, and flutes, and the people told him that his wife was celebrating her wedding with another. Then he fell into a rage, and said, “False woman, she betrayed and deserted me whilst I was asleep!” So he put on his cloak, and unseen by all went into the palace. When he entered the dining-hall a great table was spread with delicious food, and the guests were eating and drinking, and laughing, and jesting. She sat on a royal seat in the midst of them in splendid apparel, with a crown on her head. He placed himself behind her, and no one saw him. When she put a piece of meat on a plate for herself, he took it away and ate it, and when she poured out a glass of wine for herself, he took it away and drank it. She was always helping herself to something, and yet she never got anything, for plate and glass disappeared immediately. Then dismayed and ashamed, she arose and went to her chamber and wept, but he followed her there. She said, “Has the devil power over me, or did my deliverer never come?” Then he struck her in the face, and said, “Did thy deliverer never come? It is he who has thee in his power, thou traitor. Have I deserved this from thee?” Then he made himself visible, went into the hall, and cried, “The wedding is at an end, the true King has returned.” The kings, princes, and councillors who were assembled there, ridiculed and mocked him, but he did not trouble to answer them, and said, “Will you go away, or not?” On this they tried to seize him and pressed upon him, but he drew his sword and said, “All heads off but mine,” and all the heads rolled on the ground, and he alone was master, and once more King of the Golden Mountain."
93 The Raven
"There was once upon a time a Queen who had a little daughter who was still so young that she had to be carried. One day the child was naughty, and the mother might say what she liked, but the child would not be quiet. Then she became impatient, and as the ravens were flying about the palace, she opened the window and said, “I wish you were a raven and would fly away, and then I should have some rest.” Scarcely had she spoken the words, before the child was changed into a raven, and flew from her arms out of the window. It flew into a dark forest, and stayed in it a long time, and the parents heard nothing of their child. Then one day a man was on his way through this forest and heard the raven crying, and followed the voice, and when he came nearer, the bird said, “I am a king’s daughter by birth, and am bewitched, but thou canst set me free.” “What am I to do,” asked he. She said, “Go further into the forest, and thou wilt find a house, wherein sits an aged woman, who will offer thee meat and drink, but you must accept nothing, for if you eatest and drinkest anything, thou wilt fall into a sleep, and then thou wilt not be able to deliver me. In the garden behind the house there is a great heap of tan, and on this thou shalt stand and wait for me. For three days I will come every afternoon at two o’clock in a carriage. On the first day four white horses will be harnessed to it, then four chestnut horses, and lastly four black ones; but if thou art not awake, but sleeping, I shall not be set free.” The man promised to do everything that she desired, but the raven said, alas, “I know already that thou wilt not deliver me; thou wilt accept something from the woman.” Then the man once more promised that he would certainly not touch anything either to eat or to drink. But when he entered the house the old woman came to him and said, “Poor man, how faint you are; come and refresh yourself; eat and drink.” “No,” said the man, “I will not eat or drink.” She, however, let him have no peace, and said, “If you will not eat, take one drink out of the glass; one is nothing.” Then he let himself be persuaded, and drank. Shortly before two o’clock in the afternoon he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven. As he was standing there, his weariness all at once became so great that he could not struggle against it, and lay down for a short time, but he was determined not to go to sleep. Hardly, however, had he lain down, than his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell asleep and slept so soundly that nothing in the world could have aroused him."
"At two o’clock the raven came driving up with four white horses, but she was already in deep grief and said, “I know he is asleep.” And when she came into the garden, he was indeed lying there asleep on the heap of tan. She alighted from the carriage, went to him, shook him, and called him, but he did not awake. Next day about noon, the old woman came again and brought him food and drink, but he would not take any of it. But she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink out of the glass. Towards two o’clock he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven, but all at once felt such a great weariness that his limbs would no longer support him. He could not help himself, and was forced to lie down, and fell into a heavy sleep. When the raven drove up with four brown horses, she was already full of grief, and said, “I know he is asleep.” She went to him, but there he lay sleeping, and there was no wakening him. Next day the old woman asked what was the meaning of this? He was neither eating nor drinking anything; did he want to die? He replied, “I am not allowed to eat or drink, and will not do so.” But she set a dish with food, and a glass with wine before him, and when he smelt it he could not resist, and swallowed a deep draught. When the time came, he went out into the garden to the heap of tan, and waited for the King’s daughter; but he became still more weary than on the day before, and lay down and slept as soundly as if he had been a stone. At two o’clock the raven came with four black horses, and the coachman and everything else was black. She was already in the deepest grief, and said, “I know that he is asleep and cannot deliver me.” When she came to him, there he was lying fast asleep. She shook him and called him, but she could not waken him. Then she laid a loaf beside him, and after that a piece of meat, and thirdly a bottle of wine, and he might consume as much of all of them as he liked, but they would never grow less. After this she took a gold ring from her finger, and put it on his, and her name was graven on it. Lastly, she laid a letter beside him wherein was written what she had given him, and that none of the things would ever grow less; and in it was also written, “I see right well that here you will never be able to deliver me, but if thou art still willing to deliver me, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; it lies in thy power, of that I am certain.” And when she had given him all these things, she seated herself in her carriage, and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg."
"When the man awoke and saw that he had slept, he was sad at heart, and said, “She has certainly driven by, and I have not set her free.” Then he perceived the things which were lying beside him, and read the letter wherein was written how everything had happened. So he arose and went away, intending to go to the golden castle of Stromberg, but he did not know where it was. After he had walked about the world for a long time, he entered into a dark forest, and walked for fourteen days, and still could not find his way out. Then it was once more evening, and he was so tired that he lay down in a thicket and fell asleep. Next day he went onwards, and in the evening, as he was again about to lie down beneath some bushes, he heard such a howling and crying that he could not go to sleep. And at the time when people light the candles, he saw one glimmering, and arose and went towards it. Then he came to a house which seemed very small, for in front of it a great giant was standing. He thought to himself, “If I go in, and the giant sees me, it will very likely cost me my life.”"
"At length he ventured it and went in. When the giant saw him, he said, “It is well that thou comest, for it is long since I have eaten; I will at once eat thee for my supper.” “I’d rather you would leave that alone,” said the man, “I do not like to be eaten; but if thou hast any desire to eat, I have quite enough here to satisfy thee.” “If that be true,” said the giant, “thou mayst be easy, I was only going to devour thee because I had nothing else.” Then they went, and sat down to the table, and the man took out the bread, wine, and meat which would never come to an end. “This pleases me well,” said the giant, and ate to his heart’s content. Then the man said to him, “Canst thou tell me where the golden castle of Stromberg is?” The giant said, “I will look at my map; all the towns, and villages, and houses are to be found on it.” He brought out the map which he had in the room and looked for the castle, but it was not to be found on it. “It’s no matter!” said he, “I have some still larger maps in my cupboard upstairs, and we will look in them.” But there, too, it was in vain. The man now wanted to go onwards, but the giant begged him to wait a few days longer until his brother, who had gone out to bring some provisions, came home. When the brother came home they inquired about the golden castle of Stromberg."
"He replied, “When I have eaten and have had enough, I will look in the map.” Then he went with them up to his chamber, and they searched in his map, but could not find it. Then he brought out still older maps, and they never rested until they found the golden castle of Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away. “How am I to get there?” asked the man. The giant said, “I have two hours’ time, during which I will carry you into the neighbourhood, but after that I must be at home to suckle the child that we have.” So the giant carried the man to about a hundred leagues from the castle, and said, “Thou canst very well walk the rest of the way alone.” And he turned back, but the man went onwards day and night, until at length he came to the golden castle of Stromberg. It stood on a glass-mountain, and the bewitched maiden drove in her carriage round the castle, and then went inside it. He rejoiced when he saw her and wanted to climb up to her, but when he began to do so he always slipped down the glass again. And when he saw that he could not reach her, he was filled with trouble, and said to himself, “I will stay down here below, and wait for her.” So he built himself a hut and stayed in it for a whole year, and every day saw the King’s daughter driving about above, but never could go to her. Then one day he saw from his hut three robbers who were beating each other, and cried to them, “God be with ye!” They stopped when they heard the cry, but as they saw no one, they once more began to beat each other, and that too most dangerously. So he again cried, “God be with ye!” Again they stopped, looked round about, but as they saw no one they went on beating each other. Then he cried for the third time, “God be with ye,”"
"and thought, “I must see what these three are about,” and went thither and asked why they were beating each other so furiously. One of them said that he found a stick, and that when he struck a door with it, that door would spring open. The next said that he had found a mantle, and that whenever he put it on, he was invisible, but the third said he had found a horse on which a man could ride everywhere, even up the glass-mountain. And now they did not know whether they ought to have these things in common, or whether they ought to divide them. Then the man said, “I will give you something in exchange for these three things. Money indeed have I not, but I have other things of more value; but first I must try yours to see if you have told the truth.” Then they put him on the horse, threw the mantle round him, and gave him the stick in his hand, and when he had all these things they were no longer able to see him. So he gave them some vigorous blows and cried, “Now, vagabonds, you have got what you deserve, are you satisfied?” And he rode up the glass-mountain, but when he came in front of the castle at the top, it was shut. Then he struck the door with his stick, and it sprang open immediately. He went in and ascended the stairs until he came to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden cup full of wine before her. She,"
"orientation spin. He rolled to the side, flailing an arm to try and"
"recover his balance, but the room was in rotation, his vision playing"
tricks.
"The one thing he did see was Vera Karanova standing over him, a blurred"
"image his mind tried vainly to correct. Her face was faltering, the"
indistinct outlines of a desert mirage. Was she real or was he merely
dreaming?
". . . Now the room was growing serene, a slow-motion phantasmagoria of"
"pastel colors and soft, muted sounds. He tried to reach out, but there"
"was nothing. Instead he heard faint music, dulcet beckoning tones. The"
"world had entered another dimension, a seamless void. He wanted to be"
"part of its emptiness, to swathe himself in the cascade of oblivion"
"lifting him up. A perfect repose was drifting through him, a wave of"
darkness. He heard his own breathing as he was buoyed into a blood-red
"mist. He was floating, on a journey he had long waited to take, to a"
"place far, far away. . . ."
BOOK THREE
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
"distance glimmered the sea, and by a rock upon the hillside, armed"
"men, a knot of spears, shone like spirit sentinels athwart the west."
"Mists were creeping up the valleys, as the sun went down into the sea."
A few sparse stars gleamed out like souls still tortured by the
mysteries of life. An inevitable pessimism seemed to challenge the
"universe, taking for its parable the weird afterglow of the west."
Deep in the woods a voice sang wild and solitary in the gathering
"gloom. Like the cry of a ghost, it seemed to set the silence"
"quivering, the leaves quaking with windless awe. The men who looked"
"towards the sea heard it, a song that echoed in the heart like woe."
The duke pointed into the darkening wood.
"""Trust your own heart: self is the man! Through a mistaken sense of"
duty have you been brought nigh unto death and despair! Trust not in
"sophistry: the laws of men are carven upon stone, the laws of Heaven"
"upon the heart! Be strong! From henceforth, scorn mere words! Trample"
"tradition in the dust! Trust yourself, and the God in your heart!"""
The distant voice had sunk into silence. Francesco listened for it
with hands aloft.
"""I must go,"" he said."
"""Go!""--"
"""I must be near her through the night!"""
"""The moon stands full upon the hills! I will await you here!"""
"Dim were the woods that autumn evening, dim and deep with an ecstasy"
may be stated that love is but one of the bodily passions that dies with
"it; however, even in some of the stories themselves, this explanation is"
used to clear certain difficulties; however opposed eternal love may be
"to one of the central doctrines of Buddhism, it seems to me that the"
very essence of this story is the belief that love does not die with the
"body, that it lives for ever and ever, through incarnation after"
incarnation. Such a story is the very cry of the agony of humanity.
"'Love is strong as death; many waters cannot quench love;' ay, and love"
"is stronger than death. Not any dogmas of any religion, not any"
"philosophy, nothing in this world, nothing in the next, shall prevent"
him who loves from the certainty of rejoining some time the soul he
loves.

CHAPTER XXIV
THE FOREST OF TIME
'The gate of that forest was Death.'
There was a great forest. It was full of giant trees that grew so high
and were so thick overhead that the sunshine could not get down below.
"And there were huge creepers that ran from tree to tree climbing there,"
"Astura poured boiling pitch upon the heads of the attacking party,"
hurled rocks of huge dimensions down upon them which crushed into a
"mangled mass scores of men, unable to retain the vantage they had"
"gained under the avalanche of arrows, rocks and fire."
In a moment's time the situation was changed.
"Noiselessly as leopards, the duke's men fell upon their rear, raising"
"their war-cry as they leaped from the shadows. Those on the ramparts,"
"forced to grapple with the nearer enemy, abandoned their tasks. The"
"Pisans, profiting by the lull, swarmed over the walls. Taken between"
"two parties, a deadly hand-to-hand conflict ensued. Above the din and"
"the roar of the hurricane, of the clashing of arms, above the cries"
"of the wounded, the death-rattle of the dying, sounded the voice of"
the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Onward, my men! Kill and slay!"""
Side by side the duke and Francesco leaped into the thickest of the
"fray, both animated by the same desire to come face to face with the"
"lords of Astura, spurning a lesser enemy."
For a time they seemed doomed to disappointment. Had the Frangipani
been slain?
The zest of the conflict pointed rather to their directing the
defence. Else their mercenaries would have left Astura to its fate.
Suddenly an unearthly voice startled the combatants.
"""Guard, devil, guard!"""
and Francesco loosened the sword in the scabbard anticipating an
"ambush, when he pushed it back with a puzzled look. Before a wayside"
"shrine, almost entirely concealed by weeds, there knelt a grotesque"
figure at orisons. He either had not heard the tramp of Francesco's
"steed, or ignored it on purpose, for not until the latter called to"
"him did he turn, and with much relief Francesco recognized his former"
guide from the camp of the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Where is the camp of the duke?"" he queried curtly, impatient with the"
man's exhibition of secular godliness.
"""Many miles away,"" replied he of the goat's-beard, as he arose and"
kissed a little holly-wood cross that he carried.
"""Lead me to it!"""
"The godly little man flopped again, scraped some dust together with"
"his two hands, spat upon it, then smeared his forehead with the stuff,"
uttering the names of sundry saints.
Francesco had come to the end of his patience.
"""Get up, my friend,"" he said, ""we have had enough praying for one"
"day!"""
"The goatherd offered to anoint him with dust and spittle, pointing a"
"stumpy forefinger, but Francesco was filled with disgust. He caught"
the man by the girdle and lifted him to his feet.
"""Enough of this!"" he said. ""Is the devil so much your master?"""
"The goatherd blinked red-lidded and pious eyes, while he scanned the"
"""So it is, after all, a bargain that you offer me!"" he said. ""You are"
"trying to save them. You offer a high price, but I am not a merchant."
"I can not buy you, Beatrice."""
"""It is not a bargain!"" For the first time she faltered, taken aback by"
"the pitiless logic of his words. ""Can't you see that? Can't you see"
"that, however much I loved you, I could not act otherwise than implore"
you to turn back from a step that means destruction for those bound to
"me by blood and country? Could I do less?"""
"""No,"" he said slowly."
She held out her hands to him.
"""Oh, Nehal, turn back while there is yet time! For my sake, for yours,"
"for us all, turn back from a bloody, cruel revenge. The power is"
"yours. Be generous. If we have wronged you, we have suffered and are"
"ready to atone. _I_ am ready to atone. I _can_ atone, because I love"
you. I have spoken the truth to you. I have laid my soul bare to you
"as I have done to no other being. Won't you trust me?"""
"His eyes met hers with a somber, hopeless significance which cut her"
to the heart.
"""I can't,"" he said. ""I can't. That is what you have taught me--to"
"distrust you--and every one."""
"She stood silent now, paralyzed by the finality of his words and"
gesture. It was as though the shadow of her heartless folly had risen
"before her and become an iron wall of unrelenting, measured"
retribution against which she beat herself in vain. He lifted his head
"higher, seeming to gather together his shaken powers of self-control."
"""Gyroscopes!"""
"""35,000. Drivers in equilibrium at ten degrees plus. All x."""
"""Upper lights and lookout plates!"""
"The second assistant was galvanized into activity, and upon a screen"
before him there appeared a view as though he were looking directly
upward from the prow of the great vessel. The air above them was full of
"aircraft of all shapes and sizes, and occasionally the image of one of"
that flying horde flared into violet splendor upon the screen as it was
"caught in the mighty, roving beam of one of the twelve ultra-light"
projectors under test.
"""Upper lights and lookout plates--all x,"" the second assistant reported,"
and other assistants came to attention as the check-out went on.
"""Lower lights and lookout plates!"""
"""All x,"" was the report, after each of the twelve ultra-lights of the"
"stern had swung around in its supporting brackets, illuminating every"
recess of the dark depths of the bottom well of the berth and throwing
the picture upon another screen in lurid violet relief.
"""Lateral and vertical detectors!"""
"""Laterals XP2710--all x. Verticals AJ4290--all x."""
"""Receptors!"""
"""15,270 kilofranks--all x."""
"""That's hardly fair, is it?"" commented Wilson."
"""It's a start. You have to start somewhere. Radio--know its start?"
The first message was sent across the ocean a few hundred years ago
from one man to the other after they had made a complete plan as to
"time, date, location and frequency, and also the transmitted message."
"Sure enough, they got through. That, too, was under the ideal test"
conditions. So when we finally assembled the half-a-hundred separate
circuits and devices that made it look as though we might have a space
"detector, we put up targets, aimed our equipment, and looked for a"
"response where there should be one."""
"""We don't know where our target is,"" objected Wilson."
"""And we haven't yet fired up this equipment to seek a target of unknown"
"position and range,"" admitted Allison. ""But this gear is better than"
"nothing."""
Again the green spots flickered in the dome over their heads.
"""What do all those spots mean?"" asked Wilson."
"""Those are false targets, probably caused by background noise. Although"
"the infrawave is noiseless, we still seem to be getting it. Dr."
"Friedrich disagrees. He claims this is not noise, but interferences."
"However, the good doctor is not at all certain that the so-called"
interferences come from localized conditions within the equipment or
"from external sources."""
"Wilson shrugged. ""I don't see how it's done with a radiation type that"
"has neither a directional quality nor a velocity of propagation."""
"1. A SOURCE below, usually a bituminous shale, from whose organic"
matter they have been derived by slow change.
"2. A RESERVOIR above, in which they have gathered. This is either"
a porous sandstone or a porous or creviced limestone.
"3. Oil and gas are lighter than water, and are usually under"
"pressure owing to artesian water. Hence, in order to hold them"
"from escaping to the surface, the reservoir must have the shape of"
"an ANTICLINE, DOME, or LENS."
"4. It must also have an IMPERVIOUS COVER, usually a shale. In"
"these reservoirs gas is under a pressure which is often enormous,"
reaching in extreme cases as high as a thousand five hundred
pounds to the square inch. When tapped it rushes out with a
"deafening roar, sometimes flinging the heavy drill high in air. In"
accounting for this pressure we must remember that the gas has
been compressed within the pores of the reservoir rock by artesian
"water, and in some cases also by its own expansive force. It is"
not uncommon for artesian water to rise in wells after the
exhaustion of gas and oil.
LIFE OF THE ORDOVICIAN
"During the ages of the Ordovician, life made great advances. Types"
"already present branched widely into new genera and species, and"
new and higher types appeared.
Sponges continued from the Cambrian. Graptolites now reached their
climax.
STROMATOPORA--colonies of minute hydrozoans allied to corals--grew
"wound communicated with the pleura, and the patients died from"
septicæmia mainly due to absorption from the surface of that membrane
(_Pleural septicæmia_).
"No. 190 is a most striking instance of spontaneous cure, since no doubt"
can exist that both rectum and bladder were perforated.
"(180*) _Injury to the cæcum and ascending colon._--Boer,"
"wounded at Graspan while sheltering behind a rock, lying on his"
back.
"_Entry_ (Lee-Metford), in right thigh, 3 inches below and 1"
"inch within anterior superior spine of ilium; _exit_, in back,"
on a level with the fourth lumbar spinous process and 3 inches
from that point.
Half an hour after the wound the patient commenced to suffer
severe stabbing pain; he lay on the field one hour; later he
"was taken to a Field hospital, and on the second day was sent"
by train a distance of twenty-five miles.
When seen at the end of fifty hours the condition was as
"follows. Face anxious, complexion dusky. Great abdominal pain,"
especially about the umbilicus. Vomiting frequent and
distressing; bowels confined since the accident; tongue dry and
"furred. Urine scanty. Pulse full and strong, 125; respirations,"
"entirely thoracic, 30."
"Abdomen generally distended and tympanitic, wall rigid and"
"motionless. Dulness in right flank, together with superficial"
oedema and emphysema.
grounded with a coaxial sheath. But there was a clear section that led
"directly down to the CPU. That's where he'd place the blade, and hope"
it'd at least short- circuit the power feed even if it didn't sever the
wires completely.
"He tested the radio transmitter one last time, making sure it would"
"activate the blade, then reached down and clamped the mechanism onto"
"the wire, tightening it with thumb screws. When it was as secure as he"
"could make it, he stood back and examined his handiwork. If somebody"
"decided to remove the faceplate, they'd spot it in a second, but"
otherwise . . .
"Quickly, hands trembling from the cold, he fitted the cover back on the"
module and began replacing the screws with the tiny screwdriver. It
"wasn't magnetized, a deliberate choice, so the small screws kept"
"slipping between his bulky fingers, a problem made more acute by the"
numbing cold.
Three screws to go . . . then he heard the noise. Footsteps on the
aluminum catwalk in the pressure bay above. . . . _Shit_.
"He kept working as fast as he could, grimly holding the screws secure"
and fighting back the numbness and pain in his freezing fingers.
"Only one more. Above, he could hear the sounds of someone checking each"
"of the equipment bays, methodically opening and then resecuring them."
"First the starboard side bay was opened and closed, then the portside"
bay. Now he heard footsteps advancing down the metal stairs leading to
the computer bay. They were five seconds away from discovering him.
The last screw was in.
"that day, despite the fact that Big George, bruised, ragged, and torn,"
doubled his force of pickets and took personal charge of them.
"That night, under glaring headlines, the evening papers told the story,"
"reporting one fisherman fatally hurt, one striker dead of a gunshot"
"wound, and many others injured."
CHAPTER XVIII
WILLIS MARSH SPRINGS A TRAP
"The ensuing days were strenuous ones for the partners, working as they"
"did, with a crippled force and under constant guard. Riot was in the"
"air, and violence on every side. By the police, whose apathy"
disappeared only when an opportunity occurred of arresting the men they
"were supposed to protect, they were more handicapped than helped. The"
appearance of a fisherman at any point along the water-front became a
sure signal for strife.
"Day by day the feeling on both sides grew stronger, till the non-union"
"men were cemented together in a spirit of bitterest indignation, which"
materially lessened their zeal for work. Every act of violence
"intensified their rage. They armed themselves, in defiance of orders,"
"tossed restraint to the winds, and sought the slightest opportunity of"
wreaking vengeance upon their enemies. Nor were the rioters less
"determined. Authority, after all, is but a hollow shell, which, once"
"broken, is quickly disintegrated. Fierce engagements took place,"
"The ""Sunderland,"" like her consorts, was already cleared for action."
"All the crew were behind the protected portions of the ship, but the"
captain and seven of the officers elected to fight the ship not from
the armoured conning-tower but from the fore-bridge.
"""By Jove! They're at it already,"" exclaimed Oswestry, as a series of"
rapid detonations came from across the dunes.
By the aid of their glasses the officers could discern the fleecy
mushrooms of smoke caused by the bursting of the anti-aerial guns
directed against the British airmen. Viewed from a distance it seemed
impossible that a frail aeroplane could exist amid that tornado of
shell.
"""Wireless reports mobile battery three hundred yards sou'-sou'-east"
"of Clemskercke church, sir,"" reported a signalman."
Promptly the news was transmitted to the fire-control platform. In
his lofty perch a gunnery-lieutenant was busy with a complication of
"instruments, assisted by a midshipman and three seamen."
"""Fire-control to for'ard 6-inch gun: stand by!"" came the telephonic"

PLAN
The indexer should decide definitely in his mind just what his
"procedure is to be before actually beginning work. At first, it is well"
"to make the index too full rather than the reverse, as it is easier to"
"cut out than to fill in. Most important of all, he must be sure that"
the matter to be indexed is clearly understood before he attempts to
transcribe the idea. The character of the book to be indexed must be
"carefully considered, taking into account the class of people who will"
"probably consult it, and the lines on which they will probably seek"
information.
Judgment is required in deciding whether it is wise to choose the
exact words of the author or to condense the idea into other words.
"In technical books, the exact wording is sometimes essential, but"
otherwise it is more important to express the _idea_ than the exact
terms in which it is expressed.
Always prefer simple words and expressions to those which are unusual
and cumbersome.
Omit every unessential word.
"When the book being indexed is one written upon a specific subject,"
this main subject should not be indexed unless necessary to indicate
"some reference for which a searcher would look. Ordinarily, the"

Mutely he signed for the helm to be put hard over.
Terence understood. Literally groping his way through the thick

"All around the ""Sunderland"" the destroyers were dodging hither and"
thither in order to attempt to avoid the hail of bombs that rained
from the sky. It was little short of a miracle that collisions did
"not take place, for owing to the darkness, the suffocating fumes from"
"the missiles, and to the fact that most of the helmsmen were"
"temporarily blinded and choked, all attempt at formation was out of"
the question.
From the after-bridge of the cruiser a searchlight flashed skywards.
For a few seconds even its powerful rays failed to penetrate the pall

ACIDUM CARBOLICUM CRUDUM--CRUDE CARBOLIC ACID
DERIVATION.--A liquid consisting of several different constituents of
"coal tar, particularly creosol and phenol, obtained by fractional"
distillation.
"PROPERTIES.--A nearly colorless, or reddish-brown liquid of a strong"
"disagreeable and creosote-like odor, and gradually turning darker on"
exposure to the air and light. Soluble in fifteen parts of water.
PHENOL--ACIDUM CARBOLICUM--CARBOLIC ACID
DERIVATION.--Obtained from crude carbolic acid by agitation with caustic
"soda, heating to 338° F., and adding hydrochloric acid. Then by"
"agitation with sodium chloride, digestion with calcium chloride, and"
distillation at a temperature between 336° F. and 374° F. and finally by
crystallization.
PROPERTIES.--Phenol in its pure state is a solid at ordinary
"temperatures, crystallizing in minute plates or long rhomboidal needles,"
"white or colorless, of a peculiar odor recalling that of creosote, and"
an acrid burning taste. It is likely to be colored pinkish or brown
under the influence of light and air. Soluble in about 19.6 parts of
"water, and very soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, glycerin, fixed"

Now where's the damned on-board AI module?
He scanned the bay. The AI system was the key to his plan. He had to
make certain the computer's artificial intelligence functions could be
"completely shut down, disengaged, when the crucial moment came. He"
couldn't afford for the on-board system-override to abort his planned
revision in the hypersonic flight plan. His job tonight was to make
"sure all the surprises were his, not somebody else's. There wouldn't be"
any margin for screw-ups. Everything had to go like clockwork.
"He edged his way on through the freezing bay, searching the banks of"
"equipment for a clue, and then he saw what he was looking for. There,"
"along the portside bulkhead. It was a white, rectangular console, and"
everything about it told him immediately it was what he wanted.
"He studied it a second, trying to decide where to begin."
At that moment he also caught himself wondering fleetingly how he'd
ever gotten into this crazy situation. Maybe he should have quit the
Air Force years ago and gone to engineering school like his father had
"wanted. Right now, he had to admit, a little electrical engineering"
would definitely come in handy.
He took out a pocket screwdriver and began carefully removing the AI
"console's faceplate, a bronzed rectangle. Eight screws later, he lifted"
it off and settled it on the floor.
The penlight revealed a line of chips connected by neat sections of
plastic-coated wires. Somewhere in this electronic ganglia there had to
"Beneath was a vast, orderly checkerboard. Every alternate square was"
"covered by what seemed a jointless metal plate. The open squares,"
"plainly land under cultivation, were surrounded by gleaming fences"
that hooked each metal square with every other one of its kind as
batteries are wired in series. Over these open squares progressed
"tiny, two legged figures, for the most part following gigantic"
shapeless animals like figures out of a dream. Ahead suddenly appeared
the spires and towers of an enormous city!
"Metropolis and cultivated land! It was as unbelievable, on that raw"
"new planet, as such a sight would have been could a traveler in time"
have observed it in the midst of a dim Pleistocene panorama of young
Earth.
It was instantly apparent that the city was their destination. Rapidly
"the little ship was rushed toward it; and, realizing at last the"
"futility of its laboring, Brand cut off the atomic motor and let the"
shell drift.
"Over a group of squat square buildings their ship passed, decreasing"
speed and drifting lower with every moment. The lofty structures that
were the nucleus of the strange city loomed closer. Now they were
"soaring slowly down a wide thoroughfare; and now, at last, they"
hovered above a great open square that was thronged with figures.
Lower they dropped. Lower. And then they settled with a slight jar on
a surface made of reddish metal; and the figures rushed to surround
them.
*       *       *       *       *
"Looking out the glass panel at these figures, both Brand and Dex"
former showing his delight in a rare display of white teeth and a flow
"of unintelligible English. Even the sledge-dogs, now fat from idleness,"
"greeted their mistress with a fierce clamor that dismayed Alton Clyde,"
to whom all was utterly new and strange.
"""Glory be!"" he exclaimed. ""They're nothing but wolves. Won't they bite?"
"And the house--ain't it a hit! Why, it looks like a stage setting! Oh,"
"say, I'm for this! I'm getting rough and primitive and brutal already!"""
"When they passed from the store, with its shelves sadly naked now, to"
"the cozy living quarters behind, his enthusiasm knew no bounds. Leaving"
"Chakawana and her mistress to chatter and clack in their patois, he"
"inspected the premises inside and out, peering into all sorts of"
"corners, collecting souvenirs, and making friends with the saturnine"
breed.
"Cherry would not return to the ship, but Emerson and Clyde re-embarked"
"and were rowed down to the cannery site, abreast of which lay _The"
"Bedford Castle_, where they lingered until the creeping twilight forced"
them to the boat again. When they reached the ship the cool Arctic
"night had descended, but its quiet was broken by the halting nimble of"
"steam-winches, the creak of tackle, the cries of men, and the sounds of"
a great activity. Baring his head to the breezes Boyd filled his lungs
"full of the bracing air, sweet with the flavor of spring, vowing"
secretly that no music that he had ever heard was the equal of this. He
"turned his face to the southward and smiled, while his thoughts sped a"
message of love and hope into the darkness.
"on the field an hour, whence he was removed to hospital."
"Probably the track pierced the ilium, and remained confined to"
the abdominal wall. There were no signs of visceral injury.
"(159) Cape Boy. Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_ (Lee-Metford),"
immediately above and outside right anterior superior spine;
"_exit_, 1-1/2 inch below and to right of umbilicus. A"
well-marked swelling corresponded with division of the fibres
"of the oblique muscles and of the rectus, and on palpation a"
hollow corresponding with the track was felt. The abdominal
muscles were exceptionally well developed (fig. 84).
"(160) Wounded at Magersfontein while lying prone. _Entry_,"
"irregular, oblique, and somewhat contused, over the eighth left"
"rib, in the anterior axillary line; _exit_, a slit wound"
immediately above and to the left of the umbilicus. The bullet
"struck a small circular metal looking-glass before entering,"
hence the irregularity of the wound. The patient developed a
"hæmothorax, but no abdominal signs; the former was probably"
"parietal in origin, secondary to the fractured rib, and the"
whole wound non-penetrating as far as the abdominal cavity was
concerned.
"(161) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1-1/2 inch"
external to and 1/2 inch below the left posterior superior
"iliac spine; _exit_, 1 inch internal horizontally to the left"
anterior superior spine.
"No signs of intra-peritoneal injury were noted, but free"
suppuration occurred in left loin; the ilium was tunnelled.
The same patient was wounded by a Jeffrey bullet in the hand;
welcome it and then I would destroy it once and for all. I would enjoy
"my leave at any cost. It would become my only reality, and when it was"
over it would be a reality which I would take back to the front. I would
"hoard it and always think of it out there, so that the war would seem"
"like a dream, the end of which I could await with patience and"
resignation.
I went out to seek friends and acquaintances. I also hoped to meet some
war enthusiasts. I would tell them something about the war. How would
their theories be able to stand before my actual experiences!
I was soon disillusioned.
I dined with a wealthy kinsman. The slaughter of millions had brought
"him prosperity. He had never done any fighting except with his mouth,"
"but it is precisely that kind of fighting that infuriates the spirit,"
"engenders heroic ardour, and causes the nostrils to dilate. He was so"
"bellicose that he even desired to do some _real_ righting, not"
understanding the difference between the two. He thought of joining an
"infantry unit--the artillery were not good enough, he did not want to"
"fire at an enemy he could not see, he wanted to use the bayonet and"
murder his fellow men in hand-to-hand encounters.
I began to understand why many men I had met were glad to come back from
leave.
"I tried to dissuade him, although I felt it would do him good to see"
something of the war and he would learn a much-needed lesson. And yet I
"did not want him killed or horribly mutilated, although I knew that he"
"and those like him were alone responsible for the entire war, both at"
its origins and its continuance.
"Another naked tree I would paint is the gleaming mauve-silver fig, which"
"burns its cold incandescence, tangled, like some sensitive creature"
emerged from the rock. A fig tree come forth in its nudity gleaming over
"the dark winter-earth is a sight to behold. Like some white, tangled sea"
"anemone. Ah, if it could but answer! or if we had tree-speech!"

"Yes, the steep valley sides become almost gorges, and there are trees."
"Not forests such as I had imagined, but scattered, grey, smallish oaks,"
"and some lithe chestnuts. Chestnuts with their long whips, and oaks with"
"their stubby boughs, scattered on steep hillsides where rocks crop out."
"The train perilously winding round, half way up. Then suddenly bolting"
"over a bridge and into a completely unexpected station. What is more,"
men crowd in--the station is connected with the main railway by a post
motor-omnibus.
An unexpected irruption of men--they may be miners or navvies or
land-workers. They all have huge sacks: some lovely saddle-bags with
rose-coloured flowers across the darkness. One old man is in full
"black-and-white costume, but very dirty and coming to pieces. The others"
wear the tight madder-brown breeches and sleeved waistcoats. Some have
"the sheepskin tunic, and all wear the long stocking cap. And how they"
smell! of sheep-wool and of men and goat. A rank scent fills the
carriage.
"They talk and are very lively. And they have mediaeval faces, _rusé_,"
"never really abandoning their defences for a moment, as a badger or a"
pole-cat never abandons its defences. There is none of the brotherliness
and civilised simplicity. Each man knows he must guard himself and his
own: each man knows the devil is behind the next bush. They have never
within the posterior axillary line. The whole right side of the
"chest was dull, with signs of the presence of fluid, the heart"
being displaced to the left. There was considerable distress;
"the respirations averaged 40, the pulse 100, and the"
temperature reached 101.5° the first evening after arrival.
On the nineteenth day the thorax was aspirated (Mr. Hanwell)
"and 50 ounces of dirty red-coloured fluid, half clot, half"
"serum, were evacuated. Considerable relief was afforded; the"
respirations became slightly less frequent; the heart returned
"to a normal position, and distant tubular respiration was"
audible. The temperature dropped to normal the third day after
"evacuation of the fluid, but on the sixth day it again"
"commenced to rise, and meanwhile fluid again began to collect."
On the twenty-sixth day a second aspiration resulted in the
evacuation of 35 ounces of bloody fluid in which flakes of
lymph were found. Three days later the temperature became
"normal. The respirations fell to 22, and the patient made an"
uninterrupted recovery.

They were now in the midst of the great wilderness. On all sides
"myriads of trees, interminably pillared; through their tops the wind"
sighed and pined like the soft breath of a sleeping world. Away on
"every hand stretched oblivious vistas, black under multitudinous green"
spires.
"The interminable trees seemed to vex the duke's spirit, as their"
trunks crowded the winding track and seemed to shut in the twain as
"with a never ending barrier. And behind them, with the muffled tread"
"of a phantom army, came the duke's armed array striding through the"
night.
"""Have you too suffered a wrong at the hands of the Frangipani?"""
"Francesco at last broke the silence, turning to his companion."
The latter jerked the bridle of his charger so viciously that the
terrified animal reared on its haunches and neighed in protest.
"""Man, know you whereof you speak?"" the duke snarled, as he came closer"
"to Francesco. ""He has made the one woman the Duke of Spoleto ever"
"loved--a wanton!""--"
They pushed uphill through the solemn shadows of the forest. A sound
like the raging of a wind through a wood came down to them faintly
"from afar. It was a sullen sound, deep and mysterious as the hoarse"
"babel of the sea, smitten through with the shrill scream of trumpets,"
like the cry of gulls above a storm. Yet in the aisles of the pine
forest it was still as death.
"Then, like a spark struck from flint and steel falling upon tinder, a"
red glare blazed out against the background of the night. A horn
"blared across the moorlands; the castle bell began to ring, jerkily,"
"countrymen in South Africa, there stood up a man himself nurtured in"
"luxury, to take up the burden of the disinherited. His wife too stood by"
"him, a lady of gentle birth. We all know who that man is--he is"
"Gandhi,--and what humiliations and suffering he went through. Do you"
think he suffered in vain and that his voice remained unheard? It was
"not so, for in the great vortex of passion for Justice, there were"
caught others--men like Polak and Andrews. Are they your countrymen? Not
"in the narrow sense of the word but truly in a larger sense, that these"
who choose to bear and suffer belong to one clan the clan from which
Kshatriya Chivalry is recruited. The removal of suffering and of the
cause of suffering is the Dharma of the strong Kshatriya. The earth is
the wide and universal theatre of man's woeful pageant. The question is
who is to suffer more than his share. Is the burden to fall on the weak
or the strong? Is it to be under hopeless compulsion or of voluntary
acceptance?

But this is no longer so.

Having resumed their respective stations the cruiser and the
destroyer flotilla followed. Owing to the greatly reduced speed of
the hostile aircraft it was an easy matter to maintain a fixed
"relative distance between them and the British vessels, whose"
attention was divided between the prospect of an aerial meeting with
seaplanes and the risk of being intercepted by the torpedo of a
"German submarine, to say nothing of floating mines."
"""She's cast off!"" shouted a dozen voices."
"Such was the case. The two Zeppelins had parted company, one flying"
"off at a terrific speed, rising rapidly as she did so, while the"
"other, being without means of propulsion, drifted at the mercy of the"
winds.
It was now dawn. The grey light of morning was already overcoming the
strength of the searchlights and it was already possible to discern
the outlines of the abandoned Zeppelin by the natural light of day.
Pelting up from the eastward came the air squadron of seaplanes. Half
"a dozen circled and started off in pursuit of the fugitive airship,"
"which, travelling at high speed, was now but a faint speck against"
the ruddy sky.
"The rest advanced boldly upon the disabled Zeppelin, although"
"ignorant of the fact that she had jettisoned her guns, and, save for"
"a few rifles, was without means of defence."
"The seaplanes' automatic guns spat viciously, and as the range"
decreased almost every shot began to tell. The huge fabric once more
"began to drop, as the small projectile ripped through the flimsy"
aluminium envelope.
"of horns, the shouting of commands."
The duke and Francesco had dismounted and were gazing up towards the
storm-swept ramparts. Shrieks and curses rolled down upon them like
the tumbling of a cascade.
"Then they began to scale the ledge, the path dwindling to a goat's"
highway.
Above them rose a sheer wall on which there appeared not clinging
space for a lizard. The abyss below was ready to welcome them to
perdition if their feet slipped.
"After a brief respite they continued, the duke's men scrambling up"
"behind them, looking like so many ants on the white chalk-cliffs. The"
"air was hot to suffocation; the storm roared, the thunder bellowed in"
"deafening echoes through the skies, and the heavens seemed one blazing"
"cataract of fire, reflected in the throbbing mirror of the sea."
"They had reached a seam in the rock, where they paused for a moment to"
let their brains rest. There was hardly room for the duke and
"Francesco on the ledge, so narrow was the rocky shelf, and the latter"
was pushing close against the wall when he was suddenly forced to look
"up. He heard the din of the encounter above. The Pisans, having"
"attacked the Frangipani from the south, were driving them out at the"
"north. Suddenly two bodies whizzed by him, thrust over the ramparts in"
the fierceness of the assault. Another came; he seemed to have jumped
"for life, for he kept feet foremost for a distance through the air,"
"before he began to whirl. These fell clear of the scaling party, and"
"were impaled on the broken tops of the stunted trees, that bossed the"
side of the precipice. One came so near the duke that his flight
downward almost blew him off his narrow perch. His head struck the

"to him. He went in like a man nerved for peril, with sword drawn and"

no voice broke the silence.
"The refectory was open, the door standing half ajar. Francesco thrust"
it full open with the point of his sword and looked in. A gray light
filtered through the narrow windows. The nuns lay huddled on benches
"and on the floor. Some lay fallen across the settles, others sat with"
their heads fallen forward upon the table; a few had crawled towards
the door and had died in the attempt to escape. The shadow of death
was over the whole.
Francesco's face was as gray as the faces of the dead. There was
"something here, a horror, a mystery, that hurled back the warm courage"
of the heart.
"With frantic despair he rushed from one body to the other, turning the"
"dead faces to the light, fearing every one must be that of his own"
"Ilaria. But Ilaria was not among them; the mystery grew deeper, grew"
"more unfathomable. For a moment, Francesco stood among the dead nuns"
"as if every nerve in his body had been suddenly paralyzed, when his"
"eyes fell upon a crystal chalice, half overturned on the floor. It"
contained the remnants of a clear fluid. He picked it up and held it
to his nostrils. It fell from his nerveless fingers upon the stone and
"broke into a thousand fragments, a thin stream creeping over the"
granite towards the fallen dead. It was a preparation of hemlock and
"bitter almonds. He stared aghast, afraid to move, afraid to call. The"
nuns had poisoned themselves.
"Like a madman he rushed out into the adjoining corridor, hither and"
"thither, in the frantic endeavor to find a trace of Ilaria. Yet not a"
"earth for ages before this in lowly types, which, being destitute"
"of hard parts, would leave no record."
THE SILURIAN
The narrowing of the seas and the emergence of the lands which
characterized the closing epoch of the Ordovician in eastern North
America continue into the succeeding period of the Silurian. New
species appear and many old species now become extinct.
THE APPALACHIAN REGION. Where the Silurian system is most fully
"developed, from New York southward along the Appalachian"
"Mountains, it comprises four series:"
"4 Salina  . . . shales, impure limestones, gypsum, salt"
3 Niagara . . . chiefly limestones
"2 Clinton . . . sandstones, shales, with some limestones"
"1 Medina  . . . conglomerates, sandstones"
The rocks of these series are shallow-water deposits and reach the
total thickness of some five thousand feet. Evidently they were
"laid over an area which was on the whole gradually subsiding,"
although with various gentle oscillations which are recorded in
the different formations. The coarse sands of the heavy Medina
"formations record a period of uplift of the oldland of Appalachia,"
when erosion went on rapidly and coarse waste in abundance was
brought down from the hills by swift streams and spread by the
"waves in wide, sandy flats. As the lands were worn lower the waste"
"became finer, and during an epoch of transition--the Clinton--"
"there were deposited various formations of sandstones, shales, and"
limestones. The Niagara limestones testify to a long epoch of
"repose, when low-lying lands sent little waste down to the sea."
"the foliage, still flashes and dominates the landscape. Ha-ha! proud"
"mankind! There you ride! But alas, most of the men are still"
"khaki-muffled, rabbit-indistinguishable, ignominious. The Italians look"
curiously rabbity in the grey-green uniform: just as our sand-colored
"khaki men look doggy. They seem to scuffle rather abased, ignominious"
"on the earth. Give us back the scarlet and gold, and devil take the"
hindmost.
*       *       *       *       *
The landscape really begins to change. The hillsides tilt sharper and
"sharper. A man is ploughing with two small red cattle on a craggy,"
tree-hanging slope as sharp as a roof-side. He stoops at the small
"wooden plough, and jerks the ploughlines. The oxen lift their noses to"
"heaven, with a strange and beseeching snake-like movement, and taking"
"tiny little steps with their frail feet, move slantingly across the"
"slope-face, between rocks and tree-roots. Little, frail, jerky steps the"
"bullocks take, and again they put their horns back and lift their"
"muzzles snakily to heaven, as the man pulls the line. And he skids his"
wooden plough round another scoop of earth. It is marvellous how they
"hang upon that steep, craggy slope. An English labourer's eyes would"
bolt out of his head at the sight.
There is a stream: actually a long tress of a water-fall pouring into a
"little gorge, and a stream-bed that opens a little, and shows a"
marvellous cluster of naked poplars away below. They are like ghosts.
"They have a ghostly, almost phosphorescent luminousness in the shadow of"
"the valley, by the stream of water. If not phosphorescent, then"
"incandescent: a grey, goldish-pale incandescence of naked limbs and"
"myriad cold-glowing twigs, gleaming strangely. If I were a painter I"
"would paint them: for they seem to have living, sentient flesh. And the"
shadow envelopes them.
"throat. After all, he was going to win! Out of the shimmering distance"
"of his desire, the lady of his dreams drew closer to him; and ere long"
"he could lay at her feet the burden of his travail, and then--."
"Oblivious to the turmoil all about, he wrote rapidly, almost"
"incoherently, to Mildred, transcribing the mood of mingled tenderness"
and exultation which possessed him.
"""Outside the building,"" he concluded, ""there is a raging mob. They"
"would ruin me if they could, but they can't do it, they can't do it. We"
"have beaten them all, my lady. We have won!"""
"He was sealing his letter, when, without warning, ""Fingerless"" Fraser"
"appeared at his side, his fishlike eyes agleam, his colorless face"
drawn with anxiety.
"""They've come to grab you for killing that striker,"" he began,"
"breathlessly; ""there's a couple of 'square-toes' on the dock now."
"Better take it on the 'lam'--quick!"""
"""God!"" So Marsh had withheld this stroke until the last moment, when"
the least delay would be fatal. Boyd knew that if he were brought into
court he would have hard shift to clear himself against the mass of
perjured testimony that his rival had doubtless gathered; but even this
seemed as nothing in comparison with the main issue. For one wild
instant he considered sending George Balt on with the ship. That would
"be folly, no doubt; yet plainly he could not hold _The Bedford Castle_"
and keep together that raging army of fishermen while he fought his way
through the tedious vexations of a trial. He saw that he had
"under-estimated his enemy's cunning, and he realized that, if Marsh had"
"planned this move, he would press his advantage to the full."
"""There's two plain-clothes men,"" he heard Fraser running on. ""I 'made'"
In this brief sketch it is quite impossible to relate the many
changes of species and genera during the Silurian.
CORALS. Some of the more common types are familiarly known as cup
"corals, honeycomb corals, and chain corals. In the CUP CORALS the"
most important feature is the development of radiating vertical
"partitions, or SEPTA, in the cell of the polyp. Some of the cup"
"corals grew in hemispherical colonies (Fig. 288), while many were"
"separate individuals (Fig. 289), building a single conical, or"
"horn-shaped cell, which sometimes reached the extreme size of a"
foot in length and two or three inches in diameter.
"HONEYCOMB CORALS consist of masses of small, close-set prismatic"
"cells, each crossed by horizontal partitions, or TABULAE, while"
"the septa are rudimentary, being represented by faintly projecting"
ridges or rows of spines.
CHAIN CORALS are also marked by tabulae. Their cells form
"elliptical tubes, touching each other at the edges, and appearing"
in cross section like the links of a chain. They became extinct at
the end of the Silurian.
The corals of the SYRINGOPORA family are similar in structure to
"chain corals, but the tubular columns are connected only in"
places.
To the echinoderms there is now added the BLASTOID (bud-shaped).
"The blastoid is stemmed and armless, and its globular ""head"" or"
"""calyx,"" with its five petal-like divisions, resembles a flower"
"bud. The blastoids became more abundant in the Devonian,"
"culminated in the Carboniferous, and disappeared at the end of the"
Paleozoic.
The gypsum and salt deposits of the Salina show that toward the
close of the Silurian period a slight oscillation brought the sea
"floor nearer to the surface, and at the north cut off extensive"
"tracts from the interior sea. In these wide lagoons, which now and"
then regained access to the open sea and obtained new supplies of
"salt water, beds of salt and gypsum were deposited as the briny"
waters became concentrated by evaporation under a desert climate.
Along with these beds there were also laid shales and impure
limestones.
"In New York the ""salt pans"" of the Salina extended over an area"
one hundred and fifty miles long from east to west and sixty miles
"wide, and similar salt marshes occurred as far west as Cleveland,"
"Ohio, and Goderich on Lake Huron. At Ithaca, New York, the series"
"is fifteen hundred feet thick, and is buried beneath an equal"
thickness of later strata. It includes two hundred and fifty feet
"of solid salt, in several distinct beds, each sealed within the"
shales of the series.
Would you expect to find ancient beds of rock salt inclosed in
beds of pervious sandstone?
The salt beds of the Salina are of great value. They are reached
"by well borings, and their brines are evaporated by solar heat and"
by boiling. The rock salt is also mined from deep shafts.
"Similar deposits of salt, formed under like conditions, occur in"
the rocks of later systems down to the present. The salt beds of
"Texas are Permian, those of Kansas are Permian, and those of"
Louisiana are Tertiary.
"form of line or mezzotint effects,[41] photogravure,[41] and the yet"
"more recent photo-intaglio process known as rotogravure,[41] and"
photo-mezzotint.
DIE CUTTING
"Dies,[41] generally required for stamping the covers of books in gilt"
"letters and designs, are cut in brass by hand or by finely adjusted"
"routing-machines, the design being drawn upon the metal by an artist,"
or transferred to it by photography. In the case of very elaborate
"designs, the dies are first etched by nitric acid or iron perchloride,"
"and the more open or less intricate spaces then deepened by hand, or by"
the routing-machines.
THE PAPER
"In selecting the paper for the book, the publisher must consider the"
"surface required by his plates, the weight necessary to give a proper"
"bulk in proportion to the size of his volume, and the quality as"
"regulated by the price. The average book, with no text illustrations,"
"is printed on wove[42] paper of antique finish, which is a fairly rough"
"surface, giving a maximum bulk. A 12mo[42] book should bulk 1 to 1⅛"
"inches, a 10mo[42] book, 1⅛ to 1¼ inches. If the book runs more than an"
"average length, a medium-or a plate-finish paper may be used, and the"
weight per ream is regulated by the number of pages in each volume and
the bulk required.
"Lineplates print satisfactorily on medium-finish paper, and even"
on antique-finish if the lines are not too fine. Halftones require
"English-finish,[42] super-calendered[42] or coated[42] paper."
"purchasers, the former being mounted as a curiosity, while the backbone"
forms a novel and serviceable walking-stick.
One method of trapping these monsters which affords keen delight was
"related to me. The requirements are an electric battery, some rope, a"
"few feet of electric wire, a cartridge, and an empty box, with a chunk"
"or two of bad meat. The cartridge is fitted with an electric primer,"
the wire of which stretches to the battery. This cartridge is buried
"in a hunk of meat, the whole being dangled from a box--an empty cask is"
"better--which serves as a float, while a rope is stretched from the box"
"to the shore, with the electric wire spirally wound round it. A short"
"length of chain is preferable, if available, to attach the bait to the"
"float, but a short piece of rope will do. This novel line is thrown"
"into the water, and the man keeps his eye on the float, with one finger"
"on the battery. The hungry shark, espying the tempting morsel, makes a"
"grab and swallows it, but the chain prevents him tearing away with it."
"The pull causes the float to disappear, the man’s finger presses the"
"button, and the trick is done. There is an explosion, and pieces of"
shark and showers of water fly into the air. The incident is all over
too quickly for the fish to marvel about the strange indigestibility
of the tainted meat he grabbed so greedily. The men enjoy this sport
"hugely when it can be followed, as they regard the shark with intense"
detestation.

KEEPER CLEANING THE LAMP AFTER IT HAS COOLED DOWN.]
"Despite the vigilance of the various Powers, slave-running is still a"
lucrative business on these forbidding coasts. Now and again a forced
"The third forward bay, located beneath the other two and down a set of"
"steel stairs, was the one he needed to penetrate. It contained all the"
"computer gear: flight control, navigation, and most importantly, the"
artificial intelligence (AI) system for pilot interface and backup.
He suddenly found himself thinking a strange thought. Since no air-
"breathing vehicle had ever flown hypersonic, every component in this"
"plane was, in a sense, untested. To his mind, though, that was merely"
one more argument for shutting down the damned AI system's override
"functions before he went hypersonic. If something did go wrong, he"
wanted this baby on manual. He only needed the computer to alert him to
potential problems. The solutions he'd have to work out with his own
"brain. And balls. After all, that's why he was there."
"As he walked down the steel steps, he thumbed through the magnetic"
"cards, praying he had the one needed to open the lower bay and access"
the computers. Then he began inserting them one by one into the green
"metallic slot, trying to keep his hand steady in the freezing cold."
"Finally one worked. The three encoded diodes blinked, and a hydraulic"
"arm automatically slid the port open. Next the interior lights came on,"
an orange high-voltage sodium glow illuminating the gray walls.
"This third bay, like the two above it, was big enough to stand in. As"
"he stepped in, he glanced back up the stairs, then quickly resealed the"
"door. Off went the lights again, so he withdrew his penlight and turned"
to start searching for what he wanted.
Directly in front of him was a steel monolith with banks of toggle
"switches: electrical power controls, communications controls,"
"propulsion system controls, reaction-control systems. Okay, that's the"

"We have insisted on the difference between Tragedy and Pathos, and"
criticized the weakening effect of the latter upon the former. To escape
the penalty that awaits general criticism we may add here that Tragedy
is never greater than when her handmaid is ready to do her _modest_
"service. Sophocles puts into the mouth of Oedipus, at the moment of his"
"departure into blind and desolate exile, tender injunctions regarding"
the care of his young daughters:
"But my poor maidens, hapless and forlorn,"
"Who never had a meal apart from mine,"
"But ever shared my table, yea, for them"
"Take heedful care; and grant me, though but once,"
"Yea, I beseech thee, with these hands to feel,"
"Thou noble heart! the forms I love so well,"
And weep with them our common misery.
"Oh, if my arms were round them, I might seem"
To have them as of old when I could see.[52]
"Shakespeare, too, knew well how to kindle the soft radiance which,"
"fading again, makes the ensuing darkness darker still. Ophelia, the"
"sleeping Duncan, Cordelia rise to our minds. Nor need we quote the"
famous words of Webster's Ferdinand. It is enough that the greatest
scene in _Gorboduc_ is precisely that scene where pathos softens by a
momentary dimness of vision our horror at a mother's crime.
"_The Misfortunes of Arthur_ (1587), by Thomas Hughes, though twenty-five"
"years later, may be placed next to _Gorboduc_ in our discussion of the"
rise of tragedy. It will serve as an illustration of the kind of tragedy
that was being evolved from Senecan models by plodding uninspired
"_Wounds of the omentum._--Here, again, I am unable to express any"
"opinion, although the supposition that hæmorrhage from this source took"
place is natural.
"Prolapse of omentum was comparatively rare, except in cases with large"
wounds; it was apparently seen with some frequency among patients who
"died rapidly on the field of battle. I only saw it twice, and on each"
occasion in shell wounds. The wounds from small-calibre bullets were as
a rule too small to allow of external prolapse.
"Fig. 89, however, illustrates a very interesting observation. A patient"
"in the German Ambulance in Heilbron, under Dr. Flockemann, died as a"
result of suppuration and hæmorrhage secondary to an injury to the
colon. At the autopsy a portion of the omentum was found adherent in the
"wound of exit, but it had not reached the external surface. The chief"
interest of the observation lies in the light it throws on the mechanism
of these injuries. It is impossible to conceive that a small-calibre
bullet coming into direct contact with the omentum could do anything but
"perforate it. It, therefore, appears clear that in a displacement like"
"that figured, only lateral impact occurred with the omentum, which was"
"carried along by the spin and rush of the bullet into the canal of exit,"
where it lodged.

_Results of injury to the intestine._ 1. _Escape of contents and

be said on this subject. The escape of contents into the peritoneal

clamour against intellectual complications which are the inevitable
"endowment of these days. Life is necessarily intricate, subtle and"
"anxious, and Democracy has made of each man a ruler and governor in"
his degree. Is it possible to point to a single principle which shall
"be a motive and a standard of duty, which shall establish a synthetic"
method after the ruthless analysis of the later Victorian days?
How searching that analysis has been! Fifty years ago the man in the
"street might rarely read the Bible, but he had a tolerably assured"
"conviction that the Bible was infallible, however resolutely he might"
refuse its interpretation by an infallible church.
Then
“...the Essays and Reviews debate Begins to tell on the
"public mind, and Colenso’s views have weight.”"
Plain people were taught to look on the Old Testament as a library of
"Hebrew literature containing not only poetry and history, but romance."
"When Colenso’s book first appeared, Matthew Arnold deprecated its"
publication since it brought criticisms familiar to men of culture
"before the notice of the public, without considering how the beliefs"
of “the vulgar” might be upset.
"The supercilious apostle of “sweetness and light,” himself contributed"
"largely in later years to the general confusion in men’s minds, and"
the New Testament criticism has been introduced to the general public
by Mr. Arnold’s accomplished niece.
"Our friend, the man in the street, was all unprepared!"
"whose names were unknown to Grey, but who evidently were characters well"
known to the others of the company.
"""There is no such thing as justice left, or purity of taste, or any such"
"thing!"" shouted a handsome, well-proportioned fellow, whose face had"
"attracted Grey’s notice several times, and seemed dimly familiar to him."
"""Look at the mouthing mountebanks that walk the boards now!  They strut"
"like peacocks, they gibber like apes.  They have neither voice, nor"
"figure, nor talent, nor grace.  But, forsooth, because some fine dame"
"has smiled upon them, or they are backed by a nobleman’s patronage, they"
"can crow it over the rest of us like a cock upon his dunghill, and we,"
"who have the talent and the gifts, may rot like rats in our holes!"""
"""Shame! shame! shame!"" cried an admiring chorus."
"""Look at me!"" thundered the young man, his eyes flashing.  ""Who dares"
"say I cannot act?  Have I not held spellbound, hanging on my lips, whole"
houses of beauty and fashion?  Have I lost my skill or cunning?  Has my
"voice or has my grace departed from me?  Wherefore, then, do I sit here"
"idle and hungry, whilst men not fit to black my boots hold the boards"
"and fill their pouches with gold?  Why such injustice, I say?"""
A chorus of indignation again arose; but out of the shadows came a deep
voice.
"""The answer is easy, friend Lionel; arrogance and drink have been the"
cause of your downfall.  How could any manager continue to engage you?
How many times has it happened that you have come to the theatre sodden

"folly? They were patient with you.  Oh yes, they were very patient; for"
they knew your gifts and recognized them.  But you met friendly rebuke

"Not that they are suspicious or uneasy. On the contrary, noisy,"
"assertive, vigorous presences. But with none of that implicit belief"
"that everybody will be and ought to be good to them, which is the mark"
of our era. They don't expect people to be good to them: they don't want
"it. They remind me of half-wild dogs that will love and obey, but which"
won't be handled. They won't have their heads touched. And they won't be
fondled. One can almost hear the half-savage growl.
"The long stocking caps they wear as a sort of crest, as a lizard wears"
"his crest at mating time. They are always moving them, settling them on"
"their heads. One fat fellow, young, with sly brown eyes and a young"
"beard round his face folds his stocking-foot in three, so that it rises"
over his brow martial and handsome. The old boy brings his stocking-foot
over the left ear. A handsome fellow with a jaw of massive teeth pushes
his cap back and lets it hang a long way down his back. Then he shifts
"it forward over his nose, and makes it have two sticking-out points,"
"like fox-ears, above his temples. It is marvellous how much expression"
these caps can take on. They say that only those born to them can wear
"them. They seem to be just long bags, nearly a yard long, of black"
stockinette stuff.
The conductor comes to issue them their tickets. And they all take out

They shout and expostulate with the conductor. Full of coarse life they
"are: but so coarse! The handsome fellow has his sleeved waistcoat open,"
"and his shirt-breast has come unbuttoned. Not looking, it seems as if he"
"wears a black undervest. Then suddenly, one sees it is his own hair. He"

THE ALGONKIAN
In some regions there rests unconformably on the Archean an
"immense body of stratified rocks, thousands and in places even"
"scores of thousands of feet thick, known as the ALGONKIAN. Great"
"unconformities divide it into well-defined systems, but as only"
the scantiest traces of fossils appear here and there among its
"strata, it is as yet impossible to correlate the formations of"
different regions and to give them names of more than local
application. We will describe the Algonkian rocks of two typical
areas.
THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO. We have already studied a very
ancient peneplain whose edge is exposed to view deep on the walls
of the Colorado Canyon. The formation of flat-lying sandstone
which covers this buried land surface is proved by its fossils to
"belong to the Cambrian,--the earliest period of the Paleozoic era."
The tilted rocks on whose upturned edges the Cambrian sandstone
"rests are far older, for the physical break which separates them"
from it records a time interval during which they were upheaved to
mountainous ridges and worn down to a low plain. They are
therefore classified as Algonkian. They comprise two immense
series. The upper is more than five thousand feet thick and
consists of shales and sandstones with some limestones. Separated
"from it by an unconformity which does not appear in Figure 207,"
"the lower division, seven thousand feet thick, consists chiefly of"
massive reddish sandstones with seven or more sheets of lava
interbedded. The lowest member is a basal conglomerate composed of
pebbles derived from the erosion of the dark crumpled schists
"beneath,--schists which are supposed to be Archean. As shown in"
Then suddenly the affair altered its complexion.
The oncoming tug was barely twice its length from the scow when Boyd
saw Big George cease his violent antics and level a revolver directly
at the wheel-house of the opposing craft. Two puffs of smoke issued
"from weapon, then out from the glass-encased structure the steersman"
"plunged, scrambled down the deck and into the shelter of the house."
"Instantly the bow of the tug swung off, and she came on sidewise,"
"striking Balt's scow a glancing blow, the sound of which rose above the"
"shouts, while its force threw the big fellow and his companions to"
their knees and shattered the glass in the pilot-house windows. The
"boats behind fouled each other, then drifted down upon the scow, and"
"the tide, seizing the whole flotilla, began to spin it slowly. Rushing"
"to the ladder, Emerson leaped into another launch which fortunately was"
"at hand, and the next instant as the little craft sped out from the"
"side of _The Bedford Castle_, he saw that a fight was in progress on"
"the lighter. It was over quickly, and before he reached the scene the"
"current had drifted the tows apart. George, it seemed, had boarded the"
"tug, dragged the captain off, and beaten him half insensible before the"
man's companions had come to his rescue.
"""Is the scow damaged?"" Emerson cried, as he came alongside."
"""She's leaking, but I guess we can make it,"" George reassured him."
"They directed the second launch to make fast, and, towed by both tugs,"
they succeeded in beaching their cargo a mile below the landing.
"""We'll calk her at low tide,"" George declared, well satisfied at this"
outcome of the misadventure. Then he fell to reviling the men who had
caused it.
"earlier. As a founder of a dynasty that overthrew a previous one, Azag-Bau"
"must have engaged in hostilities with other centres, so that the second"
interpretation that 'the king's country will be seized' may well refer to
"some historical event of the same general period. Be that as it may, the"
important point for us is that we have here another proof of the practical
purpose served by the observation of birth-omens.
IV
Passing now to some illustrations of birth-omens from the collections of
"the =bârû=-priests, let us first take up some texts dealing with omens"
"from the young of animals. Naturally, the animals to which attention was"
"directed were the domesticated ones--sheep, goats, cows, dogs, horses and"
"pigs. Among these the most prominent is the sheep, corresponding to the"
"significance attached to the sheep in liver divination where it is, in"
"fact, the only animal whose liver is read as a means of forecasting the"
future[33]. As a result of this particularly prominent position taken by
"the sheep in birth-omens, the word =isbu=, designating the normal or"
abnormal foetus--human or animal--when introduced without further
qualification generally indicates the foetus of a sheep[34].
"A text[35] dealing with a double foetus, i. e., of a sheep[36], reads in"
part as follows:
"'If it is a double foetus with slits (?) on the head and tail, the"
land will be secure.
"If it is a double foetus and enclosed[37], confusion in the country,"
"rejected. Generally, it was against the regulations and, particularly,"
it was injudicious. Down pillows would not be a factor in Unity Blake's
after-life.
"“Besides,” she remarked, “she is not the only orphan in the infirmary.”"
“Why not call it a sick-room or sick-ward instead of that prison term?”
asked John.
"“It's the name given to it by the governing body,” she replied."
After this John became a regular visitor. Every time he kicked his heels
for ten minutes in the shabby and depressing parlour and every time he
was received with glacial politeness by the Sister superintendent.
By blunt questioning he learned the history of the institution. The
Sisterhood of Saint Martha was an Angelican body with headquarters in
"Kent, which existed for meditation and not for philanthropic purposes."
The creation and conduct of the orphanage had been thrust upon the
sisterhood by the will of a member long since deceased. It was unpopular
"with the sisterhood, who resented it as an excrescence, but bore it as"
an affliction decreed by divine Providence. Among the cloistered inmates
of the Kentish manor-house there was no fanatical impulse towards
Willesden.
"They were good, religious women; but they craved retirement, and not"
"action, for the satisfying of their spiritual needs. Otherwise they"
would have joined some other sisterhood in which noble lives are spent
"in deeds of charity and love. But there are angels of wrath, angels of"
"mercy, and mere angels. These were mere angels. The possibility of being"
chosen by the Mother Superior to go out into the world again and take
"charge of the education, health, and morals of twenty sturdy and squalid"
little female orphans lived an abiding terror in their gentle breasts. A
"prince of cooks. Yet who, by the wildest stretch of fancy, could have"
contemplated tight places or dangers as the trim yacht rode peacefully
at anchor an eighth of a mile off our dock at smiling Miami? To every
man aboard such things as death and the shedding of blood had ceased
"with the armistice, and Gates would have taken his oath, were it asked"
"of him, that our course pointed only toward laughing waters, blue skies,"
and emerald shore-lines.
Early next morning we were under way when Tommy pounded on my stateroom
"door, challenging me to a dip overboard. There was a glorious joy in his"
"voice, as far reaching as reveille, that found response in the cockles"
"of my heart. Gates, never happier than when standing beneath stretched"
"canvas, hove-to as he saw us dash stark naked up the companionway stairs"
"and clear the rail head-first, but he laid by only while we had our"
splash and continued the course southward the moment our hands grasped
the gangway.
"""We're cruising, not swimming,"" he said bluntly, as we reached the deck."
"""But I'll say this,"" he called after us, ""you're both in about as fine"
"condition as men get to be. I'll give _that_ to the Army!"" Which was"
"true, except for the fact that I might have been pronounced overtrained."
"Tommy and I were as hard as nails, our skin glowed like satin--but,"
"better than this, his spirit was quick with the love of living, charged"
with a contagion that had already begun to touch my own.
Half an hour later he mumbled through a crumbling biscuit:
"""If Pete ever cooked better grub than this it was in a previous"
"incarnation!"""
"""Man achieves his greatest triumph but once in life,"" I admitted. ""It's"
"self-evident."""
appears to have had a common origin with it. We may conceive that
the primordial fishes not only had gills used in breathing air
"dissolved in water, but also developed a saclike pouch off the"
gullet. This sac evolved along two distinct lines. On the line of
the ancestry of most modern fishes its duct was closed and it
became the swim bladder used in flotation and balancing. On
"another line of descent it was left open, air was swallowed into"
"it, and it developed into the rudimentary lung of the dipnoans and"
into the more perfect lungs of the amphibians and other air-
breathing vertebrates.
One of the ancient dipnoans is illustrated in Figure 300. Some of
"the members of this order were, like the ostracoderms, cased in"
"armor, but their higher rank is shown by their powerful jaws and"
by other structures. Some of these armored fishes reached twenty-
five feet in length and six feet across the head. They were the
tyrants of the Devonian seas.
GANOIDS. These take their name from their enameled plates or
scales of bone. The few genera now surviving are the descendants
of the tribes which swarmed in the Devonian seas. A restoration of
"one of a leading order, the FRINGE-FINNED ganoids, is given in"
"Figure 301. The side fins, which correspond to the limbs of the"
"higher vertebrates, are quite unlike those of most modern fishes."
"Their rays, instead of radiating from a common base, fringe a"
central lobe which contains a cartilaginous axis. The teeth of the
Devonian ganoids show a complicated folded structure.
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DEVONIAN FISHES. THE NOTOCHORD IS
"PERSISTENT. The notochord is a continuous rod of cartilage, or"
"gristle, which in the embryological growth of vertebrate animals"
supports the spinal nerve cord before the formation of the
of periods when they became more numerous.
ECHINODERMS. This subkingdom comprises at present such familiar
"forms as the crinoid, the starfish, and the sea urchin. The"
structure of echinoderms is radiate. Their integument is hardened
with plates or particles of carbonate of lime.
"Of the free echinoderms, such as the starfish and the sea urchin,"
"the former has been found in the Cambrian rocks of Europe, but"
neither have so far been discovered in the strata of this period
in North America. The stemmed and lower division of the
"echinoderms was represented by a primitive type, the CYSTOID, so"
"called from its saclike form, A small globular or ovate ""calyx"" of"
"calcareous plates, with an aperture at the top for the mouth,"
"inclosed the body of the animal, and was attached to the sea"
bottom by a short flexible stalk consisting of disks of carbonate
of lime held together by a central ligament.
"ARTHOPODS. These segmented animals with ""jointed feet,"" as their"
"name suggests, may be divided in a general way into water"
breathers and air breathers. The first-named and lower division
"comprises the class of the CRUSTACEA,--arthropods protected by a"
"hard exterior skeleton, or ""crust,""--of which crabs, crayfish, and"
"lobsters are familiar examples. The higher division, that of the"
"air breathers, includes the following classes: spiders, scorpions,"
"centipedes, and insects."
"THE TRILOBITE. The aquatic arthropods, the Crustacea, culminated"
before the air breathers; and while none of the latter are found
"in the Cambrian, the former were the dominant life of the time in"
"numbers, in size, and in the variety of their forms. The leading"
"crustacean type is the TRILOBITE, which takes its name from the"
The localised ecchymosis surrounding the apertures is quite
"characteristic of this form of injury, and is a valuable aid to finding"
the openings during an operation.
"Fig. 88 shows the interior of the same segment of bowel, as fig. 87. It"
"shows the localised ecchymosis as seen from the inner surface, here"
rather more extensive from the fact that the blood spreads more readily
in the submucous tissue.
[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Perforating Wounds of Small Intestine. A.
Entry; note circular outline and eversion of mucous membrane. B. Wound
"of exit; curved slit-like character, eversion of mucous membrane. Note"
"the localised ecchymosis, more abundant round exit aperture. (St."
Thomas's Hospital Museum)]
It will be noted that the main feature of the form of injury is the
regular outline and the small size of the wounds. Another feature not
illustrated by the figures should also be mentioned. In the ruptures of
intestine with which we are acquainted in civil practice the wound in
the gut is almost without exception situated at the free border of the
"bowel, but in these injuries it was just as frequently at the mesenteric"
"margin. The importance of this factor is considerable, since wounds"
near the mesenteric edge are much more likely to be accompanied by
"hæmorrhage, and thus the opportunity for diffusion of infection is"
"considerably multiplied, to say nothing of the danger from loss of"
blood.
"Beyond these more or less pure perforations, long slits or gutters were"
occasionally cut. I saw instances of these in the case of the ascending
"colon, and in the small curvature of the stomach. The comparative fixity"
of the portion of bowel struck is a matter of great importance in the
production of this form of injury.
has been unbroken since its beginning.
5. THE CHANGE IN SPECIES HAS BEEN A GRADUAL DIFFERENTIATION.
Tracing the lines of descent of various animals and plants of the
"present backward through the divisions of geologic time, we find"
that these lines of descent converge and unite in simpler and
still simpler types. The development of life may be represented by
a tree whose trunk is found in the earliest ages and whose
branches spread and subdivide to the growing twigs of present
species.
6. THE CHANGE IN ORGANISMS THROUGHOUT GEOLOGIC TIME HAS BEEN A
PROGRESSIVE CHANGE. In the earliest ages the only animals and
"plants on the earth were lowly forms, simple and generalized in"
structure; while succeeding ages have been characterized by the
"introduction of types more and more specialized and complex, and"
therefore of higher rank in the scale of being. Thus the Algonkian
contains the remains of only the humblest forms of the
"invertebrates. In the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian the"
invertebrates were represented in all their subkingdoms by a
"varied fauna. In the Devonian, fishes--the lowest of the"
vertebrates--became abundant. Amphibians made their entry on the
"stage in the Carboniferous, and reptiles came to rule the world in"
the Mesozoic. Mammals culminated in the Tertiary in strange forms
which became more and more like those of the present as the long
ages of that era rolled on; and latest of all appeared the noblest
"product of the creative process, man."
"Just as growth is characteristic of the individual life, so"
"gradual, progressive change, or evolution, has characterized the"
history of life upon the planet. The evolution of the organic
kingdom from its primitive germinal forms to the complex and
"beget children for the State and for Christ, says the lover, children"
"endowed by their upright parents with a good disposition, children who"
see the good example at home which is to guide them. Again and again he
reverts to the mother's duty to suckle the child herself. He indicates
"how the house should be arranged, in a simple and cleanly manner; he"
occupies himself with the problem of useful children's dress. Who stood
"up at that time, as he did, for the fallen girl, and for the prostitute"
compelled by necessity? Who saw so clearly the social danger of
"marriages of persons infected with the new scourge of Europe, so"
violently abhorred by Erasmus? He would wish that such a marriage should
at once be declared null and void by the Pope. Erasmus does not hold
"with the easy social theory, still quite current in the literature of"
"his time, which casts upon women all the blame of adultery and lewdness."
"With the savages who live in a state of nature, he says, the adultery of"
"men is punished, but that of women is forgiven."
"Here it appears, at the same time, that Erasmus knew, be it half in"
"jest, the conception of natural virtue and happiness of naked islanders"
in a savage state. It soon crops up again in Montaigne and the following
centuries develop it into a literary dogma.
CHAPTER XIII
ERASMUS'S MIND-CONTINUED
Erasmus's mind: Intellectual tendencies--The world encumbered by
beliefs and forms--Truth must be simple--Back to the pure
sources--Holy Scripture in the original languages--Biblical
humanism--Critical work on the texts of Scripture--Practice
It was rather comical to see it. We were always climbing. And the line
"curved in great loops. So that as one looked out of the window, time and"
"again one started, seeing a little train running in front of us, in a"
"diverging direction, making big puffs of steam. But lo, it was our own"
little engine pelting off around a loop away ahead. We were quite a long
"train, but all trucks in front, only our two passenger coaches hitched"
on behind. And for this reason our own engine was always running fussily
"into sight, like some dog scampering in front and swerving about us,"
while we followed at the tail end of the thin string of trucks.
I was surprised how well the small engine took the continuous steep
"slopes, how bravely it emerged on the sky-line. It is a queer railway. I"
would like to know who made it. It pelts up hill and down dale and round
"sudden bends in the most unconcerned fashion, not as proper big railways"
"do, grunting inside deep cuttings and stinking their way through"
"tunnels, but running up the hill like a panting, small dog, and having a"
"look round, and starting off in another direction, whisking us behind"
unconcernedly. This is much more fun than the tunnel-and-cutting system.
They told me that Sardinia mines her own coal: and quite enough for her
"own needs: but very soft, not fit for steam-purposes. I saw heaps of it:"
"small, dull, dirty-looking stuff. Truck-loads of it too. And"
truck-loads of grain.
"At every station we were left ignominiously planted, while the little"
engines--they had gay gold names on their black little bodies--strolled
"about along the side-lines, and snuffed at the various trucks. There we"
"sat, at every station, while some truck was discarded and some other"
"sorted out like a branded sheep, from the sidings and hitched on to us."
"It took a long time, this did."
The great vaults of the Abbey of Farfa resounded with glee and
merriment.
"Before a low, massive stone table, resembling a druidical altar,"
"surrounded by giant casks filled with the choicest wines of Italy,"
"Greece and Spain, there sat the Duke of Spoleto and the Abbot"
"Hilarius, discoursing largely upon the vanities of the world, and"
touching incidentally upon questions pertaining to the welfare of
Church and State. A single cresset shed an unsteady light over the
"twain, while a lean, cadaverous friar glided noiselessly in and out"
"the transepts, obsequiously replenishing the beverage as it"
disappeared with astounding swiftness in the feasters' capacious
"stomachs. And each time he replenished the vessels, he refilled his"
"own with grim impartiality, watching the Abbot and his guest from a"
low settle in a dark recess.
The vault was of singular construction and considerable extent. The
roof was of solid stone masonry and rose in a wide semicircular arch
"to the height of about twelve feet, measured from the centre of the"
ceiling to the ground floor.
"The transepts were divided by obtusely pointed arches, resting on"
"slender granite pillars, and the intervening space was filled up with"
drinking vessels of every conceivable shape and size.
"The Abbot of Farfa was a discriminating drinker, boasting of an"
"ancestral thirst of uncommonly high degree, the legacy of a Teutonic"
ancestor who had served the Church with much credit in his time.
They had been carousing since sunset.
"and, according to instructions, looked the accountant officer"
"squarely in the face and gave his name and rating. Then, receiving"
"his money in the crown of his cap, the recipient saluted and moved"
away to make room for the next man.
All was proceeding smoothly and with the regularity of clockwork when
suddenly a diversion occurred.
The ship's company had a mascot in the shape of a young African
"monkey, that had been presented to the ""Sunderland"" by a French"
cruiser during a visit to an Algerian port. Although usually
"good-tempered ""Mephisto"" could and did exhibit fits of sulkiness and"
outbursts of insubordination that would have earned a lower deck man
"ninety days' ""confined to detention quarters."" But the monkey being a"
"sort of chartered libertine, was idolized by the ship's company and"
mildly tolerated by the officers.
Mephisto was lazily sunning himself under the lee of the quarter-deck
6-in gun shield when his eye caught sight of the chief writer's
"silver watch, which that petty officer had occasion to consult."
Probably the monkey imagined that it was one of the tins of condensed
milk for which he had great partiality.
"Getting on his four feet Mephisto ambled across the quarter-deck,"
past the line of men drawn up at attention. Before he could cross the
"chalk line, a symbol for which he had no respect, the chief writer"
had replaced his timepiece.
Foiled in that direction the monkey made a grab at a pile of brand
"new copper coins, and before any of the officers and men could"
"prevent, had made a rush for the weather-shrouds."
In any case if India need to make any contribution to the world it
should be as great as the hope they cherished for her. Let them not
"talk of the glories of the past till they have secured for her, her true"
place among the intellectual nations of the world. Let them find out how
she had fallen from her high estate and ruthlessly put an end to all
that self satisfied and little-minded vanity which had been the cause of
their fatal weakness. What was it that stood in her way? Was her mind
paralysed by weak superstitious fears? That was not so; for her great
"thinkers, the Rishis, always stood for freedom of intellect and while"
"Galileo was imprisoned and Bruno burnt for their opinions, they boldly"
declared that even the Vedas were to be rejected if they did not conform
to truth. They urged in favour of persistent efforts for the discovery
"of physical causes yet unknown, since to them nothing was extra-physical"
but merely mysterious because of a hitherto unascertained cause. Were
they afraid that the march of knowledge was dangerous to true faith? Not
so. For their knowledge and religion were one.
These are the hopes that animate us. For there is something in the Hindu
culture which is possessed of extraordinary latent strength by which it
has resisted the ravages of time and the destructive changes which have
swept over the earth. And indeed a capacity to endure through infinite
transformations must be innate in that mighty civilisation which has
"seen the intellectual culture of the Nile Valley, of Assyria and of"
Babylon war and wane and disappear and which to-day gazes on the future
with the same invincible faith with which it met the past.
"--_Modern Review, vol. XIX, pages_ 277, 278."
"If it is a double foetus with five feet, serious hostility in the"
"country, the house of the man will perish, his stall[45] will be"
destroyed.
"If it is a double foetus with six feet, the population will be"
"diminished, confusion in the land."
"If it is a foetus within a foetus, the king will weaken his enemy,"
his possessions will be brought into the palace[46].
*       *       *       *       *
"If a foetus gives birth to a second foetus[47], the king will assert"
himself against his opponent.
It will be observed that in quite a number of cases two alternative
"interpretations are given, one of an official character referring to the"
"public welfare, or to occurrences in the royal household[48], the other of"
an unofficial character bearing on the welfare of the individual to whom
the mother lamb that had produced the monstrosity belonged. One foetus
"issuing from the other, or one within the other, appears to have been a"
"favorable or an unfavorable sign, according to the position of the second."
"If the one lay above the other, the association of ideas pointed to a"
"control of the ruler over his enemy. In some cases, the association of"
ideas leading to the interpretation is not clear; and we must perhaps
assume in such instances an entry of an event that =actually= occurred
after the birth of the monstrosity in question. A certain measure of
arbitrariness in the interpretations also constitutes a factor to be taken
into consideration; and the last thing that we need to expect in any
system of divination is a =consistent= application of any principle
whatsoever.
"another, shaking the ground and reverberating, and sending up showers of"
"stones and loose earth that came rattling down on to the canteen-roof,"
"while the huddled, sprawling mass of human bodies shook and squirmed"
"with terror. The droning of propellers could be plainly heard, then it"
"grew weaker and weaker, until it passed away. One by one the men got up."
"Someone lit a candle. Tables, benches, and prostrate bodies had been"
thrown into confusion. Cards and coins and overturned beer-mugs littered
the floor. The smell of spilt beer mingled with the smell of stale
tobacco. A few of us stepped out into the open air. We inhaled a
"pungent, sulphurous stench. We were sure our camp had been bombed this"
time and were fearful lest any of our friends had been hit. We walked
past the Church tent--it was full of rents and holes. And just beyond it
was a huge pit with fresh soil heaped up in a ring around it. Loose
earth and stones and sods were scattered everywhere. Then we saw
"something move in the darkness--it was a man on all fours, dragging"
himself painfully along and uttering a groan with every breath. Two
bearers arrived with a stretcher. They put it down by his side and
helped him on to it. Then they picked it up and disappeared in the
gloom. We had hardly walked a few yards further when we saw a light
approaching us. We went towards it. A man was staggering slowly along
and leaning on the shoulder of a comrade who was carrying a lantern. He
"supported his right elbow with his left hand, down the back of which"
two thin streams of blood were winding. His left sleeve was darkly
stained and the blood was dripping from it. His face was very pale and
the corners of his mouth were slightly turned down.
Suddenly the broad white beam of a searchlight swung across the
darkness. For a time it seemed to paw the sky in a hesitating fashion
and then it remained fixed on one spot.
"""There 'e is! There 'e is!"" someone shouted in an excited voice."
reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork.
"Then, suddenly, as he rested there, the room was filled with the"
"strong, sweet odour of mignonette. It came as upon a single buffet of"
wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost
"seemed a living visitant. And the man cried aloud: “What, dear?” as if"
"he had been called, and sprang up and faced about. The rich odour clung"
"to him and wrapped him around. He reached out his arms for it, all his"
senses for the time confused and commingled. How could one be
"peremptorily called by an odour? Surely it must have been a sound. But,"
"was it not the sound that had touched, that had caressed him?"
"“She has been in this room,” he cried, and he sprang to wrest from it a"
"token, for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had"
belonged to her or that she had touched. This enveloping scent of
"mignonette, the odour that she had loved and made her own—whence came"
it?
The room had been but carelessly set in order. Scattered upon the
"flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins—those discreet,"
"indistinguishable friends of womankind, feminine of gender, infinite of"
"mood and uncommunicative of tense. These he ignored, conscious of their"
triumphant lack of identity. Ransacking the drawers of the dresser he
"came upon a discarded, tiny, ragged handkerchief. He pressed it to his"
face. It was racy and insolent with heliotrope; he hurled it to the
"floor. In another drawer he found odd buttons, a theatre programme, a"
"pawnbroker’s card, two lost marshmallows, a book on the divination of"
"dreams. In the last was a woman’s black satin hair bow, which halted"
"him, poised between ice and fire. But the black satin hair-bow also is"
"femininity’s demure, impersonal, common ornament, and tells no tales."
"And then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent, skimming the"
PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS. These valuable illuminants and fuels
"are considered here because, although they are found in traces in"
"older strata, it is in the Ordovician that they occur for the"
first time in large quantities. They range throughout later
formations down to the most recent.
The oil horizons of California and Texas are Tertiary; those of
"Colorado, Cretaceous; those of West Virginia, Carboniferous; those"
"of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Canada, Devonian; and the large"
field of Ohio and Indiana belongs to the Ordovician and higher
systems.
"Petroleum and natural gas, wherever found, have probably"
originated from the decay of organic matter when buried in
"sedimentary deposits, just as at present in swampy places the"
hydrogen and carbon of decaying vegetation combine to form marsh
"gas. The light and heat of these hydrocarbons we may think of,"
"therefore, as a gift to the civilized life of our race from the"
"humble organisms, both animal and vegetable, of the remote past,"
whose remains were entombed in the sediments of the Ordovician and
later geological ages.
Petroleum is very widely disseminated throughout the stratified
"rocks. Certain limestones are visibly greasy with it, and others"
give off its characteristic fetid odor when struck with a hammer.
"Many shales are bituminous, and some are so highly charged that"
"small flakes may be lighted like tapers, and several gallons of"
oil to the ton may be obtained by distillation.
But oil and gas are found in paying quantities only when certain
conditions meet:
DUTY TO OUR COUNTRY
"And lastly, what are our duties to our country? These are essentially to"
win honour for it and also win for it security and peace. As regards
"winning honour for our country, it is true that while India has offered"
from the earliest times welcome and hospitality to all peoples and
nationalities her children have been subjected to intolerable
humiliations in other countries even under the flag of our king.
There can be no question of the fundamental duty of every Indian to
stand up and uphold the honour of his country and strove for the removal
of wrong.
"The general task of redressing wrong is not a problem of India alone,"
but one in which the righteous men are interested the world over. For
"wrong cries for redress everywhere, in the clashings interests of the"
"rich and poor, between capital and labour, between those who hold the"
"power and those from whom it has been withheld,--in a word in the"
struggle of the Disinherited.
When any man is rendered unable to uphold his manhood and self-respect
and woman are deprived of the chivalrous protection and consideration of
"men and subjected to degradation, the general level of manhood or"
womanhood in the world is lowered. It then becomes an outrage to
humanity and a challenge to all men to safeguard the sacredness of our
common human nature.
What is the machinery which sets a going a world movement for the
redress of wrong? For this I need not cite instances from the history of
other countries but take one which is known to you and in which the
living actors are still among us. In the midst of the degradation of his
"That, however, despite the largely fanciful character of the entries in"
"the omen texts, these collections not only rested on a firm basis of"
"actual observation, but served a practical purpose is shown by the"
examples that we have of official reports made by the =bârû=-priests of
"human and animal anomalies, with the interpretations attached that"
represent quotations from the collections[21]. A report of this kind in
reference to an animal monstrosity reads in part as follows[22]:
"'If it is a double foetus, but with one head, a double spine, two"
"tails and one body, the land that is now ruled by two will be ruled"
by one person.
"If it is a double foetus with one head, the land will be safe.'"
We have here two quotations from a text furnishing all kinds of
peculiarities connected with a double foetus and we are fortunate in
having the text from which the quotations are made[23]. Evidently an ewe
"has given birth to a monstrosity such as is here described, the case has"
"been reported to the diviners who furnish the king[24] with this report,"
"indicating that since the monstrosity has only one head, what might have"
been an unfavorable omen is converted into a favorable one.
Another report[25] regarding a monstrosity born of a sow reads:
"'If a foetus has eight feet and two tails, the ruler will acquire"
"universal sway. A butcher, Uddanu by name, reported as follows: A sow"
gave birth (to a young) having eight feet and two tails. I have
preserved it in salt and kept it in the house. From
Nergal-eṭir[26].'
Here we have the name of the =bârû=-priest who made the report expressly
"is quite black inside his shirt, like a black goat."
But there is a gulf between oneself and them. They have no inkling of
"our crucifixion, our universal consciousness. Each of them is pivoted"
"and limited to himself, as the wild animals are. They look out, and they"
"see other objects, objects to ridicule or mistrust or to sniff curiously"
"at. But ""thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"" has never entered"
"their souls at all, not even the thin end of it. They might love their"
"neighbour, with a hot, dark, unquestioning love. But the love would"
probably leave off abruptly. The fascination of what is beyond them has
not seized on them. Their neighbour is a mere external. Their life is
"centripetal, pivoted inside itself, and does not run out towards others"
"and mankind. One feels for the first time the real old mediaeval life,"
which is enclosed in itself and has no interest in the world outside.
"And so they lie about on the seats, play a game, shout, and sleep,"
and settle their long stocking-caps: and spit. It is wonderful in
them that at this time of day they still wear the long stocking-caps
as part of their inevitable selves. It is a sign of obstinate and
powerful tenacity. They are not going to be broken in upon by
world-consciousness. They are not going into the world's common clothes.
"Coarse, vigorous, determined, they will stick to their own coarse dark"
stupidity and let the big world find its own way to its own enlightened
"hell. Their hell is their own hell, they prefer it unenlightened."
And one cannot help wondering whether Sardinia will resist right
through. Will the last waves of enlightenment and world-unity break over
them and wash away the stocking-caps? Or is the tide of enlightenment
and world-unity already receding fast enough?
"Certainly a reaction is setting in, away from the old universality,"
"back, away from cosmopolitanism and internationalism. Russia, with her"
_déjeuner_ and of dry bread and octopus soup for dinner soon changed my
outlook upon life. Little wonder then if these folk after six weeks of
such treatment were nervous and excitable.
Such was the condition of body and mind in which they attended the
"long service of Good Friday night. Service I have said, but drama"
"were a more fitting word, a funeral-drama. At the top of the nave,"
"just below the chancel-step, stood a bier and upon it lay the figure"
"of the Christ, all too death-like in the dim light. The congregation"
"gaze upon him, reverently hushed, while the priests’ voices rise in"
prayer and chant as it were in lamentation for the dead God lying
there in state. Hour after hour passes. The women have kissed the
"dead form, and are gone. The moment has come for carrying the Christ"
"out to burial. The procession moves forward--in front, the priests"
"with candles and torches and, guarded by them, the open bier borne"
"shoulder-high--behind, a reverent, bare-headed crowd. The night is"
"dark and gusty. It rains, and the rugged, tortuous alleys of the town"
"are slippery. It is late, but none are sleeping. Unheeding of wind"
"and rain, the women kneel at open door or window, praying, swinging"
"censers, sprinkling perfume on the passing bier. Slowly, haltingly, led"
"by the dirge of priests, now in darkness, now lighted by the torches’"
"flare and intermittent beams from cottage doorways, groping at corners,"
"stumbling in ill-paved by-ways, the mourners follow their God to his"
grave. The circuit of the town is done. All have taken their last look
upon the dead. The sepulchre is reached--a vault beneath the church
from which the funeral started. The priests alone enter with the bier.
"There is a pause. The crowd waits. The silence is deep as the darkness,"
only broken here and there by a deep-drawn sigh. Is it the last depth
"of anguish, or is it well-nigh relief that the long strain is over?"
"The priests return. In silence the crowd have waited, in silence they"
disperse. It is finished.
"supply of granite, gneiss, marble, slate, and other such building"
materials. Still more valuable are the stores of iron and copper
and other metals which they contain.
At the present time the pre-Cambrian region about Lake Superior
"leads the world in the production of iron ore, its output for 1903"
being more than five sevenths of the entire output of the whole
"United States, and exceeding that of any foreign country. The ore"
bodies consist chiefly of the red oxide of iron (hematite) and
"occur in troughs of the strata, underlain by some impervious rock."
A theory held by many refers the ultimate source of the iron to
the igneous rocks of the Archean. When these rocks were upheaved
"and subjected to weathering, their iron compounds were decomposed."
Their iron was leached out and carried away to be laid in the
Algonkian water bodies in beds of iron carbonate and other iron
"compounds. During the later ages, after the Algonkian strata had"
"been uplifted to form part of the continent, a second"
concentration has taken place. Descending underground waters
charged with oxygen have decomposed the iron carbonate and
"deposited the iron, in the form of iron oxide, in troughs of the"
strata where their downward progress was arrested by impervious
floors.
The pre-Cambrian rocks of the eastern United States also are rich
"in iron. In certain districts, as in the Highlands of New Jersey,"
the black oxide of iron (magnetite) is so abundant in beds and
disseminated grains that the ordinary surveyor's compass is
useless.
The pre-Cambrian copper mines of the Lake Superior region are
"among the richest on the globe. In the igneous rocks copper, next"
"to iron, is the most common of all the useful metals, and it was"
"Viggon Sarri smiled confidently. He glanced at Linus Brein and asked,"
"""Just how competent do you think this new thing is?"""
"Linus shrugged. ""We've analyzed the infrawave pattern they've"
developed. It is obvious that this is their first prototype of an
infrawave space detector. The pattern is of the primitive absorptive
"type, which is both inefficient as a detector and is also inclined to"
"produce spurious responses. From our observations, their equipment"
must be extremely complex too. It must be loaded to the scuppers with
"fragile circuits and components, because the search pattern keeps"
"breaking down, or becoming irregular. An efficient detector cannot"
be made of the infrawave bands until the third order of reflective
"response is discovered. I doubt that any research team, no matter how"
"big, can start with the primitive absorption phase of the infrawaves"
and leap to the higher orders of infrawave radiation in less than a
"lifetime of study."""
"""So, gentlemen?"" asked Viggon of his two aides. ""Can you predict"
"whether or not their new detector will deliver the goods?"""
All looked expectantly at Linus Brein.
"""We've been recalculating our probabilities at the introduction of each"
"new phase of their behaviour,"" Linus Brein said seriously. ""From their"
"actions, I would say that they do not know, grasp, or perhaps even"
guess that space has flaws and warps in the continuum. They have been
"going at their search in a pattern of solid geometrical precision, but"
"have been paying no attention to those rifts, small as they are, that"
actually make a straight course bend aside for a distance. So due to
the fact that their search pattern has already passed over one of these
"rifts in which the one lifeship lies, and passed beyond in their line"
"The pulse rose to 120, and respiration to 26, and there was"
"pain, which was subdued by 1/3 grain of morphia, administered"
"subcutaneously. A fair amount of urine was passed, and the"
"bowels acted once, the motion containing blood."
On the second day after operation there was some improvement;
"the pulse still numbered 116, and the temperature was raised to"
"100°, but the belly moved fairly, and pain was moderate."
"Abundant foul-smelling, bile-stained discharge came from the"
wound when the plug was removed. Rectal feeding was
supplemented by small quantities of milk and soda by the mouth.
"The condition did not materially change, but on the fourth day"
it was evident that the suturing of the stomach wound had given
"way, and liquid food escaped readily when taken. The discharge"
remained bile-stained and very foul. No extension of
"inflammation to the general peritoneal cavity occurred, but it"
was evident that the patient was suffering from constitutional
"infection from the foul wound, the lower part of which opened"
up somewhat after the removal of the stitches on the seventh
day. The wound was irrigated three times daily with 1-300
"creolin lotion, but remained very foul. The man slowly lost"
"strength, although escape from the stomach considerably"
decreased. On the tenth day a sudden severe hæmorrhage
"occurred, presumably from a large branch of the coeliac axis."
"The bleeding was readily controlled by a plug, and did not"
"recur; but the patient rapidly sank, and died on the twelfth"
"day after the operation, and fourteen days after reception of"
the injury. No _post-mortem_ examination was made.
"2. _Wounds of the small intestine._--These were comparatively common,"
but offered little that was special either in their symptoms or the
acknowledged the authority of the Ancients without any evidence. How
"naïvely he appeals to Antiquity, again and again, to justify some bold"
"feat! He is critical, they say? Were not the Ancients critical? He"
"permits himself to insert digressions? So did the Ancients, etc."
Erasmus is in profound sympathy with that revered Antiquity by his
fundamental conviction that it is the practice of life which matters.
Not he is the great philosopher who knows the tenets of the Stoics or
Peripatetics by rote--but he who expresses the meaning of philosophy by
"his life and his morals, for that is its purpose. He is truly a divine"
"who teaches, not by artful syllogisms, but by his disposition, by his"
"face and his eyes, by his life itself, that wealth should be despised."
To live up to that standard is what Christ himself calls _Renascentia_.
Erasmus uses the word in the Christian sense only. But in that sense it
is closely allied to the idea of the Renaissance as a historical
phenomenon. The worldly and pagan sides of the Renaissance have nearly
"always been overrated. Erasmus is, much more than Aretino or"
"Castiglione, the representative of the spirit of his age, one over whose"
Christian sentiment the sweet gale of Antiquity had passed. And that
very union of strong Christian endeavour and the spirit of Antiquity is
the explanation of Erasmus's wonderful success.

The mere intention and the contents of the mind do not influence the
"world, if the form of expression does not cooperate. In Erasmus the"
quality of his talent is a very important factor. His perfect clearness
"and ease of expression, his liveliness, wit, imagination, gusto and"
humour have lent a charm to all he wrote which to his contemporaries was
"irresistible and captivates even us, as soon as we read him. In all that"
"constitutes his talent, Erasmus is perfectly and altogether a"
"representative of the Renaissance. There is, in the first place, his"
"cliffs. Each was followed at regular intervals, until a double row of"
swift air-craft flying with methodical precision headed towards the
Flanders shore.
"Already the ""Sunderland"" and three other light cruisers, accompanied"
"by a torpedo-boat destroyer flotilla, were shaping a course for the"
Belgian coast.
Off the East Goodwins they were joined by two monitors and three
"pre-Dreadnought battleships, and the battle line was formed. Away"
"steamed the destroyers to act as screens to the heavier vessels, and"
to guard them from submarine attack. The monitors led the main
"division, the cruisers acting as links between them and the"
"battleships, which, owing to their greater draught, could not"
approach the coast nearer than a distance of from four to seven
miles.
From Aubyn's point of view the forthcoming operations were entirely
new. For the first time in his experience he was to take part in an
"action between ships and shore batteries, the latter being both fixed"
and mobile. It was a comparatively easy matter to plant shells into
"forts the position of which were known, but the Germans had brought"
"up heavy guns mounted on travelling platforms, which could be moved"
"with considerable celerity behind the long, low-lying sand dunes"
between Nieuport and Zeebrugge.
It was partly to locate the latter that the airmen had preceded the
"bombarding ships, and also to harass the enemy's lines of"
"communication. Moreover, hostile submarines were reported to have"
"been brought in sections to Zeebrugge, where they were being bolted"
together ready to take the offensive against the British vessels
operating off the Belgian coast.
"no peace. Nevertheless, when he is seriously ill he does not fear death."
"His hygienics amount to temperance, cleanliness and fresh air, this last"
item in moderation: he takes the vicinity of the sea to be unwholesome
"and is afraid of draughts. His friend Gilles, who is ill, he advises:"
"'Do not take too much medicine, keep quiet and do not get angry'. Though"
"there is a 'Praise of Medicine' among his works, he does not think"
highly of physicians and satirizes them more than once in the
_Colloquies_.
Also in his outward appearance there were certain features betraying his
"delicacy. He was of medium height, well-made, of a fair complexion with"
"blond hair and blue eyes, a cheerful face, a very articulate mode of"
"speech, but a thin voice."
In the moral sphere Erasmus's delicacy is represented by his great need
"of friendship and concord, his dislike of contention. With him peace and"
"harmony rank above all other considerations, and he confesses them to be"
"the guiding principles of his actions. He would, if it might be, have"
all the world as a friend. 'Wittingly I discharge no one from my
"friendship,' he says. And though he was sometimes capricious and"
"exacting towards his friends, yet a truly great friend he was: witness"
"the many who never forsook him, or whom he, after a temporary"
"estrangement, always won back--More, Peter Gilles, Fisher, Ammonius,"
"Budaeus, and others too numerous to mention. 'He was most constant in"
"keeping up friendships,' says Beatus Rhenanus, whose own attachment to"
Erasmus is a proof of the strong affection he could inspire.
At the root of this desire of friendship lies a great and sincere need
of affection. Remember the effusions of almost feminine affection
towards Servatius during his monastic period. But at the same time it is
"a sort of moral serenity that makes him so: an aversion to disturbance,"
"anything, risk anything, and suffer anything to shield her from the"
"filthy Germans, I rejoice that she has in her service such supremely"
efficient guardians as this most wickedly unscrupulous Dawson. There
"is, at any rate, not a trace of our English muddle about him."""
"""Ours is a righteous cause,"" cried poor Cary desperately. ""We are"
"fighting for right against wrong, for defence against aggression, for"
civilisation against utter barbarism. We are by instinct clean
"fighters. If in the stress of conflict we stoop to foul methods, can"
we ever wash away the filth of them from our souls? We shall stand
before the world nakedly confessed as the nation of hypocrites we have
"always been declared to be."""
"""Cary,"" I said, ""you make me tired. We cannot be too thankful that we"
"possess Dawsons to counterplot against the Germans, and that"
personally we are in no way responsible for the morality of their
methods. Come off the roof and get back to this most interesting
"affair of the _Antinous_. I presume one of Dawson's men was working,"
"unknown to his fellows, with the care and maintenance party, and"
"another, equally unknown, with the engineers who were busy upon the"
gearing of the turbines. Many of the regular ship's officers and men
would also have been on board. Had our remarkable friend his agents
among them too? Everything is possible with Dawson; I should not be
"surprised to hear that he had police officers in the Fleet flagship."""
"""You are almost right. One of his men, a temporary petty officer of"
"R.N.V.R., was certainly on board, and he tells me that down in the"
engine room was another--a civilian fitter. They were both first-class
"men. The electric wires, as you know, are carried about the ship under"
"the deck beams, where they are accessible for examination and repairs."
"They are coiled in cables from which wires are led to the switch room,"
"and thence to all parts of the ship. There are thousands of wires, and"
atheistic rhetoric has been placarded at the cost of the State in
every commune throughout France.
"We may consider, then, if there be any method by which the man who"
"does not read theological or scientific or philosophical books, the"
"man who has left off going to church, or gets no help from the"
"average sermon, the man who has no reverence for mere authority, may"
be induced to consider the Christian Revelation as offering him a key
to those riddles of life which his civic responsibilities are
perpetually propounding.
Remember that his present condition may be roughly described as
consisting of religious haziness and moral laziness. The moral
laziness is being subjected to a series of rough shocks. He _must_
make up his mind about some questions of morality. The relation of the
"sexes, the duties of property, the treatment of the subject savage,"
"the survival of the unfit, the ethics of commerce, the control of the"
"sale of alcohol, the education of children, these things he has to"
"decide and he will ultimately decide. But he is at present perplexed,"
and his religious haziness is the reason of his perplexity. He perhaps
"has not reached the conclusion of his contemporary in France, but he"
is on the way to it. Those heavenly lights which M. Viviani declares
that his Government has extinguished still shine faintly for men in
"England, though the mists obscure them."
"Can we get men to look upwards for light, and instead of cursing the"
"ancient creed in a confused commination, to take Arthur Clough’s"
advice--
“Ah! yet consider it again.”
"I believe that there is a method, and as I mention it I am prepared"
The dozen men who had been slinging freight on the dock hastened up the
"gang-plank or climbed the fenders, while the signal-man clung to the"
"lifting tackle, and, at the piping cry of his whistle, was swung aloft"
out of the very arms of the rioters.
"Above, on the flying bridge, Captain Peasley was bellowing orders; a"
quartermaster was running up the iron steps to the pilot-house; on deck
the sailors were fighting their way to their posts through the ranks of
the raging fishermen and the shrieking confusion of the Orientals; the
"last men aboard, with a ""Heave Ho!"" in unison, slid the gang-plank"
"upward and out of reach. The neighboring roofs, lately so black, were"
"emptying now, the onlookers hastening to join in the attack."
Big George alone remained upon the wharf. As he saw the rush coming he
had ordered his men to abandon their load; then he ran to the
"after-mooring, and, taking slack from a deck hand, cast it off. Back up"
"the dock he went to the forward hawser, where, at a signal, he did the"
"same, moving, toward the last, without excessive hurry, as if in a"
"spirit of bravado. The ship was clear, and he had not cut a hawser. He"
had done his work; all but a ton or two of the cargo was stowed. There
was no longer cause for delay.
"""Get aboard! Are you mad?"" Emerson shouted, but the cry never reached"
"him. Back he came slowly, in front of the press, secure in his"
"tremendous strength, defiance in his every move, a smouldering"
challenge in his eyes; and noting that gigantic frame with its
"square-hewn, flaming face, not one of his enemies dared oppose him. But"
"as he passed they yapped and snarled and jostled at his heels, hungry"
to rend him and only lacking courage.
"As yet the ship, although throbbing to the first pulsations of her"
"engines, lay snug along the piling, but gradually her stern swung off"
Lord.”
"Indeed, it is our misfortune in England that Bishops are almost"
necessarily bad leaders. We are told when an election to the Papacy is
imminent that this or that Cardinal is in the list of “Papabili”--a
possible Pope--so in like manner we may almost select amongst the
undergraduates of Oxford and Cambridge our future diocesans. These are
"men clever, shrewd, and hard-working, of estimable private character,"
and not without some modest patrimony. Early entered in the race for
"preferment, ambitious, and yet, _mirabile dictu_, devout, they are"
"endowed first of all with the true qualification for episcopacy, a"
capacity for compromise and a pliant political mind. _Sic itur ad
"astra_ the excellent curate or tutor, the courteous and accomplished"
"chaplain to the Bishop, the eloquent canon and ecclesiastical courtier"
is consecrated and enthroned. Henceforward for the rest of his days he
"must hurry from his study table, crowded with correspondence, to his"
"confirmations, his diocesan society meetings, and his weary,"
humiliating attendance at the House of Lords. What wonder if Bishops
"discourage new ventures of faith, who have no time for thinking, no"
"time for reading, and perhaps, sometimes, too little opportunity for"
prayer!
And so we find them not unwilling to accommodate the Catholic Faith to
"the popular prejudice of the moment, acquiescing in an undogmatic,"
"undenominational, more or less Christian creed. Popularity becomes the"
"very breath of their nostrils, and they proceed to hide in an"
"appendix to the Prayer-book, the hymn _Quicunque vult_."
Yet the discerning can see that now is no time for keeping in the
background the great truths of religion. Already men are being
prepared in many ways to receive them.
good--the power of that sneered-at race that is to thy silly little
individual hand’s strength as the might of the sea to the spite of some
flab stinging medusa!
"Yet, if the insignificance of thy little petty self irk thy conceit"
"at this moment, what of the scented, gloved, and dandified gentlemen"
who write the anarchic words that have led thy conceit to seek some
shabby fame in flinging a bomb amongst innocent people! What of them
whose lyric pens have pointed the way to the Uselessness of the old
and sick and far-too-many and superfluous ones! What of them that go
scot-free--whose philosophies led thee to kill the old miser-woman and
to slay the drunken carter to thine own Egoism’s enrichment? Tsh! thou

"Overman, putting to the touch of practice what the gloved gentlemen"
were content to prate of--Might being Right and the rest.
"Well, thou goest to thy dunghill alone--they to their social triumphs."

lackeys!... Gods! are they not even Envied!

"and throwing down great loops of rope. Under the trees, growing along"
"the ground, were smaller creepers full of thorns, that tore the wayfarer"
"and barred his progress. The forest, too, was full of snakes that crept"
"along the ground, so like in their gray and yellow skins to the earth"
they travelled on that the traveller trod upon them unawares and was
bitten; and some so beautiful with coral red and golden bars that men
would pick them up as some dainty jewel till the snake turned upon them.
Here and there in this forest were little glades wherein there were
"flowers. Beautiful flowers they were, with deep white cups and broad"
glossy leaves hiding the purple fruit; and some had scarlet blossoms
"that nodded to and fro like drowsy men, and there were long festoons of"
white stars. The air there was heavy with their scent. But they were all
"full of thorns, only you could not see the thorns till after you had"
plucked the blossom.
"This wood was pierced by roads. Many were very broad, leading through"
"the forest in divers ways, some of them stopping now and then in the"
"glades, others avoiding them more or less, but none of them were"
"straight. Always, if you followed them, they bent and bent until after"
"much travelling you were where you began; and the broader the road, the"
"softer the turf beneath it; the sweeter the glades that lined it, the"
quicker did it turn.
"One road there was that went straight, but it was far from the others."
It led among the rocks and cliffs that bounded one side of the valley.
"It was very rough, very far from all the glades in the lowlands. No"
"flowers grew beside it, there was no moss or grass upon it, only hard"
"sharp rocks. It was very narrow, bordered with precipices."
"There were many lights in this wood, lights that flamed out like sunsets"
"and died, lights that came like lightning in the night and were gone."
"before undertaking it, and to calculate the probable benefit it could"
"get therefrom, and the probable expenses it would incur; not to speak of"
the result of any possible failure. It may be presumed that Japan would
not tamely be intimidated by any action undertaken by any country which
"is not based on justice and equity, and which, therefore, is not open to"
reason.
"Further, is there any country which would willingly embark on such an"
enterprise single-handed? I think not. The reason is too obvious for me
to elucidate.
"Putting aside altogether any question of justice and equity, if such an"
"enterprise is to be embarked upon at all, it would have to be by common"
"action of all the Western Powers, somewhat similar to that when the"
combined forces of Europe rose against France some hundred years ago.
But let me ask if such a thing is possible under the present
circumstances? The claims of Japan to the kind consideration of humanity
have already become so widely spread that she could no longer be
"trampled upon easily. Man is, after all, a rational being. Do the"
writers of the articles on the Yellow Peril (articles which even now
repeatedly make their appearance) not know the fact that even in France
there is a large number of people who have recently purchased Japanese
"bonds, not to speak of Germany, where those bonds have been openly"
floated by banks of high standing? Even if all the governments of the
"West should be willing to agree to such an enterprise, I do not think"
the people at large would move with them.
"Japan is modest enough, Japan is honest enough. Why does she deserve a"
"general ostracism? She might become, it is possible, a Power of the"
"world. She might become, it is possible, more civilised on the lines of"
"occidental civilisation, after which she strives so earnestly. Are these"
"café. I felt its tremendous emphasis, and was content."
"Then, quite without warning, I caught my breath as my glance fell upon a"
girl dining with an old chap but three tables away. Among the habitués
of the Ritzes of two continents there could not have been found another
"like her, for never had I beheld a face as exquisite--and I've seen"
many. It possessed a beauty that left me helpless--yet there was an
indefinable sadness in it that might have suggested a haunting fear.
"One of the lights among the vines hung close to her, and I could see"
"these things. Even could I see the color of her eyes, deep purple"
eyes--the tone the wild iris takes at twilight. When she leaned one way
I might have thought the rich abundance of her hair contained spun
"copper or deep red gold, and again I would have sworn it matched the"
"mellow brown of chestnuts; in all forming an arrangement of waves, each"
"refusing to stay in place yet never really getting out of order, each"
coquetting with a subtle mischief that found an echo in her lips. Her
neck and shoulders were of that perfection that men realize but can not
"analyze; and her mouth, laughing or in repose, was maddening."
And there was an added charm quite apart from hair and eyes and lips.
"This I had never before seen in any face. Animation? Yes, and more."
"Interest in the life about her? Assuredly, to a very marked degree."
"Wildness? That was it!--a wildness, subtly blended with refinement, that"
found expression in every quick look; as if someone had put a fawn there
"from the forest and it was trying, half humorously, half confidently, to"
keep itself from running away in fright. It was this glory of wildness
that she typified which made my cheeks grow hot with watching.
"But who has ever made a picture worthy of his dreams! How, then, can I"
"describe this girl, when painter, sculptor, writer--all--would miserably"
fail at attempting to portray a beauty whereon imagination might gaze in
lined with hard-packed bumper-layers of hemp and fibre. High into the
air extended the upper half of the ship of space--a sullen gray expanse
"of fifty-inch hardened steel armor, curving smoothly upward to a needle"
prow. Countless hundred of fine vertical scratches marred every inch
"of her surface, and here and there the stubborn metal was grooved and"
scored to a depth of inches--each scratch and score the record of an
attempt of some wandering cosmic body to argue the right-of-way with
the stupendous mass of that man-made cruiser of the void.
"A burly young man made his way through the throng about the entrance,"
"nodded unconcernedly to the gatekeeper, and joined the stream of"
passengers flowing through the triple doors of the double air-lock
"and down a corridor to the center of the vessel. However, instead of"
entering one of the elevators which were whisking the passengers up to
"their staterooms in the upper half of the enormous football, he in some"
way caused an opening to appear in an apparently blank steel wall and
stepped through it into the control room.
"""Hi, Breck!"" the burly one called, as he strode up to the instrument-desk"
"of the chief pilot and tossed his bag carelessly into a corner. ""Behold"
your computer in the flesh! What's all this howl and fuss about poor
"computation?"""
"""Hello, Steve!"" The chief pilot smiled as he shook hands cordially."
"""Glad to see you again--but don't try to kid the old man. I'm simple"
"enough to believe almost anything, but some things just aren't being"
"done. We have been yelling, and yelling hard, for trained computers"
ever since they started riding us about every one centimeter change in
"acceleration, but I know that you're no more an I-P computer than I am"
"a Digger Indian. They don't shoot sparrows with coast-defense guns!"""

"BRACHIOPODS. These soft-bodied animals, with bivalve shells and"
"two interior armlike processes which served for breathing,"
"appeared in the Algonkian, and had now become very abundant. The"
"two valves of the brachiopod shell are unequal in size, and in"
each valve a line drawn from the beak to the base divides the
valve into two equal parts. It may thus be told from the pelecypod
"mollusk, such as the clam, whose two valves are not far from equal"
"in size, each being divided into unequal parts by a line dropped"
from the beak.
Brachiopods include two orders. In the most primitive order--that
of the INARTICULATE brachiopods--the two valves are held together
"only by muscles of the animal, and the shell is horny or is"
"composed of phosphate of lime. The DISCINA, which began in the"
"Algonkian, is of this type, as is also the LINGULELLA of the"
Cambrian. Both of these genera have lived on during the millions
"of years of geological time since their introduction, handing down"
from generation to generation with hardly any change to their
descendants now living off our shores the characters impressed
upon them at the beginning.
The more highly organized ARTICULATE brachiopods have valves of
carbonate of lime more securely joined by a hinge with teeth and
"sockets (Fig. 270). In the Cambrian the inarticulates predominate,"
though the articulates grow common toward the end of the period.
MOLLUSKS. The three chief classes of mollusks--the PELECYPODS
"(represented by the oyster and clam of to-day), the GASTROPODS"
"(represented now by snails, conches, and periwinkles), and the"
"CEPHALOPODS (such as the nautilus, cuttlefish, and squids)--were"
"all represented in the Cambrian, although very sparingly."
calls himself in writing to Colet. But again he cannot help giving
"himself credit for acknowledging that quality, nay, converting that"
"quality itself into a virtue: it is modesty, the opposite of boasting"
and self-love.
This bashfulness about himself is the reason that he does not love his
"own physiognomy, and is only persuaded with difficulty by his friends to"
sit for a portrait. His own appearance is not heroic or dignified enough
"for him, and he is not duped by an artist who flatters him: 'Heigh-ho,'"
"he exclaims, on seeing Holbein's thumbnail sketch illustrating the"
"_Moria_: 'if Erasmus still looked like that, he would take a wife at"
once'. It is that deep trait of dissatisfaction that suggests the
inscription on his portraits: 'his writings will show you a better
image'.
Erasmus's modesty and the contempt which he displays of the fame that
fell to his lot are of a somewhat rhetorical character. But in this we
should not so much see a personal trait of Erasmus as a general form
"common to all humanists. On the other hand, this mood cannot be called"
"altogether artificial. His books, which he calls his children, have not"
turned out well. He does not think they will live. He does not set store
by his letters: he publishes them because his friends insist upon it. He
writes his poems to try a new pen. He hopes that geniuses will soon
"appear who will eclipse him, so that Erasmus will pass for a stammerer."
What is fame? A pagan survival. He is fed up with it to repletion and
would do nothing more gladly than cast it off.
Sometimes another note escapes him. If Lee would help him in his
"endeavours, Erasmus would make him immortal, he had told the former in"
"their first conversation. And he threatens an unknown adversary, 'If you"
"go on so impudently to assail my good name, then take care that my"
"gentleness does not give way and I cause you to be ranked, after a"
"thousand years, among the venomous sycophants, among the idle boasters,"
among the incompetent physicians'.
The self-centred element in Erasmus must needs increase accordingly as
he in truth became a centre and objective point of ideas and culture.
There really was a time when it must seem to him that the world hinged
"upon him, and that it awaited the redeeming word from him. What a"
"widespread enthusiastic following he had, how many warm friends and"
venerators! There is something naïve in the way in which he thinks it
"requisite to treat all his friends, in an open letter, to a detailed,"
rather repellent account of an illness that attacked him on the way back
"from Basle to Louvain. _His_ part, _his_ position, _his_ name, this more"
and more becomes the aspect under which he sees world-events. Years will
come in which his whole enormous correspondence is little more than one
protracted self-defence.
Yet this man who has so many friends is nevertheless solitary at heart.
And in the depth of that heart he desires to be alone. He is of a most
retiring disposition; he is _a recluse_. 'I have always wished to be
"alone, and there is nothing I hate so much as sworn partisans.' Erasmus"
is one of those whom contact with others weakens. The less he has to
"address and to consider others, friends or enemies, the more truly he"
utters his deepest soul. Intercourse with particular people always
"causes little scruples in him, intentional amenities, coquetry,"
"reticences, reserves, spiteful hits, evasions. Therefore it should not"
be thought that we get to know him to the core from his letters. Natures
"like his, which all contact with men unsettles, give their best and"
deepest when they speak impersonally and to all.
After the early effusions of sentimental affection he no longer opens
his heart unreservedly to others. At bottom he feels separated from all
and on the alert towards all. There is a great fear in him that others
"once we are to renounce our reason, or trust to it only within a"
"certain sphere, all hope for us is lost, as far as withstanding the"
attack of outside enemies is concerned. We are liable to sceptical
"attacks from every side, and all we can maintain against them is a"
"personal conviction which is not proof. How, then, was the difficulty"
met?

"Hamilton), p. 15."
"Kant, as we have said, made an important development upon the position"
of Hume. Hume had arrived at the point of declaring the particular mind
and matter equally incompetent to afford an ultimate explanation of
"things, and he suggested experience in their place. This is the first"
"note of the new philosophy: experience, not a process of the"
"interaction of two separate things, mind on the one hand, matter on the"
"other, but something comprehending both. This, however, was scarcely"
"realised either by Hume or Kant, though the latter came very near the"
"formulation of it. Kant saw, at least, that things could not produce"
"knowledge, and he therefore changed his front and suggested starting"
with the knowledge that was before regarded as result--a change in
point of view that caused a revolution in thought similar to that
caused in our ideas of the natural world by the introduction of the
"system of Copernicus. Still, while following out his Copernican theory,"
Kant did not go far enough. His methods were still somewhat
psychological in nature. He still regarded thought as something which
can be separated from the thinker; he still maintained the existence of
things in themselves independent and outside of thought. He gives us a
"'theory' of knowledge, when what we want to reach is knowledge itself,"
and not a subjective conception of it.
Here it is that the Absolute Idealism comes in--the Idealism most
fish or looking for iguanas and crabs hidden in the holes of the banks.
"“Physically the Chocoes are a fine and healthy race. They are tall, as"
"compared with the Cuna-Cuna, well proportioned, and with a graceful"
bearing. The men have wiry limbs and faces that are at once kind and
"energetic, while as a rule the girls are plump, fat, and full of"
mischief. The grown women preserve their good looks and attractiveness
"much longer than is generally the case in primitive peoples, in which"
their sex bears the heaviest share of every day’s work.
"“Both males and females have unusually fine white teeth, which they"
sometimes dye black by chewing the shoots of one of the numerous wild
peppers growing in the forests. The skin is of a rich olive-brown color
"and, as usual, a little lighter in women and children. Though all go"
"almost naked, they look fairer than the San Blas Cunas, and some of the"
women would compare advantageously in this respect with certain
Mediterranean types of the white race.
"“The hair is left by all to grow to its natural length, except in a few"
"cases, in which the men have it cropped at the neck. It is coarse and"
"not jet black, as reported of most Indians, but with a reddish hue,"
which is better noticed when the sun is playing through the thick mass.
"“In young children it decidedly turns at times to a blond color, the"
only difference from the Caucasian hair being the pronounced coarseness
of the former. As there are no white people living within a radius of
"fifty miles, but only negroes, mulattoes and zambos, this peculiarity"
"cannot be explained by miscegenation, and may therefore be considered as"
a racial feature of the Choco tribe.
"“In men the every-day dress consists of a scanty clout, made of a strip"
of red calico about one foot broad and five feet long. This clout is
"formations of the stratified rocks of the earth's crust, giving to"
"each formation its maximum thickness wherever found, amounts to"
not less than forty miles. Knowing how slowly sediments accumulate
"upon the sea floor, we must believe that the successive cycles"
which the earth has seen stretch back into a past almost
"inconceivably remote, and measure tens of millions and perhaps"
even hundreds of millions of years.
HOW THE FORMATIONS ARE CORRELATED AND THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD MADE
"UP. Arranged in the order of their succession, the formations of"
the earth's crust would constitute a connected record in which the
"geological history of the planet may be read, and therefore known"
as the GEOLOGICAL RECORD. But to arrange the formations in their
natural order is not an easy task. A complete set of the volumes
of the record is to be found in no single region. Their leaves and
chapters are scattered over the land surface of the globe. In one
"area certain chapters may be found, though perhaps with many"
"missing leaves, and with intervening chapters wanting, and these"
absent parts perhaps can be supplied only after long search
through many other regions.
Adjacent strata in any region are arranged according to the LAW OF
"SUPERPOSITION, i.e. any stratum is younger than that on which it"
"was deposited, just as in a pile of paper, any sheet was laid"
later than that on which it rests. Where rocks have been
"disturbed, their original attitude must be determined before the"
law can be applied. Nor can the law of superposition be used in
identifying and comparing the strata of different regions where
the formations cannot be traced continuously from one region to
the other.
The formations of different regions are arranged in their true
I shall not say whence the document emanated. I believe it was composed
"by some one who does not lack a certain knowledge of Japan, but who has"
drawn false deductions from his knowledge of similar matters of other
countries. Here is the best example. The document speaks of the native
contingents of Formosa. Now there exist no such forces in Formosa. The
"garrisons of Formosa are sent there from Japan. On the other hand, in"
the colonies belonging to other countries there are generally troops
formed of native contingents. It is notably so in French colonies. The
"author of the document in question, reasoning from these facts, thought"
that it ought to be the same with Formosa.
Has Japan any fear of another alteration of the Treaty of
Shimonoseki being imposed upon her?
"The combined action of Russia, Germany and France, for imposing on"
Japan an alteration of the Treaty of Shimonoseki appears to us to have
been a great error on their parts. I can positively say that there are
many eminent persons in Germany and in France who regret that action.
"Even in Russia, in certain quarters, a belief seems to be entertained"
"that, but for the fault then committed, the present misfortunes would"
"not have happened. As to ourselves, we are not hypnotised by the errors"
then committed by those three powers. We intend to remain friends of
"France, of Germany, and even of Russia, in spite of the injustice we"
"have suffered, provided, of course, those powers wish to keep"
friendship.
We do not overlook the possibility of another combination which those
"powers may have an idea of forming against us, and it behoves us to be"
"watchful. Nevertheless, to tell you my candid opinion, it is scarcely"
possible that a similar intervention should be renewed. I do not think
France would push her docility so far as to follow Germany a second
"time. It would be necessary that Germany should set the example, aided"
"infant mind with the stories of his bold adventures, the numerous fights"
"in which he had taken part, the death of his companions and his"
hair-breadth escapes. Numerous were the decorations he bore. The most
conspicuous was an ugly mark on his breast left by an arrow and a hole
on the thigh caused by a spear thrust. The trust imposed on this
marauder proved to be not altogether ill placed for once in a river
journey we were pursued by several long boats filled with armed dacoits.
When these boats came too near for us to effect an escape the erstwhile
"dacoit leader, my attendant, stood up and gave a peculiar cry, which was"
evidently understood. For the pursuing boats vanished at the signal.
INDUSTRIAL EFFORTS
"I come now to another period of his life fifty years from now, when he"
foresaw the economic danger that threatened his country. This
Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition was one of the first means he
thought of to avert the threatened danger. Here also he attempted to
bring together other activities. Evening entertainments were given by
"the performances of ""Jatras,"" which have been the expression of our"
national drama and which have constantly enriched our Bengali literature
by the contributions of village bards and composers. There were athletic
tournaments also and display of physical strength and endurance. He also
"established here the people's Bank, which is now in a most flourishing"
"condition. He established industrial and technical schools, and it was"
there that the inventive bend of my mind received its first impetus. I
remember the deep impression made on my mind by the form of worship
rendered by the artisans to Viswakarma God in his aspect as the Great
Artificer: His hand it was that was moulding the whole creation; and it
"seemed that we were the instruments in his hand, through whom he"
intended to fashion some Great Design.
"the blood-stained House. Certain of the nobles, gathered together,"
resolve upon an alliance for the purpose of restoring a strong
"government. The Duke of Albany, however, thinks to snatch power to"
himself from this opportunity. _Scene 2._--Report is made of the
"suppression of the rebellion, but this news is immediately followed by a"
report of Albany's attempted usurpation of the throne. Coalition for his
"defeat is agreed upon, and the play ends with the mournful soliloquy of"
that aged counsellor who first opposed the division of the throne and
"now sees, as the consequence of that fatal act, his country, torn to"
"pieces by civil strife, left an easy prize for an ambitious conqueror."

Out upon the dock an insistent siren blared a crescendo and diminuendo
"blast of sound, and two minutes remained. In every stateroom and in"
every lounge and saloon speakers sounded a warning:
"""For a short time, while we are pulling clear of the gravitational field"
"of the Earth, walking will be somewhat difficult, as everything on board"
will apparently increase in weight by about one-fifth of its present
"amount. Please remain seated, or move about with caution. In about an"
"hour weight will gradually return to normal. We start in one minute."""

counterbalanced the pull of gravity upon the mass of the cruiser.
"Simultaneously there was added from the potentiometer, already set"

I almost smiled with self-contempt when I thought how I had set out the
"previous morning in order to conquer my old world, and how it was now"
receding further and further from me. I looked at the other readers.
"They were mostly old men, engrossed in their studies, just as they had"
been in peace time. I wondered what they thought about the war. I knew
they would not allow it to disturb them much or interfere with their
"studies and their sleep. And after all, why should they care? It was"
only youth that was being slaughtered on the battlefields and not old
age.
The sleepy dullness of the museum became unbearable and I walked out
into the street.
"I spent the evening with a member of the National Liberal Club, an"
"intimate family friend, whose intellectual arrogance was one of the evil"
"memories of my childhood, when many eager impulses and aspirations had"
been turned to bitterness by his lofty depreciation and his
imperturbable assumption of superiority based on maturer years and
experience. Having at different times received material kindnesses at
"his hands, I knew I could not tell him what I really thought, and the"
"prospect of meeting him filled me with uneasiness. Moreover, in his"
presence I felt a kind of pride which I did not usually feel in the
presence of others--a pride that forbade me to express any sentiment or
to reveal my inner mind. And yet my inner mind was clamouring
intolerably for revelation. I realized the advantage he would derive
"from his simple attitude and from his lack of mental integrity, which"
enabled him to ignore any considerations that did not conform to his
"preconceived notions, and I realized the disadvantage of my complex"
"attitude, made up as it was of so many conflicting impulses, at war with"
each other and with the world around me.
"discord is signalled by the rattle of dice, thrown by Yudhisthira, the"

"supreme moment Arjuna had flung down his earthly weapon, Gandiva. It was"
then that the eternal conflict between matter and spirit was decided.
The next panel shows the outward or the material aspect of victory.
Behind a foreground of waving flags is seen the battle field of
Kurukshetra with procession of white-clad mourning women seen by fitful
lights of funeral pyres. In the last panel is seen Yudhisthira
renouncing the fruits of his victory setting out on his last journey. In
"front of him lies the vast and sombre plain and mountain peaks, faintly"
"visible by gleams of unearthly light, unlocalised but playing here and"
there. His wife and his brothers had fallen behind and dropped one by
one. There is to be no human companion in his last journey. The only
thing that stood by him and from which he had never been really
separated is Dharma or the Spirit of Righteousness.
LIFE OF ACTION
Faridpur at that time enjoyed a notoriety of being the stronghold of
"desperate characters, dacoits by land and water. My father had captured"
"single-handed one of the principal leaders, whom he sentenced to a long"
term of imprisonment. After release he came to my father and demanded
"some occupation, since the particular vocation in which he had"
specialised was now rendered impossible. My father took the unusual
"course to employ him as my special attendant to carry me, a child of"
"four, on his back to the distant village school. No nurse could be"
"tenderer than this ex-leader of lawless men, whose profession had been"
to deal out wounds and deaths. He had accepted a life of peace but he
could not altogether wipe out his old memories. He used to fill my
The man in the street looks out for a newspaper which may strengthen
his own party proclivities. He expects to find political questions
"discussed, but so far as religion is concerned he accepts without"
"knowing it the current convention of the pressman, and imbibes a"
semi-sceptical atmosphere without misgiving or suspicion.
"And yet, as Sir Leslie Stephen saw, every theory of duty depends upon"
Belief or Disbelief in the Divinity of Christ. We may talk of duty to
"Society, duty to the Race, duty to Posterity, duty to Civilization;"
but the plain man will recall the question of Sir Boyle Roche: “I do
"not understand, Mr. Speaker, all this talk about our duty to"
Posterity! What has Posterity ever done for us?”
You cannot control conduct by asserting that a man owes a debt to an

the acceptance or definite refusal will determine the course of
civilization during the next twenty years.
"The mere assertion of authority will not suffice, and men are not"
impressed in favour of Catholic doctrine simply by dignified ceremony
and Ritual. We have only to look across the English Channel to be
assured of this. Frenchmen have not been encouraged to study the
evidences of Christianity. Bishops and priests have only advertised
sceptical books by forbidding their perusal to the faithful; and as
"the devout have been instructed to live by faith, but not how to give"
"a reason for the faith which is in them, in the result M. Viviani’s"
The very question sobered him.
Suddenly it was as though he had left the din of the noisy thoroughfare
of life and had entered the majestic silence of a mighty cathedral;
"and from the great mysterious deeps a whisper came to his ears, each"
"syllable roundly phrased, clear, unhesitating, a chapter of this"
strange book of life that he had so lately read--the book that had
fired his blood and aroused his energy. The breath of these pages
"seemed to give him decision and free air, where before he had been"
"drifting aimlessly, going he knew not whither, caring not overmuch."
This book had braced him--it was a call to battle. He had had enough of
beds of roses and daffodils and idyllic trances. The phrasing of _The
Masterfolk_ came to him now:
“Nature has ordered that certain things shall be; and to him who
disobeys her ordering she is cruelly merciless. She has decreed that
"he shall be most dominant, shall breed the fittest race, shall know"
"the fullest life, shall achieve the highest destiny, who abides"
by the woman he loves. And him who is unclean she flings upon the
"dunghill--him and his seed for ever. Of the love of man for woman,"
Nature has spoken with no uncertain voice; and Nature’s judgment is
final. He that fears to love a woman sets himself against the supreme
law of life; he ends in unnatural vice; he is against the design of
life; celibacy Nature will none of--for celibacy stultifies life and
ends the race. Promiscuous love she condemns utterly and punishes
heavily with loathsome disease and with foul decay; the races of
"promiscuous love are become of the scum of the earth, and are dying"
"out. Against the love of many women also, once and for all, she"
has spoken. The peoples of many wives Nature is sweeping into the
waste corners of the world. Nature is her own jury--Nature alone her
own judge. She hath not said the Masterfolk cannot break from her
with other nations with whom they want to live in peace. And they
realise any predominant interest of a foreign country in their trade or
manufacture is sure to lead to misunderstanding and friction. Actuated
by this idea they have practically excluded all foreign manufactured
articles by prohibitive tariffs.
REVIVAL OF INDIAN INDUSTRIES
Is our country slow to realise the danger that threatens her by the
capture of her market and the total destruction of her industries? Does
she not realise that it is helpless passivity that directly provokes
aggression? Has not the recent happenings in China served as an object
"lesson? There is, therefore, no time to be lost and the utmost effort is"
demanded of the Government and the people for the revival of our own
industries. The various attempts that have hitherto been made have not
been as successful as the necessity of the case demands. The efforts of
the Government and of the people have hitherto been spasmodic and often
worked at cross purposes. The Government should have an advisory body
of Indian members. There should be some modification of rules as regards
selection of Industrial scholars. Before being sent out to foreign
countries they should be made to study the conditions of manufacture in
this country and its difficulties. For a particular industry there
"should be a co-ordinated group of three scholars, two for the industrial"
and one for the commercial side. Difficulties would arise in adapting
foreign knowledge to Indian conditions. This can only be overcome by the
"devoted labour of men of originality, who have been trained in our"
future Research Laboratory. The Government could also materially help
(i) by offering facilities for the supply of raw materials (ii) by
offering expert advice (iii) by starting experimental industries. He had
reason to think that the Government is full alive to the crucial
importance of the subject and is determined to take every step
"outside, where an elaborate etiquette had made the rules even for the"
trees to grow in seemliness with a most gentlemanly existence. For him
were no disturbing peerings into human destiny--he raised no rough
"alarms by strenuous aims and vigorous thinking. Pretty, dandified,"
"he--always. Sinning easily enough, but always like a gentleman. Never"
"a crudity. As a perfumed fan fluttered by jewelled slender fingers,"
blowing cool fragrant airs that kiss the painted cheek of some
"frail beauty, he uttered his lines--obscene often, but by the most"
gentlemanly of innuendoes. The unmannerly thing was the only sin. The
display of a profound emotion was the depth of ill-breeding. So sang
"he, tunefully always, guiltless of all rough accent of originality;"
"sang of peacocks and green carnations and blue roses, of butterflies"
"and pools and dragonflies and souls, of ivory and silver, and of"
"dawn and dusk and dew, and white shoulders sweet, beauties who moved"
languidly with rustle of silk--so wafted he to you nothing more vibrant
than whisper of women and scent of perfumed chambers and flowers and
"bowers and rose and amarynth and asphodel and daffodil, of moonlight"
and music and kiss and gavotte and little tiny things--and always in
the most gentlemanly manner. He milked the unicorn. Always a would-be
"suggestion of mysterious deep-hid symbolism that ended where it began,"
and at most only the dark hint of well-bred tragedy.
"He moved impatiently now, as impatiently as he might, complaining that"
the shop-window into which he deigned to cast his reflection was tinted
with amethyst.
"“Come, Greppel,” said he--“let us gaze at ourselves in another"
window--this is an ageing colour.”
Then came the terrible tragedy of a fire at a charity bazaar; a most
patrician function with much upper clergy in it was smitten with sudden
"western door. That stood open,--the bell had long ago ceased,--Mass was"
"over,--and all was profoundly still."
"Out of the warm sunlit air he stepped into the vast, cool,"
"clear-obscure, white glory of the stately shrine,--with bared head and"
"noiseless, reverent feet, he advanced a little way up the nave, and"
"then stood motionless, every artistic perception in him satisfied,"
"soothed, and entranced anew, as in his student-days, by the tranquil"
grandeur of the scene. What majestic silence! What hallowed peace! How
jewel-like the radiance of the sun pouring through the rich stained
"glass on those superb carved pillars, that, like petrified stems of"
"forest-trees, bear lightly up the lofty, vaulted roof to that vast"
height suggestive of a white sky rather than stone!
"Moving on slowly further toward the altar, he was suddenly seized by an"
"overpowering impression,--a memory that rushed upon him with a sort of"
"shock, albeit it was only the memory of a tune!--a wild melody,"
"haunting and passionate, rang in his eras,--the melody that Sarasate,"
"the Orpheus of Spain, had evoked from the heart of his speaking"
"violin,--the sobbing love-lament of the ""Zigeunerweisen""--the weird"
minor-music that had so forcibly suggested--What? THIS VERY
"PLACE!--these snowy columns,--this sculptured sanctity--this flashing"
"light of rose and blue and amber,--this wondrous hush of consecrated"
calm! What next? Dear God! Sweet Christ! what next? The face of
Edris?--Would that heavenly countenance shine suddenly though those
rainbow-colored beams that struck slantwise down toward him?--and
should he presently hear her dulcet voice charming the silence into
deeper ecstasy?
"Overcome by a sensation that was something like fear, he stopped"
"abruptly, and leaning against one of the quaint old oaken benches,"
"strove to control the quick, excited throbbing of his heart,--then"
Her strange behavior at that time had affected him more deeply than he
would have thought possible; and while he had purposely avoided
"thinking much about the banker's sudden change of front, back of his"
"devout thankfulness for the miracle was a vague suspicion, a curious"
feeling that made him uncomfortable in the girl's presence. He could
"not repent his determination to win at any price; yet he shrank, with a"
"moral cowardice which made him inwardly writhe, from owning that Cherry"
had made the sacrifice at which Clyde and the others had hinted. If it
"were indeed true, it placed him in an intolerable position, wherein he"
could express neither his gratitude nor his censure. No doubt she had
"read the signs of his mental confusion, and her own delicate"
sensibility had responded to it.
They remained side by side on the bridge while the day died amidst a
"wondrous panoply of color, each busied with thoughts that might not be"
"spoken, in their hearts emotions oddly at variance. The sky ahead of"
"them was wide-streaked with gold, as if for a symbol, interlaid with"
sooty clouds in silhouette; on either side the mountains rose from
penumbral darkness to clear-cut heights still bright from the slanting
radiance. Here and there along the shadowy shore-line a light was born;
the smell of the salt sea was in the air. Above the rhythmic pulse of
"the steamer rose the voices of men singing between decks, while the"
parting waters at the prow played a soft accompaniment. A steward
"summoned them to supper, but Boyd refused, saying he could not eat, and"
the girl stayed with him while the miles slowly slipped past and the
night encompassed them.
"""Two hours more,"" he told her, as the ship's bell sounded. ""Then I can"
"eat and sleep--and sing."""
Captain Peasley was pacing the bridge when later they breasted the
done for those who left school for ever when they were twelve years
old.
"A generation ago Lord Sherbrooke, on the extension of the franchise,"
told his contemporaries that it was time to begin “to educate our
masters”--but we have not gone very far in our instruction of
"Christian Sociology, though as yet we have not adopted the Utilitarian"
"basis of morals accepted by the French Republic, and endeavoured to"
establish principles of duty towards man without any reference
whatever to a duty towards God.
Can any one be surprised if the plain man be perplexed when he is
called upon to decide questions of economy and morality without any
guiding principle? As a matter of fact he makes no such effort.
"“Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision, for the day of the"
"Lord is near in the valley of decisions,” but the sun and the moon are"
"darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. The puzzled popular"
"vote is but as the swing of the pendulum, first to this side, then to"
"the other. “These fellows have been no good, let us give the others a"
show.”
Yet assuredly there is a principle which is guidance and strength if
only men could discern it. There are Teachers who can tell men of its
"beneficent power, but they are as yet few in number, and their voices"
"are not sufficiently strong. When once these can get a hearing, men"
welcome their evangel and find in it a guide of life.
"I am persuaded that just as Bishop Butler, when he perused the preface"
"of his _Analogy_, had no prescience of the young fellow of Lincoln,"
who was in a few years to give the Christian faith a fresh hold in the
"hearts of the common people, who gladly heard him, so in our time many"
of our Bishops seem unable to perceive the dawn of another “day of the
"And so, besides dethroning the Burmese king, and occupying his golden"
"palace, we are ousting from their pleasant homes the guardian spirits of"
"the trees. They flee before the cold materialism of our belief, before"
the brutality of our manners. The headman did not say this; he did not
"mean to say this, for he is a very courteous man and a great friend of"
"all of us; but that is what it came to, I think."
"The trunk of this tree is more than ten feet through--not a round bole,"
"but like the pillar in a Gothic cathedral, as of many smaller boles"
growing together; and the roots spread out into a pedestal before
entering the ground. The trunk does not go up very far. At perhaps
twenty-five feet above the ground it divides into a myriad of smaller
"trunks, not branches, till it looks more like a forest than a single"
tree; it is full of life still. Though the pigeons and the doves come
"here no longer, there are a thousand other birds flitting to and fro in"
their aerial city and chirping to each other. Two tiny squirrels have
"just run along a branch nearly over my head, in a desperate hurry"
"apparently, their tails cocked over their backs, and a sky blue"
chameleon is standing on the trunk near where it parts. There is always
"a breeze in this great tree; the leaves are always moving, and there is"
a continuous rustle and murmur up there. A mango-tree and tamarind near
by are quite still. Not a breath shakes their leaves; they are as still
"as stone, but the shadow of the fig-tree is chequered with ever-changing"
"lights. Is the Nat really gone? Perhaps not; perhaps he is still there,"
"still caring for his tree, only shy now and distrustful, and therefore"
no more seen.
"Whole woods are enchanted sometimes, and no one dare enter them. Such a"
"wood I know, far away north, near the hills, which is full of Nats."
"There was a great deal of game in it, for animals sought shelter there,"
"and no one dared to disturb them; not the villagers to cut firewood, nor"

"minutes--for, without the acceleration given by this additional power,"
they would lose many precious hours of time in covering merely the
few thousands of miles during which Earth's attraction would operate
powerfully against their progress.
Faster and faster the great cruiser shot upward as more and more of the
"starting power was released, and heavier and heavier the passengers"
felt themselves become. Soon the full calculated power was on and the
"acceleration became constant. Weight no longer increased, but remained"
constant at a value of plus twenty three and six-tenths percent. For a
few moments there had been uneasy stomachs among the passengers--perhaps
a few of the first-trippers had been made ill--but it was not much worse
"than riding in a high-speed elevator, particularly since there was no"
change from positive to negative acceleration such as is experienced in
express elevators.
"The computer, his calculations complete, watched the pilot with"
"interest, for, accustomed as he was to traversing the depths of space,"
there was a never-failing thrill to his scientific mind in the delicacy
and precision of the work which Breckenridge was doing--work which could
be done only by a man who had had long training in the profession and
who was possessed of instantaneous nervous reaction and of the highest
degree of manual dexterity and control. Under his right and left hands
were the double-series potentiometers actuating the variable-speed
shipwrecked crew casting lots for the next occupant of the kettle could
suffer no greater pangs of apprehension than did the Sisters of Saint
Martha on the imminence of an appointment to the orphanage. They had
taken vows of obedience. The Mother Superior's selection was final.
The unfortunate nominee had to pack up her slender belongings and go
"to Willesden. Being a faulty human being (and none but a faulty,"
"unpractical, unsympathetic human being can want, in these days of"
"enlightenment, to shut herself up in a nunnery for the rest of her life,"
with the avowed intention of never doing a hand's turn for any one of
"God's creatures until the day of her death), she invariably regarded"
herself as a holy martyr and ruled the poor little devils of orphans for
"the greater glory of God (magnified entirely, be it understood, by her"
own martyrdom) than for the greater happiness of the poor little devils.
Sister Theophila--in entering into religion the Protestant Sisters
"changed the names by which they were known in the world, according to"
"the time-honoured tradition of an alien church--Sister Theophila, with"
"the temperament of the recluse, had been thrust into this position"
of responsibility against her will. She performed her duties with
scrupulous exactitude and pious resignation. Her ideal of life was the
"ascetic, and to this ideal the twenty orphans had to conform. She did"
not love the orphans.
"Her staff consisted of one matron, a married woman of a much humbler"
class than her own. Possibly she might have loved the orphans had
"she not seen such a succession of them, and her own work been less"
harassing. Twenty female London orphans from disreputable homes are
a tough handful. When you insist on their conformity with the ascetic
"ideal, they become tougher. They will not allow themselves to be loved."
"“And ungrateful!” exclaimed the matron, one day when she was taking"
Risca round the institution. He had expressed to Sister Theophila his
resurrection of Jesus Christ can be set aside as a “cunningly devised
"fable.” No scientific man, who has not deliberately shut himself in an"
hermetically sealed materialism would say to-day that “Miracles” do
not happen. It is a question of evidence.
"And educated men know that there is a science of metaphysics, that"
"there is a science of psychology, that literary criticism is"
"scientific, that the age of a document can be decided, that cumulative"
"evidence cannot be ignored, and that simply to put aside the claims of"
Christianity without examination is absurd.
"But, as Sir Leslie Stephen shows, it is the Christianity of the"
"Catholic creed that matters, and it is this Christianity of which the"
man in the street has need. It gives him a solution of those social
"and ethical problems which he must solve, which he can only neglect at"
"the peril of natural degradation. For example, the position of women"
depends upon our belief or disbelief that Christ was born of the
Virgin Mary. To say that monogamy is the natural evolution of
"humanity, that chastity in the young unmarried man is a product of"
"civilization, that a high conception of a man’s duty to posterity will"
"keep him from harlotry, is simply to show ignorance of history, of"
"human nature, and of the world as it is. A man who talks now-a-days"
about the respect of marriage being a Teutonic contribution to the
"evolution of civilized society, is behind the times. We _know_ that"
"respect for women, and marriage held in honour, are the creations of"
"the Holy Catholic Church, which insists on the Incarnation of the Lord"
Jesus Christ.
But the man in the street does not know these things. The discoveries
"in science, whether physical or psychical, do not reach him. Technical"
treatises are too strong meat for his intellectual digestion. The
pulpit does not appeal to him. At every baptism in the Church of
"less our own, sometimes rest upon a merest chance--dropped in for supper"
at a fashionable place patronized by those who wish to see the brightest
"of Havana life. There were other places, of course, that might have"
"offered quite as much, but this one happened to be on the route we had"
taken.
"Midnight passed, but still we lingered, seated on the latticed balcony"
that encircles an inner court where cabaret features are
"held--suggestive of a bull ring. One rather piquant Spanish girl,"
"playing her accompaniment on a guitar, gazed softly up at Tommy while"
"singing about some wonderful Nirvana, an enchanted island that floated"
"in a sea of love. It was a pretty song, even if more intense than"
"temperate, and pleased with it he tossed her a coin; whereupon she"
"tilted her chin and raised a shoulder, asking in the universal language"
of cabarets if she should not come up and drink a health with the
"_imperioso Señor_. But he, whose heart was beating against a twenty-page"
"letter from a nymph in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, laughed a"
"negative, this time throwing her a flower that she kissed lightly and"
put in her hair.
"We had supped well, the mandolins were now tinkling, incessantly, and"
"this, mingled with the silvery tones of glasses touched in eager"
"pledges, created an ensemble of sounds dear to the heart of every true"
Bohemian. Effects were good here. The ceilings and walls of our balcony
were lighted by vari-colored electric bulbs artfully placed amidst
"growing vines that drooped in festoons above the tables, producing a"
"fairy-like enchantment. And, indeed, the café proved to be a mart not"
"only of enchantments but entertainments, including a popular gambling"
salon.
"At last, in desperation seeing that Monsieur refused to be cheered,"
"Tommy sprang up, saying:"
"probably falls into the fallacy, common even among those who follow"
"the sea, that a partial or entire clearance of her ""crowd"" will quite"
"alter her nature; whereas sailors being sailors--that is, people of"
certain fairly definite attributes--any given environment makes them
much the same as those who preceded them.
But entire changes in the _personnel_ of a vessel rarely take place.
"The officers change, but the crew remains: the crew goes, but"
officers stay.  Or more frequently some few men are favourites of one
"or two of the officers, and they mingle with the new crew like yeast,"
till the ancient fermentation is visible once more.
Ships (to speak thus of their companies) talk of the same subjects
over a million miles of changing seas: they have a permanent stock of
subjects.  These include all which are perennially of interest to
"seafaring men, such as homes _versus_ boarding-houses, but they"
"include also something more individual, something more intimately"
connected with the essence of that particular vessel.  And the one
unending topic of interest on board the _Potluck_ was foreign
politics.
"How this came about no one knew, though many theories were set afloat"
and sunk again every Sunday afternoon.  Some said that the first
"captain of the _Potluck_ was called Palmerstone, and that he"
introduced the subject of England _versus_ the world as soon as he
came on board.  Others swore that they had been told by a clerk in
the employ of the firm that there had been a discussion over her very
keel concerning the introduction into her frame of foreign oaks.
"""This was the way of it,"" said Jack Hart, who was the chief upholder"
"of this particular theory, and the son of a little shipbuilder--""the"
lot that built her at Liverpool was the mixedest crowd of forsaken
linen paper were held so high that the expense of an extra leaf was
considered an unnecessary luxury. In these books that which took the
"place of the title was at the end, the colophon being in evidence,"
"indicating the name of the illuminator, if not always that of the"
"printer. As was the case with the manuscript book, the volume began"
"with the phrase, ""Here beginneth...."" Later came piratical reprints,"
which resulted in making the critical reader insist upon having each
"volume stamped with the printer's name or mark, as a guarantee of"
reliable workmanship.
The first definite step in the direction of the title-page is marked
"by bibliographers in a little volume printed by Arnold Ther Hoernen,"
"of Cologne, in 1470. It consisted of an introduction at the head of"
"a page, the major part of which was left blank. Whether the printer"
"forgot to place the usual introduction at the head of the first page,"
"and took this way to remedy his error, is not known."
"In general, different faces of type should never be combined upon the"
"title-page, the variations being secured by using smaller sizes of the"
"same face, or harmonizing fonts. Capitals and lower-case letters can be"
successfully combined on the title-page only as a result of care and
"thought, the best title-pages usually being all in lower-case or all in"
caps and small caps. A two-color title-page is rarely a success unless
"it was originally composed with two colors in mind, instead of being"
set up in black and arbitrarily split up for colors.
"The decoration should never overbalance the type, and this applies"
as well to the question of borders on decorated books. No matter how
"beautiful, if the decoration overbalances the type, the volume or the"
title-page ceases to be an example of typography and becomes something
answerable only to itself.
sanguinary purification imparted by the taurobolium was more efficacious
than baptism. The food that was taken during the mystic feasts was likened
to the bread and wine of the communion; the Mother of the Gods was
"undoubtedly placed above the Mother of God, whose son also had risen again."
"A Christian author, writing at Rome about the year 375, furnishes some"
"remarkable information on this subject. As we have seen, a mournful"
"ceremony was celebrated on March 24th, the _dies sanguinis_ in the course"
of which the _galli_ shed their blood and sometimes mutilated themselves in
"commemoration of the wound that had caused Attis's death, ascribing an"
expiatory and atoning power to the blood thus shed. The pagans {71} claimed
that the church had copied their most sacred rites by placing her Holy Week
at the vernal equinox in commemoration of the sacrifice of the cross on
"which the divine Lamb, according to the church, had redeemed the human"
"race. Indignant at these blasphemous pretensions, St. Augustine tells of"
having known a priest of Cybele who kept saying: _Et ipse Pileatus
"christianus est_--""and even the god with the Phrygian cap [i. e., Attis] is"
"a Christian.""[42]"
But all efforts to maintain a barbarian religion stricken with moral
decadence were in vain. On the very spot on which the last taurobolia took
"place at the end of the fourth century, in the _Phrygianum_, stands to-day"
the basilica of the Vatican.
*       *       *       *       *
There is no Oriental religion whose progressive evolution we could follow
"at Rome so closely as the cult of Cybele and Attis, none that shows so"
plainly one of the reasons that caused their common decay and
"disappearance. They all dated back to a remote period of barbarism, and"
from that savage past they inherited a number of myths the odium of which
"could be masked but not eradicated by philosophical symbolism, and"
practices whose fundamental coarseness had survived from a period of rude
"inevitable negative. So much time spent by day in questioning managers,"
"agents, schools and choruses; by night among the audiences of theatres"
from all-star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find
what he most hoped for. He who had loved her best had tried to find
"her. He was sure that since her disappearance from home this great,"
"water-girt city held her somewhere, but it was like a monstrous"
"quicksand, shifting its particles constantly, with no foundation, its"
upper granules of to-day buried to-morrow in ooze and slime.
The furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of
"pseudo-hospitality, a hectic, haggard, perfunctory welcome like the"
specious smile of a demirep. The sophistical comfort came in reflected
"gleams from the decayed furniture, the ragged brocade upholstery of a"
"couch and two chairs, a foot-wide cheap pier glass between the two"
"windows, from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a"
corner.
"The guest reclined, inert, upon a chair, while the room, confused in"
"speech as though it were an apartment in Babel, tried to discourse to"
him of its divers tenantry.
"A polychromatic rug like some brilliant-flowered rectangular, tropical"
islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting. Upon the
gay-papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from
"house to house—The Huguenot Lovers, The First Quarrel, The Wedding"
"Breakfast, Psyche at the Fountain. The mantel’s chastely severe outline"
was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew
like the sashes of the Amazonian ballet. Upon it was some desolate
flotsam cast aside by the room’s marooned when a lucky sail had borne
"them to a fresh port—a trifling vase or two, pictures of actresses, a"
"medicine bottle, some stray cards out of a deck."
though he himself were the captain. The captain asked what sort of
"nonsense this might be, and whether he had ever heard of a cabin-boy's"
being entrusted with the command of a ship. But the boy answered that
was all one to him; if they did not care to buy the three cords of
"birch-wood, and obey him, as though he were captain, for the space of a"
single day--the captain and crew should know which day it was to be in
"advance--then he would set foot on the ship no more, and far less would"
he ever dirty his hands with pitch and tar on her again. The whole thing
"seemed strange to the captain, yet he finally gave in, because he wanted"
"to have the boy along with him and, no doubt, he also thought that"
he would come to his senses again when they were once under way. The
"quartermaster was of the same opinion. ""Just let him command all he"
"likes, and if things go wrong with him, we'll help him out,"" said he. So"
"the birch-wood was bought, full-measure and without haggling, and they"
set sail.
"When the day came on which the cabin-boy was to take command, the"
"weather was fair and quiet; but he drummed up the whole ship's crew, and"
"with the exception of a tiny bit of canvas, had all sails reefed. The"
"captain and crew laughed at him, and said: ""That shows the sort of a"
captain we have now. Don't you want us to reef that last bit of sail
"this very minute?"" ""Not yet,"" answered the cabin-boy, ""but before long."""
"Suddenly a squall struck them, struck them so heavily that they thought"
"they would capsize, and had they not reefed the sails they would"
undoubtedly have foundered when the first breaker roared down upon the
ship.
"The boy ordered them to throw the first cord of birch-wood overboard,"
"billet by billet, one at a time and never two, and he did not let them"
"touch the other two cords. Now they obeyed him to the letter, and did"
not laugh; but cast out the birch-wood billet by billet. When the last
infer from the vast thicknesses of its rocks and the
unconformities which part them. We know that during its long
"periods land masses again and again rose from the sea, were worn"
"low, and were submerged and covered with the waste of other lands."
But the formations of separated regions cannot be correlated
"because of the absence of fossils, and nothing more can be made"
"out than the detached chapters of local histories, such as the"
outline given of the district about Lake Superior.
The pre-Cambrian rocks show no evidence of any forces then at work
upon the earth except the forces which are at work upon it now.
The most ancient sediments known are so like the sediments now
being laid that we may infer that they were formed under
conditions essentially similar to those of the present time. There
is no proof that the sands of the pre-Cambrian sandstones were
swept by any more powerful waves and currents than are offshore
"sands to-day, or that the muds of the pre-Cambrian shales settled"
to the sea floor in less quiet water than such muds settle in at
"present. The pre-Cambrian lands were, no doubt, worn by wind and"
"weather, beaten by rain, and furrowed by streams as now, and, as"
"now, they fronted the ocean with beaches on which waves dashed and"
along which tidal currents ran.
Perhaps the chief difference between the pre-Cambrian and the
present was the absence of life upon the land. So far as we have
"any knowledge, no forests covered the mountain sides, no verdure"
"carpeted the plains, and no animals lived on the ground or in the"
air. It is permitted to think of the most ancient lands as deserts
of barren rock and rock waste swept by rains and trenched by
powerful streams. We may therefore suppose that the processes of
their destruction went on more rapidly than at present.
"camp. At Brienne he had been dubbed ""the Spartan,"" an instance of that"
almost uncanny faculty of schoolboys to dash off in a nickname the
"salient features of character. The phrase was correct, almost for"
"Napoleon's whole life. At any rate, the pomp of Paris served but to"
root his youthful affections more tenaciously in the rocks of Corsica.
"In September, 1785, that is, at the age of sixteen, Buonaparte was"
nominated for a commission as junior lieutenant in La Fère regiment of
artillery quartered at Valence on the Rhone. This was his first close
contact with real life. The rules of the service required him to
spend three months of rigorous drill before he was admitted to his
"commission. The work was exacting: the pay was small, viz., 1,120"
"francs, or less than £45, a year; but all reports agree as to his keen"
zest for his profession and the recognition of his transcendent
abilities by his superior officers.[8] There it was that he mastered
"the rudiments of war, for lack of which many generals of noble birth"
have quickly closed in disaster careers that began with promise:
"there, too, he learnt that hardest and best of all lessons, prompt"
"obedience. ""To learn obeying is the fundamental art of governing,"""
says Carlyle. It was so with Napoleon: at Valence he served his
apprenticeship in the art of conquering and the art of governing.
This spring-time of his life is of interest and importance in many
"ways: it reveals many amiable qualities, which had hitherto been"
blighted by the real or fancied scorn of the wealthy cadets. At
"Valence, while shrinking from his brother officers, he sought society"
more congenial to his simple tastes and restrained demeanour. In a few
"of the best bourgeois families of Valence he found happiness. There,"
"too, blossomed the tenderest, purest idyll of his life. At the country"
"house of a cultured lady who had befriended him in his solitude, he"
"saw his first love, Caroline de Colombier. It was a passing fancy;"
but to her all the passion of his southern nature welled forth. She

"any friendly state,--"

"shall be punishable by fine and imprisonment, or either of such"

"offender is convicted; and imprisonment, if awarded, may be either"
with or without hard labour.

PREFACE:
BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.
AN ingenuous reviewer once described some verses of mine as
"“unwholesome,” because, he said, they had “a faint smell of Patchouli"
"about them.” I am a little sorry he chose Patchouli, for that is not a"
particularly favourite scent with me. If he had only chosen Peau
"d’Espagne, which has a subtle meaning, or Lily of the Valley, with"
"which I have associations! But Patchouli will serve. Let me ask, then,"
"in republishing, with additions, a collection of little pieces, many of"
"which have been objected to, at one time or another, as being somewhat"
"deliberately frivolous, why art should not, if it please, concern"
"itself with the artificially charming, which, I suppose, is what my"
"critic means by Patchouli? All art, surely, is a form of artifice, and"
"thus, to the truly devout mind, condemned already, if not as actively"
"noxious, at all events as needless. That is a point of view which I"
"quite understand, and its conclusion I hold to be absolutely logical. I"
"have the utmost respect for the people who refuse to read a novel, to"
"go to the theatre, or to learn dancing. That is to have convictions and"
to live up to them. I understand also the point of view from which a
work of art is tolerated in so far as it is actually militant on behalf
of a religious or a moral idea. But what I fail to understand are those
"delicate, invisible degrees by which a distinction is drawn between"
"this form of art and that; the hesitations, and compromises, and"
"timorous advances, and shocked retreats, of the Puritan conscience once"
"emancipated, and yet afraid of liberty. However you may try to convince"
"yourself to the contrary, a work of art can be judged only from two"
standpoints: the standpoint from which its art is measured entirely by
"its morality, and the standpoint from which its morality is measured"
entirely by its art.
to say: it is a question of the stage of development.
"Experience has taught me that for the group of normal children, almost"
"irrespective of age, the first kind of story suitable will contain an"
appeal to conditions to which they are accustomed. The reason of this
"is obvious: the child, having limited experience, can only be reached"
"by this experience, until his imagination is awakened and he is enabled"
to grasp through this faculty what he has not actually passed through.
Before this awakening has taken place he enters the realm of fiction
(represented in the story) by comparison with his personal experience.
Every story and every point in the story mean more as that experience
"widens, and the interest varies, of course, with temperament, quickness"
"of perception, power of visualising and of concentration."
"In “The Marsh King's Daughter,” H. C. Andersen says:"
“The Storks have a great many stories which they tell their little
"ones, all about the bogs and marshes. They suit them to their age and"
"capacity. The young ones are quite satisfied with Kribble, Krabble,"
"or some such nonsense, and find it charming; but the elder ones want"
something with more meaning.”
One of the most interesting experiments to be made in connection with
this subject is to tell the same story at intervals of a year or six
months to some individual child.[25] The different incidents in the
"story which appeal to it (and you must watch it closely, to be sure the"
"interest is real, and not artificially stimulated by any suggestion on"
your part) will mark its mental development and the gradual awakening
"of its imagination. This experiment is a very delicate one, and will"
"not be infallible, because children are secretive and the appreciation"
"is often (unconsciously) simulated, or concealed through shyness or"
"want of articulation. But it is, in spite of this, a deeply interesting"
There was a very definite purpose in this somewhat rustically cunning
"and half ironical letter. Luther wanted, if possible, to make Erasmus"
"show his colours, to win him, the powerful authority, touchstone of"
"science and culture, for the cause which he advocated. In his heart"
Luther had long been aware of the deep gulf separating him from Erasmus.
"As early as March 1517, six months before his public appearance, he"
wrote about Erasmus to John Lang: 'human matters weigh heavier with him
"than divine,' an opinion that so many have pronounced about"
"Erasmus--obvious, and yet unfair."
"The attempt, on the part of Luther, to effect a _rapprochement_ was a"
reason for Erasmus to retire at once. Now began that extremely ambiguous
policy of Erasmus to preserve peace by his authority as a light of the
world and to steer a middle course without committing himself. In that
attitude the great and the petty side of his personality are
inextricably intertwined. The error because of which most historians
have seen Erasmus's attitude towards the Reformation either in far too
unfavourable a light or--as for instance the German historian
"Kalkoff--much too heroic and far-seeing, is that they erroneously regard"
him as psychologically homogeneous. Just that he is not. His
double-sidedness roots in the depths of his being. Many of his
utterances during the struggle proceed directly from his fear and lack
"of character, also from his inveterate dislike of siding with a person"
or a cause; but behind that is always his deep and fervent conviction
that neither of the conflicting opinions can completely express the
"truth, that human hatred and purblindness infatuate men's minds. And"
with that conviction is allied the noble illusion that it might yet be
"possible to preserve the peace by moderation, insight, and kindliness."
In April 1519 Erasmus addressed himself by letter to the elector
"Frederick of Saxony, Luther's patron. He begins by alluding to his"
"For some time his tin-machines had been busy, night and day, turning"
"out great heaps of gleaming cans, while the carpenters and machinists"
"completed their tasks. The gill-netters were overhauling their gear,"
the beach was lined with fishing-boats. On the dock great piles of
"seines and drift-nets were being inspected. Three miles below, Big"
"George, with a picked crew and a pile-driver, was building the"
"fish-trap. It consisted of half-mile ""leads,"" or rows of piling, capped"
"with stringers, upon which netting was hung, and terminated in"
"""hearts,"" ""corrals,"" and ""spillers,"" the intricate arrangements of"
webbing and timbers out of which the fish were to be taken.
It was for the title to the ground where his present operations were
going forward that George had been so cruelly disciplined by the
"""interests;"" and while he had held stubbornly to his rights for years"
"in spite of the bitterest persecution, he was now for the first time"
able to utilize his site. Accordingly his exultation was tremendous.
"As for Boyd, the fever in his veins mounted daily as he saw his dream"
assuming concrete form. The many problems arising as the work advanced
afforded him unceasing activity; the unforeseen obstacles which were
"encountered hourly required swift and certain judgment, taxing his"
"ingenuity to the utmost. He became so filled with it all, so steeped"
"with the spirit of his surroundings, that he had thought for nothing"
"else. Every dawn marked the beginning of a new battle, every twilight"
"heralded another council. His duties swamped him; he was worried,"
"exultant, happy. Always he found Cherry at his shoulder, unobtrusive"
"and silent for the most part, yet intensely observant and keenly alive"
"to every action. She seemed to have the faculty of divination, knowing"
"when to be silent and when to join her mood with his, and she gave him"
valuable help; for she possessed a practical mind and a masculine
"aptitude for details that surprised both him and George. But, rapidly"
But there is a sequel on the morrow. Soon after dark on Easter-eve
the same weary yet excited faces may be seen gathered in the church.
"But there is a change too; there is a feeling abroad of anxiety, of"
"expectancy. Hours must yet pass ere midnight, and not till then is"
"there hope of the announcement, ‘Christ is risen!’ The suspense seems"
long. To-night there is restlessness rather than silence. Some go to
and fro between the church and their homes; others join discordantly
in the chants and misplace the responses; anything to cheat the long
hours of waiting. Midnight draws near; from hand to hand are passed
"the tapers and candles which shall light the joyful procession, if"
only the longed-for announcement be made. What is happening there now
behind those curtains which veil the chancel from the expectant throng?
"Midnight strikes. The curtains are drawn back. Yes, there is the"
"bier, borne but yesternight to the grave. It is empty. That is only"
"the shroud upon it. The words of the priest ring out true, ‘Christ is"
"risen!’ And there behind the chancel, see, a second veil is drawn back."
"There in the sanctuary, on the altar-steps, bright with a blaze of"
"light stands erect the figure of the Christ who, so short and yet so"
"long a while ago, was borne lifeless to the tomb. A miracle, a miracle!"
Quickly from the priest’s lighted candle the flame is passed. In a
moment the dim building is illumined by a lighted taper in every hand.
"A procession forms, a joyful procession now. Everywhere are light and"
"glad voices and the embraces of friends, crying aloud the news ‘Christ"
is risen’ and answering ‘He is risen indeed.’ In every home the lamb is
"prepared with haste, the wine flows freely; in the streets is the flash"
"of torches, the din of fire-arms, and all the exuberance of simple"
joy. The fast is over; the dead has been restored to life before men’s
eyes; well may they rejoice even to ecstasy. For have they not felt the
"ecstasy of sorrow? This was no tableau on which they looked, no drama"
"in which they played a part. It was all true, all real. The figure on"
the bier was indeed the dead Christ; the figure on the altar-steps was
indeed the risen Christ. In these simple folk religion has transcended
"expect an appreciation of fine humour from a normal child, that is,"
from an elemental mind. It seems as if the rough-and-tumble element
were almost a necessary stage through which children must pass--a
"stage, moreover, which is normal and healthy; but up to now we have"
"quite unnecessarily extended the period of elephantine fun, and though"
we cannot control the manner in which children are catered for along
"this line in their homes, we can restrict the folly of appealing too"
strongly or too long to this elemental faculty in our schools. Of
"course, the temptation is strong, because the appeal is so easy. But"
there is a tacit recognition that horse-play and practical jokes are
no longer considered an essential part of a child's education. We note
"this in the changed attitude in the schools, taken by more advanced"
"educationists, towards bullying, fagging, hazing, etc. As a reaction,"
"then, from more obvious fun, there should be a certain number of"
"stories which make appeal to a more subtle element, and in the chapter"
"on the questions put to me by teachers on various occasions, I speak"
more in detail about the educational value of a finer humour in our
stories.
At some period there ought to be presented in our stories the
"superstitions connected with the primitive history of the race, dealing"
"with the Fairy (proper), giants, dwarfs, gnomes, nixies, brownies"
and other elemental beings. Andrew Lang says: “Without our savage
ancestors we should have had no poetry. Conceive the human race born
"into the world in its present advanced condition, weighing, analysing,"
examining everything. Such a race would have been destitute of poetry
and flattened by common sense. Barbarians did the _dreaming_ of the
world.”
But it is a question of much debate among educationists what should
be the period of the child's life in which these stories are to be
presented. I myself was formerly of opinion that they belonged to
uproar.
Emerson and his companions found themselves carried away before the
"onslaught like chips in the surf, then sucked into a maelstrom where"
the first duty was self-preservation. Behind locked doors and shivering
"glass a terrified office-clerk, receiver to ear, was calling madly for"
"Police Headquarters, while in the main building itself the crowd"
bellowed and roared and the hollow floor reverberated to the thunder of
trampling feet and the crash of tumbling freight-piles.
Boyd succeeded in keeping his footing and eventually fought his way to
"a backing of crated machinery, where he stooped and ripped a cleat"
"loose; then, laying about him with this weapon, he cleared a space. It"
"was already difficult to distinguish friend from foe, but he saw Alton"
Clyde go down a short distance away and made a rush to rescue him. His
"pine slat splintered against a head, he dodged a missile, then struck"
"with the fragment in his hand, and, snatching Clyde by the arm, dragged"
"him out from under foot. Battered and bruised, the two won back to"
"Emerson's first position, and watched the tide surge past."
At the first alarm the fishermen had armed themselves with bale-hooks
"and bludgeons, and for a time worked havoc among their assailants; but"
as the fight became more general they were forced apart and drawn into
"the crowd, whereupon the combatants split up into groups, milling about"
like frightened cattle. Men broke out from these struggling clusters to
"nurse their injuries or beat a retreat, only to be overrun and"
swallowed up again in a new commotion.
"Emerson saw the big, barefooted fisherman in the red underclothes,"
"armed with a sledge-hammer, go through the ranks of his enemies like a"
"tornado, only to be struck by some missile hurled from a distance. With"
a shout of rage the fellow turned and flung his own weapon at his
when convicted of error.
Erasmus perhaps never quite realized how much his philological-critical
method must shake the foundations of the Church. He was surprised at his
adversaries 'who could not but believe that all their authority would
"perish at once when the sacred books might be read in a purified form,"
and when people tried to understand them in the original'. He did not
feel what the unassailable authority of a sacred book meant. He rejoices
"because Holy Scripture is approached so much more closely, because all"
sorts of shadings are brought to light by considering not only what is
"said but also by whom, for whom, at what time, on what occasion, what"
"precedes and what follows, in short, by the method of historical"
philological criticism. To him it seemed so especially pious when
reading Scripture and coming across a place which seemed contrary to the
"doctrine of Christ or the divinity of his nature, to believe rather that"
one did not understand the phrase _or that the text might be corrupt_.
Unperceived he passed from emendation of the different versions to the
correction of the contents. The epistles were not all written by the
apostles to whom they are attributed. The apostles themselves made
"mistakes, at times."
The foundation of his spiritual life was no longer a unity to Erasmus.
"It was, on the one hand, a strong desire for an upright, simple, pure"
"and homely belief, the earnest wish to be a good Christian. But it was"
"also the irresistible intellectual and aesthetic need of the good taste,"
"the harmony, the clear and exact expression of the Ancients, the dislike"
of what was cumbrous and involved. Erasmus thought that good learning
might render good service for the necessary purification of the faith
and its forms. The measure of church hymns should be corrected. That
"Christian expression and classicism were incompatible, he never"
believed. The man who in the sphere of sacred studies asked every author
for his credentials remained unconscious of the fact that he
find depicted on a modern tombstone the worm that dieth not and the
"fire that is not quenched. No; the water-pitcher was not a symbol, it"
was an instrument; for my part I have little faith in the existence
of any symbols in popular religion which are not in origin at least
instruments; and the purpose to which this instrument was put was to
supply the dead person with that wedding-bath which he had not taken
"in life, and without which he would vainly strive in the under-world"
to prepare himself for divine wedlock. The water-pitcher was not
"commemorative, but preventive, of future punishment. Its erection was"
"not a warning to the living, but a service to the dead."
"Thus then the evidence for the intimate association of the mysteries,"
"or of the main idea which runs through them, with human weddings is"
"complete and, I hope, convincing; and the custom of the water-pitcher,"
"which concludes it, fitly introduces at the same time the evidence"
for the association of the same idea with funerals. This is equally
"plentiful. The vague conception of death as a wedding, which as I have"
"shown was elaborated in the mysteries, has of course already been"
exemplified in all those passages of ancient literature and modern
"folk-songs which I have adduced, and I have found in it also the motive"
for the assimilation of funeral-customs to the customs of marriage.
"But the evidence that the actual doctrines of the mysteries, in which"
"more definite expression was given to that vague idea, were closely"
associated with death and funeral-custom is to be found rather in
epitaphs and sepulchral monuments.
The tone of the epitaphs may be sufficiently illustrated by a single
couplet:
Οὐκ ἐπιδὼν νύμφεια λέχη κατέβην τὸν ἄφυκτον
Γόργιππος ξανθῆς Φερσεφόνης θάλαμον[1501].
"‘I, Gorgippus, lived not to look upon a bridal bed ere I went down"
connected with that event. The _Chaldaei_ were Oriental fortune-tellers who
asserted that their predictions were based on the Chaldean astrology. They
"found credulous clients among the farm laborers, and Cato gravely exhorts"
the good landlord to oust them from his estate.[3]
"Beginning with the second century before Christ, merchants began to import"
Syrian slaves. At that time Delos was the great trade center in this human
"commodity, and in that island especially Atargatis was worshiped by"
citizens of Athens and Rome.[4] Trade spread her worship in the
Occident.[5] We know that the great slave revolution that devastated Sicily
"in 134 B. C. was started by a slave from Apamea, a votary of the Syrian"
"goddess. Simulating divine madness, he called his companions to arms,"
"pretending to act in accordance with orders from heaven.[6] This detail,"
"which we know by chance, shows how considerable a proportion of Semites"
"there was in the gangs working the fields, and how much authority Atargatis"
enjoyed in the rural centers. Being too poor to build temples for their
"national goddess, those agricultural laborers {106} waited with their"
devotions until a band of itinerant _galli_ passed through the distant
hamlet where the lot of the auction had sent them. The existence of those
"wandering priests depended, therefore, on the number of fellow-countrymen"
"they met in the rural districts, who supported them by sacrificing a part"
of their poor savings.
Towards the end of the republic those diviners appear to have enjoyed
rather serious consideration at Rome. It was a pythoness from Syria that
advised Marius on the sacrifices he was to perform.[7]
Under the empire the importation of slaves increased. Depopulated Italy
"needed more and more foreign hands, and Syria furnished a large quota of"
"the forced immigration of cultivators. But those Syrians, quick and"
"intelligent as they were strong and industrious, performed many other"
functions. They filled the countless domestic positions in the palaces of
"At last out of khaki, and dressed in conventional evening clothes, I"
felt as if I were indeed writing the first words of another story on the
"unmarred page of the incoming year. As I entered the library my mother,"
"forgetting that it was I who owed her deference, came forward with"
outstretched arms and a sound in her voice like that of doves at nesting
"time. Dad's welcome was heartier, even though his eyes were dimmed with"
"happy tears. And old Bilkins, our solemn, irreproachable butler, grinned"
benignly as he stood waiting to announce dinner. What a wealth of
affection I had to be grateful for!
"I did not lack gratitude, but with the old year touching the heels of"
"the new, and Time commanding me to get in step, my return to civil life"
"held few inducements. Instead of a superabundance of cheer, I had"
brought from France jumpy nerves and a body lean with over
training--natural results of physical exhaustion coupled with the mental
reaction that must inevitably follow a year and a half of highly
imaginative living.
"But there was another aspect less tangible, perhaps more permanent--and"
all members of combat divisions will understand exactly what I mean.
"When America picked up the gauntlet, an active conscience jerked me from"
a tuneful life and drove me out to war--for whether men are driven by
"conscience, or a government draft board, makes no difference in the"
"effect upon those who come through. Time after time, for eighteen"
"months, I made my regular trips into hell--into a hell more revolting"
"than mid-Victorian evangelists ever pictured to spellbound, quaking"
sinners. Never in this world had there been a parallel to the naked
dangers and nauseous discomforts of that western front; never so
"prolonged an agony of head-splitting noises, lacerations of human flesh,"
"smells that turned the body sick, blasphemies that made the soul grow"
"Virtue.... Youth is full of presumption and arrogance, though nothing"
"in the world is so frail: it fears nothing, and vainly relies on its"
"own strength, believing everything with the utmost levity and without"
any precaution.”
"And on another occasion, when Calypso hospitably provides clothes for"
"the shipwrecked men, and Telemachus is handling a tunic of the finest"
"wool and white as snow, with a vest of purple embroidered with gold,"
"and displaying much pleasure in the magnificence of the clothes, Mentor"
"addresses him in a severe voice, saying: “Are these, O Telemachus, the"
thoughts that ought to occupy the heart of the son of Ulysses? A young
"man who loves to dress vainly, as a woman does, is unworthy of wisdom"
or glory.”
"I remember, as a schoolgirl of thirteen, having to commit to memory"
"several books of these adventures, so as to become familiar with the"
"style. Far from being impressed by the wisdom of Mentor, I was simply"
"bored, and wondered why Telemachus did not escape from him. The only"
part in the book that really interested me was Calypso's unrequited
"love for Telemachus, but this was always the point where we ceased to"
"learn by heart, which surprised me greatly, for it was here that the"
real human interest seemed to begin.
Of all the effects which I hope for from the telling of stories in the
"schools, personally I place first the dramatic joy we bring to the"
children and to ourselves. But there are many who would consider this
"result as fantastic, if not frivolous, and not to be classed among the"
educational values concocted with the introduction of stories into the
school curriculum. I therefore propose to speak of other effects of
story-telling which may seem of more practical value.
"The first, which is of a purely negative character, is that through"
of white rose leaves thrown down constantly through two holes in the
"ceiling, ""like a leafy mist between the priests and the worshippers."""
[Sidenote: A Splendid Church.]
The worshippers of the Virgin have not been lacking in their efforts to
"erect a suitably sumptuous building on the site of this ""miracle."" The"
"magnificent nave, with its avenue of forty-two columns of Greek marble,"
surmounted by a frieze of mosaic pictures; the glorious pavement of
"_opus Alexandrinum_, whose ""crimson and violet hues temper the white"
"and gold of the walls""; the grand _baldacchino_, with its four porphyry"
columns wreathed with gilt leaves; and the splendid tomb chamber of
"Pius IX. (predecessor of the late Pope Leo XIII.), with its riot of"
"rich marbles and alabaster, in front of the high altar--to say nothing"
of the almost incredibly costly chapels opening into the nave--combine
to give S. Maria Maggiore a proud place among the very finest of the
fine basilicas of Rome.
[Sidenote: A Dazzling Scene.]
"But not all the splendors of the building, nor all the fascination of"
"its ""miracles"" and legends, nor all the spell of its other relics, can"
"equal the interest attaching to the ""SANTA CULLA,"" the holy cradle. On"
"the afternoon of Christmas Day, we walked through the wet streets to"
"the front of the church, pushed back the heavy, dirty screen of padded"
"canvas, such as hangs at the door of every great church in Italy,"
"however fine, and, stepping within, found ourselves in the midst of"
a scene of the most dazzling splendor. The building was brilliantly
"illuminated with hundreds of electric lights and huge candles, which"
were sharply reflected by the glistening marbles on every hand; the
"air was heavy with clouds of incense, through the blue smoke of which"
"the lofty ceiling looked higher than ever, and the organ and choir"
and its monuments rival those of Cybele in number and variety. In the Latin
"Occident, however, no trace of it can be found, because it had been"
"absorbed by the worship of _Magna Mater_. In Asia itself, Attis and Mèn"
"were sometimes considered identical, and this involved the Roman world in a"
"complete confusion of those two persons, who in reality were very"
different. A marble statue discovered at Ostia represents Attis holding the
"lunar crescent, which was the characteristic emblem of Mèn. His"
"assimilation to the ""tyrant"" of the infernal regions transformed the"
"shepherd of Ida into a master of the underworld, an office that he combined"
with his former one as author of resurrection.
A second title that was given to him reveals another influence. A certain
Roman inscription is dedicated to Attis the Supreme ([Greek: Attei
hupsistôi]).[27] This epithet is very significant. In Asia Minor
"""Hypsistos"" was the appellation used to designate the god of Israel.[28] A"
"number of pagan thiasi had arisen who, though not exactly submitting to the"
"practice of the synagogue, yet worshiped none but the Most High, the"
"Supreme God, the Eternal God, God the Creator, to whom every mortal owed"
service. These must have been the attributes ascribed to Cybele's companion
"by the author of the inscription, because the verse continues: ([Greek: kai"
"sunechonti to pan]) ""To thee, who containest and maintainest all"
"things.""[29] Must we then believe that Hebraic monotheism had some"
influence upon the mysteries of the Great Mother? This is not at all
improbable. We know that numerous Jewish colonies were established in
"Phrygia by the Seleucides, and that {63} these expatriated Jews agreed to"
certain compromises in order to conciliate their hereditary faith with that
of the pagans in whose midst they lived. It is also possible that the
clergy of Pessinus suffered the ascendancy of the Biblical theology. Under
"the empire Attis and Cybele became the ""almighty gods"" (_omnipotentes_)"
"_par excellence_, and it is easy to see in this new conception a leaning"
"upon Semitic or Christian doctrines, more probably upon Semitic ones.[30]"
ideas is concerned. He does not hold that all sensation is a percept
"involving extension and much else--involving, indeed, existence."
"Following upon Reid, Dugald Stewart obtained a very considerable"
"reputation, and he was living and writing at the time Ferrier was a"
"young man. His main idea would, however, seem to have been to guard his"
"utterances carefully, and enter upon no keen discussions or"
"contentions: when a bold assertion is made, it is always under shelter"
of some good authority. But his rounded phrases gained him considerable
"admiration, as such writing often does. He carried--perhaps"
inadvertently--Reid's views farther than he would probably have held as
"justifiable. He says we are not, properly speaking, conscious of self"
"or the existence of self, but merely of a sensation or some other"
"quality, which, by a _subsequent suggestion_ of the understanding,"
leads to a belief in that which exercises the quality. This is the
"doctrine of Reid put very crudely, and in a manner calculated to bring"
us back to unrelated sensation in earnest. Stewart adopted a new
"expression for Reid's 'common-sense,' _i.e._ the 'fundamental laws of"
"belief,' which might be less ambiguous, but never took popular hold as"
did the first.
There were many others belonging to this school besides Reid and
"Stewart, whom it would be impossible to speak of here. The Scottish"
"Philosophy had its work to do, and no doubt understood that work--the"
first essential in a criticism: it endeavoured to vindicate perception
"as against sensational idealism, and it only partially succeeded in its"
task. But we must be careful not to forget that it opened up the way
for a more comprehensive and satisfactory point of view. It was with
Kant that the distinction arose between sensation and the forms
"necessary to its perception, the form of space and time, and so on. As"
"to this part of the theory of knowledge, Reid and his school were not"
clear; they only made an effort to express the fact that something was
"touches of emotion or passion, many small yet significant details which"
"nothing but actual observation can reveal, and which throw much light"
"upon the real, inner relation of the native to his institution. So I"
was busy going over my old entries and checking them and putting my
material into shape in a detailed and concrete manner.
"On the third day, as I was sitting and taking notes in the afternoon,"
word ran all round the villages that the Dobuan canoes had been
"sighted. And indeed, as I hastened towards the shore, there could be"
"seen, far away, like small petals floating on the horizon, the sails"
"of the advancing fleet. I jumped at once into a canoe, and was punted"
"along towards the promontory of Kaykuyawa, about a mile to the South of"
"Sinaketa. There, one after the other, the Dobuan canoes were arriving,"
"dropping their sails and undoing the mast as they moored, until the"
"whole fleet, numbering now over eighty canoes, were assembled before"
"me (see Plate XLVIII). From each a few men waded ashore, returning"
with big bunches of leaves. I saw them wash and smear themselves and
"perform the successive stages of native, festive adornment (see Plate"
XLIX). Each article was medicated by some man or another in the canoe
before it was used or put on. The most carefully handled articles
"of ornamentation were the ineffective looking, dried up herbs, taken"
"out of their little receptacles, where they had remained since they"
"had been becharmed in Dobu, and now stuck into the armlets. The whole"
"thing went on quickly, almost feverishly, making more the impression"
"of a piece of technical business being expeditiously performed, than"
of a solemn and elaborate ceremony taking place. But the ceremonial
element was soon to show itself.
"After the preparations were finished, the whole fleet formed itself"
"into a compact body, not quite regular, but with a certain order, about"
"four or five canoes being in a row, and one row behind the other. In"
"this formation they punted along over the Lagoon, too shallow for"
different parts of this country in the success of his work. This was the
fourth occasion on which he had been deputed to the West by the
"Government of India on a scientific mission, and the success that has"
attended his visit to foreign countries has exceeded all his
"expectations. In Vienna, in Paris, in Oxford, Cambridge and London, in"
"Harvard, Washington, Chicago and Columbia, in Tokio and in many other"
places his work has uniformly been received with high appreciation. In
spite of the fact that his researches called into question some of the
"existing theories, his results have notwithstanding received the fullest"
acceptance. This was due to a great extent to the convincing character
of the demonstration afforded by the very delicate instruments he had
been able to invent and which worked under extremely difficult tests
with extraordinary perfection. Even the most critical savants in Vienna
felt themselves constrained to make a most generous admission. In these
"new investigations on the border land between physics and physiology,"
"they held that Europe has been left behind by India, to which country"
they would now have to come for inspiration. It has also been fully
recognised that science will derive benefit when the synthetic
intellectual methods of the East co-operate with the severe analytical
methods of the West. These opinions have also been fully endorsed in
other centres of learning and Dr. Bose had received applications from
distinguished Universities in Europe and America for admission of
foreign post graduate scholars to be trained in his Laboratory in the
new scientific methods that have been initiated in India.
RESEARCH LABORATORY FOR INDIA
This recognition that the advance of human knowledge will be incomplete
"without India's special contributions, must be a source of great"
inspiration for future workers in India. His countrymen had the keen
imagination which could extort truth out of a mass of disconnected facts
to the chamber of bright-haired Persephone which none may escape.’
"There is naturally here a note of lament, as befits any epitaph, and"
more especially that of one who dies young and unmarried; but none
"the less there is an anticipation--justified, we may think, if we"
"will, by some ceremony of bridal ablution performed for the dead man"
by his friends--that his death is a wedding with the goddess of the
"under-world; and indeed the phrase Φερσεφόνης θάλαμος, ‘the bridal"
"chamber of Persephone,’ recurs with some frequency in this class of"
epitaphs[1502].
"Considered collectively, such epitaphs would suggest a distinctly"
"offensive conception of Persephone; but in each taken separately, as"
"it was composed, it will be allowed, I think, that if there is supreme"
"audacity, there is equal sublimity. It is just these qualities which"
"give pungency to a blasphemous parody of such epitaphs, in which the"
wit of Ausonius exposes the worst possible aspect of a religious
conception which to the pure-minded was wholly pure. My apology for
quoting lines which I will not translate must be the fact that a
caricature is often no less instructive than a true portrait. The mock
epitaph concludes as follows:
Sed neque functorum socius miscebere vulgo
Nec metues Stygios flebilis umbra lacus:
"Verum aut Persephonae Cinyreius ibis Adonis,"
Aut Jovis Elysii tu catamitus eris[1503].
Ausonius in jest bears an unpleasant resemblance to Clement in earnest;
both perverted to their uttermost a doctrine which commanded nothing
but reverence from faithful participants in the mysteries.
Akin to these epitaphs are certain tablets which recently have been
"fully discussed by Miss Jane Harrison[1504], and have been shown to"
"elaborate, but one would think rather painful, since they include the"
breaking of a front tooth in sign that they are ready for marriage. They
marry young and mothers at twelve years are not uncommon.
Once a year the Guaymies have a great tribal feast--“balceria” the
Spaniards call it. Word is sent to all outlying huts and villages by a
"mystic symbol of knotted rags, which is also tied to the branches of the"
trees along the more frequented trails. On the appointed day several
hundred will gather on the banks of some river in which a general bath
"is taken, with much frolicking and horseplay. Then the women employ"
"several hours in painting the men with red and blue colors, following"
"the figures still to be seen on the old pottery, after which the men"
garb themselves uncouthly in bark or in pelts like children “dressing
up” for a frolic. At night is a curious ceremonial dance and game called
"balsa, in which the Indians strike each other with heavy sticks, and are"
knocked down amid the pile of broken boughs. The music--if it could be
"so called--the incantations of the wisemen, the frenzy of the dancers,"
"all combine to produce a sort of self-hypnotism, during which the"
Indians feel no pain from injuries which a day later often prove to be
very serious.
[Illustration: PANAMANIAN FATHER AND CHILD]
"There are a multitude of distinct Indian tribes on the Isthmus, each"
"with its own tribal government, its distinctive customs and its allotted"
"territory, though boundaries are, of course, exceedingly vague and the"
territories overlap. The Smithsonian pamphlet enumerates 21 such tribes
in the Darien region alone. But there seems to be among them no such
condition of continual tribal warfare as existed between our North
American Indians as long as they survived in any considerable numbers
the aggressions of the white settlers. It is true that the historian of
Balboa’s expedition records that the great leader was besought by
"Hadad, in a considerable part of Syria besides. The Greeks considered her"
"as the principal Syrian goddess ([Greek: Suria thea]), and in the Latin"
"countries she was commonly known as _dea Syria_, a name corrupted into"
_Iasura_ by popular use.
We all remember the unedifying descriptions of her itinerant priests that
"Lucian and Apuleius[1] have left. Led by an old eunuch of dubious habits, a"
crowd of painted young men marched along the highways with an ass that bore
an elaborately adorned image of the goddess. Whenever they passed through a
"village or by some rich villa, they went through their sacred exercises. To"
the shrill accompaniment of their Syrian flutes they turned round and
"round, and with their heads thrown back fluttered about and gave vent to"
hoarse clamors until vertigo seized them and insensibility was complete.
"Then they flagellated themselves wildly, struck themselves with swords and"
shed their blood in front of a rustic crowd which pressed closely about
"them, and finally they took up a profitable collection from the wondering"
"spectators. They received jars of milk and wine, cheeses, flour, bronze"
"coins of small denominations and even some silver pieces, all of which"
disappeared in the folds of their capacious robes. If opportunity presented
they knew how to increase their profits by means of clever thefts or by
making commonplace predictions for a moderate consideration.
"This picturesque description, based on a novel by {105} Lucius of Patras,"
is undoubtedly extreme. It is difficult to believe that the sacerdotal
corps of the goddess of Hierapolis should have consisted only of charlatans
and thieves. But how can the presence in the Occident of that begging and
low nomadic clergy be explained?
It is certain that the first worshipers of the Syrian goddess in the Latin
world were slaves. During the wars against Antiochus the Great a number of
"prisoners were sent to Italy to be sold at public auction, as was the"
"custom, and the first appearance in Italy of the _Chaldaei_[2] has been"
potentialities of his race for evolving modes of expression demanded by
the period of transition in which he was placed. They found expression
"in great constructive work, in the restoration of quiet amidst disorder,"
"in the earliest effort to spread education both among men and women, in"
"questions of social welfare, in industrial efforts, in the establishment"
of people's Bank and in the foundation of industrial and technical
schools. And behind all these efforts lay a burning love for his country
and its nobler traditions.
MATTERS EDUCATIONAL
In educational matters he had very definite ideas which is now becoming
more fully appreciated. English schools were at that time not only
regarded as the only efficient medium for instruction. While my father's
subordinates sent their children to the English schools intended for
"gentle folks, I was sent to the vernacular school where my comrades were"
"hardy sons of toilers and of others who, it is now the fashion to"
"regard, were belonging to the depressed classes. From these who tilled"
the ground and made the land blossom with green verdure and ripening
"corn, and the sons of the fisher folk, who told stories of the strange"
creatures that frequented the unknown depths of mighty rivers and
"stagnant pools, I first derived the lesson of that which constitutes"
true manhood. From them too I drew my love of nature. When I came home
accompanied by my comrades I found my mother waiting for us. She was an
"orthodox Hindu, yet the ""untouchableness"" of some of my school fellows"
did not produce any misgivings in her. She welcomed and fed all these as
her own children; for it is only true of the mother heart to go out and
enfold in her protecting care all those who needed succour and a
mother's affection. I now realise the object of my being sent at the
"most plastic period of my life to the vernacular school, where I was to"
"learn my own language, to think my own thoughts and to receive the"
lines before us we shall be better able to appreciate the later
playwright's genius. But we shall also be reminded that the credit of
introducing blank verse must lie with the older man.
"The chief question of all remains to be asked. Does _Gorboduc_, with all"
"its borrowed devices, _and because of them_, rise to a higher level of"
tragedy than _Cambyses_ and _Appius and Virginia_? To answer this
"question we must examine the effect of those devices, and understand"
what is precisely meant by the term tragedy. Let it be first understood
that the arrangement of acts and scenes is comparatively unimportant in
"this connexion, though most helpful in giving clearness to the action."
Marlowe's _Doctor Faustus_ (in the earlier edition) dispenses with it;
so does Milton's _Samson Agonistes_; and we have just seen that the
great Greek dramatists knew nothing of it. What is important is the
"exclusion of that comic element which, in some form or another, had"
hitherto found a place in almost every English play; the removal of all
action from the stage--for the Dumb Shows stand apart from the play--;
and the substitution of stately speeches for natural conversation and
"dialogue. Of all three the purpose is the same, namely, to impress the"
audience with a sense of greater dignity and awe than would be imparted
by a more familiar style. The long speeches give importance to the
"decisions, and compel a belief that momentous events are about to"
happen or have happened. In harmony with this effect is the absence of
all comic relief--although Shakespeare was to prove later that this has
"a useful place in tragedy. A smile, a jest would be sacrilege in the"
prevailing gloom. Two effects alone are aimed at; an impression of
"loftiness in the theme, and a profound melancholy. Not warm gushing"
"tears. Those are the outcome of a personal sorrow, small and ignoble"
"beside an abstract grief at 'the falls of princes', 'the tumbling down"
"of crowns', 'the ruin of proud realms'. What does the reader or"
spectator know of Ferrex that he should mingle his cries with Videna's
"lamentations? The account of Porrex appealing, with childlike faith in"
"his voice created divinities,[55] as originally the almighty voice of Thoth"
had created the world.[56]
The ritual that conferred such superhuman power[57] developed in Egypt into
"a state of perfection, completeness and splendor unknown in the Occident."
"It possessed a unity, a precision and a permanency that stood in striking"
"contrast to the variety of the myths, the uncertainty of the dogmas and the"
arbitrariness of the interpretations. The sacred books of the Greco-Roman
period are a faithful reproduction of the texts that were engraved upon the
"walls of the pyramids at the dawn of history, notwithstanding the centuries"
that had passed. Even under the Cæsars the ancient ceremonies dating back
"to the first ages of Egypt, were scrupulously performed because the"
smallest word and the least gesture had their importance.
This ritual and the attitude toward it found their way for the most part
into the Latin temples of Isis and Serapis. This fact has long been
"ignored, but there can be no doubt about it. A first proof is that the"
clergy of those temples were organized just like those of Egypt during the
period of the Ptolemies.[58] There was a hierarchy presided over by a high
"priest, which consisted of _prophetes_ skilled in the sacred science,"
"_stolistes_, or _ornatrices_,[59] whose office it was to dress the statues"
"of the gods, _pastophori_ who carried the sacred temple plates in the"
"processions, and so on, just as in Egypt. As in their native country, the"
"priests were distinguished from common mortals by a tonsure, by a linen"
"tunic, and by their habits as well as by their garb. They devoted"
themselves entirely to their ministry and had no other profession. This
"{95} sacerdotal body always remained Egyptian in character, if not in"
"nationality, because the liturgy it had to perform remained so. In a"
"similar manner the priests of the Baals were Syrians,[60] because they were"
the only ones that knew how to honor the gods of Syria.
In the first place a daily service had to be held just as in the Nile
restored and public meetings to oppose the Government were rigorously
"suppressed, trade and manufactures were arising: Scotland was not"
"really dead, as she appeared. A new life was dawning: reform was in the"
"air, and in due time made its presence felt. But the memory of these"
"times of political oppression, when the franchise was the privilege of"
"the few, and of the few who were entirely out of sympathy with the most"
"part of their countrymen or their country's wants, remained with the"
people just as did the 'Killing-time' of Covenanting days two centuries
"before. Time heals the wounds of a country as of an individual, but the"
"operation is slow, and it is doubtful whether either period of history"
"will ever be forgotten. At anyrate, if they are so as this century"
"closes, they were not in the Scotland known to Ferrier; they were still"
a very present memory and one whose influence was keenly felt.
And along with this political struggle yet another struggle was taking
"place, no less real though not so evident. The religion of the country"
had been as dead as was the politics in the century that was gone--dead
"in the sleep of Moderatism and indifferentism. But it, too, had"
"awakened; the evangelical school arose, liberty of church government"
"was claimed, a liberty which, when denied it, rent the Established"
Church in twain.
In our country it has been characteristic that great movements have
"usually begun with those most in touch with its inmost life, the"
so-called lower orders of its citizens. The nobles and the kings have
rather followed than taken the lead. In the awakening of the present
"century this at anyrate was the case. 'Society,' so called, remained"
conservative in its view for long after the people had determined to
"advance. Scott, it must be remembered, was a retrogressive influence."
The romanticism of his novels lent a charm to days gone by which might
or might not be deserved; but they also encouraged their readers to
"imagine a revival of those days of chivalry as a possibility even now,"
rather a more serious matter with them than among some of the other
"Indians, the Chocoes for example. They wear as a rule blouses and two"
"skirts, where other denizens of the Darien dispense with clothing above"
the waist altogether. Their hair is usually kept short. The nose ring is
"looked upon as indispensable, and other ornaments of both gold and"
silver are worn by both sexes. Americans who have had much to do with
the Indians of the Darien always comment on the extreme reticence shown
"by them in speaking of their golden ornaments, or the spot whence they"
were obtained. It is as though vague traditions had kept alive the story
of the pestilence of fire and sword which ravaged their land when the
Spaniards swept over it in search of the yellow metal. Gold is in the
"Darien in plenty. Everybody knows that, and the one or two mines near"
the rivers now being worked afford sufficient proof that the region is
"auriferous. But no Indian will tell of the existence of these mines, nor"
will any guide a white man to the spot where it is rumored gold is to be
found. Seemingly ineradicably fixed in the inner consciousness of the
Indian is the conviction that the white man’s lust for the yellow metal
is the greatest menace that confronts the well-being of himself and his
people.
The San Blas are decidedly a town-dwelling tribe. They seem to hate
"solitude and even today, in their comparatively reduced state, build"
villages of a size that make understandable Balboa’s records of the size
"and state of the chief with whom he first fought, and then made friends."
"At Narganá are two large islands, fairly covered with spacious houses"
about 150 feet long by 50 broad. The ridge pole of the palm-thatched
roof is 30 to 40 feet from the ground. A long corridor runs through the
"house longitudinally, and on either side the space is divided by upright"
"posts into square compartments, each of which is supposed to house an"
entire family. The side walls are made of wattled reeds caked with clay.
"One of these houses holds from sixteen to twenty families, and the"
edifices are packed so closely together as to leave scarce room between
deaths that take place. Everywhere hurried action and unreasoning
instinct give place to deliberation and debate. Between this play and
its predecessors no change can be more sweeping or more abrupt. In an
"instant, as it were, we pass from the unpolished _Cambyses_, savage and"
"reeking with blood, to the equally violent events of _Gorboduc_, cold"
"beneath a formal restraint which, regulating their setting in the"
"general framework, robs them of more than half their force. Had this"
severe discipline of the emotions been accepted as for ever binding upon
the tragic stage Elizabethan drama would have been forgotten. The truth
is that the germ of dissension was sown in _Gorboduc_ itself. Conscious
"that the banishment of action from the stage, while natural enough in"
"Greece, must meet with an overwhelming resistance from the popular"
"custom in England, the authors, Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton,"
invented a compromise. Before each act they provided a symbolical Dumb
"Show which, by its external position, infringed no classical law, yet"
satisfied the demand of an English audience for real deeds and
"melodramatic spectacles. It was an ingenious idea, the effect of which"
was to keep intact the close link between stage and action until the
native genius should be strong enough to cast aside its swaddling
clothes and follow its own bent without hurt. As illustrating this
innovation--the reader will not have forgotten that both Dumb Show and
Chorus are to be found in _Pericles_--we may quote the directions for
the Dumb Show before the second act.
"First, the music of cornets began to play, during which came in"
upon the stage a king accompanied with a number of his nobility and
gentlemen. And after he had placed himself in a chair of estate
"prepared for him, there came and kneeled before him a grave and"
"aged gentleman, and offered up unto him a cup of wine in a glass,"
which the king refused. After him comes a brave and lusty young
"gentleman, and presents the king with a cup of gold filled with"
"poison, which the king accepted, and drinking the same, immediately"
tablet links up the popular conception of death as a wedding with the
Platonic conception of the deification of the soul. ‘I was admitted to
"the embrace of Despoina, Queen of the underworld’: ‘Happy and Blessed"
"One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal.’"
"But if Plato, even in his conception of a purely spiritual life"
"hereafter, owed something to the popular religion, he drew upon it"
far more freely in his conception of Love. In the _Symposium_ one
speech after another culminates in the assertion of that belief which
"found its highest expression in the mysteries. ‘So then I say,’ says"
"Phaedrus, ‘that Love is the most venerable of the gods, the most"
"worthy of honour, the most powerful to grant virtue and blessedness"
unto mankind both in life and after death[1528].’ And in the same tone
too Eryximachus: ‘He it is that wields the mightiest power and is
the source for us of all blessedness and of our power to have loving
fellowship both with one another and with the gods that are stronger
"than we[1529].’ And finally Aristophanes: It is Love, ‘who in this"
"present life gives us most joys by drawing like unto like, and for our"
"hereafter displays hopes most high, if we for our part display piety"
"towards the gods, that he will restore us to our erstwhile nature and"
will heal us and will make us happy and blessed[1530].’
This is not Platonic philosophy but popular religion. Phrase after
phrase reveals the origin of this conception of Love. The hopes most
high were the hopes held forth by the mysteries; the blessedness and
the loving fellowship with gods were the fulfilment of those hopes.
In such language did men ever hint at the joys to which their mystic
sacraments gave access. And Plato here ventures yet further. The author
"of those high hopes, the founder of that blessedness, he proclaims, is"
none other than Love--Love that appealed not to the soul only of the
"initiated, but to the whole man, both soul and body--Love that meant"
not only the yearning after wisdom and holiness and spiritual equality
the public ceremonies there was a secret worship to which one was admitted
only after a gradual initiation. The hero of Apuleius had to submit to the
ordeal three times in order to obtain the whole revelation. In Egypt the
{99} clergy communicated certain rites and interpretations only upon a
promise not to reveal them. In fact this was the case in the worship of
Isis at Abydos and elsewhere.[78] When the Ptolemies regulated the Greek
"ritual of their new religion, it assumed the form of the mysteries spread"
over the Hellenic world and became very like those of Eleusis. The hand of
the Eumolpid Timotheus is noticeable in this connection.[79]
But while the ceremonial of the initiations and even the production of the
"liturgic drama were thus adapted to the religious habits of the Greeks, the"
doctrinal contents of the Alexandrian mysteries remained purely Egyptian.
The old belief that immortality could be secured by means of an
identification of the deceased with Osiris or Serapis never died out.
Perhaps in no other people did the epigram of Fustel de Coulanges find so
"complete a verification as in the Egyptians: ""Death was the first mystery;"
"it started man on the road to the other mysteries.""[80] Nowhere else was"
life so completely dominated by preoccupation with life after death;
nowhere else was such minute and complicated care taken to secure and
"perpetuate another existence for the deceased. The funeral literature, of"
"which we have found a very great number of documents, had acquired a"
"development equaled by no other, and the architecture of no other nation"
can exhibit tombs comparable with the pyramids or the rock-built sepulchers
of Thebes.
This constant endeavor to secure an after-existence for one's self and
"relatives manifested itself in various ways, but it finally assumed a"
"concrete form in the worship of Osiris. The fate of Osiris, the god who"
"died and returned to life, became the prototype of the {100} fate of every"
"human being that observed the funeral rites. ""As truly as Osiris lives,"""
"been maintained that Attis was not worshiped together with his companion,"
"the Great Mother, during the times of the republic, but this is undoubtedly"
"wrong, because the two persons of this divine couple must have been as"
inseparable in the ritual as they were in the myths.[10]
"But the Phrygian religion kept alive in spite of police surveillance, in"
spite of precautions and prejudices; a breach had been made in the cracked
"wall of the old Roman principles, through which the entire Orient finally"
gained ingress.
"Directly after the fall of the republic a second divinity from Asia Minor,"
"closely related to the Great Mother, became established in the capital."
During the wars against Mithridates the Roman soldiers learned to revere
"Mâ, the great goddess of the two Comanas, who was worshiped by a whole"
people of hierodules in the ravines of the Taurus and along the banks of
the {54} Iris. Like Cybele she was an ancient Anatolian divinity and
"personified fertile nature. Her worship, however, had not felt the"
"influence of Thrace, but rather that of the Semites and the Persians,[11]"
like the entire religion of Cappadocia. It is certain that she was
"identical with the Anâhita of the Mazdeans, who was of much the same"
nature.
The rites of her cult were even more sanguinary and savage than those of
"Pessinus, and she had assumed or preserved a warlike character that gave"
"her a resemblance to the Italian Bellona. The dictator Sulla, to whom this"
"invincible goddess of combats had appeared in a dream, was prompted by his"
superstition to introduce her worship into Rome. The terrible ceremonies
"connected with it produced a deep impression. Clad in black robes, her"
"""fanatics,"" as they were called, would turn round and round to the sound of"
"drums and trumpets, with their long, loose hair streaming, and when vertigo"
"seized them and a state of anesthesia was attained, they would strike their"
arms and bodies great blows with swords and axes. The view of the running
"instinctive desire to acknowledge and honor, by his noblest design and"
"work, the unseen but felt majesty of the Creator. He had a great"
"longing to enter it now, and ascended the steps with that intention;"
"but, much to his vexation, the doors were shut. He walked from the side"
to the principal entrance; that superb western frontage which is so
cruelly blocked in by a dwarfish street of the commonest shops and
"meanest houses,--and found that also closed against him. Disappointed"
"and sorry, he went back again to the side of the colossal structure,"
"and stood on the top of the steps, close to the central barred doors,"
"studying the sculptured saints in the niches, and feeling a sudden,"
"singular impression of extreme LONELINESS,--a sense of being shut out,"
"as it were, from some high festival in which he would gladly have taken"
part.
"Not a cloud was in the sky, ... the evening was one of the most"
"absolute calm, and a delicious warmth pervaded the air,--the warmth of"
"a fully declared and balmy spring. The Platz was almost deserted,--only"
"a few persons crossed it now and then, like flitting shadows,--and"
"somewhere down in one of the opposite streets a long way off, there was"
"a sound of men's voices singing a part-song. Presently, however, this"
"distant music ceased, and a deep silence followed. Alwyn still remained"
"in the sombre shade of the cathedral archway, arguing with himself"
"against the foolish and unaccountable depression that had seized him,"
and watching the brilliant May moon soar up higher and higher in the
"heavens; when,--all at once, the throbbing murmur of the great organ"
inside the Dom startled him from pensive dreaminess into swift
"attention. He listened,--the rich, round notes thundered through the"
"stillness with forceful and majestic harmony; anon, wierd tones, like"
"the passionate lament of Sarasate's ""Zigeunerweisen"" floated around and"
"above him: then, a silvery chorus of young voices broke forth in solemn"
unison:
no one who did not know intimately their purpose and disposition could
"venture to tamper with them, for great numbers are always in use. If"
"any one cut the lighting wires, for instance, the defects would be"
obvious at once; so with the heating or telephone wires. Nothing was
"touched except the lines to the guns, of which there are eight"
disposed upon the deck. From the guns connections run to the switch
"room, the conning tower, the gunnery control platform aloft, and to"
the gunnery officer's bridge. It was the main cable between the switch
"room and the conning tower which was cut, and it was one cable laid"
alongside a dozen others. Now who could know that this was the gun
"cable, and the only one in which damage might escape detection while"
"the ship was in harbour? At sea there is constant gun drill, during"
"which the electrical controls and the firing-tubes are always tested,"
but in harbour the guns are lying idle most of the time. It was
"evidently the intention of the enemy, who cut these wires, that the"
"_Antinous_ should go to sea before the defect was discovered, and that"
her fire control should be out of action till the wiring system could
be repaired. That very serious disaster was prevented by the
"preliminary testing during the night before sailing, but the enemy has"
been successful in delaying the departure of an invaluable light
"cruiser for two days. In these days, when the war of observation is"
"more important even than the war of fighting, the services of light"
cruisers cannot be dispensed with for an hour without grave
inconvenience and risk. Yet here was one delayed for forty-eight hours
after her ordinary repairs had been completed. The naval authorities
are in a frightful stew. For what has happened to the _Antinous_ may
"happen to other cruisers, even to battleships. If there is sabotage"
"among the workmen in the shipyards, it must be discovered and stamped"
out without a moment's delay. This time it is the cutting of a wire
cable; at another time it may be some wilful injury far more serious.
A warship is a mass of delicate machinery to which a highly skilled
enemy agent might do almost infinite damage. Dawson has been run off
"esteemed matrons to the Palatine, where, hailed by the cheers of the"
"multitude and surrounded by fumes of incense, it was solemnly installed"
"(Nones of April, 204). This triumphal entry was later glorified by"
"marvelous legends, and the poets told of edifying miracles that had"
occurred during Cybele's voyage. In the same year Scipio transferred the
"seat of war to Africa, and Hannibal, compelled to meet him there, was"
beaten at Zama. The prediction of the Sybils had come true and Rome was rid
of the long Punic terror. The foreign goddess was honored in recognition of
the service she had rendered. A temple was erected to her on the summit of
"the Palatine, and every year a celebration enhanced by scenic plays, the"
"_ludi Megalenses_, commemorated the date of dedication of the sanctuary and"
the arrival of the goddess (April 4th-10th).
What was this Asiatic religion that had suddenly been transferred into the
heart of Rome by an extraordinary circumstance? Even then it could look
back upon a long period of development. It combined beliefs of various
"origin. It contained primitive usages of the religion of Anatolia, some of"
which have survived to this day in spite of Christianity and Islam. Like
"the Kizil-Bash peasants of to-day, the ancient inhabitants of the peninsula"
"met on the summits of mountains covered with woods no ax had desecrated,"
and {48} celebrated their festal days.[1] They believed that Cybele resided
"on the high summits of Ida and Berecyntus, and the perennial pines, in"
"conjunction with the prolific and early maturing almond tree, were the"
"sacred trees of Attis. Besides trees, the country people worshiped stones,"
rocks or meteors that had fallen from the sky like the one taken from
Pessinus to Pergamum and thence to Rome. They also venerated certain
"animals, especially the most powerful of them all, the lion, who may at one"
time have been the totem of savage tribes.[2] In mythology as well as in
art the lion remained the riding or driving animal of the Great Mother.
Their conception of the divinity was indistinct and impersonal. A goddess
"of the earth, called Mâ or Cybele, was revered as the fecund mother of all"
"things, the ""mistress of the wild beasts""[3] that inhabit the woods. A god"
"years; we can read its sacred texts, mythical narratives, hymns, rituals,"
"and the Book of the Dead in the original, and we can ascertain its various"
ideas as to the nature of the divine powers and of future life. A great
number of monuments have preserved for our inspection the pictures of
"divinities and representations of liturgic scenes, while numerous"
inscriptions and papyri enlighten us in regard to the sacerdotal
organization of the principal temples. It would seem that the enormous
quantity of documents of all kinds that have been deciphered in the course
of nearly an entire century should have dispelled every uncertainty about
"the creed of ancient Egypt, and should have furnished exact information"
with regard to the sources and original character of the worship which the
Greeks and the Romans borrowed from the subjects of the Ptolemies.
"And yet, this is not the case. While of the four great Oriental religions"
"which were transplanted into the Occident, the religion of Isis and Serapis"
is the one whose relation to the ancient belief of the mother country we
"can establish with greatest accuracy, we {74} know very little of its first"
"form and of its nature before the imperial period, when it was held in high"
esteem.
"One fact, however, appears to be certain. The Egyptian worship that spread"
over the Greco-Roman world came from the Serapeum founded at Alexandria by
"Ptolemy Soter, somewhat in the manner of Judaism that emanated from the"
temple of Jerusalem. But the earliest history of that famous sanctuary is
"surrounded by such a thick growth of pious legends, that the most sagacious"
"investigators have lost their way in it. Was Serapis of native origin, or"
"was he imported from Sinope or Seleucia, or even from Babylon? Each of"
these opinions has found supporters very recently. Is his name derived from
"that of the Egyptian god Osiris-Apis, or from that of the Chaldean deity"
Sar-Apsi? _Grammatici certant_.[1]
"Whichever solution we may adopt, one fact remains, namely, that Serapis and"
"fast light cruiser, came in about a fortnight ago to have some defects"
"made good in her high-speed geared-turbines. There was not much wrong,"
but her engineer commander recommended a renewal of some of the spur
"wheels. The officers and crew went on short leave in rotation, a care"
"and maintenance party was put in charge, and the builders placed a"
"working gang on board which was occupied in shifts, by night and by"
"day, in making good the defects. When a ship is under repair in a"
"river basin, it is practically impossible to keep up the beautiful"
order and discipline of a ship at sea. Men of all kinds are constantly
"coming and going, life on board is stripped of the most ordinary"
"comforts and conveniences, there is inevitably some falling off in"
"strict supervision. Lack of space, lack of facilities for moving about"
"the ship, lack of any regular routine. You will understand. Just as"
the expansion in the New Army and the New Navy has made it possible
"for unknown enemy agents to take service in the Army and the Navy, so"
the dilution of labour in the shipyards has made it possible for
workmen--whose sympathies are with the enemy--to get employment about
"the warships. The danger is fully recognised, and that is where"
Dawson's widespread system of counter-espionage comes in. There is not
"a trade union, among all the eighteen or twenty engaged in shipyard"
"work--riveters, fitters, platers, joiners, and all the rest of"
them--in which he has not police officers enrolled as skilled
"tradesmen, members of the unions, working as ordinary hands or as"
"foremen, sometimes even in office as ""shop stewards"" representing the"
interest of the unions and acting as their spokesmen in disputes with
the employers. Dawson claims that there has never yet been a secret
"Strike Committee, since the war began, upon which at least one of his"
own men was not serving. He is a wonderful man. I don't like him; he
is too unscrupulous and merciless for my simple tastes; but his value
"to the country is beyond payment."""
"""But where in the world does he raise these men? One can't turn a"
"In the first place, this cult was said to exercise a corrupting influence"
"perversive of piety. Its morals were loose, and the mystery surrounding it"
"excited the worst suspicions. Moreover, it appealed violently to the"
emotions and senses. All these factors offended the grave decency that a
Roman was wont to {82} maintain in the presence of the gods. The innovators
had every defender of the _mos maiorum_ for an adversary.
"In the second place, this religion had been founded, supported and"
propagated by the Ptolemies; it came from a country that was almost hostile
to Italy during the last period of the republic;[26] it issued from
"Alexandria, whose superiority Rome felt and feared. Its secret societies,"
"made up chiefly of people of the lower classes, might easily become clubs"
of agitators and haunts of spies. All these motives for suspicion and
hatred were undoubtedly more potent in exciting persecution than the purely
"theological reasons, and persecution was stopped or renewed according to"
the vicissitudes of general politics.
"As we have stated, the chapels consecrated to Isis were demolished in the"
"year 48 B. C. After Cæsar's death, the triumvirs decided in 43 B. C. to"
"erect a temple in her honor out of the public funds, undoubtedly to gain"
the favor of the masses. This action would have implied official
"recognition, but the project appears never to have been executed. If Antony"
"had succeeded at Actium, Isis and Serapis would have entered Rome in"
"triumph, but they were vanquished with Cleopatra; and when Augustus had"
"become the master of the empire, he professed a deep aversion for the gods"
"of his former enemies. Moreover, he could not have suffered the intrusion"
"of the Egyptian clergy into the Roman sacerdotal class, whose guardian,"
restorer and chief he was. In 28 B. C. an ordinance was issued forbidding
the erecting of altars to the Alexandrian divinities inside the sacred
"enclosure of the _pomerium_, and seven years later Agrippa extended this"
prohibitive regulation to a radius of a thousand paces around the {83}
city. Tiberius acted on the same principle and in 19 A. D. instituted the
"regard it as a new, strange teaching, and know that we are but seeing"
"again with clearer eyes what a half-knowledge blinded us to, then the"
world will be bright and beautiful to us as it was long ago.
"But now all is dark. There are no dryads in our trees, nor nymphs among"
the reeds that fringe the river; even our peaks hold for us no guardian
"spirit, that may take the reckless trespasser and bind him in a rock for"
"ever. And because we have lost our belief in fairies, because we do not"
"now think that there are goblins in our caves, because there is no"
"spirit in the winds nor voice in the thunder, we have come to think that"
"the trees and the rocks, the flowers and the storm, are all dead things."
"They are made up, we say, of materials that we know, they are governed"
"by laws that we have discovered, and there is no life anywhere in"
Nature.
And yet this cannot be true. Far truer is it to believe in fairies and
in spirits than in nothing at all; for surely there is life all about
"us. Who that has lived out alone in the forest, that has lain upon the"
hillside and seen the mountains clothe themselves in lustrous shadows
"shot with crimson when the day dies, who that has heard the sigh come up"
"out of the ravines where the little breezes move, that has watched the"
"trees sway their leaves to and fro, beckoning to each other with wayward"
"amorous gestures, but has known that these are not dead things?"
Watch the stream coming down the hill with a flash and a laugh in the
"sunlight, look into the dark brown pools in the deep shadows beneath"
"the rocks, or voyage a whole night upon the breast of the great river,"
"drifting past ghostly monasteries and silent villages, and then say if"
"there be no life in the waters, if they, too, are dead things. There is"
"no consolation like the consolation of Nature, no sympathy like the"
sympathy of the hills and streams; and sympathy comes from life. There
is no sympathy with the dead.
"and Justinian,[33] and in accordance with the sad prophecy of Hermes"
"Trismegistus[34] Egypt, Egypt herself, lost her divinities and became a"
land of the dead. Of her religions nothing remained but fables that were no
"longer believed, and the only thing that reminded the barbarians who came"
"to inhabit the country of its former piety, were words engraved on stone."

This rapid sketch of the history of Isis and Serapis shows that these
divinities were worshiped in the Latin world for more than five centuries.
The task of pointing out the transformations of the cult during that long
"period, and the local differences there may have been in the various"
"provinces, is reserved for future researches. These will undoubtedly find"
"that the Alexandrian worship did not become Latinized under the empire, but"
that its Oriental character became more and more pronounced. When Domitian
"restored the Iseum of the Campus Martius and that of Beneventum, he {86}"
"transferred from the valley of the Nile sphinxes, cynocephali and obelisks"
"of black or pink granite bearing borders of hieroglyphics of Amasis,"
Nectanebos or even Rameses II. On other obelisks that were erected in the
propyleums even the inscriptions of the emperors were written in
"hieroglyphics.[35] Half a century later that true dilettante, Hadrian,"
"caused the luxuries of Canopus to be reproduced, along with the vale of"
"Tempe, in his immense villa at Tibur, to enable him to celebrate his"
voluptuous feasts under the friendly eyes of Serapis. He extolled the
merits of the deified Antinous in inscriptions couched in the ancient
"language of the Pharaohs, and set the fashion of statues hewn out of black"
basalt in the Egyptian style.[36] The amateurs of that period affected to
prefer the hieratic rigidity of the barbarian idols to the elegant freedom
of Alexandrian art. Those esthetic manifestations probably corresponded to
"religious prejudices, and the Latin worship always endeavored to imitate"
the art of temples in the Nile valley more closely than did the Greek. This
evolution was in conformity with all the tendencies of the imperial period.
"associated with the name of Hegel. Hegel takes experience, knowledge,"
"or thought, in another and much more comprehensive fashion than did his"
"predecessors. Knowledge, in fact, is all-comprehending; it embraces"
"both sides in itself, and explains them as 'moments,' _i.e._"
complementary factors in the one Reality. To make this clearer: we have
"been all along taking knowledge as a dualistic process, as having two"
"sides involved in it, a subject and an object. Now, Hegel says our"
mistake is this: we cannot make a separation of such a kind except by a
"process of abstraction: the one really implies the other, and could not"
"possibly exist without it. We may in our ordinary pursuits do so,"
without doubt; we may concentrate our attention on one side or the
"other, as the case may be; we may look at the world as if it could be"
"explained by mechanical means, as, indeed, to a certain point it can."
"But, Hegel says, these explanations are not sufficient; they can easily"
"be shown to be untrue, when driven far enough: the world is something"
"larger; it has the ideal side as well as the real, and, as we are"
"placed, they are both necessarily there, and must both be recognised,"
if we are to attain to true conceptions.
Without saying that Ferrier wholly assimilated the modern German
"view,--for of course he did not,--he was clearly largely influenced by"
"it, more largely perhaps than he was even himself aware. It"
particularly met the present difficulties with which he was confronted.
"The negative attitude was felt to be impossible, and the other, the"
"Belief which then, as now, was so strongly advocated, the Belief which"
meant a more or less blind acceptance of a spiritual power beyond our
"own, the Belief in the God we cannot know and glory in not being able"
"so to know, he felt to be an equal impossibility. Ferrier, and many"
"others, asked the question, Are these alternatives exhaustive? Can we"
not have a rational explanation of the world and of ourselves? Can we
"not, that is, attain to freedom? The new point of view seemed in some"
"measure to meet the difficulty, and therefore it was looked to with"
the Scriptures?” “Did Jesus Christ go up into heaven in the sight of
the apostles till a cloud received Him?” “Did Mary’s Son come to her
as other babies come?” “Was Joseph Jesus Christ’s real father?” Our
"members of Parliament who have no leisure to know their own children,"
who keep them in the nursery till it is time for them to go to the
"Preparatory School, who leave their training to the governess and the"
"head-master, may talk about “the cruelty of the religious differences"
which hinder the establishment of an efficient system of education for
the children of the State.” But the men and the mothers who live with
"their children and talk to them about their lessons, know that a child"
will insist upon an answer to its questions. A father of a family in
"the artisan and labouring classes, if he be at all intelligent, loses"
all respect for ministers of the Gospel who pretend that there is no
"difficulty about the simple Gospel story, and losing his self-respect"
"for the men who have appointed themselves his teachers, he is tempted"
to throw all theology aside. And if he ventures on this despairing
expedient he finds himself in mental confusion again over ethics
"instead of theology, and there arises a prospect of anarchy and"
"disorder. Capital is timid, so enterprise is checked. Poverty"
"increases and riot follows, and it all ends, not now-a-days in the"
"Napoleonic “whiff of grape-shot,” but in the rattle of the maxim in"
the streets and the desolation of a thousand homes.
The experience of all civilization is that you cannot separate
morality from religion. When the Romans lost their faith in the old
"gods and became “undenominational,” civic virtue decayed. When the"
genius of the Empire was set up for a universal Deity and men were
bidden as good citizens to burn their few grains of incense before the
statue of the reigning Emperor--the representative of an ordered and
moral state--we know what happened. You cannot make an abstraction
"alive and deify Government. Laws, which have the sanction only of"
"expediency, do but furnish mankind with exercise in evasion."
"Greek. This was a radical change. The philosopher Demetrius of Phalerum,"
"who had been cured of blindness by Serapis, composed poems in honor of the"
god that were still sung under the Cæsars several centuries later.[5] We
"can easily imagine that the poets, who lived on the bounty of the"
"Ptolemies, vied with each other in their efforts to celebrate their"
"benefactors' god, and the old rituals that were translated from the"
Egyptian were also enriched with {76} edifying bits of original
"inspiration. A hymn to Isis, found on a marble monument in the island of"
"Andros,[6] gives us some idea of these sacred compositions, although it is"
of more recent date.
"In the second place, the artists replaced the old hieratic idols by more"
attractive images and gave them the beauty of the immortals. It is not
known who created the figure of Isis draped in a linen gown with a fringed
"cloak fastened over the breast, whose sweet meditative, graciously maternal"
face is a combination of the ideals imagined for Hera and Aphrodite. But we
know the sculptor of the first statue of Serapis that stood in the great
"sanctuary of Alexandria until the end of paganism. This statue, the"
"prototype of all the copies that have been preserved, is a colossal work of"
"art made of precious materials by a famous Athenian sculptor named Bryaxis,"
a contemporary of Scopas. It was one of the last divine creations of
"Hellenic genius. The majestic head, with its somber and yet benevolent"
"expression, with its abundance of hair, and with a crown in the shape of a"
"bushel, bespoke the double character of a god ruling at the same time both"
the fertile earth and the dismal realm of the dead.[7]
"As we see, the Ptolemies had given their new religion a literary and"
artistic shape that was capable of attracting the most refined and cultured
minds. But the adaptation to the Hellenic feeling and thinking was not
"exclusively external. Osiris, the god whose worship was thus renewed, was"
more adapted than any other to lend his authority to the formation of a
"syncretic faith. At a very early period, in fact before the time of"
misgiving. In contrast-dreams of this type we are not concerned with
the eruption of concealed and repressed wishes. They are merely based
"on vestigial possibilities, entirely alien to our temperament as it has"
"developed in life, and only a part of our complex personalities in the"
"sense that, as Schopenhauer said, whatever path we take in life there"
are latent germs within us which could only have developed in an exactly
opposite path. Even the very same dream may be due to quite different
"causes. To take a very simple dream, for we may best argue on the simplest"
"facts: the dream of eating. We dream of eating when we are hungry, but"
sometimes we also dream of eating when the stomach is suffering from
"repletion. The dream is the same, but the psychological mechanism is"
"entirely different, in the one case emotional, in the other intellectual."
In the first case the picture of eating is built up in response to an
"organic visceral craving, and we have an elementary wish-dream of what"
Freud would call infantile type; in the second case the same dream is a
"theory, embodied in a concrete picture, to account for the existence of"
the repletion experienced.
"There cannot be the slightest doubt that the wish-dream, in its simple or"
"what Freud calls its infantile form, represents an extremely common type"
of dream.[160] A large number of the dreams of children are concerned with
wishes and their fulfilments. Those dreams of adults which are aroused by
"actual organic sensations also tend to fall, though not invariably, into"
"the same form. Again, we chance to want a thing when we are awake; when"
"we are asleep we dream we have found it. It may also be said, almost with"
"certainty, that in some cases our dreams are the fulfilment of unexpressed"
"and unconscious waking wishes. Even the best people, it is probable, may"
occasionally dream of events which represent the fulfilment of wishes they
have never consciously formulated. Archbishop Laud was accustomed to note
down his dreams in his Diary. On one occasion we find him setting down
"a disturbing dream, in which he saw the Lord Keeper dead, and 'rotten"
already.' A little later we find that Laud is 'much concerned at the
them with an eagerness and zeal almost too great for the object he had
in view.
"[7] The late Sir John Skelton, K.C.B."
"After his marriage in 1837, Ferrier devoted his attention almost"
entirely to the philosophy he loved so well. He did not succeed--did
"not perhaps try to succeed--at the Bar, to which he had been called."
Many qualities are required by a successful advocate besides the subtle
mind and acute reasoning powers which Ferrier undoubtedly possessed:
possibly--we might almost say probably--these could have been
"cultivated had he made the effort. He had, to begin with, a fair junior"
"counsel's practice, owing to his family connections, and this might"
"have been easily developed; his ambition, however, did not soar in the"
"direction of the law courts, and he did not give that whole-hearted"
devotion to the subject which is requisite if success is to follow the
efforts of the novice. But if he was not attracted by the work at the
"Parliament House, he was attracted elsewhere; and to his first"
"mistress, Philosophy, none could be more faithful. In other lines, it"
"is true, he read much and deeply: literature in its widest sense"
"attracted him as it would attract any educated man. Poetry, above all,"
"he loved, in spite of the tale sometimes told against him, that he"
gravely proposed turning _In Memoriam_ into prose in order to ascertain
logically 'whether its merits were sustained by reason as well as by
rhyme'--a proposition which is said greatly to have entertained its
"author, when related to him by a mutual friend. Works of imagination he"
delighted in--all spheres of literature appealed to him; he had the
sense of form which is denied to many of his craft; he wrote in a style
"at once brilliant and clear, and carelessness on this score in some of"
"the writings of his countrymen irritated him, as those sensitive to"
such things are irritated. He has often been spoken of as a living
"protest against the materialism of the age, working away in the quiet,"
the aristocracy and were especially appreciated as litter-bearers.[8] The
"imperial and municipal administrations, as well as the big contractors to"
"whom customs and the mines were farmed out, hired or bought them in large"
"numbers, and even in the remotest border provinces the _Syrus_ was found"
"serving princes, cities or private individuals. The worship of the Syrian"
goddess profited considerably by the economic current that continually
brought new worshipers. We find her mentioned in the first century of our
"era in a Roman inscription referring in precise terms to the slave market,"
"and we know that Nero took a devout fancy to the stranger that did not,"
"however, last very long.[9] In the popular Trastevere quarter she had a"
temple until the end of paganism.[10] {107}
"During the imperial period, however, the slaves were no longer the only"
"missionaries that came from Syria, and Atargatis was no longer the only"
divinity from that country to be worshiped in the Occident. The propagation
of the Semitic worship progressed for the most part in a different manner
under the empire.
"At the beginning of our era the Syrian merchants, _Syri negotiatores_,"
undertook a veritable colonization of the Latin provinces.[11] During the
second century before Christ the traders of that nation had established
"settlements along the coast of Asia Minor, on the Piraeus, and in the"
"Archipelago. At Delos, a small island but a large commercial center, they"
"maintained several associations that worshiped their national gods, in"
particular Hadad and Atargatis. But the wars that shook the Orient at the
"end of the republic, and above all the growth of piracy, ruined maritime"
commerce and stopped emigration. This began again with renewed vigor when
the establishment of the empire guaranteed the safety of the seas and when
the Levantine traffic attained a development previously unknown. We can
trace the history of the Syrian establishments in the Latin provinces from
"the first to the seventh century, and recently we have begun to appreciate"
"their economic, social and religious importance at its true value."
always follows it. He never swears[21] or calls names or uses ill words
"to companions. He is never peevish and fretful, always cheerful and"
good-tempered.”
VII.--_Stories of exaggerated and coarse fun._ In the chapter on the
positive side of this subject I shall speak more in detail of the
educational value of robust and virile representation of fun and of
"sheer nonsense, but as a representation to these statements, I should"
like to strike a note of warning about the element of exaggerated and
"coarse fun being encouraged in our school stories, partly because of"
the lack of humour in such presentations--a natural product of stifling
imagination--and partly because the train of the abnormal has the same
effect as the too frequent use of the melodramatic.
"You have only to read the adventures of Buster Brown, which for years"
"formed the Sunday reading of millions of children in the United States,"
to realise what would be the effect of coarse fun and entire absence
"of humour upon the normal child in its everyday experience, an effect"
all the greater because of the real skill with which the illustrations
are drawn. It is only fair to state that this series was not originally
"prepared or intended for the young, but it is a matter of regret"
(shared by most educationists in the States) that they should ever have
been given to children at all.
"In an article in _Macmillan's Magazine_, Dec. 1869, Miss Yonge writes:"
"“A taste for buffoonery is much to be discouraged, an exclusive taste"
for extravagance most unwholesome and even perverting. It becomes
destructive of reverence and soon degenerates into coarseness. It
"permits nothing poetical or imaginative, nothing sweet or pathetic to"
"exist, and there is a certain self-satisfaction and superiority in"
making game of what others regard with enthusiasm and sentiment which
absolutely bars the way against a higher or softer tone.”
"inclined to frolic away from chastity or integrity, much as did the"
county members who pocketed the bribes of Sir Robert Walpole and
prated of patriotism.
"Fortunately for society the man in the street is a very decent fellow,"
and generally finds out before long that Wisdom’s ways are ways of
pleasantness. A man may enjoy posing as an agnostic when he wants an
"excuse for--as the negro said--“doing what he dam please,” but when he"
"takes to himself a wife, and children are born to him, a certain"
anxiety as to the continuity and perpetuation of these relationships
"begins to show itself. A man who has lost a little child, or waited in"
"agonizing suspense to hear the physician’s verdict, when sickness"
"overshadows his home, discovers that he needs something beyond"
"negations, something that will bring life and immortality to light"
again within his soul.
"Moreover, the man in the street finds it necessary to come to some"
decision on other problems of existence. He is a citizen and must
needs exercise his enfranchisement and give his vote at an election
now and again. He must help to decide whether the State shall ignore
"religion and establish a system of ethical education, of which the"
"ultimate sanction is social convenience, or maintain the thesis that"
Creed and Character are mutually inter-dependent.
"As he pays his poor rate wrathfully, or with resignation, its annual"
increase reminds him of the necessity of curing or eliminating the
"unfit. When he reads of Belgian and Prussian colonial enterprise, or"
ponders on the perplexing problem of the Black Belt which the Southern
"States must solve, he is compelled to consider whether it is true"
that “God has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all
"the face of the earth,” or whether this shall be accounted as another"
of the delusions of Saul of Tarsus whom Governor Festus found to be
"Mission preacher will use his magnetic power, the artist whose skill"
"it is to build or to paint, will make his appeal to the love of order"
"and beauty, the musicians will meet the heart through the ear. May not"
the writer of fiction use his psychological training and his knowledge
of many sides of human life to create a story which shall set men
thinking about the old doctrines which he believes to have lost none
of their regenerating power?
There is danger lest men with good intentions should go blindly to
work to redress and diminish social grievances. Individualism with its
"hateful cry, “Each man for himself and the devil take the hindmost,”"
"is now at a discount, but it may be replaced by a despotism of State"
"regulation which will destroy the family and the home. There is, I"
"believe, only one creed which can make the capitalist unselfish and"
"the sons of labour satisfied, which will tell men that wealth means"
"responsibility and that there is dignity in toil, which will teach the"
rich man to order himself lowly and reverently to those who are _his_
"betters and to hurt nobody by word or deed, which will teach the"
"labourer that his chief need is not other men’s wealth, but the"
“carrière ouverte aux talents” and the determination to do his duty in
"that state of life, whatever it may be, unto which God _shall_ call"
him.
It is the Holy Catholic Faith which makes equality of opportunity for
"all men its earthly ambition, and offers refreshment and hope to those"
who are not strong enough to strive with the rest. The old men saw
"visions and we have found that they were prophecies, a young man may"
dream dreams. My dream is that the men who are doing the work of the
world to-day may be taught that Christ is their best teacher and the
Incarnate God their refuge and strength.
There is a tale of an acrobat and juggler who knew well that his
car likewise becomes a triumphal car.
‘Just as the marriage of Zeus in the realm of light became a type for
"men in this life, so the marriage of Hades, or of Dionysus representing"
"him, developed into a similar prototype for the dead. Since that which"
"is true of Death bears directly upon the actual dead, it was quite"
natural that gradually the process of death came to be considered in
general as a wedding with the deities of death. With this conception
too harmonize those wedding-scenes which are so common and conspicuous
"on funeral monuments, as well as the often-recurring scenes from the"
joyous cycle of Dionysus-myths[1510].’
"Two brief comments may be made upon this passage. First, Furtwängler"
"clearly recognises in Dionysus a mere substitute for Hades, and thus"
confirms my interpretation of the strange legend concerning Dionysus
and Prosymnus[1511]. We noticed that the somewhat obscure observation
of Heraclitus (as quoted by Clement) upon that story contained the
words ‘Dionysus and Hades are one and the same’; and we now see that
"in art too the same identification was made, and that the marriage of"
a mortal with Dionysus was used to typify the future marriage of the
dead with their gods. The reason for this identification seems simply
"to be that the cults in which the two gods figured, although differing"
"in outward form, were felt to express one and the same idea--namely the"
conception of death as a form of marriage; and the tendency to identify
"in such cases was carried so far that the god Dionysus was even, we are"
"told, identified with the mortal Adonis[1512], presumably because the"
"worship of each, as I have shown above, turned upon this one cardinal"
doctrine.
"Secondly, Furtwängler points out that the marriage of Zeus and Hera"
represented for living men the same doctrine as the marriage of Hades
and Persephone (or of Dionysus and Ariadne) represented for the dead.
The truth of this is well illustrated by the close resemblance between
"iguanas in the jungle, the fish in the river and the yams and bananas in"
the clearing needed no silver to come to his table. Besides he was
"preparing to become a man of family. Maria was quite willing, and so one"
day they strolled off together hand in hand to a clearing Miguel had
made with his machete on the river bank. With that same useful tool he
"cut some wooden posts, set them erect in the ground and covered them"
with a heavy thatch of palmetto leaves impervious to sun or rain. The
sides of the shelter were left open during the first months of wedded
"life. Later perhaps, when they had time they would go to Cruces at the"
period of the priest’s regular visit and get regularly married. When the
rainy season came on and walls were as necessary as a roof against the
"driving rain, they would build a little better. When that time came he"
would set ten stout uprights of bamboo in the ground in the shape of an
"oblong, and across the tops would fasten six cross pieces of girders"
with withes of vine well soaked to make them pliable. This would make
the frame of the first floor of his house. The walls he would make by
"weaving reeds, or young bamboo stalks in and out betwixt the posts until"
a fairly tight basketwork filled the space. This was then plastered
"outside with clay. The dirt, which in time would be stamped down hard,"
formed the floor. For his second story a tent-shaped frame of lighter
"bamboo tightly tied together was fastened to the posts, and cane was"
tied to each of the rafters as we nail laths to scantling. Thus a strong
"peaked roof, about eight feet high from the second floor to the"
"ridgepole was constructed, and thatched with palm leaves. Its angle"
being exceedingly steep it sheds water in the fierce tropic rain storms.
"The floor of the second story is made of bamboo poles laid transversely,"
and covered heavily with rushes and palmetto. This is used only as the
"family sleeping apartment, and to give access to it Miguel takes an"
"8-inch bamboo and cuts notches in it, into which the prehensile toes of"
his family may fit as they clamber up to the land of Nod. Furniture to
the chamber floor there is none. The family herd together like so many
"squirrels, and with the bamboo climbing pole drawn up there is no danger"
"presence, a presence that I do not see but seem to feel, and my greatest"
"terror is that I _shall_ see it. The presence is ill-defined, but very"
"real, and it seems to suggest the potentiality of all possible moral,"
"mental, and physical evil. In these dreams it always occurs to me that"
if this evil presence shall ever become embodied into a something that I
"could _see_, the sight of it would be so ineffably horrible as to drive me"
mad. So vivid has this fear been that on several occasions I have awakened
in a cold sweat or a nameless fear that would persist for some minutes
after I realised that I had only been dreaming.' This seems to be an
abnormal type of the dream of flight.
It is somewhat surprising that while dreams of floating in the air are so
"common and clearly indicate the respiratory source of the dream, dreams"
"of floating on water seem to be rare, for as the actual experience of"
"floating on water is fairly familiar, we might have expected that sleeping"
consciousness would have found here rather than in the never experienced
idea of floating in air the explanation of its sensations. The dream of
"floating on water is, however, by no means unknown; thus Rachilde (Mme."
"Vallette), the French novelist and critic, whose dream life is vivid and"
"remarkable, states that her most agreeable dream is that of floating on"
the surface of warm and transparent lakes or rivers.[124] One of the
correspondents of _L'intermédiaire des Chercheurs et des Curieux_[125]
also states that he has often dreamed of walking on the water.
It is not only in sleep that the sensation of flying is experienced. In
"hysteria a sense of peculiar lightness of the body, and the idea of the"
"soul's power to fly, may occur incidentally,[126] and may certainly be"
"connected both with the vigilambulism, as Sollier terms the sleep-like"
"tendencies of such cases, and the anaesthetic conditions found in the"
hysterical. It is noteworthy that Janet found that in an ecstatic person
who experienced the sensation of rising in the air there was anaesthesia
"of the soles of the feet. In such hysterical ecstasy, which has always"
III. CRITICISM AND HISTORY
Beyond the system--The universality of art--The discipline of
"art--Poetry, prose and oratory--Classicism and impressionism--"
Practical personality and poetical personality--The monographic
method in criticism--The reform of Ã¦sthetic history--Criticism as
philosophy--Sensibility and intelligence.
"The identification of history and philosophy, in the form in which"
"we have expounded it in the preceding chapter, is the turning point"
of Croce's thought; the system which in the first three volumes of
the _Filosofia dello Spirito_ had still a somewhat static and rigid
"appearance, is really set to movement, animated as if by a new and"
"intenser life, since its implicit dynamism is made explicit in the"
"fourth and concluding volume. To Croce himself, the whole of his work"
"appears no longer as a system, but as ""a series of systematizations,"""
"and his _Filosofia dello Spirito_, as a series of ""volumes on the"
"problems slowly gathering in his mind since the years of his youth."""
"No wonder, therefore, that his later work should contain ""thoughts"
"that break the bars of the so-called system, and give, to a close"
"scrutiny, new systems or new 'systematizations,' since always the whole"
"moves with every one of our steps."" No wonder that he should feel that"
he will continue to philosophize even if one day he shall abandon
"""philosophy,"" ""as this is what the unity of philosophy and history"
"implies: that we philosophize whenever we think, and of whatever object"
"and in whatever form we may think.""[1] And in fact, in these last few"
"years, Croce has given many a severe shock to the faithful worshippers"
"of his system, sometimes by extending his tolerance, or even his"
"approval, to types of speculation apparently remote from his own, but"
"in which he recognises, under a radically different aspect, some of"
"a horde of alligators or crocodiles, as are seen in Crocodile Creek, one"
"of the affluents of the Bayano. This river, which empties into the Gulf"
"of Panama, is in its lower reaches a tide-water stream and perhaps"
because of the mingling of the salt and the fresh the water is densely
filled with the microscopic infusoria which at night blaze forth in
coldly phosphorescent gleams suggestive of the sparkling of a spray of
"diamonds. Put your hand into the stream, lift it and let the water"
trickle through your fingers. Every drop gleams and glistens as it falls
with a radiance comparable with nothing in nature unless it be the great
fire-flies of the tropics. Even diamonds have to pass through the hands
of the cutter before they will blaze with any such effulgence as the
trickling waters of this tropical stream. One who has passed a night
"upon it may well feel that he has lived with one of the world’s marvels,"
and can but wonder at the matter-of-fact manner in which the natives go
about their tasks unmoved by the contact with so much shining glory.
[Illustration: LOADING CATTLE AT AGUADULCE]
There is always controversy on the Isthmus over the question whether the
gigantic saurians of Crocodile Creek are in fact crocodiles or
alligators. Whether expert scientific opinion has ever been called upon
"to settle the problem I do not know, but I rather suspect that crocodile"
was determined upon because it gave to the name of Crocodile Creek in
which they are so plentifully found “apt alliteration’s artful aid” to
make it picturesque. Whatever the precise zoological classification
given to the huge lizards may be is likely to be relatively unimportant
"before long, because the greatest joy of every tourist is found in"
killing them. The fascination which slaughter possesses for men is
"always hard to understand, but just what gives the killing of alligators"
"its peculiar zest I could never understand. The beasts are slow, torpid"
"and do not afford a peculiarly difficult test of marksmanship, even"
though the vulnerable part of their bodies is small. They are timid and
"Villiers flashed back an amused, responsive glance, and then"
conscientiously strove to pay more attention to the irrepressible
"feminine philologist beside him, determining to take her, as he said to"
"himself, by way of penance for his unremembered sins. After a while"
"there came one of those extraordinary, sudden rushes of gabble that"
"often occur at even the stiffest dinner-party,--a galloping race of"
"tongues, in which nothing really distinct is heard, but in which each"
talks to the other as though moved by an impulse of sheer desperation.
This burst of noise was a relief after the strained murmurs of trite
"commonplaces that had hitherto been the order of the hour, and the fair"
"Duchess, somewhat easier in her mind, turned anew to Alwyn, with"
greater grace and gentleness of manner than she had yet shown.
"""I am afraid,"" she said smilingly, ""you must find us all very stupid"
"after your travels abroad? In England we ARE dull,--our tristesse"
"cannot be denied. But, really, the climate is responsible,--we want"
"more sunshine. I suppose in the East, where the sun is so warm and"
"bright, the people are always cheerful?"""
"""On the contrary, I have found them rather serious and contemplative"
"than otherwise,"" returned Alwyn,--""yet their gravity is certainly of a"
"pleasant, and not of a forbidding type. I don't myself think the sun"
"has much to do with the disposition of man, after all,--I fancy his"
"temperament is chiefly moulded by the life he leads. In the East, for"
"instance, men accept their existence as a sort of divine command, which"
"they obey cheerfully, yet with a consciousness of high"
"responsibility:--on the Continent they take it as a bagatelle, lightly"
"won, lightly lost, hence their indifferent, almost childish,"
"gayety;--but in Great Britain""--and he smiled,--""it looks nowadays as"
"if it were viewed very generally as a personal injury and bore,--a kind"
of title bestowed without the necessary money to keep it up! And this
"money people set themselves steadily to obtain, with many a weary grunt"
Adonis in the mysteries of Aphrodite. He is the beloved of the goddess;
he is lost and mourned for as dead; he is restored again from the
grave to the goddess who loved him. And in all this he appears to be
the representative of all Cybele’s worshippers; for the ritual of
"initiation into her rites, if once again we may avail ourselves of"
"Clement’s statements, is strongly imbued with the idea of marriage"
between the goddess and her worshipper. The several acts or stages of
initiation are summarised in four phrases: ‘I ate out of the drum; I
drank out of the cymbal; I carried the sacred vessel; I entered privily
the bed-chamber--ἐκ τυμπάνου ἔφαγον· ἐκ κυμβάλου ἔπιον· ἐκερνοφόρησα·
ὑπὸ τὸν παστὸν ὑπέδυν[1472]. In the passage from which these phrases
are culled there appears to be a certain confusion between the rites
of Cybele and those of Demeter; but the fact that Clement shortly
afterwards gives another formulary of Demeter’s ritual is sufficient
"proof that he meant this present formulary, as indeed the mention of"
"kettle-drum and cymbal[1473] suggests, to apply to the mysteries of"
Cybele[1474]. It appears then that the final act or stage of initiation
consisted in the secret admission of the worshipper to the bed-chamber
of the goddess. Such ritual can have borne only one interpretation. It
clearly constituted a promise of wedded union between the initiated
and their deity. Viewed in this light even the emasculation of the
priests of Cybele may more readily be understood; it may have been the
"consecration of their virility to the service of the goddess, a final"
"and convincing pledge of celibacy in this life, in return for which"
they aspired to be blest by wedlock with their goddess hereafter.
The mention of the goddess’ bed-chamber in the above passage is of
considerable interest. The παστός (or παστάς) in relation to a temple
meant the same thing as it often meant in relation to an ordinary
"house, an inner room or recess screened off, and in particular a"
bridal chamber. Such provision for the physical comfort of the deity
was probably not rare. Pausanias tells us that on the right of
that one can differentiate.
For all that he ought to have given himself another decade before crying
"himself a failure, yet a brilliant young journalist who has not found"
a publisher for one of four novels has reasonable excuse for serious
cogitation. There are scores of brilliant young journalists who have
"published masterpieces of fiction before they are thirty, and at forty"
"have gone on their knees and thanked kind, gentle Time for his effacing"
fingers; yet the novels have had some quality of the novel warranting
"their publication. At any rate, the brilliant young journalists have"
believed in them. They have looked upon their Creation and found that
"it was good. But Risca, looking on his Creation, found that it was"
wood. His people were as wooden as Mr. and Mrs. Ham in a Noah's Ark; his
scenery was as wooden as the trees and mountain in a toy Swiss
village; his dialogue as wooden as the conversation-blocks used by
"the philosophers of Laputa. He had said, in an outburst of wrathful"
"resentment, that he found his one artistic outlet in aiding to create"
Stella's Land of Illusion; and he was right. He was despairingly
aware of the lack of the quick fancy; the power of visualization; the
"sublimated faculty of the child's make-believe, creating out of trumpery"
"bits and pieces a glowing world of romance; the keen, instinctive"
knowledge of the general motives of human action; the uncanny insight
"into the hearts and feelings of beings of a sex, class, or type"
different from his own; the gift of evolving from a tiny broken bone of
"fact a perfect creature indisputably real, colouring it with the hues of"
"actuality and breathing into it the breath of life--the lack, indeed, of"
"all the essential qualities, artistic and therefore usually instinctive,"
that go to the making of a novelist. Yet Risca was doggedly determined
to be a novelist and a poet. It was pathetic. How can a man who cannot
distinguish between “God Save the King” and “Yankee Doodle” hope to
write a world-shaking sonata? Risca knew that he was crying for the
"moon, and it is only because he cried so hard for it that he deserved"
being largely determined by the nature of the voice and of the things it
"uttered: it would, further, be quite easy to enter into conversation with"
the person we had thus constructed. That is what seems to occur in dreams.
"We hear a voice behind the curtain of darkness, and to fit that voice and"
"the things it utters we instinctively form a picture which, in virtue of"
"the hallucinatory aptitude of sleep, is thrown against the curtain; it is"
then quite easy to enter into conversation with the person we have thus
constructed. It no more occurs to us during sleep to suppose that the
"voice we hear is only a voice and nothing more, than it would occur to us"
awake to suppose that the voice behind the curtain is only a voice and
nothing more. The process is the same; the difference is that in dreams we
"are, without knowing it, living among what from the waking point of view"
are called hallucinations.
This process by which dreams are formed in sleeping consciousness
through the splitting of the dreamer's personality for the construction
of other personalities has been recognised ever since dreams began to
be seriously studied. Maury referred to the scission of personality in
dreams.[168] Delboeuf dealt with what he termed the altruising by the
dreamer of part of his representations.[169] Foucault terms the same
process personalisation.[170] Giessler attempts elaborately to explain
the enigma of self-diremption--the formation of a secondary self--in
"dreams; if, he argues, a touch or other sensation exceeds the dream-body's"
"capacity of adaptation--_i.e._, if the state of stimulus is above the"
apperceptive threshold--only one part of the perception is referred to the
dream-body and the other is transferred to a secondary self.[171] This
"explanation, while it very fairly covers the presentative class of dreams,"
"directly connected with sensory stimuli, cannot so easily be applied to"
"the dramatisation of our representative dreams, which are not obviously"
traceable to direct bodily stimulation.
The splitting up of personality is indeed a very pronounced and widely
"out in such force that they were divided into a night and a day crew,"
"half of them being sent back to report later, while among the mountains"
of freight the work went forward faster than ever. But the night had
"served to point the anger of the strikers, and the dock owners,"
"becoming alarmed for the safety of their property, joined with Emerson"
"in establishing a force of a dozen able-bodied guards, armed with"
"clubs, to assist the police in disputing the shore line with the"
"rioters. The police themselves had proved ineffective, even betraying a"
"half-hearted sympathy with the union men, who were not slow to profit"
"by it. Even so, the day passed rather quietly, as did the next. But in"
time the agitation became so general as to paralyze a wide section of
"the water-front, and the city awoke to the realization that a serious"
"conflict was in progress. The handful of fishermen, hidden under the"
"roof of the great warehouse, outnumbered twenty to one, and guarded"
"only by a thin line of pickets, became a centre of general interest."
"As the violence of the mob, stimulated rather than checked by the"
"indifference of the police, became more openly daring, so likewise did"
"the reprisals of the fishermen, goaded now to a stubborn rage. They"
"would not hear to having their food brought to them, but insisted daily"
on emerging in a body at noon and spending the hour in combat. Not to
"speak of the physical disabilities they incurred in these affrays, the"
"excitement distracted them and affected their work disastrously, to the"
great concern of their employer.
It was on the fourth day that Boyd espied the man in the gray suit
"among the strikers and pointed him out to his three companions, Clyde"
and Fraser having joined him and George in a spirit of curiosity. Clyde
"was for immediately executing a sally to capture the fellow, explaining"
that once they had him inside the dock-house they could beat him until
"he confessed that Marsh was behind the strike, but his valor shrank"
amazingly when Fraser maliciously suggested that he himself lead the
"you?’ and then turning to her ravisher, ‘What do you mean, sirrah, by"
"handling me so roughly, and dragging me down into the sea? I shall"
"go under and be drowned, miserable girl.’ And Poseidon answers, ‘Do"
"not be frightened, you shall come to no harm; no, I will strike the"
"rock here, near where the waves break, with my trident, and will let"
"a spring burst up which shall bear your name, and you yourself shall"
"be blessed and, unlike your sisters, shall not carry water when you"
are dead (καὶ σὺ εὐδαίμων ἔσῃ καὶ μόνη τῶν ἀδελφῶν οὐχ ὑδροφορήσεις
ἀποθανοῦσα)[1499].’ The whole point of Poseidon’s answer clearly
depends upon the existence of a well-known belief that the Danaids were
punished hereafter for remaining unmarried and that the punishment took
the form of vainly fetching water for that bridal bath which was a
necessary preliminary to a wedding; Amymone shall have a very thorough
"bridal bath, and the spring that bears her name shall be a monument"
"of it, while she herself shall be ‘blessed’ by wedlock with Poseidon;"
thus shall she escape the fate of the unmarried. Clearly then there was
no distinction between the uninitiated and the unmarried; both alike
were doomed vainly to fetch water for those ablutions which preceded
initiation into the mysteries or into matrimony; and once again the
conception of marriage as a mystic and sacramental rite akin to the
rites of Eleusis is clearly revealed.
It may further be noted here that this idea of the punishment of the
"unmarried completely explains the custom, on which I have already"
"touched, of erecting a water-pitcher (λουτροφόρος) over the grave of"
"unmarried persons. This intimated, according to Eustathius[1500], that"
the person there buried had never taken the bath which both bride and
bridegroom were wont to take before marriage. But this must not be
taken to mean that the water-pitcher was erected as a symbol of the
punishment which the dead person was supposed to be undergoing; this
"was not an idea which his relatives and friends, even if they had held"
"it, would have wished to blazon abroad. One might as soon expect to"
"Attis, or Papas, was regarded as her husband, but the first place in this"
"divine household belonged to the woman, a reminiscence of the period of"
matriarchy.[4]
When the Phrygians at a very early period came from Thrace and inserted
"themselves like a wedge in the old Anatolian races, they adopted the vague"
"deities of their new country by identifying them with their own, after the"
habit of pagan nations. Thus Attis became one with the Dionysus-Sabazius of
"the conquerors, or at least assumed some of his characteristics. This"
Thracian Dionysus was a god of vegetation. Foucart has thus admirably
"pictured his savage nature: ""Wooded summits, deep oak and pine forests,"
ivy-clad caverns were at all times his favorite haunts. Mortals who were
anxious to know the powerful divinity ruling these solitudes had to observe
"the life of his kingdom, {49} and to guess the god's nature from the"
phenomena through which he manifested his power. Seeing the creeks descend
"in noisy foaming cascades, or hearing the roaring of steers in the uplands"
"and the strange sounds of the wind-beaten forests, the Thracians thought"
"they heard the voice and the calls of the lord of that empire, and imagined"
a god who was fond of extravagant leaps and of wild roaming over the wooded
"mountains. This conception inspired their religion, for the surest way for"
"mortals to ingratiate themselves with a divinity was to imitate him, and as"
far as possible to make their lives resemble his. For this reason the
Thracians endeavored to attain the divine delirium that transported their
"Dionysus, and hoped to realize their purpose by following their invisible"
"yet ever-present lord in his chase over the mountains.""[5]"
"In the Phrygian religion we find the same beliefs and rites, scarcely"
"modified at all, with the one difference that Attis, the god of vegetation,"
"was united to the goddess of the earth instead of living ""in sullen"
"loneliness."" When the tempest was beating the forests of the Berecyntus or"
"Ida, it was Cybele traveling about in her car drawn by roaring lions"
mourning her lover's death. A crowd of worshipers followed her through
"incomplete without India's special contributions, mutual appreciation"
and better understanding resulted from his visit. One of the greatest of
"Medical Institutions, the Royal Society of Medicine, has been pleased to"
regard his address before the society as one of the most important in
their history and they expected that their science of medicine would be
materially benefited by the researches that are being carried out by him
in India. India has also been drawn closer to the great seats of
"learning in the West, to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; for"
there also the methods of inquiry initiated here have found the most
"cordial welcome. Many Indian students find their way to America,"
strangers in a strange land; hitherto they found few to advise and
"befriend them. It will perhaps be different now, since their leading"
Universities have begged from India the courtesy of hospitality for
their post graduate scholars. Some of these Universities again have
asked for a supply of apparatus specially invented at Dr. Bose's
laboratory which in their opinion will mark an epoch in scientific
advance.
THE INEFFABLE WONDER BEHIND THE VEIL
"As for the research itself, he said its bearings are not exclusively"
"specialistic, but touch the foundation of various branches of science."
To mention only a few; in medicine it had to deal with the fundamental
"reaction of protoplasm to various drugs, the solution of the problem why"
an identical agent brings about diametrically opposite effects in
different constitutions; in the science of life it dealt with the new
comparative physiology by which any specific characteristic of a tissue
is traced from the simplest type in plant to the most complex in the
animal; the study of the mysterious phenomenon of death and the
accurate determination of the death point and the various conditions by
which this point may be dislocated backwards and forwards; in psychology
"_Par excellence_, it was, in the phrase of Louis XIV, the nation of"
"shopkeepers, of middlemen; and its long supremacy in the business of"
buying cheap and selling dear was due firstly to economy of means and
"consumption, and secondarily to command of accumulated money capital at"
low rates of interest. The sinking of interest was the first sign that
the limits to its commercial expansion were being reached; but it
"belonged to the conditions that, with or without ""empire,"" its advantage"
must begin to fall away as soon as rival States were able to compete
"with it in the economies of ""production"" in the sense of transport and"
transfer.
In such economies the Dutch superiority grew out of the specially
practical basis of their marine--habitual fishing and the constant use
of canals. There is no better way than the former of building up
seamanship; and just as the Portuguese grew from hardy fishers to daring
"navigators, so the Dutch grew from thrifty fishers and bargemen to"
"thrifty handlers of sea-freight, surpassing in economy the shippers of"
"England as they did in seamanship the marine of Spain. Broadly speaking,"
"the navies which owed most to royal fostering--as those of Spain,"
"France, and in part England--were the later to reach efficiency in the"
degree of their artificiality; and the loss of one great Spanish navy
after another in storms must be held to imply a lack of due experience
on the part of their officers.
One of the worst military mistakes of Spain was the creation of
great galleons in preference to small cruisers. The sight of the
"big ships terrorised the Dutch once, in 1606; but as all existing"
"seacraft had been built up in small vessels, there was no"
sufficient science for the navigation of the great ones in stress
"of weather, or even for the building of them on sound lines. The"
"English and Dutch, on the other hand, fought in vessels of the kind"
"they had always been wont to handle, increasing their size only by"
"public bond in peace, over and above the normal tie of common enmities."
The result was a development of civic life still more rapid and more
"marked in inland Flanders,[735] where the territorial feudal power was"
naturally greater than in the maritime Dutch provinces. Self-ruling
"cities, such as Ghent and Antwerp, at their meridian, were too powerful"
to be effectively menaced by their immediate feudal lords. But on the
side of their relations with neighbouring cities or States they all
exhibited the normal foible; and it was owing only to the murderous
compulsion put upon them by Spain in the sixteenth century that any of
the provinces of the Netherlands became a federal republic. For five
"centuries after Charlemagne, who subdued them to his system, the Low"
Countries had undergone the ordinary slow evolution from pure feudalism
to the polity of municipalities. In the richer inland districts the
"feudal system, lay and clerical, was at its height, the baronial castles"
"being ""here more numerous than in any other part of Christendom"";[736]"
"and when the growing cities began to feel their power to buy charters,"
"the feudal formula was unchallenged,[737] while the mass of the outside"
"population were in the usual ""Teutonic"" state of partial or complete"
serfdom. It was only by burning their suburbs and taking to the walled
fortress that the people of Utrecht escaped the yoke of the
Norsemen.[738]
"Mr. Torrens M'Cullagh is responsible for the statement that ""it"
seems doubtful whether any portion of the inhabitants of Holland
"were ever in a state of actual servitude or bondage,"" and that the"
northern provinces were more generally free from slavery than the
"others (_Industrial History of the Free Nations_, 1846, ii, 39)."
"Motley (_Rise of the Dutch Republic_, as cited, pp. 17, 18)"
"pronounces, on the contrary, that ""in the northern Netherlands the"
"degraded condition of the mass continued longest,"" and that ""the"
number of slaves throughout the Netherlands was very large; the
"number belonging to the bishopric of Utrecht enormous."" This is"
"under one crown, repeatedly collapsed. The marvel is that in such an age"
even the attempt was made. The remarkable woman who planned and first
"effected it, Queen Margaret of Norway, appealed in the first instance"
"with heavy bribes for the co-operation of the clergy,[671] who,"
"especially in Sweden, where they preferred the Danish rule to the"
"domination of the nobles,[672] were always in favour of it for"
ecclesiastical reasons.
"Had such a union permanently succeeded, it would have eliminated a"
serious source of positive political evil; but to carry forward
Scandinavian civilisation under the drawbacks of the medieval difficulty
"of inter-communication (involving lack of necessary culture-contacts),"
"the natural poverty of the soil, and the restrictive pressure of the"
"Catholic Church, would have been a task beyond the power of a monarchy"
"comprising three mutually jealous sections. As it was, the old strifes"
"recurred almost as frequently as before, and moral union was never"
"developed. If historical evidence is to count for anything, the"
experience of the Scandinavian stocks should suffice to discredit once
"for all the persistent pretence that the ""Teutonic races"" have a faculty"
"for union denied to the Celtic, inasmuch as they, apparently the most"
"purely Teutonic of all, were even more irreconcilable, less fusible,"
than the Anglo-Saxons before the Norman Conquest and the Germans down
"till our own day, and much more mutually jealous than the quasi-Teutonic"
"provinces of the Netherlands, which, after the severance of Belgium,"
"have latterly lost their extreme repulsions, while those of Scandinavia"
"are not yet dead.[673] The explanation, of course, is not racial in any"
case; but it is for those who affirm that capacity for union is a
Teutonic gift to find a racial excuse.
"With the Reformation, though that was nowhere more clearly than in"
"Scandinavia a revolution of plunder, there began a new progress, in"
respect not of any friendliness of the Lutheran system to thought and
hereditary impurity of a guilty ancestor who had aroused the wrath of
"heaven against his posterity, much as the original sin with which Adam's"
disobedience had stained the human race was to be wiped out. The custom
observed by the votaries of Sabazius of dedicating votive hands which made
the liturgic sign of benediction with the first three fingers extended (the
_benedictio latina_ of the church) was probably taken from the ritual of
"the Semitic temples through the agency of the Jews. The initiates believed,"
"again like the Jews, that after death their good angel (_angelus bonus_)"
"would lead them to the banquet of the eternally happy, and the everlasting"
joys of these banquets were anticipated on earth by the liturgic repasts.
This celestial feast can {65} be seen in a fresco painting on the grave of
"a priest of Sabazius called Vincentius, who was buried in the Christian"
"catacomb of Prætextatus, a strange fact for which no satisfactory"
explanation has as yet been furnished. Undoubtedly he belonged to a
Jewish-pagan sect that admitted neophytes of every race to its mystic
"ceremonies. In fact, the church itself formed a kind of secret society"
"sprung from the synagogue but distinct from it, in which Gentiles and the"
Children of Israel joined in a common adoration.
"If it is a fact, then, that Judaism influenced the worship of Sabazius, it"
"is very probable that it influenced the cult of Cybele also, although in"
this case the influence cannot be discerned with the same degree of
certainty. The religion of the Great Mother did not receive rejuvenating
"germs from Palestine only, but it was greatly changed after the gods of"
more distant Persia came and joined it. In the ancient religion of the
"Achemenides, Mithra, the genius of light, was coupled with Anâhita, the"
goddess of the fertilizing waters. In Asia Minor the latter was assimilated
"with the fecund Great Mother, worshiped all over the peninsula,[32] and"
when at the end of the first century of our era the mysteries of Mithra
"spread over the Latin provinces, its votaries built their sacred crypts in"
the shadow of the temples of the _Magna Mater_.
first appearance in the gay world. He knew that it belonged to Lady
"Geraldine Romaine; and often his eyes roved round some gay assemblage,"
searching half unconsciously for a sight of her tall and graceful
"figure, and the sweet, earnest face, so different from the laughing and"
grimacing crowd in which he now moved.  Grey had not known much of
"women, so far.  His college life first, and then his roving career of"
"adventure, had hindered him from making friendships save with those of"
his own sex; and his deep love for his mother had preserved as a living
"power his chivalrous belief in women, and a resolute determination to"
"disbelieve the idle, malicious, and vicious tales he heard of them on"
"all sides.  Womanhood was sacred to him, and should be sacred to the"
world.  That was his inalienable conviction; and he had striven to be
"blind and deaf to much of what had often been passing around him, that"
"he might not sink to the level of the men he met, who would tear to"
"tatters a woman’s reputation for an evening’s pastime, or revel in every"
ugly bit of scandal or tittle-tattle that the young beaux’ valets
"learned from the lackeys of other fine folk, and retailed with additions"
"at the door of the theatre, the gates of the Park, or on the staircases"
of the fashionable houses whither their masters and mistresses flocked
"for amusement, unconscious or heedless of the gossip spread abroad about"
them by their servants at the doors.
Grey took no pleasure in the society of these fashionable dames.  His
tongue had not learned the trick of the artificial language then in
vogue.  He was disgusted by the gross flattery every lady looked to
"receive, and the lisping platitudes of the attendant beaux filled him"
with scorn.  It was small wonder that he chose rather the society of men
"of more virility and stronger fibre, such as Lord Sandford and his"
"chosen friends; for though many of them were wild young rakes, and not a"
"few had a very doubtful record, yet Grey knew little enough about that,"
"and found them not without attraction, although the higher part of his"
"nature revolted from much that he saw and heard.  Nevertheless, he"
"history as a formal discipline, for the actual writing of history,"
Croce uses the word Historiography; but in his _Teoria e Storia
"della Storiografia_ (Theory and History of the writing of History),"
"history still means both the doing and the thinking, life and the"
"consciousness of life, though not in the abstract distinction in which"
these meanings are generally apprehended. In Croce the distinction is
"also unity, and there is no doing which is not also a thinking, no life"
"which is not also the consciousness of life, no consciousness which is"
"not also the consciousness of itself. The ambiguity, some traces of"
"which could still be seen in the _Logica_, entirely disappears in this"
"fourth volume of the system, at least for the reader who has followed"
the whole development of Croce's thought.
"We call contemporary history the history that is being made, rather"
loosely including in it a more or less extended stretch of time up
to the actual present. But contemporary history rigorously ought
"to be only history in the actual making, the immediate present and"
"the consciousness of the immediate present. All history, however,"
is contemporary history in this rigorous and precise sense; it is a
"condition of all history that it should live, be present in the mind"
"of the historian; all history springs directly from present life,"
since only an interest of our present life can induce us to inquire
"into the past, which, by being made history, is no longer a past but"
"a present. If, Croce says, ""contemporaneity is not the characteristic"
"of one class of histories (as it is held to be, and with good reasons,"
"in an empirical classification), but the intrinsic character of all"
"history, the relation between history and life must be conceived of"
as a relation of unity: not certainly in the sense of an abstract
"identity, but in that of a synthetic unity, which implies both the"
"unity and the distinction of the terms. To speak of a history, of"
"which we do not possess the documents, will then seem as absurd as"
"to speak of the existence of a certain thing, of which we should at"
"fishing districts, where speculative conditions encouraged early"
"marriages and large families, the Norwegian population were better off"
than the Swedish.[705]
"Already in Malthus' youth the Norwegian-Danish policy had been altered,"
all legal and military restrictions on marriage having been withdrawn;
and he notes that fears were expressed as to the probable results. It is
one of his shortcomings to have entirely abstained from subsequent
investigation of the subject; and in his late addendum as to the state
of Sweden in 1826 he further fails to note that as a result of a
"creation there after 1803 of 6,000 new farms from land formerly waste,"
the country ceased to need to import corn and was able to export a
"surplus.[706] It still held good, however, that the Norwegian"
"population, being from persistence of prudential habit[707] much the"
"slower in its rate of increase, had the higher standard of comfort,"
despite much spread of education in Sweden.
Within the past half-century the general development of commerce and of
industry has tended broadly to equalise the condition of the
Scandinavian peoples. As late as 1835 a scarcity would suffice to drive
"the Norwegian peasantry to the old subsistence of bark bread, a ruinous"
"resort, seeing that it destroyed multitudes of trees of which the value,"
"could the timber have found a market, would have far exceeded that of a"
quantity of flour yielding much more and better food. At that period the
British market was closed by duties imposed in the interest of the
Canadian timber trade.[708] Since the establishment of British free
"trade, Norwegian timber has become a new source of wealth; and through"
this and other and earlier commercial developments prudential family
"habits were affected. Thus, whereas the population of Sweden had all but"
"doubled between 1800 and 1880, the population of Norway had grown even"
faster.[709] And whereas in 1834 the proportion of illegitimate to
legitimate births in Stockholm was 1 to 2.26[710] (one of the results of
"first entered the Duchess's drawing-room that evening, and had there"
"been introduced to his hostess, had been a sort of revelation to the"
"languid, fashionable guests assembled; sudden quick whispers were"
"exchanged--surprised glances,--how unlike he was to the general type of"
"the nervous, fagged, dyspeptic ""literary"" man!"
"And now that every one was seated at dinner, the same impression"
"remained on all,--an impression that was to some disagreeable and"
"humiliating, and that yet could not be got over,--namely, that this"
"""poet,"" whom, in a way, the Duchess and her friends had intended to"
"patronize, was distinctly superior to them all. Nature, as though proud"
"of her handiwork, proclaimed him as such,--while he, quite unconscious"
"of the effect he produced, wondered why this bevy of human beings, most"
of whom were more or less distinguished in the world of art and
"literature, had so little to say for themselves. Their conversation was"
"BANAL,--tame,--ordinary; they might have been well-behaved, elegantly"
"dressed peasants for aught they said of wise, cheerful, or witty. The"
"weather,--the parks,--the theatres,--the newest actress, and the newest"
"remedies for indigestion,--these sort of subjects were bandied about"
from one to the other with a vaguely tame persistence that was really
"irritating,--the question of remedies for indigestion seemed to hold"
"ground longest, owing to the variety of opinions expressed thereon."
"The Duchess grew more and more inwardly vexed, and her little foot beat"
"an impatient tattoo under the table, as she replied with careless"
"brevity to a few of the commonplace observations addressed to her, and"
"cast an occasional annoyed glance at her lord, M le Duc, a thin,"
"military-looking individual, with a well waxed and pointed mustache,"
whose countenance suggested an admirably executed mask. It was a face
"that said absolutely nothing,--yet beneath its cold impassiveness"
"linked the satyr-like, complex, half civilized, half brutish mind of"
"the born and bred Parisian,--the goblin-creature with whom pure"
Greeks; and the same means of communication may equally well have been
employed for the despatch of a human wife to some god. Plutarch appears
to have been actually familiar with this idea. In a passage in which
"he is attempting to vindicate the purity and goodness of the gods and,"
"it must be added withal, their aloofness from human affairs, he claims"
"that all the religious rites and means of communion are concerned, not"
"with the great gods (θεοί), but with lesser deities (δαίμονες) who"
"are of varying character, some good, others evil, and that the rites"
"also vary accordingly. “As regards the mysteries,” he says, “wherein"
are given the greatest manifestations or representations (ἐμφάσεις καὶ
"διαφάσεις) of the truth concerning ‘daemons,’ let my lips be reverently"
"sealed, as Herodotus has it”; but the wilder orgies of religion, he"
"argues, are to be set down as a means of appeasing evil ‘daemons’ and"
"of averting their wrath; the human sacrifices of old time, for example,"
"were not demanded nor accepted by gods, but were performed to satisfy"
"either the vindictive anger of cruel and tormenting ‘daemons,’ or in"
some cases “the wild and despotic passions (ἔρωτας) of ‘daemons’ who
could not and would not have carnal intercourse with carnal beings.
"Just as Heracles besieged Oechalia to win a girl, so these strong and"
"violent ‘daemons,’ demanding a human soul that is shut up within a"
"body, and being unable to have bodily intercourse therewith, bring"
"pestilences and famines upon cities and stir up wars and tumults,"
"until they get and enjoy the object of their love.” And reversely,"
"he continues, some ‘daemons’ have punished with death men who have"
forced their love upon them; and he refers to the story of a man who
violated a nymph and was found afterwards with his head severed from
his body[1464]. The whole passage betrays clearly enough what was the
popular belief which Plutarch here set himself so to explain as to
safeguard the goodness of the gods; but perhaps the end of it is the
"most significant of all. Plutarch forgets that a nymph, if she is a"
"‘daemon,’ is by his own hypothesis incapable of bodily intercourse; in"
"this case then his attempted explanation is not even logically sound,"
The margin of leisure left to a traveller in Europe for the writing of
"letters is, after all, a very narrow one, as those of my readers who"
have been abroad will readily remember. One generally moves from place
"to place in such rapid succession that the feeling of being settled,"
"which is essential to the most satisfactory writing, is almost unknown."
"Then, when one does stop for a few days in a historic city, each day"
"is so full of interest, and the golden opportunity to see its sights"
"seems so fleeting, that one hesitates to take any part of such time for"
"writing, to say nothing of the weariness and drowsiness of an evening"
that follows a day of sightseeing.
Add to this the amount of time required of one who acts as general
"director of the tour, and has to take account of all manner of business"
"details, and the number of questions to be answered when there are"
three or four young people in the party who have read just enough
general history to make their minds bristle with interrogations at
"every interesting place, and who have to be read to daily _en masse_"
on the spot in order to improve the psychological moment of excited
curiosity; add also the physician's injunction to take abundance of
"exercise in the open air, in order to the full recovery of health and"
"the laying up of strength for future work, and his earnest counsel not"
to linger much at a writing desk or a study table--and it will be seen
that if the continuity of this series of letters suffers an occasional
"break, it is but the natural result of the conditions of tourist life."

It may interest some of my younger readers to know that the member
of our party who receives the most attention is a little blue-eyed
"girl, just two years old to-day, who is the most extraordinary"
"traveller of her age that I ever saw or ever heard of, accepting all"

"than any that had been offered to us by the national rhetoricians,--a"
"collaboration which happened to take the aspect of a struggle, and"
"imposed duties antagonistic, but of the same nature--was probably the"
most usual frame of mind among the soldiers who could think; and it
"existed, subconsciously, even among the unthinking ones, provided that"
"their duties were of a definite, concrete kind, touched them in the"
"deepest chords of their beings, involved the fundamental issues of life"
"and death. To the man who consciously faces death, there is no comfort"
in wilful error; only this realization of an end that transcends all
"particular ideals, because it is the end of life itself, can be worthy"
of that price. You cannot willingly die for fourteen points any more
"than for one point, but death which is loathsome in the drama of mere"
"circumstance, however adorned with brilliant rhetoric, is no longer"
death but an act of life in the tragedy in which the hero is conscious
"of his fate. There was no war, probably, that was ever more full than"
the last one of what might be called the material of tragedy; but what
"have the official celebrators done with it, they who have not feared"
"to desecrate, in all our countries, one at least of the concrete,"
"individual tragedies, in order to make of it an empty symbol, to"
transform an unknown hero into abstract heroism? In some of Croce's
"pages, there is a more concrete realization of the ideal tragedy of"
the war than in any poem or oration that I have seen to this day.
The last years of the war found Croce at work on some of the greatest
"poetical spirits of modern Europe, Ariosto, Goethe, Corneille,"
"Shakespeare, bringing to the understanding of their work, to this task"
"of concrete history, the deep consciousness of the nature of poetry,"
"and of the relations of poetry with life, acquired in twenty years of"
philosophical meditations. Even his functions as Minister of Public
Education during the last two years did not distract him entirely from
"his studies, and this year of the sixth centenary of Dante's death"
"was celebrated by him with the publication of _La Poesia di Dante_,"
"For God's sake, let me kill them!"
Let go of me.
Don't go there!
Come back here.
It's high tide.
You'll be caught in the seaweed.
You'll be killed.
You crazy?
Don't go to the ruins.
Come back!
They were in the marshes.
They are wounded.
Let me take care of them.
- I'll look after them.
- All right.
You knew the risk you were taking bringing them here.
It's too late now.
Look after them so they can rest.
I'll speak to them afterwards.
I know you are there!
You saw them!
They can set you free if they wish.
But you're the one who has to wait!
They have to come of their own free will.
I've seen how pure they are.
How innocent they are!
"I won't intervene, but I beg you to spare them!"
So be it.
Let destiny be fulfilled!
"Don't you want to play, Madame Louise?"
Last night ended in tragedy.
- What happened?
And I'm proud of you.
All right.
And that's that.
Court dismissed.
"Well, I told you."
Keep your mouth shut or you'll be sorry.
"Jim, come here."
"Come here and let a guy talk to you, will you?"
What brought you back?
What's the difference?
"We're back, ain't we?"
"Charlie, I think you'd better go up and get fixed up."
"Go ahead, kid."
"Sit down, Jim."
Sit down.
I'm not going to ask you why you beat it.
I can guess that easy.
"Well, we'll let that go."
"I wanna ask, I want you to tell me the truth."
What's the matter?
Don't you like the way we treat you?
Don't you like us?
What is it?
Let's have it.
Give us a break.
There must be something you like to do.
Patsy wants to help you do it.
You're the mayor of this place.
You don't act like it.
"Well, I didn't ask for the job."
"Listen, kid."
I'm gonna tell you something and it's just between us.
Aren't you rushing things?
I find you irresistible.
I'll bet.
You know something?
Take off three inches of paint and you'd be quite attractive.
How do you like our country?
After tonight I'm going to become a citizen.
After tonight you'll be entitled to citizenship.
"Well, how long are you gonna be?"
Can't you see I'm busy?
Who was that?
My husband.
Your husband?
"Relax, we're not married anymore, we're just good friends."
He lives down the hall.
"Oh, come on, let's get out of here."
Where to?
I'll change my dress and I'll show you the town.
Which one?
"Oh, I don't know."
You're a better judge at that than I am.
This is my new one.
"Say, that's pretty."
I'll get into it.
I won't be a minute.
"Well, uh... take your time."
You married?
No.
Never been?
No.
How come?
I don't know.
- A real weird story.
- It makes me feel eerie.
I'm going to bed.
"Me, too."
I'm totally bushed today.
Good night.
"- Tomorrow, let's all go there and see."
- Go where?
See what?
Those two trees that committed double suicide by being struck by lightning.
Don't be stupid!
That happened a long time ago.
Those trees can't still be there.
I can't see them.
"Grandma told me they were still here, though."
Burnt trees keep standing forever because they won't rot.
There they are!
That's it!
Let's go and see.
Why don't we just look from where we are?
"I don't know why, but I'm a little scared."
"""Those two cedar trees look as if they have committed double suicide. """
"""We are two elopers."
"""Why not live next to them?"""
What are you doing?
Sorry!
I just got carried away because of the mood.
Stupid!
I'm going back!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
What's wrong?
What did you say?
!
Our squadrons are all assembled...
Huh?
Then what squadrons are those?
Did His Majesty send reinforcements?
Sion said he was putting me in charge of this!
There's no way he'd do that!
- Then...
- Don't tell me...
It's him?
That's impossible!
Crimson Fingered Claugh would ignore hostages and attack?
What do we do?
"If we lose after taking people hostage, we'll be executed!"
"No, we haven't lost yet..."
Let's kill the hostages.
I get it.
Roland doesn't think we're serious!
If we kill a hostage...
- Cease this!
- But...
You've all done well.
But this is it.
Let us release the hostages.
"But, Princess..."
I shall do all I can.
With my life alone!
You must not!
I cannot allow the Princess to die alone...
"I, too..."
"I shall accompany you, Princess!"
"Sir, get in here!"
"We have 5 deceased males and what looks to be a crude lab, all shot in the head execution style."
- Any anthrax on the scene?
- Only residue.
There's also packing and tags from 4 new backpacks.
"- All right, listen up."
- Backpacks?
They're already on the move.
We're too late.
Have you finished?
"As you said, the sun is set."
Yes.
I'd like you to meet a colleague of mine.
Dr. Reid.
- May we speak?
- Of course.
I have a little time.
That was a joke.
I have all the time.
Please.
A joke.
"- Well, we're making progress."
"- Yes, progress."
That is true.
Is there no way for this thing to end?
This Jihad?
The Jihad will end when Allah wills its end.
Then how will you know that it is Allah's will?
When the Jihad ends.
I have been lying to you.
Of course you have.
My colleague has been outside watching us as we talked on monitors.
- Who'll know?
Come on!
- A beast!
- Here I am.
"Oh, not you!"
Forget it.
- Squire?
What squire?
- You know what squire.
"Oh, my rheumatism."
That cell was so damp.
Two whole nights.
"Oh, you poor dear."
"Come, let me undress you and put you to bed."
It must have been an awful experience.
It was.
"Oh, Betty."
Your hands are so soft and warm.
"You don't really think there was a squire up here in our bed, do you?"
- Well...
- Do you?
"Come, let me take those off."
And that.
Doesn't that feel better?
"Bernard, my darling."
Come.
Citizens nobles gentry!
The king.
Me?
"Oh, yes."
"Good Sir Knight, you have proved your worth on the field of honour."
"And now you must prove yourself in mortal combat with a monster so terrifying, so awe-inspiring, so horrible so soul-destroying that even I would hesitate to meet it face to face in hand-to-hand combat."
Did that...
Did that mean something or was that just us getting caught up in the moment?
"I'm not giving you the cold shoulder,"
I just don't want us to go right back to where we were.
Then... what do you want me to do?
"Amy, I want you to figure out what's important to you."
I have.
"Maybe you haven't noticed, but I have."
So what do you want?
You're gonna have to tell me what's important to you.
Say something.
Just sit down.
They'll be fine.
"Yeah, I know."
I know.
And who do we have to thank for that?
"Hey, honey."
Good night.
"Yeah, tell me again."
Who do we have to thank?
"Yeah, Mel."
"I-no, no, no!"
"These are true ""hot shot"" type horses."
"No, you have to see them."
"Yeah, I got a client roster in my phone from last month."
Is that still up-to-date?
"Okay, good."
"Thanks for spreading the word, Scott."
"Just, just, just come up."
That's it.
"If you see them, I guarantee you'll buy a few of them."
Okay.
Chun-su!
"Chun-su, are you home?"
What's your business?
I didn't expect you here.
Where is Chus-su?
What do you want with a man in mourning?
Mourning?
Oh...
His old man was weak with asthma for a long time.
"Well, would you give him a message?"
He must pay his taxes without more ado.
Taxes?
Did you say taxes?
"You took a man and beat him to death, and you want to collect taxes?"
Are you accusing me of murder?
The whole village knows that he was dying of asthma!
What?
He died of asthma?
!
Say that again.
"Say that again, you bastard!"
I'll kill you!
I'll kill all of you and kill myself!
Chun-su!
Get out of there!
Don't aggravate a man in mourning!
Very well.
I'll go.
But he still has to pay his taxes.
If it is not receive within five days...
Get out of here this instant!
"Men, let's go."
tomorrow?
"No, it's today!"
Better call the station.
"Wait, stop!"
How will we explain this situation?
"If they find out about us, you may have to quit."
Word will spread quickly.
So only I suffer?
I guess your post is safe.
"It'll be bad for me, too."
But your wife's the daughter of the deputy director.
"You may have to get a divorce, too."
Fine.
Then you leave first.
I'll report this after you leave.
Look!
Someone was killed!
"Silly, she was just on her period."
So dark.
Apparently it was a murder.
Where?
The hotel next door.
It's a mess with police and ambulances.
Our customers can't come and go with all that tape.
"Suzuki San, could you man the front desk?"
Sure.
"Hey, you can't go in, stay back!"
"Okay, okay."
Looks awful.
Who was killed?
That streetwalker.
"A price dispute with a customer... led to the killing, apparently."
I know that crowd.
Watch out or they'll get him into trouble.
You understand?
"Tomorrow evening, you say?"
Is Biberkopf really coming with us?
Of course.
Why not?
"One bale of cheviot, 75.29."
"One half bale of worsted, 75.64."
"One bale of cheviot, 75.66."
- How many bales are missing in total?
- Just a moment.
"My wife said just yesterday, ""No one can get through that door!"""
So they came through the roof!
- The very best English cloth!
These men clearly have no sense of patriotism!
The very best English cloth!
The very best English cloth.
"I certainly hope so, or I'm conning myself."
That tickles!
No nonsense!
I'll send for my old things later.
"Mieze, come and be amazed."
What do you think?
- Very smart!
Clothes make the man.
Now it's your turn.
No!
Don't be so silly!
Business is good.
We can afford decent clothes now.
Right?

Get out!
Mrs. Brendan?
Yes.
You wanted to see me?
"Yes, I did."
"The, uh, girl said it was urgent, Mr..."
"Uh, Hoolick."
I'm Wilbur's father.
"Oh, how nice to meet you."
Do sit down.
Thank you.
I hope our keeping Wilbur here didn't inconvenience you.
"A little, but it's going to be all right."
When did you want to take him home?
"Uh, now."
"He wants power, that's different."
But you both qualify:
"same rank, seniority, service rating."
"So whoever nails that scum, will be king."
I don't mix with brass.
It's better than mixing with whores and hoods.
Times have changed.
Get yourself a new style.
You're an anomaly.
"Your men, your methods."
"In the police, now you toe the line, you snap to."
"If you don't, no one will cover for you."
All the brass have caved in.
Even you?
"Lay off me, shit!"
Who the fuck are you?
"Shit, what ya doin'?"
Who the fuck are you?
What have I done?
"Don't do that, don't!"
"Lay off Manou, or I'll stuff you with your brother's head."
Quite a shiv!
War booty.
"Creep's gotta hitchhike buck-naked, and cuffed!"
We shoulda wasted him!
Gotta be ten grand!
A year's pay for a flatfoot.
Those fuckers!
For our slush fund?
"No, it's for Manou."
Leo.
Come in.
You gotta see this.
Look at this.
This is how they're separating us.
You can control the doors from here.
Watch.
There they are.
Yeah.
They don't even care we're down here.
"Yeah, but they don't know that we know about this room."
Not yet.
"Now look, I've..."
"I've been monitoring surveillance, okay, and I think I found a way out."
Where?
"Okay, look at this."
Look at this.
You see that room right there?
"Those are, those are drainage ducts right there."
"Now, it's a tight squeeze, but I checked it out, and I think you guys can fit through it."
What do you mean you guys?
"Look, I can hide."
I'll stay here.
I'm gonna slow you down.
Connor.
"Look, it's the only way to do this, Blair."
Okay.
"You guys, you guys go out, phone for help and then,"
I'll hide down here and-
- We're not leaving you again.
I would leave me.
"No, we're staying."
How many people have they killed?
"If we leave, they get away, and they'll kill again."
Functional disorder in nature... and man.
I have to get through to people's hearts somehow.
"What is your heart telling you, Sire?"
The result of solar storm.
"Sire, all flights were cancelled."
"I know that, Carlos."
But there is a way.
What is it?
"Lili, stop it!"
I won't!
Take a look at yourself!
What is your problem?
That's a disgrace!
We have to try and be modern.
Modern?
"We are folk singers, after all."
So what?
It's the right thing to do!
"Come on, stop all that nonsense already!"
- I won't!
- What do you mean?
!
"Sire, I can't take responsibility for this mockery."
"I understand, Ludovic."
Please try to be more feminine.
That is pure madness!
"I agree, but the decision has been made."
There are no other options.
We take it or we leave it.
We can't neglect the protocol and security measures.
It's risky indeed.
There is always a risk.
- Order in the court.
- Everybody rise.
One minute with this court.
"Mr. Gargan, this has gone far enough."
Your system has blown up.
Two of your boys ran away tonight and had the gall to change their clothes in my office.
Look here.
Is that so?
"Well, sit down a minute, will you?"
- Go ahead.
Sit down.
- I'm gonna notify the board at once.
Don't do that.
You're holding up the court.
Sit down.
- You realize responsibility rests with you?
- That's all right.
Sit down for a minute.
"Go ahead, and you too."
- Have you reached a verdict?
- Yeah.
"Well, what is it?"
He's guilty.
The court says you don't get no candy bars for two weeks.
Okay.
"Sit down, will you, kid?"
"Listen, fellas."
I wanna tell you--
Hey.
Hey.
"Fellas I wanna tell you, because I think you ought to know that you've done a swell job here tonight."
You've got everything down pat.
"Come on, Marcus, you wally!"
Wait!
Wait!
Excuse me.
What is going on here?
Nothing.
Everything's under control.
I'm just his voice coach.
What are you doing here?
"I heard you were about to commit social suicide, so I dropped by."
- My accompanist left!
- Brilliant.
- You don't have to do it.
- I can't do that.
"Yeah, you can."
Just tell them:
Artistic differences.
You can't work without him.
He had a drug problem.
My mum wants me to sing it.
It'll make her happy.
"Look, mate, nothing you do can make your mum happy, all right?"
Not in the long term.
She has to do that for herself.
- Get over here right now!
"- Just bugger off, will you!"
"What I'm saying is, the important thing is to make yourself feel happy."
I've tried just making myself happy.
She's tried making herself happy.
It doesn't work.
You need other people to make you happy.
But that's just it.
The omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.
"My spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory."
Did you say omaya?
I could have sworn you said biopsy.
"Hey, I'm just messing with your head."
"Mother's maiden name, please."
"Get out of my temporal lobe, house."
Hello?
Are you awake?
They told me somebody was sick like me.
I'm up.
Your voice... aren't you my doctor?
Not anymore.
You're the guy who doesn't like cops.
Yeah.
Can you see?
You can't?
Not a thing.
You've been blind a while.
The fact that you're aware of it now... it could be a sign of improvement.
It hurts so much.
Doesn't it?
I'm okay.
It's gonna hurt.
The morphine barely takes the edge off.
"I'm gonna die, aren't I?"
"You die, I die."
It's not gonna happen.
Why not?
You're just too stubborn to die?
They took a piece of my brain.
Whatever's wrong with us... they'll find.
"- First, you can't drive."
- Why not?
You can't drive your car.
Let him get some fresh air.
You're so pretty.
The princess on the pea.
Little mouse.
But you want to sleep.
I can see how tired you are.
Yes my love.
Lullaby and goodnight
With roses bedight
With lilies o'er spread ls baby's wee bed
"Tomorrow morn, if God deems"
You will wake from your dreams
"Tomorrow morn, if God deems"
You will wake from your dreams
- Do you recognize that sound?
"- Yes, mistress."
You know how much I love to pull you up on your balls.
"Oh yes, mistress."
- Ease it a little?
"- As you wish, mistress."
Or do you beg me to pull harder?
"Harder, please, mistress."
- I can't hear your.
"- Harder, please, mistress."
- And?
"- Please, mistress."
That's better.
- After all.
"- Thank you, mistress."
"- Sailing orders, Crawford."
"- Thank you, sir."
- I report to Jarvis in Corsica?
- Correct.
With all possible speed.
Try to avoid any side issues on the way.
How's your glass?
"Your first lieutenant, Mr. Scott-Padget what do you make of him?"
- He is both efficient and keen.
"So keen, he's out with the press gang."
I hate tattling.
"No cursing his efficiency and devotion to duty, but I should warn you..."
"If you'll forgive me, sir, I'd prefer to make up my own mind."
No.
Don't!
You mustn't resist the king's pressmen.
We've only been married three days.
- You don't want him!
He's not a sailor.
- We shall teach him.
Don't take him from me.
You can't!
- I beseech you.
Have pity on us.
- Bring him along.
These men are from the Defiant.
Press gang.
- From our ship.
"- We're Navy, they can't touch us."
We'd have some explaining to do.
- Come with us.
"- You can't, he's a gentleman."
Great job.
That's all for today.
"All right, well, great."
Yeah.
How did we do?
Did we do good?
"I mean, are we gonna make it?"
"Well, you know, it's just our first session, you know."
We're not looking for an end result here.
It's not a competition.
"I get all that, but have you seen couples that are worse off than us?"
Yeah.
Or are we that far gone?
We're...
Are you gonna put a...
Like a numerical value on it?
"You know, Doc?"
Like a one to 10?
"One being worst, 10 being best?"
"No, hang on one second."
Where would you put us?
"Right where you are, sir."
"What if someone put a gun to your head right now and said,"
"""You have to answer this second or I'll shoot."
"""Are they gonna make it?"" What do you say?"
What would you say?
Whoa!
"Okay, no one has a gun to my head, Mr. Smith."
It's hypothetical.
It's not a place for inappropriate behavior.
And you definitely don't pull a hypothetical gun on your therapist.
Sorry.
You can barely hold your sword.
Then come get me.
What?
I...
Seeing that I'm a sportsman I'll give you a moment to recuperate.
They're after me.
After you?
They're after me!
Aku's got a price on my head!
Aku has a price on my head!
We are in no condition to fight.
Especially not with a pajama-wearing daisy strapped to my wrist!
- We must escape.
- Over the side!
Leave it to a lover of basket hats to jump left instead of right.
I'm having second thoughts now anyway.
We have no idea how far down...
"Great job, laddie."
- You have any idea where we are?
- No.
"So, what now, smarty-pants?"
"For the moment, we are safe from those bounty hunters."
We must find shelter before they find us.
We are defenseless in this lagoon.
Shut it!
There.
We'll be safer on land.
- Hear you!
- Blaster!
"What I do not understand is, why Aku is after you."
I have a huge price on my head.
"Oh, yeah."
- I don't think that's an actual thing.
- I don't care.
- Special occasion?
"- Yeah, it's girls' night out."
In a pub?
This pub?
"Safer if Bo's with her own kind so start us a tab, Trickster."
- One drink.
- Maybe two.
- Okay.
"That's right, champ."
Look at that.
"Not only is he dodging charges, he's gonna sue our ass."
- Never gonna happen.
Just talk.
- Yeah?
You can deduce that?
"Interesting, you haven't been deducing shit this past while."
"- Is there a problem, ma'am?"
- You.
You are a problem.
- This is your third complaint.
- Nothing new.
-It's just suspects stirring up shit.
"- No, you're losing control and it's getting in the way."
- I'll try harder.
Better than that.
"You'll report to the shrink and get shrunk, or I am chaining you to this desk."
Well done.
Now you gonna tell me what the hell's going on?
"Come on, this is lame you leaving me out."
"Man, I got the cops, and I got the Fae."
- I am needed on the quarterdeck.
- Why are you needed?
There's a sea running.
I've been listening to it.
I know that I'm right.
You always have to be right.
"So in case we have to reduce sail, may I return to the deck?"
It is my place.
And my duty.
Your first duty on leaving this cabin is to see all is well in the midshipmen's berth.
- But surely Mr. Kilpatrick...
- Will do as you tell him.
I want the boy left alone.
- He's taken more than enough.
"- You mean your son, sir?"
You know very well I do.
"I shall see to it for you, sir."
- May I now be returned to duty?
- You may.
Scott-Padget!
Why are we not under full sail?
"I judged it to be inadvisable, sir."
- Carry on working.
- What do you want?
- You.
- We need a lawyer.
- I'm not one yet.
- You've studied law.
- You can read documents for us.
- I might give advice...
- We want help with our petition.
- For redress of grievances?
- Don't say that.
"Without you, I would have no reason to live."
"But with you, I can handle anything."
I'll find Martina.
I'll get her to confess.
No matter what.
Have faith.
You'll see: we haven't lost yet.
"For the love of God, hurry up!"
I'm not risking my life for 20 Scudi.
I think I heard a woman scream.
- You hear women everywhere...
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.
"Well, I didn't hear anything, so let's go back to our quarters."
Let go of me.
"- If you scream, I'll kill you."
What did I do to you?
What do you want from me?
I know you told the judges that Beatrice paid you to let me into the castle...
Why?
It's not true.
You lied in court.
Who paid you?
"Tell me, or I'll strangle you."
"Shout if you want - you're the one they're looking for, not me."
You're finished.
All I have to do is call them.
You're right.
I'm finished.
"Thanks to you, they think I'm a murderer."
So it won't cost me anything to twist your neck!
Who paid you?
Stop!
I don't know what to do.
I don't know if I'm standing still or I'm swimming.
Swim now!
Stop!
They're torturing me!
They're playing with me!
They're slow-playing me!
Shoot them!
Swim slowly.
"Swim, swim, swim."
Save yourselves!
Go to shore!
It's too late!
They've got me!
It's only a matter of time!
"There's no sharks around you, honey."
"You're safe now, baby."
I don't know what's going through my mind!
I'd love some ice cream.
What?
"I'd love some ice cream, with maybe some pecans in it!"
Couples' massage is part of your program and so important.
"It gives you the chance to bond, relax, reconnect."
We prefer to bond on our own.
"Okay, would you prefer male or female therapists?"
"What would you recommend more for like a nurturing, pampering, motherly energy?"
"Would that be a man or a woman, do you think?"
A woman.
"Well, I'm just so tight in my shoulders."
Do you have any...
Let me see.
Where does it go?
When it leaves?
In the inverter.
Then turn on the inverter.
This is a joke for you!
"We are also someone's child, we lose our memory."
"You made these bombs, Right?"
Yes Papa I made it.
I have a diploma for making bombs.
Now you'll die with this bomb.
"Tell me, Where is the diamond?"
Why won't it blow?
"Papa, Bomb is here..."
And you're using the remote from there.
Come inside the range.
Should I press it while standing on the bomb.
What kind bomb is this?
Why won't it blow?
"Papa, Don't hit me."
"Don't doubt my talent, Bomb is fine."
I have a diploma.
Let me see the remote.
Here.
Battery is fitted wrong.
Now see how it blows...
"Now tell me, Where is the diamond?"
Chandi look at this diamond.
Our luck will also shine like this.
"After today, won't have to do this sales job."
We won't have to live in this car show room's wash room.
Won't have to listen to Laila Madam.
Let's runaway.
I know I threatened you.
"In truth, I'm so glad"
You had the courage to tell me
How their fate had changed.
Yes.
They will be together.
For many years.
"I do this not out of any malice, as you are my son,"
But to ensure peace.
"So that should you return,"
You have seared into your memory
What is yours and what is not.
my baby
wide-eyed pretty you're a body
I can hold
I'm a good man too.
"You're not a very trusting fellow, are you?"
I was a lot more trusting before you took my weapons.
You'll get those back as soon as you leave us.
They say you're a threat to the realm.
But your family wants you safe.
Alive.
Yes.
You're not thirsty?
"I have my own, thanks."
Who paid you to kill me?
The queen or my brother?

Girl:
"Oh, no."
Chad we barely go out in daylight as it is.
Come on!
I'm starting to feel like a vampire.
"- Besides, we didn't do anything wrong."
- I know.
"But Kev, I'm in this guy's sights."
"There are better options than laying low, believe me."
We can call Dan Silk.
Threaten him.
"No offense, but I don't think you could take him."
Pummeling this guy wouldn't do much for my public image.
I mean we could threaten him with legal action.
- It's true.
"- I'm a lawyer, truth is irrelevant."
I do this all the time.
"I need to make it clear, if he doesn't print a retraction, he'll face a very lengthy lawsuit."
I'll bury him in discovery and depositions.
It's Lawyering 101.
I've never seen you so...
litigious.
- Right.
- It's kind of hot.
- But no way can you call him.
- Why not?
He's not a major corporation.
He's one guy.
He's one loser.
He'll cave.
They all do.
Believe me.
No.
We just need to let it blow over.
It's alright uncle.
How many people are so duty conscious like your son?
Feel proud of him.
"Sir, you're really great."
You will catch that thief.
"Looking at the fire in you, if you catch him, he will see his worst nightmare."
You are his perfect partner.
You will catch him for sure.
He won't.
He will catch him.
He won't.
"He will catch him, you shorty."
You won't catch him.
You stupid.
"I'm telling you, he will catch him."
Why are talking nonsense?
Why are you interfering in our matters?
I am talking to my brother-in-law.
You can't catch him even if he stands in front of you.
You won't catch him.
No way.
Day after tomorrow is very auspicious.
Lets fix the engagement on that day.
No.
I've an urgent meeting on that day.
Ministers are coming from India.
Actually...
Sorry.
Don't mistake me.
This meeting was fixed a month back.
Important business deal.
We will have it next week.
You're not OK with Kat and Christian.
You're still angry.
Since when had being gay defined me?
I kind of lied before.
I do like the neurotic ones.

"Go, go, go!"
What is going on out here?
!
None of you are going to sleep until your side is spotless.
But the first-years ambushed us!
No excuses!
"And you two, don't even pretend that you've been fishing."
"Oh, um..."
"In that case, you have broken curfew."
"Put that down, pick up a mop!"
Another strike?
There'll be more.
We're one step ahead.
Particularly concerning ballet.
We would thrash you any day.
Are you threatening a ballet battle?
There's no such thing.
A hip-hop war.
Second-year crew versus the ballet tragics.
"Saturday afternoon, 12:45 at the cafe."
We're done here.
Let's bounce.
"They're well oiled, I'll give them that much."
"Oh, sorry."
How is it possible you slept through that?
Let me guess
What's the matter?
"Well, we're having a little trouble with these drills here."
- No more spares?
"- No, they're all shot too."
"Well, turn them in and get some new ones."
"Frank, these drills cost money."
- We gotta be more careful.
- Yeah?
You asked us to speed it up.
You better get some drills that will stand this gaff.
They'll stand up if they're used right.
Maybe you can use them better.
"Yeah, and so can you."
- Did you check your setting?
"- Yeah, it's all right."
That's tool steel.
You're giving her too much feed.
"Come on, boy, you're too good a guy for boners like that."
- I see that greaseball's been picking on you.
- Yeah.
How's it feel being pushed around by a honyock?
I don't like it.
I ain't gonna stand for it.
No?
"What are you gonna do, take a poke at him and lose your job?"
I'll take a poke at him and I'll get another job too.
That don't worry me none.
You were a long time getting this one.
"Weren't you, Frank?"
Yeah.
"All right, then."
Why don't you get wise to yourself?
What I did was...
By artificial means...
I set it - in a way - since I created a sunset.
In color.
"It was fun to fake it, to change its position."
By showing it has set through the colors.
Even though it's here.
What's this?
"That's part of a series, it's called ""The Last Room""."
"It's the last bed I used, in my parent's room."
"It's my last bed, at my parents'."
"The last room, to put it simply."
The last darkroom as well.
If you look closely...
The light on the body...
Isn't coming from the light source you see here.
This light is strange...
Not really...
It is artificial?
"No, it's a lamp here, on the bedside table."
"Well it's a suicidal picture, in a way..."
It's a body that is...
"Mine, I suppose."
But glorious...
And dead...
I mean...
Dead but glorious.
It's also a rather morbid picture...
So I've been told.
It's deliberately morbid.
How can it be artificial...
Since it's about death and...
So you know...?
So now what?
"The same old story, this time I am the king and you are the queen."
Now I need to decide..
..whether I should kill him to get you...
Or shall I get you and then kill him.
He will die and you will belong to me.
It was me who made the mistake.
Spare his life.
So much concern for him?
I have come back only for you.
- There is a difference.
- What's the difference?
You took a life and he gave his life to come back.
You have to also kill to get love.
I want to change this story.
You want to change it?
How will you change it?
I don't want anyone's blood on my conscience.
Blood...
Why blood?
He can fall from a tall building.
Or..
"..he could get electrocuted, while making toast."
"I promise you, I'll give you a right to choose."
And what if you can have me?
"Then you won't kill him, right?"
Yeah?
The one who had disarmed him is now his armor.
This time he won't die because of me.
"Okay, done!"
We get engaged in three days.
"Fine, okay."
What did you do yesterday?
Same.
You win or lose?
You look like you just got out of an all-night game.
"Dad, sitting second chair on this case was a really big deal for me."
Okay?
"You could just maybe, I don't know, pretend..."
Pretend to be proud.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
Or are you just taking pot shots at me because I didn't become a cop like you?
Were.
- Listen to me.
Are you proud of what you do?
"This is what you do, man."
This is...
"You know, you dig at me and you dig at my job."
And you know what?
I don't need it.
I don't want it.
I...
"I'm just gonna go, Dad."
See you.
A big winner.
Hold the avocado.
"Yes, it should be a bipartisan effort."
We have a historic opportunity here.
"We pass this bill, we have the most stringent gun regulations in the country."
We can create a real precedent.
"Look, I need you to get behind me on this."
You.
Not anybody else.
- Whoa!
Whoo!
Drink this.
Drink this.
"Now, just to be clear, these aren't steroids, right?"
"No, no, no, no."
Of course not.
These are performance-enhancing supplements.
"Okay, so how long before I start to notice something?"
This is the good stuff.
You'll feel it almost immediately.
"But I should warn you, you may experience some mood swings... some irrational thinking here and there... but it is nothing compared to the long-term effects."
- Which are what?
- You ever punched a guy so hard in the eye he swallowed it?
I'll get some water.
"- How you feel, man?"
You drunk?
- Yeah.
I'm pretty wasted.
- Great.
So what do we smash first?
- I wanna smash a crate.
"- Yeah, a crate on his back."
- Why don't you punch me?
- Punch you?
Punch you?
- What?
"I'm probably gonna get punched a lot in the tournament, right?"
- Yeah.
All right.
"- Okay, that's a good point."
- Let's punch him.
[sighs]
These civilians don't know how to drive.
They ought to be kept off the streets.
The streets belong to us professional drivers.
"Taxis, buses, trucks."
That's all that should be allowed on the streets.
"You see, I happen to know a great deal about driving."
I have a perfect safety record.
[honking horn]
"Come on, get out of the way, you bum."
[sighs]
[car doors shut]
[woman] thank you.
"Thank you, sickle."
"Well, this is a perfect test site."
Little traffic And low real estate value.
"It's adequate, I suppose."
"Ok, let's get this over with."
This thing on all right?
It's ready.
What do you want him to do this time?
I want you to climb that fire escape To the absolute top.
Wait a minute.
Uh-uh.
This is as high as I go.
You want me to break somebody's leg?
Just tell me how many pieces.
"But up there, I don't go."
- Why not?
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.
I will fall.
Seeing them.
No.
They never seem to stay dead.
How's it going over there?
"There's stuff on here, but it's password protected."
"I know, but can you open it?"
I don't know. I'm trying.
(sighs) How do we know all this mayhem hasn't already happened?
We don't.
Good.
Just keep working.
Fuck.
(sighs)
Can you just talk to me?
"Yeah, what do you wanna talk about?"
Anything.
Just regular stuff.
Like what normal people talk about.
"-Not really my strong suit, Katherine."
-l'll start.
(sighs)
How do you know I dropped out of college?
"Oh, that was just a lucky guess."
Grabbed my file or something?
-You fit a profile.
-Of what?
"Civilian broadcasters have a certain, you know, personality trait."
Keep working.
"Well, I can't work in silence, so you might as well just entertain me."
Okay.
A troubled childhood with an emphasis on extreme emotional loss or fatigue.
Death of a parent.
"Isn't that, uh, kind of inappropriate ?"
"I mean, given the sexual content of the lyrics."
"Well, it was the only song she knew all the words to."
"That and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."""
Ah.
"Well, this is really fun."
"Staying up late, eating sweets, singing songs."
It's like summer camp.
Coed summer camp with really hot camp counselors.
"No offense, Gary, but this is barely entertaining me."
"Yeah, Gary, young guy in Newport, cool job... you must have a lot of fun."
Not really.
No friends ?
No girls ?
Well... there is one girl.
"Oh, well, you only need one, as long as it's a good one."
She's an amazing one.
"Well, are you guys serious ?"
Pretty serious.
"You know, thinking about taking it to the next level."
"Oh, the next level."
That's very serious.
"Yeah, you haven't asked her out yet, have you ?"
"Not yet, no."
"Well, what's the holdup ?"
"I mean, if she's as hot as she sounds."
It's not her.
It's me.
She's a great girl.
And I'm... the ice cream guy.
"Oh, what the hell..."
we have nothing better to do.
- and you...
"- Will hate you, like I've always hated you."
"Patience, Mr. Hall."
All our teams need to act simultaneously.
I think that's a comet or something.
"It's a meteorite, in point of fact."
I was drawn to it as well.
- When can I kill him?
- We have to wait
- for the meteor to go critical.
- When's that?
When he starts the ritual in all three time periods.
"Um, we got a nuclear bomb, here."
"Professor, Jax, we need you."
"Oh, man, I forgot how much of a badass I was."
Look.
What do you mean you don't have the money?
I was going to sell a nuclear warhead and pay you out of the profit.
- Things changed.
- You expect me to just hand the meteor over for free?
"No, I expected to take it from you by force."
Ah.
Well...
I think that's our cue.
Really?
These guys again?
Now.
Keep them occupied.
You ready to show these fools what's really good?
You have no idea.
Glad we're past the point of worrying about the timeline.
Carter!
You lose me my customers.
Where else can I park?
Where the engineer's parked.
You choke us when you start it up.
We swallow fumes instead of tea.
I park right here.
You can't.
You have no right.
"It's my cafe, my territory."
You can't park your car here.
What's wrong?
Park where the engineer's parked.
What's going on?
"It's my cafe, my territory."
Leave him alone...
Mind your own business.
"I go to a lot of trouble, I work."
Serving tea isn't that tiring!
There's a difference.
My tea relaxes you.
Who takes care of me?
Are you tired?
I'm the one who's exhausted.
"I've been out harvesting in the blazing sun, in the full heat of summer."
is serving tea that tiring?
So I'm not working?
I don't make efforts?
Your work isn't all that counts.
Remember the first day that you served tea to your future husband.
You appreciated it and so did he.
Those days shouldn't be over now.
You have to remember that day for the tea...
- Yep.
Here you go.
Thanks.
It's all old folks.
Not an asshole in sight.
Should we just go?
You know...
"Hey, does ""wheat"""
"sound anything like ""sourdough""?"
"You know, put a nickel in it, honey."
Assholes trump old people.
Good amendment.
It's a living document.
Mustard dip.
Ready?
The mustard dip... a simple yet effective small-time con.
- You know the secret to making toast?
"- Pick a mark with a calm,"
- easygoing temperament.
- You toast it!
"Next, casually spill a condiment of your choosing on your unsuspecting mark."
"Here, let me give you a hand."
"Now, in one simple, fluid motion, remove your mark's jacket."
This should be done without effort or aggression.
"Finally, extract the wallet just as your partner appears to seamlessly abscond with it."
Perfect in elegance and simplicity.
This man stole my wallet!
Well done.
Whoa.
"No, he did not."
Here...
It's here.
I thought he was a cop.
He drove by a few times.
He never got out of the car.
Sorry.
I wish I could be more help.
"Yeah, well, actually, you know what, you can."
What are you doing?
"This is one of those video doorbells that record you, right?"
"Yes, it is."
Do you know how much that thing cost me?
A lot.
They're very expensive.
"But it's good for you, because then it'll confirm your story."
Thank you very much for this.
Hey.
"Honey, let's go home."
It's late.
Mm-hmm.
I'm almost finished.
I'm gonna be done in a second.
"Oh, no, you won't."
Do not tell me that you are operating on a silverfish.
"Well, it's more like a scenic journey through his digestive tract."
Okay.
I'll be in my office.
"Hold on, Angie."
Look what I found.
Oh.
"Wow, that's actually kind of beautiful."
Right?
"So, this is just the sort of saccharide most silverfish love to munch on."
"In this case, it's a highly magnified particulate of professional grade acoustic foam."
But she forgot us.
The money we had borrowed for the wedding... led us... into endless troubles.
"To help my dad,"
I started working.
Even after 2 years
We couldn't clear even a chunk of the loan.
Dealing with the money-lenders has become a struggle of our daily life.
But...
Today...
Today?
Some thugs came home... and insulted us very badly.
They said...
"If you can't repay the loan,"
Ask your daughter to...
"Unable to hear such things, my dad..."
In a haste...
He promised to clear the loan... in 2 days.
I surely know that it's not possible.
Either...
We leave the city.
Or...
My family should...
"Don't be foolish, Deepa."
Even the man with a million rupees on loan is sitting happily.
"Please, Varun!"
You could have asked me.
No.
I just felt like sharing it with you.
"So, I did."
I have some savings.
I don't have immediate expenses lined up.
I will lend it to you.
"Dropped out freshman year, but still shows up to our reunion."
What kind of loser would do that ?
We're going to find out.
"I'm serious, guys."
You're making a mistake.
"No, we're not."
"Get your hands out, Mr. Winslet."
What ?
"You didn't go to the reunion to sell insurance, did you ?"
"Yes, I did."
I told you before.
I got blood smeared.
There was smeared blood on the floor where Patrick was killed.
How much you want to bet that's our victim's blood ?
"Puts you at the scene, Dan."
Do you care to talk about that ?
I should have been part of that class.
It's all his fault.
"Freshman year, locker room."
Dansy the pansy.
Shouldn't have told Coach I blew off practice.
That'll keep you from talking !
Yeah !
Good night !
You want to know how long I was in the hospital ?
How long it took them to get that tape off me ?
Skin grafts.
I can't take off my shirt in front of anyone.
Not that I even have anyone.
- Do you blame Patrick for the life you have ?
- No.
For taking the life I could have had.
"Hey, you understand that?"
"Hey, Hayden?"
Oh.
Oh!
It's...
"It's really, really nice to you."
So this is a great restaurant.
It's got lots of health conscious options.
Great.
Cause you know uh...
I take care of myself.
As you can see.
I...
I did notice your pecs just now.
Oh.
Hey!
Are you flexing?
Gwyneth Paltrow eats here.
Really.
"We need options for something low carb low fat, low sodium, high protein."
"Which is better, the bacon cheeseburger or the other?"
Is it wild caught or farm raised?
Do you have chicken fingers?
"Organic, vegan, non soy, gluten free..."
Do you recommend the mac and cheese?
Can you steam that instead of grilling I don't want any crudamites in my food.
I'll have the crab cakes with butter sauce.
Extra butter.
Are these Swedish meatballs kosher?
"You're right, but people really are vain here."
"I mean, I'm not."
I'm self aware which is like radically different.
How'd you know?
Wait a minute.
Freeze it.
And run that guy.
What are you lookin' at?
Nothin'.
"I need the, um, name and address of anyone... that's been fired or quit our chip manufacturer in the last 30 days."
Acme?
"Yeah, that would be the name."
Do it.
Why did you tell the Indian girl to delay the revenue report?
Her name is Sarasvati.
And unfortunately we had to fix a glitch... in our asset management ratio analysis program.
Or it would have put our activity-based costing system off by three or four percent.
"Well, we wouldn't want that to happen, now would we?"
"Next time, check with me first."
"Okay, Eddie?"
"""Eddie."""
Unbelievable.
What?
This is a betting slip that guy used to pay me.
It's a winner.
It's a five-team parlay.
"- My man, you just won 2,000 bucks."
- Two thousand bucks!
Two thousand bucks!
- Nice.
- That'll teach that guy to go light on me.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Wait.
Whoa.
You think I should cash this in?
You liar!
Chick fight!
He loved me!
Get off of me!
Stop it!
Hey!
Get off her!
Get off her!
Get up.
"How'd this guy die, Doctor?"
"As I told you, when I know, you'll know."
Know faster.
Shaving off your moustache has brought back your usual impatience.
Good.
Means I'm doing my job.
I do have a potential cause of death.
But it's by no means airtight.
See this fracture?
"Well, yeah, you're pointing right at it."
"The brain revealed an epidural hematoma, verified by this CAT scan."
Though it's far from massive.
"Statistically, it's only fatal in about 17% of cases."
Blunt-force trauma?
Most likely.
"We're looking at a baseball bat or a golf club, perhaps wielded by a disgruntled fiancée."
You tell me how;
I'll figure out who.
Intelligence has placed La Grenouille in Nairobi.
That might mean a shipment to Somalia.
We'll continue to monitor these activities.
Just do your best.
Mission trouble?
Why does he have this?
He had a congenital heart defect.
An... an aortic valve stenosis.
We... we took his real heart out when he was ten.
When's the last time you updated the settings?
We haven't.
We... we can't.

Is there a problem?
We're about to find out.
Why aren't you taking me to school today?
Her lunch is in the fridge.
Something big is happening at work and I have to prepare for it.
What about my dance class?
"Oh, I'm sorry, honey."
Today's gonna be different.
Maybe we could help you?
That won't be necessary.
We're sick of doing nothing.
We're sick of being afraid all the time!
"That thing is hunting in daylight, now!"
We'll never be safe.
Just be patient.
We'll take care of it.
See?
I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings.
The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.
Can you confirm that?
Not yet.
It'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.
Alright.
"Well, in the meantime, there's another Wraith out there."
I believe Ellia may be able to help us find it.
How?
May I speak with her?
Alright.
May I join you?
"Ellia, we need your help."
You can sense the other Wraith.
It is alright.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"In fact, I have the same ability."
Really?
"I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us."
And I knew even then that you were different.
"Your father has raised you well, he has taught you right from wrong."
You are not like the other one.
I don't let him in.
"Yes, of course, I want all those things."
Then tell mary I will cause her no harm ever.
And that she will cause you no harm
By loving you.
By marrying you.
Go to her.
Marie:
But do it quickly.
I see your son's return has restored your will to live.
It's because he will live.
Your magic has changed.
How silly and marvelous.
"You don't believe in prophecies, do you?"
"No, I never did."
You're...
Marie de guise.
"Your future mother-in-law,"
If you so desire.
"If you get on your horse, and stop mary"
From making the biggest mistake of her life.
Where is she?
Heading for a church near a quarry.
The servants talked about a village
Nearly destroyed by the plague.
"Yes, I bribed them."
He may as well know
"Who I am, if we're to be kin."
I know the place.
Then hurry.
His hands on everything you want.
"Your majesty, a messenger has arrived."
He said there's news regarding the line of succession.
He was sick.
"I can only go off what I see, and I'll be honest with you, the personal stuff..."
It scares me.
- He put his dad in a chair.
- He was punished.
I'm handing you a world-class fighter with a redemption story.
The thing is he's never addressed the father thing.
What's their relationship?
"Is he helping the guy out, or has he got him stashed in some home stewing in his own shit?"
Ryan never talks about it.
It makes him look arrogant.
The timing's just not right for us.
This is the last time you'll be able to afford him.
Do you have any female fighters?
Rick:
That's right!
Don't stop running till you get to the border!
- Get out of my fucking house!
"- Hey, what happened?"
Stay out!
You made a mess!
"No, no, no."
Don't leave.
Don't leave.
You made a big mess!
Now just go!
Don't come back!
Stay out of my fucking house!
You stay the fuck out!
You tell her to stay the fuck out of here!
- [Engine turns over]
- What happened?
Maurice:
The king plans to behead her within the week.
Francesca:
He's accused you of adultery.
"Clarissa, dear, listen to me."
I'm your mother.
Let yourself be loved.
It'll take us hours to dig her a grave.
There's no one around to check us.
Catherine:
Make the blow sure and quick.
Remember I've paid you extra.
I don't want my children
To see you hacking at me.
Don't break the clasp.
I've promised this to one of my ladies.
Prawns?
My youngest daughter can't eat them.
The flowers.
"Full vases, cascading bouquets..."
Where are they?
We were told by the king to save them
For the actual day.
I need to see their placement.
What about the wine?
"100 casks, flowing freely."
The nobles will expect it.
"Yes, let them drink and swim in my blood"
And wonder who among them is next
Once that bastard sebastian takes the throne.
"Come in, please."
I'm nearly ready.
Hmm.
This one must be very good-looking for you to go to all this trouble.
I hate lipstick.
I can't stand it.
That's not a good color for you.
Did you try the samples I brought home?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.
What do you want to do for dinner?
I don't care about dinner.
I'm upset.
Can't you see that I'm upset?
How should I know?
You're always so relieved when you cancel your dates.
This is not a date.
We're just agreeing to eat at the same table.
"Then why does it matter how you look, unless you think something might happen with this one?"
"Mother, would you stop calling him ""this one."""
It sounds like you're picking out a lobster.
And nothing's going to happen.
He just likes the way I teach.
- You need more color.
- More color than this?
- Yes.
Would you sit down and let me do it?
- All right.
- Don't make me look like a clown.
- You won't look like a clown.
"Here, you have to blend."
- Where's the hairpiece?
- Here.
Do you want me to make you something before I leave?
"Instead, you'll go with Jimmy."
You come with me.
Have a good time.
Sit in the sun.
Take a couple days off.
We'll have a good time.
"When you come back, you'll go back to Karen."
"Please, there's no other way."
No divorce.
We're not animali.
No divorce.
She'll never divorce him.
"She'll kill him, but not divorce him."
You going to pay us?
Just give us the fucking money!
I can't.
I swear.
Let's go.
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
Lions?
"I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!"
Just throw him over the moat.
I'll get the money!
"They must really feed each other to the lions down there, 'cause the guy gave the money right up."
I'll get the money.
We got to spend the rest of the weekend at the track.
They mean business.
"Then, I couldn't believe what happened."
"When we got home, we were all over the newspaper."
At first I didn't even know why we got picked up.
Then I found out the guy we roughed up had a sister working as a typist for the FBI.
I couldn't believe it.
We got here early.
I know about you and the girl.
"We know, okay?"
"Now we can offer you two a way out, a way through."
"And if you do what we say, if you help us, we won't have to hurt her."
There's no need for violence.
Violence is what got us all in this place to begin with.
This is the end of violence for us.
This is a new beginning.
It's a partnership.
And it starts by you getting her to open that door.
Fuck you.
"Oh, shit."
Your leg.
"Oh, my God."
I don't even feel anything.
That's usually a bad sign.
You always know what to say to a girl.
Up.
"You have training in this kind of a thing, right?"
What?
- Field surgery?
Dressing wounds?
- Yeah.
"I mean, it's not my area of expertise but I know a little bit."
Okay.
Is all this blood normal?
"Well, you have a piece of truck in your leg."
No way is a joke gonna make me feel more comfortable in your ability to not kill me right now.
Grit your teeth.
Looks like we missed the artery.
"But it's gonna be okay, right?"
- They never caught on.
- They may.
I'd keep my mouth shut.
Why?
"We're all Americans here, aren't we?"
The Krauts have a way of getting information.
"Yeah, especially in this barracks."
- How?
- That's what we'd like to know.
There's only one pair left.
"Well, get some more."
"Say, uh, where does a fellow take a hot shower around here?"
"Hot shower, heh?"
Dig him.
Sorry.
No hot showers.
You wash in the latrine.
In a latrine!
"What did you expect, glamour boy?"
"An officers' club with a steam room and a massage, maybe?"
"Hey, just a minute."
You made cracks and I let them slide but I don't intend to take any more.
"If you resent my having money, start a revolution but get off my back."
-All your dough won't help here because here you're on your own.
No mother to throw a lifebelt.
- Now let's see how good you can swim.
"-I can swim, all right."
We own three swimming pools and a private lake.
It figures.
"Sorry, boys, my taxi's waiting."
"Cut the horseplay, Harry."
What's the matter with you guys?
"Wouldn't be fair to you, or to us either."
Slow us down to a walk and make us carry double provisions.
"Besides, it's more of a risk than I want to see you take."
"Believe me, that's my only reason for making this decision."
"If you don't like my way of doing it, do it yourself."
- You can have my share.
"- Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you?"
"Well, thank you very much."
You'll not leave this town without me.
We'll leave without you.
You'll wait here and like it.
"All right, come on."
Let's get going.
- How about the iodine and quinine?
- I'll get them.
"If that female iceberg comes out and wants to tag along, smack her down."
Wonder what's happened now.
"Oh, well."
"You know, I know a couple of people used to fool around like that... and they got children now."
"You, uh"
- You still want to go along?
"Not only do I still want to go, I am going."
"All right, come on."
Let's get going.
Come on.!
Mush!
Mush!
Come on.!
Hey!
Hey!
Come on!
Mush!
"Oh, you ungrateful child!"
You don't care about anyone but yourself!
How did you get that way?
You know what losing your father has done to me and yet you take your life and throw it around like it was worthless!
Why?
'Cause I wish I was dead.
Don't you understand that!
?
"I wish I'd died over there, Mom!"
"Well, you didn't die and I'll be damned if I'll stand around and watch you kill yourself."
Enough.
"Enough, Mom."
God.
You guys are so freaking serious.
"Hey, sorry."
- Hey.
So late.
Any word from Justin?
"- Yeah, he got arrested."
Don't ask.
He's fine.
You almost missed grilled cheese night.
"I'm sorry, I've let us all down."
They're out of grass skirts.
They just sold the last one.
These'll be great.
"Today is one of those days where everything you decide really, really, really matters."
You....need something aside from grilled cheese.
"You need someone to say, ""Congratulations!"""
What for?
Your promotion.
How did you know?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Please.
So the guy was choked to death.
"You sure, Doc?"
"Yes, absolutely."
"Not only that, it appears it was done with one hand... someone"
With a very strong right hand.
So you're saying that he was choked
By a guy using just one hand?
Yeah.
"There was severe damage to the larynx, the esophagus."
There's no doubt it was strangulation.
That doesn't make sense.
"Broad daylight, no robbery."
"And if there was an assault, why didn't the dog bark?"
I can't solve the case.
I can only tell you how the young man died.
"Not a single person heard a damn thing,"
And yet there were people all around.
"Hey, Doc."
Is it possible that... that a girl could have strangled him?
"On, the top my head I'd say no."
The hand print on his throat was too large for most women.
And I doubt if any woman would have that much strength.
Why do you ask?
"Oh, hell, I'm grasping at anything, Doc."
"I mean, he was with a girl."
It was her dog.
Must have been quite an impression.
You did research on me?
Are you following me?
That day you bought me a drink so now you want chocolates for free?
Disgusting.
You are such a big business tycoon.
- I'd think you'd be able to afford them.
- Afford?
I can even afford a car.
But then how would I enjoy this walk with you?
How will this work if you too keep quiet?
I am already the silent type.
Who comes to a party and...
Personality problem.
Mysterious smile?
And I want to make chocolates.
Have our personalities exchanged?
"You're damn strange, man."
It's hard to figure you out.
That means you are trying to figure me out.
"Actually, yes."
Yes?
I think we should do business together.
- What say?
- No.
But liquor and chocolates get along.
- They do.
- So then?
It'll be difficult to focus.
For you.
Doesn't that sound like a Hindi song?
"""A girl walking in the rain."""
"I slept pretty well, just the same."
Me too.
I missed you too.
"No, I'd love to go to lunch."
I'll meet you there just before noon.
Don't worry.
I'm OK.
I love you too.
"Damn it, Richard."
Will you sit down?
If you think on your butt like ordinary folks...
"Otis, it just doesn't make any sense."
"I mean, why would a girl like that kill her own brother?"
"Well, you're a college boy."
You tell me.
Didn't they teach you any psychology up
In that fancy school?
Sure.
I'll tell you one thing.
"In my opinion, the driver's telling the truth."
Record's spotless.
Stopped right away and he called the ambulance.
"Well, I'll go along with that."
"But, uh, might be a little more to it."
"Well, how do you figure that?"
"Well, look."
The girl's got to feel a lot of guilt
"Over the death of her old lady, right?"
Sure.
"She probably suffered severe psychological stress,"
Which may or may not have anything to do with it.
OTIS:
I'll tell you one thing.
"Whatever he did, you sure ain't copping to it."
Would you?
"Never trust a con, cowboy!"
They ain't get through life being honest.
Where they hiding you these days?
Around.
"Hey, you wanna see something?"
Look at that.
Lost them on a lady.
"Yeah, they took the big toe from the left foot and a pinky from my right."
That is why I walk with a gimp.
"Yeah, I can't shuffle cards like I used to but the ladies sure like it."
"Oh, no."
You look like you have seen a ghost.
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.
- That is why I can't get a raise.
"- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll."
You believe that?
- Why would they lie?
- They're just having a little bit of fun with you.
I'm not laughing.
"Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm."
He could have died.
That ain't my problem.
"You caused the accident, not me."
Where're you going?
"Take a leak, you wanna watch?"
"I'll be right back, don't just bail me now."
Son of a bitch.
- Hello?
Yeah.
Two this morning.
I swear those things show up every time the oil business goes bad.
-
- They gonna bring the kids in?
-
- They're thinking about it.
Don't these families have enough to worry about?
Hmm.
Coach.
Counselor.
"Don't report that, Esther."
I never do.
"""Sum"" means that we're adding."
We have at least two items.
"Don't make this hard, but what are we adding here -- protons and..."
Neutrons?
Neutrons.
Neutrons.
"So, David..."
"These protons and these neutrons, they're inside of...what?"
The nucleus?
"Well, don't say it like a question, son."
"If you think you know it, just say it like you know it."
The nucleus.
That's right -- the nucleus.
"So, congratulations."
Go home tonight and tell your parents that you figured out the mass number of an atom.
"Frank, ain't it a little late to be playing this song?"
-
- It's 8:30.
-
"Let's use the word ""alleged."""
They got photos!
They got witnesses!
"They got the ""alleged"" slut..."
Hey!
Let me tell you something.
I'm her husband first.
I don't tolerate talk like that.
"- Will, calm down."
"- You better get used to it, Will."
Especially when not even your wife will defend herself.
"Give me something, Laine."
Anything.
"Hell, just deny it."
Why don't you just deny it?
It is simply beneath my dignity.
Dignity!
Right.
We'll just have to make this all not worthwhile for Mr. Runyon.
What have you got on the distinguished gentleman from Illinois?
Some pretty good stuff.
"- S.E.C. Investigation, 1985."
- You got stocks?
I want something embarrassing!
Something sexual!
"Little boys, midgets, that sort of thing."
- Cows!
I don't give a goddamn!
"- Come on, Kermit."
"If we do that, we're no better than he is."
We are no better than he is.
There's nothing there.
Run!
The warehouse is gone.
They can't get out now
Let's retreat!
Run!
Hot?
Hot!
I don't need you to save me
You don't deserve it
Don't pretend you care
Do you think by killing me this world will be a better place?
You're too naive!
Lei
You think it's that easy to be a hero?
There'll always be another villain on the lurk
You will soon be like me
Because that's your destiny
Father
I'd like to borrow your umbrella
"Previously on ""Black Box""..."
Okay.
Not that I'm obsessed with him.
"Oh, my God!"
"It's a closed-circuit infrared 400,000-CCD-pixel resolution."
I have known Reynaud since I interned under him.
He had an undiagnosed brain tumor.
I want your advice.
"Yes, you have the surgery."
- You remove as much of the...
- What if I don't want to live?
"No, buy as much time as you can, and then you spend it with your son."
Don't fret.
I just lick the alphabet.
"A, B, C..."
"Nothing wrong with that, is there?"
"No, but..."
I thought you were thinking about me.
"I thought about a letter, then you, and then a new letter."
Don't discuss such matters with him.
I didn't say I was going to lick you.
Just licking in general.
"Of course I was going to lick you, but your name wasn't mentioned."
- All right.
- Let's go home.
Well done.
"- Hi, Mads."
"- Peter, isn't it?"
- Good game?
- Fine.
"Frank, I looked into that matter."
"Judging by what you told me,   the woman sold you that picture with intent to defraud."
The law clearly states that any transaction is invalid   if the seller had fraudulent intentions.
She knew you thought the picture was mouth and not hand-painted.
"When you reveal the fraud, the sale is invalid."
- You can demand your money back.
- I'm going to the car.
Bye.
Anyway...
"If you want to, you can sue her."
- Just say the word.
I'm off.
"- Okay, Mads."
- See you.
"Some celebration, or what?"
"It's my lucky day today, dear witch."
Let's hope it's not the last.
Now nothing can prevent her from making the right choice
Me!
Me!
Me...!
"That's fine, but your star is waning!"
Tomorrow is the third full moon.
Tomorrow is the third full moon.
I can talk and talk and nobody listens to me.
- Nobody believes me.
- Nor me.
But he brought the kerchief that I gave Henry.
How else would he have got it?
"I don't know yet, but we'll find out."
"It's not working, or something."
D'you know why?
Because you're a muddle-pate!
Let go or I'll hit you.
So how did she do it?
I don't know!
"So tell your girl-friend to show you and fast, or Elisa'll die of woe."
We want Elise to see Henry alive and stop dripping tears into the dough.
"Here you are, and make it quick."
"I went to her three times, you know what she said?"
Patience brings roses.
What would I do with roses?
Johann.
Looks nice.
"Is it noon already, Johann?"
"Not yet, but I can't wait."
"Snap your fingers, you're dead."
We see that every day.
And those people never have time to untangle the knots.
They never have time to prepare themselves.
And so?
And so... the role of the Messengers is to give those people too a chance to be reconciled.
"- ""The Messengers?"""
- Yes.
I don't understand.
There are people out there who know in advance that someone is going to die.
Let's say they...
"""got the message."""
"And in those cases, their job is to help that person depart in peace... reconcile."
"- And you're one of these ""Messengers?"""
"- Yes, I am."
- You know who's going to die?
- Yes.
- You see it?
"- Yes, I see it."
And you help them depart in peace.
"Nathan, I realize it may be hard to believe..."
But Dennis didn't depart in peace.
- No.
- Why?
We don't always succeed.
Sometimes we get there too late.
No one has power over the hour of death.
No one.
I don't believe you.
"Have it your way, Nathan."
But these things can still exist whether you believe in them or not.
I know when someone's going to die...
What Solomon?
May be I'm a schizophrenic indeed but I can still tell a dream from reality.
If you weren't such a cynic you'd tell what is real and what is not.
If you had just a bit of faith you'd find the key to your problems.
What advice can I give you?
Turn to a doctor or to a prosecutor.
I feel unwell.
A medic!
I have nightmares.
"You're too busy, King."
You should take more rest and enjoy yourself more.
Change your wives more often.
You have the same advice for every cause.
I need a real cure.
There is one effective cure from your illness.
It is a sacrifice to Moloch.
Moloch is waiting for fresh blood.
I am not a pagan.
Moloch is the only one who can help you.
Try it!
"Yes, everything has been performed and signed."
Goodbye.
Whom did you call?
Nobody.
Why aren't you sleeping?
I see Solomon and police in my dreams.
What police?
What Solomon?
You need to have a good sleep.
I'm very tired.
I'll be upstairs.
The cerebral cortex is not damaged.
Well you broadcast this alone.
Did you go crazy for her or what?
No.
I only wanted...
Sorry.
-Well not this at all.
-And why not?
"On Earth there are people of different genders, that attract each other, and they call it love."
Why don't you want to broadcast it?
Because they wouldn't understand it.
Love...
And why do you care?
We must deliver all available information.
"This information is available, but incommunicable."
-What do you suggest?
-I wouldn't like it if we caused panic on our planet.
I'll alter it a bit.
-What about this?
-Let me see.
"""On Earth there are people of different genders, that attract each other."" This is already better."
So broadcast it.
"But... ""attract each other""."
I'll omit this too.
-This is useless titillation.
-All right.
Broadcast it.
-And what about the gender?
-What about it?
"Wait, I have it!"
And this way it will be without consequences.
"""There are people on Earth."""
Right?
No.
"I'm sorry, he didn't."
May I ask... do you not speak?
He asked me not to.
"Well, that's something you should work on, along with what was going on in my, uh, waiting room."
I can refer you to somebody.
Can she access the applications?
No.
I want agents put on the people with access to the applications and reach out to anyone who remotely meets the killer's criteria.
[Cellphone beeps]
What?
I've never seen you work the field before.
It looks good on you.
We won't be able to get the admission files now.
So maybe we stop.
Maybe it's over.
That's what's wrong with you.
You don't push hard enough.
You're lucky I am in your life.
Why you?
Why bring you back?
And not someone worthwhile?
I asked that question myself.
Something about my DNA makes the process just...
Go.
And you just signed up for it.
"No, I didn't."
They just did it.
"So, it's been nearly two years."
Why are we here?
Your son Kevin was the first... only after we found the others...
We knew it was homicide.
It's...
It...
Okay.
If I rigged the lottery... lf...
If...
"If I'm so smart, why would I let this hammerhead win half the money?"
"Well, you didn't want to."
You didn't plan on it.
But you got fired.
"Well, because of her."
"Hey, there were cables on the floor."
Somebody could have gotten killed.
They were duct taped down.
Nobody was tripping on it.
Okay.
Okay.
I told you about her.
Can we focus here?
Your plan was already in motion.
"You'd put the gizmo in the microphone, but getting fired ruined everything."
They escorted you out of the studio.
They took your security pass and you couldn't get back in.
"You had a problem, Billy."
A real dilemma.
Is that right?
Yeah.
You knew the six numbers that were going to hit.
But then what?
You were locked out of the building.
You couldn't just turn the magnet off.
You knew the same numbers were going to keep coming up night after night.
"After four or five times, somebody would have noticed."
If only there were.
You'll notice the substance encrusting that rock.
Yes.
"Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate."
- So?
"- Perhaps nothing, doctor."
Perhaps everything.
Earthling!
Captain!
Who is this?
The Metron?
"This is your opponent, earthling."
I have heard every word you have said.
- All right.
What do you want?
- I weary of the chase.
Wait for me.
I shall be merciful and quick.
- Like you were at Cestus III?
- You were intruding!
You established an outpost in our space.
You butchered helpless human beings.
We destroyed invaders as I shall destroy you.
Can that be true?
Was Cestus III an intrusion on their space?
"It may well be possible, doctor."
We know very little about that section of the galaxy.
Then we could be in the wrong.
Perhaps.
That is something best decided by diplomats.
The Gorns simply might have been trying to protect themselves.
Yes.
You got any ideas?
"If you know any prayers, don't say 'em now."
They won't do you any good.
"Come on, I got some unfinished business to take care of with the warden."
Write a note.
Tell 'em we'll release you and Lang if they let us out alive.
Release 'em?
"Write 'em, we'll knock you both off in 10 minutes if they don't quit firing."
"My orders in case of riot are to keep firing, regardless of the safety of any official or guard."
Those orders will stand.
[GUNFIRE]
"Stay on the floor, and you won't get hurt."
Maybe.
[GUNFIRE]
Take that undershirt off.
We'll show 'em a white flag.
Here's a chance for you to be a hero.
Take this note over to the twine mill.
"And if you lose it, tell 'em to stop firing."
We give up.
I ain't going.
I don't wanna get killed.
"What do you wanna do, live forever?"
"Here, give it to me."
"Come on, Dale."
Open that door.
[GUNSHOTS]
[GUNFIRE]
[GUNFIRE]
Looks like they don't wanna play.
How bad are you hit?
"Oh, it's just a nick."
Often get defamed.
But I'm a minister.
If get defamed my party will be finished.
Vishwas fired a shot.
If Shiv's questioned... then me and my son will be in trouble.
The election's around the corner.
The media cannot be trusted.
Why don't you understand this?
Let's take care of Shiv permanently.
Let's burn him and bury his body.
I want to be on the top touch the sky... and you're still busy burying people.
I want to be a hit in politics not be on someone's hit-list.
- Mr. Pradhan...
- Enough.
You won't move a muscle.
I'll take care of things now.
If anyone asks say that Shiv's still being investigated.
The dog will definitely die.
But someone else will kill him.
Get it.
Let's burn him and bury his body.
Someone else.
Boss.
The inspector's here...
To inquire about Bajrang.
Go on.
Go to the dispensary.
Otherwise even the rats at home will fall sick.
Welcome Inspector.
For the first time...
an inspector's surrounded by goons.
- Boss...
But what truth?
The naked truth.
You met your brother in secret 48 hours ago!
- This is false!
- Do not deny it.
It is wiser to confess.
Mr Judge will consider it.
Do you have proof of what you just said?
Absolutely.
"This medallion, Mr judge"
You recognize it?
You authorized Dollon to keep it with him in his cell.
Why didn't we find the young man's body while his sister bears the medallion today?
It's you who gave it to me!
Do not deny it!
You lie again only to save your brother.
"You know very well that if he is found and charged with these crimes, he'll get the scaffold."
It shows a little.
Doesn't it?
"I understand that it is a concern, but do not make it an obsession."
"Turn your head, Sonia."
"No one will see it, I assure you."
Your scars are invisible.
When I think about all that happened...
Forget it.
- Let's eat.
- Sir?
- What?
- What is it?
- A lady asked for you.
- Take that.
She's waiting in the park.
Gives you height.
"Say, what all did you buy, Lottie?"
Nothing really.
[sighs] [exclaims]
"Jane, it's for you."
"On second thought, it's too young for you."
Size 10?
I don't get it.
"Well, you will."
"With this, I'm gonna lose pounds like water."
"Wait, I'll show you."
"All this wouldn't have anything to do with a certain gentleman... whose initials are ""Charles Nash""?"
Where do you get your ideas?
[grunts]
"Now, look, this is what you're supposed to do."
"You're supposed to kind of, like, lasso your feet."
Lasso your feet.
"Like that, see."
And then you pull yourself up.
You're bending your knees.
Shut up.
[snickering]
"Well, I'm glad to see you're feeling better, Mrs. Slocum."
How do you do?
May I help you up?
"Well, I'm not feeling better, I'm not well at all."
I just keep trying.
"That's why I'm here, Mrs. Slocum."
I'm gonna ask you to try to remember if there are any details that you overlooked.
"Like what, for instance?"
"Well, supposing we go through the whole thing again."
Right from the start.
Love is big gift from god.
Don't reject it.
"Sheen, don't burry your happiness."
"""It's your Vane, it's your world""."
"""I believe in your kindness""."
"""You may bend gracefully lowering the branches""."

"""Oh god, grant me your favors""."
"""Oh god, grant me your favors""."
"""Oh god, grant me your favors""."
"Rashid, go in for breakfast!"
"""Oh god, grant me your favors""."
"""Oh god, grant me your favors""."
Sheen!
"""Oh god!"""
Oh god!
Oh god!

Oh god!
Oh god!
For the...
For the first time some women in... the family has dared to run away like this.
Such a big step is impossible without the help of the household.
The cards have been printed.
What face can we show to our relatives?
How can one help abhorring these men and their religion?
A pagan would be ashamed of such villainy!
Oh lord.
Oh blessed lord.
Oh blessed lord.
What a generation of vipers do we live among!
You watch!
He'll have him tied to the back of a cart and whipped through the streets.
"I can't say how it goes in england now, but every man deserves a chance to redeem himself."
Like jacob moore.
Jacob moore sealed his fate whatever we do.
How do you plan on getting that to your captain?
You have already chanced one visit to the camp.
I have a messenger in mind.
"I tell ya, lads."
Have no fear.
"I look into the eyes of evil and I come through unscathed, right?"
All of you!
Stop your mumbling about ghosts and demons.
Get to work!
Ya see?
They don't doubt me!
"I don't doubt you eitherer, jacob."
He's been muttering all night.
Something about a man coming to set us free.
It's the fever.
It's healing.
Thank you.
Excuse me!
You're a woman.
"You have a keen eye, mister..."
- crusoe.
eh?
There am preparation to you meatballs to have dinner.
Meatballs.
"Thanks, mother."
Thanks.
I will be on time.
You have heard?
My dear mother is preparation meatballs for me to have at dinner.
I also will do them to you when we are married.
It will not be necessary.
She will do.
What?
I have not said it to you?
We wanted give a surprise
She will come to live with us.
It does not seem to you a good idea?
Clearly.
But?
you know?
"I thought that once married, we would be both single."
"Laura, here no."
You already know gossip that she is the doorman.
"We go, hide."
"-Either they come, or they come."
"she will not bother to you minimumly, on the contrary, it will help you, in house does everything."
She is insurmountable.
"Ah, yes?"
What time is it?
Four and the average one.
You want that it takes to house or to the consultation?
"But, how?"
"I have postponed all the visits, we did not have that to happen together afternoon?"
He fell off a building.
Don't you read the papers?
"Listen, Sheriff, I'm really sorry... to have awoken you from your slumber, but it's over."
Hands are tied now.
You shut me down.
Listen to me.
You're IA.
That's why I came to you.
You can do whatever you want.
"Remember you came to me, said, ""You wanna be a cop?"" I'm bein' a cop."
- I offered you a chance.
- I'm asking you for some help.
I need to do something.
I need to do this for myself.
"Listen, you deaf fuck."
I offered you a chance.
"When we could have done something, I offered you a chance to be a cop... and you blew it!"
You blew it.
You people are all the same.
"That cupcake makes a mess, we got a case again."
The mob runs millions in drugs through their precinct... and everybody gets a nice house.
Figgs is right.
The mob owns this town.
"They closed the case, Freddy."
- If they don't have the stomach for it—
- They had to.
It's circumstantial.
You don't have anything either.
All that stuff is illegal.
You stole it.
I know this guy.
He's a corrections officer.
Listen!
Dr. Kazamaki...!
Why are you so calm?
There's no sense in fighting what's necessary.
"No way is that ""necessary""!"
Did you forget something?
He said I was done...
in two seconds.
That rotten robot!
Penalty for Ms. Hitomi...
Fifteen years ago...
Thought I'd find you here...
Don't you have work to do?
This is a part of my job.
What do you mean?
"It's fine to affirm one's position... but left to your own devices, you're the type to brood, you know."
It's true that she may have been the one who changed your destiny...
"But if she hadn't come, it might have been the end for you of everything."
"You can't help worrying, suffering."
But you have many people depending on you now.
Don't forget that.
Yes...
I guess so.
"I'll kill him, I'll kill him, I'll definitely kill him!"
"I kill him, I'll kill him..."
What are they doing in there?
--Say...!
--What!
You numbskull!
What happened in there?
I won't tell!
"But, what if something terrible is happening...?"
- Right.
"Okay, well, I'm gonna go."
This is long distance.
"Yeah, it is long distance."
"So, see you."
Yeah.
See you.
Mom?
What's wrong?
I'm experiencing frustration.
At the general state of things in the world or something in particular?
What do you wear to a graduation?
- A cap and gown.
- I mean underneath.
Whatever you want.
The gown will cover it.
It's complicated.
I don't want to overdress... so I'm sweating if it's hot in the auditorium.
"But if I don't have enough on and it's cold, I'll freeze."
"It is complicated, especially if you over think it."
I need a helpful comment.
Take light layers.
Wear your turquoise-and-tan dress you just got.
It's cool and it will look good without your gown on.
Wear your turquoise sweater over it.
It will look great with the dress... and it'll keep you warm if it's cold in the auditorium.
- You are a fashion genius.
- You taught me everything.
- My brain's not working.
- You're excited.
It's a big day.
What time will you get there?
Krishna.
"Hey smarty, what if it has your name on it?"
If you write your name of this colony..
..then will this colony belong to you?
"Look mister, you dont.."
- Move on!
"Yobbo, quickly get out of here.."
..or I shall break your bones.
Hey but that trunk belongs to me.
"Look mister, this trunk is mine.."
..please give it back to me.
It contains a very precious thing which belongs to me.
I beg of you.
- Look I have gone crazy..
"But mister, listen to me.."
"Mister, give me my trunk back."
"Look, give me my trunk back."
"Hey ruffian, get the trunk."
"Come on let me see, pick up the trunk."
"I swear on God, dont worry, brother."
You have landed in the right hands.
"Hey boss, what are you doing!"
Do you wish to kill this person by hitting him so hard?
"And brother, even you should leave this place."
This fellow is a very crazy man.
But he took my trunk..
- Let the trunk go to hell.
And you get lost from here.
"Brother, this blood is more expensive than yourtrunk."
Go.
"Look mister, I have requested you a Iot."
I have even begged to you.
You've done a lot of shopping today.
"These days we're playing tag again... with the tax agents, to avoid any delays."
True.
We have to solve the problem... one way or another.
How much do we owe them?
200 million!
Is that the total?
What's our cash flow?
75 million!
I'll ask Djénéba to write a check.
"It's always better... to pay off debts to the state, so we can make projects... in the best conditions."
Put the money away!
Write a check for 125 million.
I don't have so much money in the bank.
It's not about your bank account.
Is it you who feeds him?
No use complaining.
Do as you're told.
You're unbearable.
I can't take it any longer!
Just leave if you can't take it!
"Sissoko, calm down."
What do you want me to do?
My woman treats me like a nobody.
You don't have to spit on me... every time you get into debt.
Leave me alone!
"If you don't do it, I'll beat you up."
Too much anger... for just one man.
"By God and Sinaté, I forgive you."
I've had enough.
"Here, Sinaté."
"Djénéba, give us five minutes."
Sloppy.
They must have been delighted that you showed up.
- You next.
- Me?
"Yes, yes, you."
Enlighten us.
Do.
"Um, OK."
I'm Tony Stonem.
I go to college...
I live in...
"I actually said enlighten us, don't bore us, Mr Stonem."
"Speak about yourself, about your motives, your drive, your animus."
"Don't know what animus means, do you?"
- Yes.
I know what it means.
"- Well, I'm relieved."
"You see because at this university, we don't have room for the inarticulate."
"I think I'd better go, then."
Bye.
Good.
"So Tony, you were about to tell us just how extremely clever you are."
- I'm not that clever.
"- Oh, he's clever all right."
Really?
Touching.
Sadly lacking in substance.
"At our university you have to have verve, a sense of charisma - intellectual thrust."
"And that's what we're here to do this afternoon, is find out whether you're a giver."
- Whether you're...
- Willing to sleep with the lecturers?
- I'm sorry?
Everyone has his own reasons for avoiding the authorites in their home.
"They have a very good reason, they've heroin there."
I sure wouldn't like to be in their shoes right now.
I wouldn't like it either.
What are we gonna do?
"Just leave him there, we're going to Berlin baby, aren't we?"
Sure.
We should have a wake.
There's no food.
So I go to the store and get some food.
These are no protection for aliens.
Oh!
And do you have protection for aliens?
You have a laser down in your pants?
I think I need another drink.
"Wake up, honey..."
Come on get up and take a shower.
"I feel sick, Kathy."
I know you feel sick.
You took drugs today.
No...
Come on and stand up It'll make you feel better.
Guests are already starting to arrive.
Can't miss the party.
Fuck the guests.
"You are brave, noble knight."
Why don't you go overthere and freed those two beauties from the dragon?
It's exactly what I'm gonna do.
You're going...over to the appartment?
"No the little one just went out, I want to try to warn her."
Are you serious?
Yes.
"I'll be honest with you, I did not like him."
Is something wrong with chubby and nerdy?
- I like chubby and nerdy.
- No.
That has nothing to do with it.
I was on scholars' bowl in 8th grade.
[ Laughter ] Wood:
Things were looking up.
"If these girls liked nerdy, I was in business."
This is where I'm a little bit of a Honda nerd.
"You notice, you guys, the floor back there is flat?"
It is flat.
"That was a big design point, 'cause normally, cars have the little hump."
"Yeah, there's no hump so when you're riding bitch, you're not really riding bitch."
"Oh, my gosh."
I actually never noticed that.
"So, Clark, this is your truck?"
"Yeah, this is my truck."
How did you arrive at buying a truck like this?
"I mean, I like it."
It's a Hemi.
What's a Hemi?
Hemi is the top of the...
It's a hemispherical.
The top of the valve is...
It's not flat.
"Wait, show me that again?"
The top of the...
[ Laughter ]
Let me just point out why chunky guys are great for hot girls...
"We'll always appreciate you, not like skinny dudes."
It's true.
"I may not always be truthful with anna,"
But I am always honest.
"Difficult balance, that."
One that I imagine you know all too well.
Here we are.
Mr. Brannis couldn't have gone very far
With a whole raft full of volatile technology.
Not far at all.
Mr. Brannis' symbol.
"Well, she looks to have seen better days."
It's still connected to the electric.
Someone's using it.
Do you have another one of those?
Someone's getting very confident.
Hmm.
Bingo.
Careful.
Some can be skittish.
Very well aware of that.
I remember you.
Nasty little bugger.
What does he do?
The constrictor causes
Involuntary catastrophic muscle contraction.
"Bones break, I'm afraid."
It was originally designed for back massage.
Hmm.
Right.
Let's call it in.
"Miss carter, I'm not sure you've thought this through."
I can't bloody well leave them here for someone else to find.
I'm not suggesting...
"It takes grit, resolve."
"When I look at you, Lucy, I see how smart you are and how hard you work."
I see how much you want it.
But you don't have it.
"You don't even begin to have it, and you never, ever will."
[feet shuffling]
He sent me to tell you you're fired.
"Well, not fired."
"If anyone asks, we'll say you left of your own accord."
We wish you well.
Why do you hate me so much?
"I don't hate you, Lucy."
"After tonight, I won't even remember you were here."
[sobbing]
"Uh, there were two big booms."
"Um, that's the second one."
- You can see the fire.
- Mm-hmm.
All the burning plastic coming down.
"Uh, then came the wave."
The wave that sank your boat.
Yeah.
"Now, after the first time we spoke, what happened?"
"This guy came to us-- uh, Karl Stoltz-- and he said that there was a shipment--"
- Objection.
Hearsay.
- Sustained.
The jury will disregard.
"Why are you dressed like that, Gabriel?"
"Uh, after we first talked to you about the boat, this guy Stoltz showed up to set us up on a drug deal."
- Your Honor.
- He framed us.
Drink it.
Fine.
"God, you're so bossy."
Force of habit.
I'm a nurse.
"Wait, you're that Annie?"
I'm calling my lawyer.
This is ridiculous.
I already told you everything.
"Well, You didn't tell us that your husband withdrew $10,000 three days before his death."
"Yeah, that's right, we have access to his financial records as well."
Maybe you do need to call your lawyer.
You didn't tell us about this either.
I did...
I didn't do anything.
You withheld information.
I can only think of one reason why you'd do that.
Because Troy had help ending his life.
You were there.
"Yeah, well, I wasn't there."
My husband needed me and I wasn't there.
"A few weeks before he died, he came apart."
He said he couldn't take it anymore.
He wanted it to end.
So he asked you to help him die.
"And instead of listening to what he wanted, I got angry."
And we had this huge fight.
I told him he was selfish.
Why didn't you tell us about it?
"Because I realized that he'd found someone to help him do what he wanted, someone to help him die."
And I was grateful.
I'm sorry.
"Come on, Trevor, wake up."
Preston set that up.
"Crime waves hit, property value drops."
Then Preston moves in and buys it all up for cheap.
Shut up!
"Trevor, listen to me."
He doesn't give a damn about black or white.
The only color that son of a bitch cares about is green.
"Come on, kid, you gotta believe me."
Drop the gun.
"You let her go, we can work it out."
He told me you would try to turn me.
There are no traitors!
Voicemail messages?
That's ludicrous.
That boy is mentally unstable.
He always has been.
"Clark Preston, you have the right to remain silent."
I'm innocent.
And please feel free to exercise that right.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
"If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you."
"""I'm for truth, no matter who tells it."
"I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against."""
Malcolm X.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
Emily...
I'm so sorry.
"""Out there in the field, sorry doesn't bring people back."""
Ohh.
You are bankrupt.
We're living in misery and he dishonours us.
You even sold your gold teeth.
People are laughing at us.
We were taken to the police.
"People make fun of us on the streets, in the mosques..."
"I'd give you another son right now, but it takes a real man."
I gave you a son and a daughter.
Your son didn't turn out to be a man.
"Stop this nonsense, Kezban."
God damn you...
You faggot.
He took after you.
What have you got here?
You're weak and mute.
"God, damn you!"
You have no pride.
"You have no dignity, no honour."
Look at your honour...
It's being trampled on.
You're an absolute disgrace.
It's my conscience that stops me.
Do you think I am not sad?
Traditions matter more than our conscience.
"Go ahead, hide in the barn, cover your head."
I told you when he was a little boy to get rid of the Zenne then.
You paid no heed.
God forgive us for what we've done or are about to do.
I can not act until I have concrete proof.
"We believe in the same God, Kezban."
He will whisper to me.
I wish you'd stay.
We must sink them!
Only Commander Yu Jong can issue such orders.
It will be too late if we wait for Yu Jong's orders!
"If they get away, you will be killed as well!"
Admiral Yi does not have the right of command.
He is not to take independent action.
That is the order of the King!
"Practice restraint, Admiral."
"Admiral, they have passed the big island!"
"If we don't act now, it will be too late!"
Very well.
I'll will go!
And I will assume full responsibility!
No one is to take hostile action!
What?
"Admiral, give me your command!"
Are you going to let it end like this?
Do not take action.
Your life and your men's lives are at stake.
"Admiral, we're running out of time!"
"If they pass Hando Island, they will be out of our reach."
It is high treason!
Admiral!
Go after them!
What happened?
They launched the ships.
Yi Soon-shin has taken action!
How dare he!
After them!
Don't let them get away!
Full speed ahead!
Don't let them get away!
- Hi.
- Thank you.
You'll like it.
It's nice.
Good fries.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks."
What?
This place all right?
"So, Fiona, how are you?"
"- I mean, how are you feeling?"
- My stomach's fine.
Great.
"I must still be a bit barmy, though."
"This kind of thing doesn't go away overnight, does it?"
No.
"If Mum was going to get Will to marry her, she'd have to quit making jokes like that."
At least she looked good.
I had her put on that nice hairy jumper  and the earrings she got from her friend that went to Zimbabwe.
The kid seemed to think this was some kind of date.
"As for his mum, she was clearly insane  and appeared to be wearing some kind of Yeti costume."
This had better be quick.
We were definitely not ordering starters.
"I'll start with the artichoke, please."
Then I'll have a mushroom omelet with fries and a Coke.
- I'll have the vegetable platter.
- We're vegetarians.
I'd never have guessed.
"Steak sandwich, please, mate."
Thanks.
Don't just sit there.
Talk to each other.
"- He already has, and he will gladly continue."
Get out of my house.
My house too.
No.
It was never your house.
You just lived here.
"You know, I'd like to hope that in a few months' time, we'll both have some perspective on this and be able to move somewhere, like forward."
This feels irreparable.
You accusing me of indifference?
You don't seem to be struggling.
I am.
Just not in the ways that you notice.
You need a haircut.
I know.
(DOOR CLOSES)
I'm pretty sure I'm missing a brush.
I'll bet one of those models yoinked it.
You got any plans tonight?
"Just gonna stay in, or are you going out?"
We were together for almost three years.
Do you want to come over?
We were just gonna make dinner at home.
You should come.
"No, thanks."
I don't want to be a burden.
You're not being a burden.
I couldn't tell him anything without him getting depressed and jealous.
Now he's gone.
He owes me a lot of money.
"You know, when he was writing and had no income."
Thousands of dollars.
I don't mean to bring you into it.
And why do we care if he's a deserter?
We've already talked about this.
- Hi guys.
"- Welcome, bro."
Don't call me bro.
We are now considered to be on the same team.
I'll go and think over this 5 strangers on the team business.
Enjoy your work!
What work?
"- Good morning, Uncle Metin."
- Good morning.
Can I borrow your lighter?
Perfect timing.
"Hey, we won't bring the subject up right away."
Okay?
We aren't going to mention anything about cheating or stealing.
I know the guy.
He'll start acting like a brother and will start lecturing us.
"First, we're going to go through the method of giving him a hard time."
Great.
We'll give him such a hard time that he will understand what...
- we have been through.
- Wait a minute.
Where are we going?
The road that leads to success.
Really?
"So, is this the road to success?"
We're the only ones walking this road.
Doesn't anyone know about it?
Exactly.
"See, these are your rivals."
Go and get your application form right away.
I don't know what you're doing.
"Whatever it is, I don't want to talk about it."
"For a little magazine, we have very good sources."
You want to know why?
I am relentless and driven.
I make it easier for them to tell than to resist me.
I know about the grand jury.
I know about Rick's indictment.
lndictment?
He hasn't even appeared.
- That's just what I hear.
- From who?
And you're going to print this?
I thought I should let you know.
"You're going to print an article that says Rick is going to be indicted when you haven't interviewed him, and you are not naming any sources?"
I can't.
The testimony's sealed.
You are not going to print this.
Because it's a lie.
- You know it's a lie?
- lt's a lie.
- How?
- How do you think?
He told me.
"He has done nothing wrong, and I will not be party to anything that might hurt him, not to mention protecting you in a libel suit."
Whoa.
Lily.
Ferocious in defense of her man.
I'm serious.
- And what if you're wrong about him?
- l'm not.
I'm just not.
You don't have to be on such a death-defying mission.
Not anymore...
What?
I don't want to see it happen anymore.
Don't want to see it anymore?
That's right...
Like your older brother.
"Don't look so worried, Kuya."
But...
Your brother is about to venture out into unknown technological territory.
I can understand your concern.
But a tremendous amount of money and the best brains in the world are behind this experiment.
That's right.
"Don't worry, Kuya."
"Elbow No. 1, EM level, clear."
"No. 2 and 3, clear."
No. 4 clear.
"Gravitator, active."
Unlock quadro-main capillary.
Insert reactor.
Confirm reactor load.
Result code normal.
Confirm all circuit connection.
"Dangaioh, ready to start."
Let's start the operation experiment.
Start operation experiment.
Move to start position.
Release anchor.
Release elbow lock.
There's abnormal pressure in the main converter!
Can you bypass it?
I'm trying.
Hopefully not too much to interpret.
Slept well?
For the first time since I've been here.
Good.
"Until yesterday,"
I was not permitted regular prayer.
We receive comfort from our prayers.
- We?
- Human beings.
I say something wrong?
You placed us on the same level.
- Aren't we?
"- Well, here..."
I am thought of as less than human.
"And in your Jihad, I am."
Gideon... what do you really want from me?
I already told you.
I want to understand you.
And if that is not possible?
Then that would be my loss.
It's almost time for your midday prayers.
May I return later?
- I look forward to it.
- Thank you.
Most of these tips are so new they haven't even been authenticated yet.
"Yeah, but there's nothing in the established information that's remotely helpful."
Wait a minute.
Anthrax.
- What?
- Genimmune.
A dutch biotech firm reported that they may have had a security breach
- involving anthrax last week.
So now I'm gonna take care of it!
"No, you will not."
You will have your boys sweep every room in this place.
"And you will come with me, as planned."
Find him.
You don't talk to me like that in front of my men.
"- I don't, huh?"
"- No, you don't!"
Ten years I've known Bobby!
Twice the guy saved my life.
This doesn't go unanswered!
"Drop the tough-guy shit with me, junior."
"Now, I know your story, Emil."
I know what this country did to you.
We're in this together.
So be calm.
- I'm calm.
- Good.
- I'm still gonna kill him.
- I don't have a problem with that.
But I need the president alive.
Don't forget that.
You promised me the leader of the free world.
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
We'll get him back.
"But without him, what kind of time frame we looking at?"
"We have 15 minutes to load in, then maybe another 3O or so to crack the protocols without his code."
"After that, it's on you."
- What about securing the basement?
- I brought a party favour for that.
- Good.
- Do you know you've got a bit of something right...
I haven't taken advantage of my employee benefits yet.
I'm entitled to 50 Euros worth of goods per month.
That includes former employees as well.
I looked into it.
Now's the perfect moment to start in with that.
They owe me 44 Euros and 10 cents now.
That costs 5 Euros and 90 cents?
That stuff is expensive.
Are these friends of yours?
Can't you see this has been blocked off!
?
"But it says, 'shopping free of charge' outside."
They haven't torn down the sign yet.
Please exit the building!
Why?
We want to go shopping!
This is the scene of a criminal investigation.
"It just doesn't work like that, if it's written on the sign..."
"Get out immediately, otherwise you'll be shot out by the task force."
Toni's dream
Can you help me with my tie?
What?
"My tie, I forgot how it works."
No.
Why don't you just ask Franz?
"Okay, okay."
It was just a question.
I just can't do it.
That's fine.
Would you come with me?
No.
Would you please leave me alone now?
- Jesus!
Are you sure?
Take her by car did not help.
I'll take care of it.
How will you deal?
"We will aim, Carl, until we learn."
- What can we find out?
- If you are scared.
- It's already scared.
- Can not scared enough.
"Thanks, Kate."
"Miss Keesey,"
I'm Special Agent Adam Frawley.
I deal with the bank robbery investigation.
Need to tell you we take fingerprints to eliminate them from the list of suspects.
I see that you have given us a preliminary DECLARATION.
I want to talk about your abduction.
Well.
I understood that you were threatened.
One of them stole my license management.
You tried to escape?
No.
We can identify in any way?
Do you have evidence to stand as witness?
I tried to escape because they were înarmaþi.
I understand.
Then they let you go?
"Yes, I have let you go."
You should not have a lawyer here?
"You're not charged, but anyone asks a lawyer is guilty."
- I believe that you did not need.
- Okay.
Only your gargoyles can save us now.
Are you out of your mind?
You almost killed us.
"I won't give up until I get the truth, Elisa."
The truth about you and the gargoyles.
I know you're out there!
"Oh, I know all about you."
Now show yourselves!
(door shuts)
I know.
I know.
This is where you shake your head and tell me I'm wasting my time.
They... they don't follow me everywhere I go.
Come on.
This time I'll drive.
This sounds like a stall.
What do you mean we have to wait?
We didn't get back in time.
You can't see them now.
Meet me back here ten minutes before sunset.
You won't be disappointed.
I promise.
"The rest of the day wasn't a total loss, not a by a long shot."
I have a meeting with the gargoyles tonight.
Your information was accurate.
So much for our good faith.
- Now we come to yours.
- Just tell me what I have to do.
Bring us a gargoyle.
"A few hours later, Elisa and I rendezvoused in the clock tower."
"She took me outside, but I still didn't know what to expect."
Statues?
"-Rick,you don't have to... -jody,I'm your husband."
So why didn't you tell us you knew lance corporal finn?
I s afraid that my husband would find out.
That you killed him?
I didn't kill james.
It was an accident.
"Fell,he hit his head;"
I did not kill him.
I loved him.
Swear to god.
Do you have any idea how many murderers swear to god they didn't do it?
I come from a good catholic family.
"When we swear to god,we mean it."
Room for one more?
"I haven't seen you in observation for a while,ducky."
I've learned as much as I can from the dead.
It's time to listen to theiving.
You met in a bar.
Yes.How did yoknow that?
When?
Nine months ago.
You sleep with him that night?
No!
That's right--
I forgot you're from a good catholic family.
Did you sleep with him the second night?
Your husband never knew.
"I would tell him that I had a late showing, and I'd meet james at the house on larson lane."
"I know that that sounds immoral, but it is not what you think."
"Well,let me guess."
You had a deep spiritual connection.
Exactly.
I carry them with me always.
Until tomorrow then...
My pocket sonnets are yours.
A talisman against further injury.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Good work.
Marianne.
"You covered Shakespeare, Scott, poetry."
"When you know his views on romance, you'll have nothing left to talk of."
I suppose I erred against decorum.
I should have talked of the weather.
Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.
Should I hide my regard?
- No.
But we know so little of him.
- Time does not determine intimacy.
"Seven years is too little for some, seven days is enough for others."
- Or seven hours.
In this case.
- I feel I know him already.
"Had I more shallow feelings, I could perhaps conceal them as you do."
- I'm sorry...
"- Don't trouble yourself, Marianne."
I do not understand her.
Marianne...
- Haven't you finished yet?
- No.
Patience.
You're not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?
- There is nothing under ten pence.
- Do you want us to starve?
Not your kid?
He's nearly as white as you are.
That don't prove nothing.
You're calling me a whore?
Dale...
"I was a virgin when we met, and you know it."
(BIRD SINGING)
Hear the whippoorwill?
Remember what you told me about when you hear a whippoorwill?
It means somebody's going to die.
How come we got to sit here in the dark like this?
Because I don't want to be a sitting duck if they show up out there.
I told you they won't be here until they call.
Where you going?
To get my cigarettes.
They're in my purse.
You can have one of mine.
"I smoke menthol, baby."
You know that.
I'll get them.
"I forgot that thing was even in there, baby."
Ray gave me that for protection.
I don't even know how it works.
You pull the damn trigger.
"Dale, what are you looking at me like this for?"
"What, did you think I was going to shoot you or something?"
That's crazy.
"Now can I have my cigarettes, please?"
"Can I have a light, baby?"
(WHIPPOORWILL SINGS)
So...
Does that wife of yours treat you right?
Is my husband with you?
Have you found him?
You're the only one we've found so far.
What about your husband?
I don't know.
We ran into trouble... and we lost most of our provisions crossing the river.
"The ice broke, and - and then some of our dogs died."
Two days ago my husband went out to look for food... and he hasn't come back.
Do you think he's dead?
That's a pretty good guess.
What are we gonna do with her?
What can you do?
Take her to Dawson and leave her.
"You're forgetting one thing, pal."
- Yeah?
- She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are.
And they had the map - the original one.
"You'll find my husband for me, won't you?"
There's nothing we can do.
We're a thousand miles from nowhere.
"Either the cold got him, or the wolves."
- Get on the sled.
We're taking you to Dawson.
- But you gotta help me find him.
He isn't dead.
I
- I don't believe that.
"Hey, listen, lady, in this country when a guy is gone for two days, he's gone."
I refuse to go until I definitely know about my husband.
"If you don't wanna stay and look for him, you can go without me."
No!
No!
Get rid of him.
John!
What are you doing?
"Well, this way you can have the flat all to yourself."
"John mate, please."
I've changed a lot since then.
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please!"
John!
Please!
What you've got to ask yourself is do you think I won't do it?
That's the only thing that should be on your mind just now.
Do you think that I won't do it?
All right.
"Next time we play chicken, I'll make sure the stakes are worth it."
There's some goodie bags in your room and other essentials.
"Are you gonna tell me who you are, then?"
"No, you'll have to wait until tomorrow now."
ATT:
JOHN MERCER
That one.
I've always thought scarlet suited you best.
It's red and don't be so cheeky.
I thought you'd be bursting with curiosity about the new recruit.
When do I get to meet him?
"Oh, wait, when you decide the time is right."
You know me so well.
You're not scared he'll do a runner?
"No, he's not that stupid."
"So, when do you put him to work?"
Fortunately I do happen to have a case for him.
Good.
- He's a saint.
sublime.
He'II even stay that way if you don't marry him.
"Yes, well, there's no danger of that."
The count won't divorce me.
"Since I Ieft him, he won't even allow me to see the children."
"well, now you've begun a new family."
"still, I prefer to be married."
I know you thumb your nose at all that.
It's funny.
I thought I'd die of suffocation when I was married.
Now it's my freedom that's killing me.
(baby cries)
Sophie!
"tell me, have you been invited to Angers next week?"
The Duke and Duchess d'Antan have asked us to their estate.
(baby screams)
Sophie!
Where is that wretch?
Excuse me.
Franz?
I will see you.
You're not going to Angers too?
Eugene!
A whole fortnight among some tiresome old aristocrats.
"A fortnight of free food, exquisite scenery and no bills."
And all you have to be is brilliant at dinner.
She doesn't seem bothered she's being eaten alive.
No.
"She'd probably say ""Better to feel something than nothing."""
Even if it's teeth.
(piano being played)
No.
You said he'd missed his tram.
No.
"You did, Mr Kirkby."
We had a whole conversation about it.
I might have been hallucinating.
Hallucinating?
From shellshock.
Do you suffer from shellshock?
Occasionally.
I can't let you back in.
I know.
She's stuck in there with that idiot.
I want to rescue her.
I want to run away with her.
Does SHE know that?
Probably not.
"The whole thing's been a series of half-cocked blunders, of which me shoving him in the chest and failing to give him a cactus is the last in a long line."
"Well, she's only on the first floor."
Doesn't matter what floor she's on if you can't let me back in.
"Of course, if you were to rush past me, grab a decorator's ladder and put it up against her window, there wouldn't be much I could do about it."
Wouldn't there?
I'm not very quick on my pins.
I don't have the full complement.
Caught a packet in the first lot.
Sniper.
Vimy Ridge.
"Go on, chump."
Oh...
"Can you hold the door, love?"
"On your signal, Lionel."
Have you seen a gentleman?
Push it!
No brandy!
But-- but the pain!
Maybe you'd better let your little brazilian butcher boy do it.
"You remove it, my boy."
I can't work runder these circumstances.
Forgive me.
"Well, community?"
Tonight we stuff ourselves and drink captain taylor's brandy!
Here.
Thank you.
Save your strength.
You're going to need it.
Captain taylor!
My name's crusoe.
Where'd you come from?
"I'm a castaway on this island, but I'm here to help you."
- Are you alone?
- No.
There's more than one of you?
Just.
You're an optimist.
"If I help you regain command of your ship,"
I need your word that you'll take my companion and myself off this island with you when you set sail.
"You have it, sir."
"Jacob moore, the leader of the mutineers, is as desperate a black heart as ever lived."
"A few of the men follow him through allegiance, the rest obey him simply through fear."
I'm working on a plan.
"Until I come back, you stay here."
I will return.
"Good, sir."
Is this an old cannibal trick?
- Giant oysters are the best.
- Some of them were humongous.
- Big oysters.
""" 15,000 kroner for legal assistance."" Okay."
- For what?
- That matter with the mouth painter.
- Fine.
You want the money up front?
- No.
We talked about it the locker room.
I thoroughly explained your options according to the law.
I'm afraid you're going to have to tell me again.
I didn't hear it.
- Weren't you listening?
- I didn't hear a word.
"Bloody hell, Frank."
"Casper, you were there."
I remember you standing there...
I couldn't quite concentrate because you weren't wearing any trousers.
- So...
- You're making me feel ill at ease.
There I was explaining things and you just stared at my crotch.
- You were very close to me.
- We're all guys in the locker room.
"Mads told me how to deal with the mouth painter, in the locker room."
I had his pecker in my face so I didn't hear a word.
"Oh, come on."
I quietly told you what to do...
"Save it for the locker room, please."
I'm going to take this and leave.
Nice to see you.
"- Give me the bill, Mads."
Take charge of the starboard gangway.
- Keep the prisoner below.
- Flagship's jolly boat alongside!
- Take me to the captain!
"- This way, sir."
"He came with the prize-ships, and stayed with the admiral."
- I've brought an urgent dispatch.
- Give that to me.
It's happened!
They've done it at Spithead!
The fleet mutinied!
- The Admiralty agreed to this?
"- Every item, sir."
All you asked for.
Look.
Full pardon for all those involved has been signed by His Majesty the king.
"- This changes things, don't it?"
- It changes everything.
"Well, lads, you heard the news!"
What happens to us?
"I'll go to the admiral, and I'm sure I can promise you everything you wish."
So long as I leave an orderly ship behind me.
I want all officers set free immediately!
Bring them on deck!
You can't let them go!
You're throwing it all away!
"Jenkins, release the midshipmen!"
- Release the officers.
- Release the officers.
"Please come on deck, sir."
- What happened?
- Mutiny's over.
"There are also ballerinas because in the ballet when a soldier dies from his body emerges his soul, his ghost, and that's a ballerina."
"Long tutu, white like the ""willis"" in ""Giselle"", classical, but with blood stain, red."
That's lovely.
- Yes.
- Alicia's loving it.
"Lovely, because from death emerges life."
- From the male emerges the female.
- Of course.
From the earth emerges...
The...
The... tree?
No.
From the earth emerges...
The... flowers?
No.
The ethereal.
"The ethereal, the impalpable, the ghostly."
Of course.
And I've got the music.
By Penderecki.
"It's for the victims of Hiroshima, World War II, but no matter."
Of course not.
And anyway Alicia remembers it perfectly.
That's the music for the battle.
It's brutal.
"And for the music for the deaths, I've got a masterpiece that you're going to hear right now."
You're going to flip out.
Take care.
"You take care too, Katerina."
Though you look gorgeous.
"""Trenches"" must be made."
And I shall.
Good!
Your minds has also sharpened up along with your body.
"So partner, why did you want to see me?"
I need a house.
Are you looking to buy one?
"No, want to rent one."
So what is the problem?
- Nobody wants to give it to a bachelor.
And I can't call my sister here until I have a house.
Don't worry!
Call your sisters!
How can I call them till I have a house!
Don't worry about that!
I have a lady friend too!
What family were you talking about?
He is a bachelor!
Why?
I am there!
These days even two men can start a family!
"Stay within your limits, Johnny!"
Just kidding!
He has got two lovely sisters.
They will come and stay with him.
You can lord over them!
They will help you in your housework too!
How much is the rent?
"3,000 rupees, no security because Johnny has brought you here."
But I will take three months advance.
My tenants will vacate the room in 15 days.
But you need to pay the advance now.
His sisters will be here in 15 days.
He will give you the advance then and you hand us the keys at the same time.
I feel good.
I feel normal.
Okay.
"Stand up, slowly."
Are you ready to play?
Isn't this the Harlech Shadow house?
It's part of the estate.
"The gamekeeper's lodge, actually."
"But, yeah, this was the model."
The layout was replicated for the game and the texture scanned.
Wow!
"Very, very cool."
"So what's the game, what do I do?"
You don't have to do anything.
"You just stay in here alone, see how long you last until you're too scared to continue."
"So all I have to do is, like, stay here?"
And I get paid for that?
"I'll be back in the control room, watching."
"There are cameras all over, so no stealing the silverware."
And now there's this.
- And what's this?
- It's an earpiece.
Oh!
"Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I will be in contact the whole time."
"Oh, cool."
"And I can, like, talk to you, and you'll hear it?"
"Great, that's great."
"Now, nothing you'll see can physically harm you."
"It's all just audio-visual, like the gopher game."
"Oh, okay."
"But if it does get too intense, we can pull you out at any time"
- and stop the experiment.
That's all right.
"It's just that I've broken down just down the road and, well, wouldn't you know it, the bloody mobile."
Would you mind if I borrowed your phone to call the AA?
Erm...you'll have to tell me where I am.
Of course.
Come inside.
Thank you.
You're an absolute angel.
Last number to call the house and last number dialled.
How was she?
What's that mean?
Did she seem suspicious or anything?
?
A bit trusting.
"I wouldn't let anybody into my house, whatever their sob story."
That's cos you're a hardfaced bitch.
Sorry.
While you steal credit cards from lonely and vulnerable women.
Just a moment of madness?
"No, that was just a cheap whore in a bar."
"Well, don't be too hard on yourself."
"It had been a while, hadn't it?"
Which showed.
"Sorry, guys."
"I'd advise you two to get a room, but it seems you already have."
"Shut up, Calum."
Now sit nice and try not to lick the windows.
Hello?
Is that the Long Bay Hotel?
"Can you put me through to Iain Risdale, please?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that's him."
I'm out of it.
- I can get us past the lock.
- So can I.
After me.
Whoa!
- Bluestone!
- Help!
(crash)
(groans)
Now that's what I call an entrance.
Who's there?
What is this?
I want answers!
"So do we, gargoyle."
So do we.
(banging)
- Why didn't you use the key I gave you?
- I lost it on the way down!
Why didn't you warn me about that blasted chute?
Any advance hesitation on your part might have made the gargoyle suspicious.
But you played your part well.
Now the fun begins.
(Malone) Welcome to the Hotel Cabal.
(Matt) That brings us to where we left off.
It's going to be a bumpy night.
I'm sure you've noticed by now this is no ordinary hotel.
The Cabal is designed to decimate one's grip on reality.
"Once your defenses are down, we step in and strip your mind of its most precious memories and darkest secrets."
"By the time a guest leaves here, he's little more than a mindless cretin."
Funny how the least little thing sets him off.
I know what you're thinking - open window.
Too good to be true.
What's the deputy head like?
"Teaches natural history, very good teacher."
He kicked up a bit of a fuss and then said:
Can't you hold on for the last few days?
Do you like any of the girls in the class?
I've only been in this class for a year.
- Only a year?
- l was in another class.
And in that class?
Do you like going to the cinema?
Not really.
"They're showing the BlackTulip, everyone's been... lt's excellent."
Aren't you going to see it?
I don't know.
Would you like to go?
"Well, I... I'd like to."
Today it's on at half past three.
"Calmly, that's the Reverie."
That's a strange Reverie.
Will you ask your parents or shall we go without permission?
I can say I'm going to the cinema.
They'll let me go.
Won't they object to you going with a girl?
"I'll say we're going with the class, after all, we do that."
So we'll meet and go.
Where shall we meet?
I don't know.
That'll do...
That's the Reverie.
Won't it be awkward if we go to the cinema?
Won't some girl be jealous?
It'd be my first time like that.
And here we go.
We loosen our arms And up and down and up and...
Sir.
Excuse me.
"Import, export."
Let's go.
Mr. Vanyerka?
-Doctor Yansky?
-Yes.
What would you like?
You're not going to invite us in?
Of course.
Please.
You were chosen by the biggest computer in the galaxy to be the representative of the planet.
Congratulations.
We came to accumulate objective systematical information.
About the conditions on Earth.
This is a confidential mission.
You understand?
"Calm down, please."
Part of our project is to be inconspicuous.
"But if you really arrived from outer space, you would look completely different."
Like what?
For example like green elves or something like that.
We don't like doing this.
Every change of appearance exhausts us.
Doesn't it?
Then we must rest for a long time.
Now do you believe us?
"Excuse me, but why me?"
Why only me?
How can I be beneficial to you?
I beg your pardon?
Hear our prayers ...
- Where's the lunatic?
- There he is!
- Grab him!
- Seize that lunatic!
- We take care of this.
"- Come with us, madman."
What are you doing?
Benito!
Motherfuckers!
What kind of a joke is this?
Get in!
"Let's go, we saved him!"
- Benito!
- Call me Ben!
I'll fail them!
I'll fail them all.
They're expelled... all of them!
UNDER SHEETS WITH THE DOCTOR
-You erase the slate please
-Immediately
Today we will examine the corpse of a man passed away by peritonitis.
"Pair to see better, you lower to the first rows."
"I see many new faces, students of first course,"
"I go especially to them, if you have never seen a corpse you are not impressed, a corpse is only a person who does not move."
We begin our class of anatomy macrocospic...
We can begin by...
"Well, we can begin our class of anatomy macrocospic."
You take notes.
What is that?
"Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair."
But I can barely see without these.
- Come on.
"- Well, these were expensive."
Let's start the bidding.
So you didn't think this was a date?
"No, not really."
Why?
Is it a date?
I thought it was a date.
"No, it's not a date."
- What about the regards?
- Regards don't mean anything.
"I mean, it's not like I said hi."
"I mean, the fact is I shouldn't say anything."
"- No, tell me."
- Can you keep a secret?
- Me?
"Oh, yeah."
I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick.
But he was so brave and gained such a wonderful perspective on life.
I fell in love with him.
"Yeah, he's got some perspective there."
"- Hey, you know what the whip does?"
- What whip?
The whip in the Senate and the House.
"Well, in the old days when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted them to, they whipped them."
"""You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble."""
"She won't talk to anyone, huh?"
"Oh, no, she won't say a word to anybody."
"Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack."
"Well, well, the white whale."
[indistinct shouting]
Tony!
He's in some kind of a room.
Like a hospital.
With machines and instruments and things.
"Oh, that's easy."
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.
While we going around looking for a fight.
Come on.
[victor] you will now function exclusively under control.
You will no longer think independently.
All thinking and reasoning will be done
By the voice that commands you.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Tony.
- Where are you from?
Witch mountain.
Sounds like some hick town to me.
How did you suspend Mr. Sickle in mid-air?
By energizing matter.
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow?
"Yes, sir."
- How did you learn to do this?
- I was born with the ability.
I wish to see a demonstration of molecular flow.
You are strapped to the table.
Unbuckle yourself and sit up.
Power has come into our hands
Which is centuries before its time.
We must use it wisely.
"they keep asking about you, what you know."
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
I know where the Ark is Marion.
The Ark is here?
Well I'm coming with you Jones!
"Get me out of here, Cut me loose!"
You can't leave me here!
If I take you out of here now they will start combing the place for us.
Jones you got to get me out of here!
Are you crazy?
You know that I hate to do this.
"You just Sit still, keep quiet."
This whole thing is going to be shut.
I'll be back to get you.
That's it.
"Who knows, perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some anti chamber for us to discover."
Perhaps it's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
"She was in possession of the original piece for years, she may know much if properly motivated."
I tell you the girl knows nothing.
I'm surprised to find you squeamish that is not your reputation.
"But it needn't concern you, I have the perfect man for this kind of work."
Heil Hitler.
Indy!
Here!
We hit stone!
Clear it off.
Come on find the edges.
"Good, good, good."
You see Indy?
We know that you were his dealer.
Okay.
I think we're done here.
I don't know anything about drugs.
"And just so we're super clear on that,"
I'm gonna go call my lawyer.
Thanks.
"Okay, you do that."
"You call your lawyer, and he'll get you out in no time."
But that's when I get started.
What is that supposed to mean?
I'll be all over you.
"Whatever you do, buy, sell, I'll be watching you."
That's actually called harassment.
It is.
It's called harassment.
"You really want to do that to your business, Jake?"
"Look, we're just after whoever actually killed Aldo Clemens."
My hunch is killing isn't exactly your thing.
"Answer some questions, I'll be out of your life."
I might have known this guy.
"If I did,"
I would have dropped him as a client months ago.
He run out of money?
No.
They always find the money.
Aldo... had become a risk.
"Some guy was following him, so I cut him off."
Who was following Aldo?
You got a name?
I can't even tell you what he looked like.
He was some guy in a crappy car.
Completely destroyed!
This concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career.
"Now, thanks to you, I am the laughingstock of the entire kingdom!"
But it wasn't her fault...
"Uh, well, first, uh, the shark chased us."
"Yeah, yeah."
And we tried to...
"but we couldn't, and he... [growls] And..."
And we...
Whoa!
[Sighs] And then we were safe.
"But then this seagull came, and it was, ""This is this..."""
Seagull?
- [Gasps]
- What?
Oh!
"You went up to the surface again, didn't you?"
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.
"Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?"
"You could have been seen by one of those barbarians, by one of those humans!"
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.
Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.
"Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady!"
"As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!"
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!
And I am never... never to hear of you going to the surface again!
Is that clear?
I don't think they allow tourists.
Exactly.
This isn't one of those tourist traps from the guide books.
Hola.
They don't allow talking on the floor.
You'll see why.
The lector kept the workers educated and entertained.
"Nowadays, most factories outside Cuba use iPods, but these guys still use the real thing."
I want to show you the storage room.
It's been around since the '20s.
After you.
- Go ahead.
- I insist.
Simon!
Simon?
We have to go... now.
Here we are again... another end.
When will I see you again?
"I need to go home for a few days, take care of some... loose ends."
But soon.
I got you a gift.
"It's nothing fancy, but it's a little more portable than a steamer trunk."
I love it.
"I finally did open that trunk when we got to London, by the way."
"My imagination had built the contents up so much, I-- my curiosity just got the better of me."
And?
What was inside?
Clothes.
"Not guns, not knives... clothes."
You were protected by your parents' love.
Love makes us do remarkable things.
"Oh, wait."
"Kitty, you are going out with a very dynamic man."
"Dynamic isn't some sort of code word for deranged, is it?"
"God, no."
"You told me you wanted handsome, and I went above and beyond on this one."
"Oh, absolutely beautiful."
"Well, why does she get to wear black?"
She's a woman of a certain age and it's classic.
- Earrings are wrong.
- What's wrong with pearls?
"Nothing, if you want to remind him of his grandmother."
Diamonds.
- Where are your diamonds?
- Is this too much?
That's the one.
And for the final touch?
A gift for both of you.
- Chicken cutlets?
- They're boobs.
They're boobs.
No.
I'm personally very happy with my body the way it is.
"Well, that's very progressive of you."
But you pay me to tell it like I see it.
I see you both need help in this department.
- What was wrong with Kleenex?
"- They're lumpy, and these?"
These are light and comfortable and they have just the right amount of jiggle.
"See, I'm wearing them right now."
Would you like to feel?
"- Oh, no, no."
I'm good.
"- No, thanks."
Goodnight.
So you can move your cloud?
You can control it.
"No, no-one can control clouds, that would be silly."
"The wind, a little bit."
She's following us!
That's the idea.
Keep her away from the snow.
So.
"Barmaid or governess, which is it?"
"That thing is after us, and you want a chat?"
"Well, we can't chat after we've been horribly killed, can we?"
How did we get up so high so quick?
"Clever staircase, it's taller on the inside!"
"What am I standing on, what's this made of?"
Super-dense water vapour.
"Should keep her trapped, for the moment."
So you actually live up here?
"On a cloud, in a box?"
"I have done, for a long time."
"Blimey, you really know how to sulk."
I'm not sulking!
You live in a box!
That's no more a box than you are a governess.
"Oh, spoken like a man!"
You're the same as all the rest.
"Sweet little Clara, works at the Rose And Crown, ideas above her station!"
"For your information,"
"I'm not sweet on the inside, and I'm certainly not... little."
It's called the TARDIS.
It can travel anywhere in time and space.
And it's mine.
"Captain, I see something."
Cover.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Lock on transporters.
Beam us up.
"Captain, we're coming under attack."
Unidentified ship quartering in.
We can't beam you up.
I've just rigged up defensive screens.
Keep those screens up.
Fire all phasers.
"Firing phasers, captain."
The alien has screens up too.
Take all action necessary to protect the ship.
We'll hold out here.
"Are you under attack, captain?"
- We could drop screens.
- Keep those screens up.
Worry about us when the ship is safe.
Kirk out.
"If they lower those screens to beam us up, they'll be open to phaser attack."
"We're hopelessly outnumbered here, captain."
Those disrupters versus our hand phasers...
"We're stuck with it, Mr. Spock."
We'll have to make do with what we've got.
"Kelowitz, Lang, flank out."
Lay down fire on coordinates Mr. Spock gave you.
Even if you don't see them.
Keep your heads down.
Helpless down here.
And the Enterprise...
"Sulu is an experienced combat officer, captain."
I'll just hold it.
Do I need to remind you how lucky we are that they're not pressing charges?
"Oh, come on, it was just a joke."
A joke?
"Yes, I didn't think it would be taken this seriously."
"Dad, humor's very subjective, okay?"
"I mean, we're talking multiple levels of interpretation here."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Okay, well, how exactly am I supposed to interpret the stolen prison transport van, huh?"
We filled the tank!
Move!
It's not just this.
"Although, a restraining order is a new low that I didn't think that you would reach quite this soon."
It's everything on top of it.
"The completely bizarre behavior, the late nights coming home, having to beg Mr. Harris for you to make up that chemistry test that you missed."
I missed a chemistry test?
"Really, Scott?"
Really?
I have to ground you.
I am grounding you.
You are grounded.
What about work?
Fine...
Other than work.
And no TV.
The TV's broken.
Then no computer.
I need the computer for school.
"Then no, uh... no Stiles."
What... no Stiles?
No Stiles!
We need to show them an example.
An example?
"Yes, and we don't need many."
One should be enough.
Do you understand what I am talking about?
"Sir, you have to leave us with something to live on before you collect the tax."
Please don't be so cruel.
"Boy, there's not getting through to you!"
So what are you saying?
Are you not going to pay your taxes?
"We would if we could, but we can't afford to."
Don't you realize tax evasion is a serious crime?
Don't waste my time!
Please!
What are you waiting for?
Take the salt and load it up!
No!
You might as well be telling us to die!
Step aside?
"No, you'll have to kill me first?"
How are you interfere with government business!
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him!
"No, Father?"
Or they'll take you to.
Father!
Father!
Father!
"Chun-su's, Father?"
"What do you mean, Mother?"
"I don't know why, but I'm told they were arrested and badly punished by the officials."
It looked like he was unconscious when I saw him.
"Oh, okay, fine!"
"Well, then why don't we wait closer to the exit?"
"Because if it looks like we planned our escape, they'll know it was a setup, and Mike dies."
W-what if we die?
!
"I mean, has anyone thought about that?"
!
"Yes, which is why you need to stop talking!"
"Just get ready, 'cause at any moment, they're gonna show --"
They're in the warehouse!
"Schmidt, get out here!"
They caught us by surprise!
Can we leave now?
!
"Dude, if we're gonna sell this, you got to put up a fight, okay?"
Which means you need to shoot at them.
Shoot at them with your gun!
"Yeah, I think they bought it."
There's too many of them!
Let's get out of here!
"Go, go!"
"Spies will use whatever they can to get behind enemy lines -- stealth, deception, and even capture."
"A prisoner of war can learn about enemy morale, supply, and location."
"Of course, the first thing you have to do is convince your enemies you're worth more alive than dead."
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I'm unarmed.
Hey!
Someone's here!
What is this?
Who are you?
!
- This is natural.
A projection.
Your mind fights against itself as it attempts to expunge the pain and grief you carry inside.
You have internalized society's rules and limits.
"In order for you to achieve your desires, we must first strip away the guilt and shame and outdated mores that have taken residency within your very flesh and bones."
- Yes.
I think I understand.
- Good.
I trust the... increased dosage is agreeable?
- I feel wonderful.
I feel...
liberated.
- Then we're ready for the next stage of your treatment.
- When do we start?
- We start now.
# You are going away #
"- You look quite festive, by the way."
"Darling, doesn't she look festive?"
"Just delightful, you are."
- Mr. Baxter?
"- Ah, Roderick."
Hello.
Are you visiting someone?
"- Uh, yes, my sister Isabel."
She's convalescing.
- Yes.
"Well, good day, Roderick."
Great to see you.
"Come, my love."
- Is this your daughter?
"- No, this is my wife, Mrs. Baxter."
You haven't met?
-Not noodles.
Why me?
Why only me?
Why only me?
Why only...
What is it?
-A soft-boiled egg.
-It has a great shape.
"A civilization that can produce such a perfect thing,"
- is a very advanced civilization.
"-This is not produced,"
-hens lay these.
-Hens?
-Yes.
Tell them we congratulate them.
"Excuse me, but according to the program we have an opinion poll."
Do you want help?
You're not going to eat?
"No, don't worry."
We have our own methods.
Good afternoon.
How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations?
I would kick them in the arse!
"Look, I'm not intrerested in politics."
"At work I'm doing my job, I adorn windows."
I want my own peace.
Good afternoon.How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
Pidlivization?
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial pidlivization?
Civilization.
It depends on where they came from.
Good afternoon.
- It's good to get out.
It was hot.
- I didn't notice it but I suppose I would if I'd been drinking as many beers as you have.
Thanks for reminding me.
Let's get some.
- Why don't you have an ice cream soda?
"- Oh, no."
Do you have to wake up with a hangover?
- Come on.
Let's go into Nick's.
- All right.
"Well, kids, how do you like the moving picture tonight?"
- It was grand.
"- Kind of sappy, if you ask me."
Sure.
Too much love stuff.
Is not for me.
"I like the racketeer pictures, boy."
"You know, shoot them up."
Is more excitement as love.
"Why, Nick, where's the romance in your soul?"
"Where is the what, please?"
Romance.
"You know, two people falling in love and sitting in the moonlight gazing into each other's eyes."
"Well, I like this too but I like better to do it myself, personal than to see some guy in the movies do it."
"Huh, kid?"
I don't care what they say.
I think that love story was beautiful tonight.
It's a lot of bunk.
No real man would ever propose like that.
"- Oh, they don't."
- You don't have to look at a girl and tell her eyes are like the twinkling stars.
The druids supposedly hid
From encroaching romans in underground
Caves that were used for worship.
"Alright, why don't you head back to the hotel."
Stay out of sight.
We'll keep in touch.
"Okay, see you guys later."
(mace:) nothing.
Keep trying.
I'm certain he knows.
Da veiga just arrived.
Da veiga has arrived.
He's called the high council into session.
What the hell is he up to?
(da veiga:)so I come with
"The offer of a trade,"
Following the finest traditions of our order.
My son's life...
For that which you seek.
Fabrice da veiga.
Once the most esteemed brother
Of the gural nataz.
"Now, a man who's reputation"
And even loyalty is in question.
"For no good reason, I assure you."
But to show my trust in the
Chairman's wisdom and mercy...
I have brought the dagger and scabbard.
I have new information for the council.
He is working with sydney fox.
The agent who recovered the case
Saw it for himself.
It seemed like the perfect opportunity to show him the concivilized and educational events
ZBZ's gonna be hosting this semester.
It's gonna buy us a little good-will.
It's what good leaders do.
We are so screwed.
What are we going to do?
This's a total nightmare.
"Don't panic, I'll figure something out."
Wait!
- I need to buy your expertise.
- Plan B.
"Not yet, that's way too dressed"
"Find out where the dean lives, get about 10 gallons of gas."
"Wait, where's dean..."
Bowman!
I was looking for the punch.
It's right over there.
Do you want me to get you some?
"That's fine, I'm fully capable."
Thank you.
"Then I'd like to get myself a tour of the house, if it's alright?"
Of course!
I told the girls I'd step down as sorority's president if we got caught.
- I have my stun gun upstairs.
- You know what?
I'll handle it.
Make sure
Bowman and Lizzi stay away from the basement door.
- What you gonna do?
- I'm gonna be a sorority's president.
"Ladies, we have an emergency."
I need 8 quadro in formation
"Sisters, you're about to make urgent use of your rush rotation skills."
We have an unexpected visitor in our mix namely dean Bowman.
"Our mission is to keep him occupied, failure is not an option."
Are you with me?
Good!
Let's move out!
Are you guys coming back?
Incredible!
And then what happened?
- I graduated from highschool.
- Highschool?
That's facinating!
"- And, then what?"
- I went to college.
So... so do you live around here?
"Dean Bowman, can I tell you what a privilege it is to have you at your party?"
What a great tie!
So?
Are you really thinking of joining the Kappa Taus?
I haven't decided yet.
What do you think about it?
You see how much fun we can have.
- I know you love strip clubs.
- Boobs.
You don't think it wouldn't be awkward though?
"- I mean, if we're dating other people."
- Doesn't have to be.
"You should meet Greg, I really think you'd like him."
"Yeah, it'll be a little awkward."
I don't want to change your mind or anything.
I really miss hanging out with you.
Me too.
Never mind.
"I've never even met you, never fucking heard of you, but I know your kind."
You're the spawning infestation of micro-cocked little bitch bloggers who take shots at people who are out there actually doing real shit.
"Nobody likes you, bro."
You're a fucking zero.
You have no friends.
"Jesus Christ, himself, wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire while holding the virgin Mary."
"Keep up the good work, player."
Have a nice day.
"Yours in perpetuity""..."
Didn't even know you knew that word...
"""Alvey 'your king' Kalina."""
"Alvey Kalina, maker of men, father of three, and business owner."
I was drunk.
"Yeah, you're one of those, too."
Nobody reads that jerk-off.
They do now.
This went viral.
There are lists and comments.
"""He's come unhinged."""
"""Fucking nuts."""
You made Mario Goldsmith relevant.
[Laptop lid thuds]
"Know your enemy, tough guy."
The enemy is you.
How much weight are you gonna lose?
"Um, like 30 pounds."
- Are you starving?
- I could eat.
You're a masochist.
"Yeah, and you're..."
- You're the other one.
I know your apartments are above the offices.
Maybe you still have a room there?
I would like to stay in the place during the night.
Thank you.
Say.
Does your servant live here?
"No, he is married and has children."
He goes home.
"If that's what you want to know, we'll be three in the apartment."
Sir?
Forgive me.
Thank you.
"Philippe, I no longer need you."
You can withdraw.
I really doubt something will happen.
Individuals who threaten us will surely be wary.
I guess that they already know you spend the night here.
My presence here won't prevent them from acting.
I hope that my room will please you.
"I'm sure, but..."
I'm sorry to put you out of your own room.
I did rearrange it with great care.
That I do not doubt.
"My partner got the ceiling and floor screwed, very complicated works, because the room, which was in good condition, was not to his taste."
"It is in a room that one passes half his life, doesn't it?"
It's late.
We will accompany you.
I know the way.
I insist.
"If you need something, I'm in the room in front of yours."
Thank you.
Everything is perfect.
You're thankful.
"If house would have pointed at you instead of me, you'd be the one in here."
"Look straight forward, tell me when you can see... it's your job to go back!"
You're a doctor!
You go where the disease is!
Say when you can see the light.
"I'm dying, and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?"
Tell me when you can see the light!
My vision's fine!
Your left-side periphery is reduced.
"It's fine, I'll prove it."
Ow!
Son of a bitch!
Now we're both exposed.
You got two choices.
"You can go tell house what just happened and get your own cot board in here, or you can go back to that apartment... you save me, the cop, and yourself."
It's not sspe.
I checked your past vaccinations against joe'S.
No batch matches.
Blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?
"Guys, could you please shut him up?"
He's over his limit on morphine.
Where's cameron?
She said she has some stuff to do.
Said she'd be back soon.
What are you doing?
Foreman!
Stop!
I can't take it!
Imagine being constantly reminded of the... pain you're about to be in.
I can't take it!
Stop it!
"Of course, Madame."
He loves me and I will give him the attention and affection that he needs.
Of course.
"Your Majesty must be tired, after such a long journey."
"Tired, yet reinvigorated."
"When I last saw you, Sire, you seemed..."
Lost?
"Now, I am found."
I want you to organize a banquet for this evening.
Send out invitations.
The entire court will attend.
"A fine idea, Sire."
"But first, tell me news."
All that has happened in my absence.
Hide nothing.
And your husband?
He grows sicker by the day.
The last few weeks are the worst.
It is too late to regret what you have done.
I regret nothing.
"But I will live the rest of my life, a murderer."
No.
You will live the rest of your life as a woman who defended herself.
Go.
The prodigal brother is returned.
"I understand you made a fine monarch, in my absence."
"I did my best but of course, I could not fill your shoes."
"Anyway, I thank you for your efforts."
You drove a good bargain and we now have a foothold in India.
All for the sake of France.
How was the war?
Exhilarating?
I'm confident that there's no depravity
That brand-new e.
Braun sheets can't erase.
How many problems does Jenny have to cause
Before you realize she's the problem?
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me here.
The library started Did you apply for a documentary internship in Haiti?
Yeah.
The producer just called.
I...
I got the job.
When were you planning on telling me about this?
"This morning,"
"And then you put internships on the ""do not discuss"" list,"
And I panicked.
Why?
Why?
This is not about competing for something.
This is-this is about our relationship.
"But both of those have been so tied up in each other,"
"And this job is a huge deal for me, Dan."
But you can't pretend like you going away for three months
Is not gonna affect us.
I think I didn't wanna face that.
It was just so much easier when we were just friends
And we could talk about things.
"All right, is-is that what you want, then?"
You wanna go back to just friends?
I don't know.
¶
Do you honestly think the other factions will stand for this?
Because you're so popular?
Get her out of here.
"When that message gets out, it'll be the end."
What message?
You'll see.
I'm gonna put it on every monitor in the city.
WOMAN ON RECORDING:
We have separated you from the rest of us.
And we created factions to ensure peace.
The time has come to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us.
We've allowed you to believe that you're the last of us.
But you're not.
"If you're watching this now, then at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded."
"Mankind waits for you, with hope, beyond the wall."
(MUSIC PLAYING)
These will be the Divergent.
They are the true purpose of this experiment.
They are vital to humanity's survival.
You did it.
- Yeah.
-Yeah.
Everyone's staring at me.
You changed everything.
(SIGHS) What now?
Only one way to find out.
You ready?
It's been over 200 years.
Who knows what's out there?
You'll never find out.
(GUNSHOT)
I don't know.
Perhaps a little.
"Dear, why don't you go up and change so we can have dinner?"
"Oh, that's a good idea."
I'll wash and then we'll eat.
"Oh, hey."
"Will you stay for dinner, Sam?"
"Well, I was."
"Thank you, John."
That'd be nice.
Didn't you tell him I was coming to dinner?
"Doctor, it was his idea to invite you tonight."
I reminded him just this morning.
I can hardly believe it.
"Why, his memory is phenomenal."
How long has he been like this?
It's been months.
"I kept trying to get him to see you, but he wouldn't."
"I begged him to take it easy, retire, but he just goes into a rage."
"What's wrong with him, Doctor?"
"Well, it certainly can't be anything physical."
I gave him a thorough checkup only a few weeks ago.
Would you object to having a specialist examine him?
A specialist?
What do you mean?
I mean a psychiatrist.
You don't think he's...
"Now, now, now, don't jump to conclusions."
It may be nothing more than just mental fatigue.
But I do think you should take him to see Dr. Croatman as soon as possible.
"Now, there, there, there."
Good morning.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy, with a hook, and he lived in a mirror."
"And if you even looked at him, you'd wake up in a bathtub full of ice, with your kidneys gone."
Whoa.
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- What?
"- You name the terms, I name the place."
"OK, fine!"
Where we gonna do this?
Castle Duloc?
"Ha, ha, very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived.
Ja!
Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost.
"If you're all too scared to put on big boy pants and go in,"
I'll just claim my winnings and be on my way.
"Now, wait a minute!"
We can last in there just as long as you can.
Fine.
Come on then.
"Hold up, Shrek."
"You can't just go barging into some creepy, spookyjoint like you own the place."
And why not?
It's not like there's anyone here to stop us.
"I still don't know about this, man."
I'm getting a whole creepy House of wax vibe going on in here.
"Look, it's that little thingy you love so much, remember?"
Welcome to Duloc
It's a creepy town
What was once pristine Now is all rundown
Stop!
"Don't stop us, Admiral!"
If we are criminals of treason what does that make our men?
We are not treasonous rebels!
Kill them!
Kill them!
"What are you waiting for, Admiral?"
Arrest these men now!
"Admiral, what do we have to lose at this point?"
Let us slay these men and change this world!
What?
Or I will slay these men and take my own life!
Admiral!
Very well.
I will slay these men and march to the capital!
Admiral!
Put down your swords!
"Are you intent on becoming a traitor, Admiral?"
A traitor?
Did you say a traitor?
The Japanese killed your father and took your mother.
Is that correct?
Admiral...
Your sister hung herself after being raped by an enemy soldier.
Isn't that right?
"Yes, Admiral!"
Chun Woo-song!
This man's infant son starved to death next to his mother.
Do you know why?
Because the Japanese killed his mother by cutting off her breasts!
Now do you understand?
This is why we can't stop fighting.
"- All right, guvnor."
I don't know the exact position of the troops... but in Ballantine's pocket there's a paper with all the troop movements in it.
"- You're sure of that, Sergeant?"
"- As sure as taxes, guvnor."
- I wouldn't fool you.
- I hope not.
"If you have, there'll be worse than lashes."
Please don't lash me any more.
I'll relieve you of these.
Cut him down.
"""Sgt. Thomas Ballantine hereby reenlists."""

- I'll pay you back with horrible interest!
- I command you to shut up!
"Tell your men to lay down their arms and get out of here, or you're a dead kipper."
Lay down your arms and leave.
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Not to freedom.
- We'll see about that.
Ready?
- Right.
"- Sgt. Cutter, guard that door."
- Right.
"Mac, take your coat."
Right.
Get up.
It's young Toad Face blazing up the Thugs.
I'll start with him first.
"No, you won't."
Striking lack of empathy or compassion for other people.

"You know, I didn't always do this."
This is my first station assignment.
I was on the other end of the numbers.
Looking at nine million black-book tax dollars.
Recruited me straight out of college.
Said it was the best opportunity I'd ever have.
"Told me I'd do special things, important things."
"Well, you're worth more than what some bureaucrat wrote down on a piece of paper 20 years ago."
All they're really talking about is what's real.
Reality.
They know how to use it.
They're good at it.
Why not quit?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I knew a guy once, and he decided he wanted to quit."
"He squirreled away money for about 20 years and he opened up a bar and wanted to create a new life, and he survived about 37 months."
They killed him?
"No, I did."
See if you can get into those files.
Emerson gets here.
Get off me!
Get the fuck off!
Get it off me!
- How much longer?
- Little while still.
"Go on, David, tell her to come out."
Tell her to come out right now!
Fuck you!
- You know.
- Are you kidding me?
You know what?
"Forget it, okay?"
I'm gonna do this by myself.
"I'm gonna go find some classy, sophisticated people who can hold their booze, who don't talk about their bleached assholes, and who aren't obsessed with poop."
"Okay, bring me up to speed here, boys."
This is an interesting piece.
I love his use of space.
The space... that's what I loved about it.
What do you think the chunky earth tones represent?
"Look at the rich texture, the dimensions."
It's almost as if you can smell it.
"Oh, God..."
This is the piece I was telling you about.
"It's unbelievable... and so raw, so base, so utterly human."
It's almost as if it exploded out of the artist.
Well...
I think it's crap.
Crap...
Crap...
Crap...
Crap...
You know what?
"Guys, let's just wrap up the evidence and start again fresh tomorrow."
"You think they'll keep, or should we put them in the fridge?"
They'll keep fine.
You know what?
"You guys win, all right?"
Are you happy?
Win what?
Heart failure!
Fly low.
Understood.
Transform.
Clear the museum of civilians.
Please evacuate in an orderly passion.
These humans did not respond.
"Well, I don't think we should worry too much about them, partner."
We need to move the planters to create a fire block.
But I...
That would destroy the harmonious nature of the plaza's design.
What?
"Nice of you to show up, Dani!"
Could've been here sooner if my ride wasn't stuck in neutral.
Next time I'm walking.
Looks like a short started the fire.
But this should hold for a while.
Cyber wires are too much for these old circuits.
I have to insist the good thing nobody got hurt.
- I didn't tell it to do that.
- I wouldn't complain.
Your robot was still in rescue mode.
"You gave him the directives to save lives, so it did."
"You're welcome, Graham."
- Where are you going?
- I need some space.
Chief said there is a bunker below street level.
Really I get something called...
the cold war.
"Apparently, we're getting some space too."
Wait for me!
I still don't get it.
How did Cade's robot know that...
"He hit me with rod, non-stop hitting..."
He hit from the left and then from the right...
He wanted to use a pair of swords to kill me.
I haven't seen these evidence before.
They are our new discoveries.
"To kill a person, why should he bring along so many weapons?"
That strongly proved that he was well-planned to kill Chun.
He even wanted to kill innocent citizen.
"Even though, he didn't mind to die with all."
Bull shit!
You creeper!
"You are framing me, you will die a dog's death!"
Bastard!
You will go to hell!
"Your Honour, I request to charge Foon with some more charges... threatening judiciary officer, contempt of court, bodily injury, and throw rubbish in public place."
Chan Mon-gut.
"I didn't do it, I didn't do it."
Don't lose your mind.
Why did you throw my shoe away?
Give me back my shoe.
Take this first.
Super swords!
Capital Chopper!
I smell something weird.
What's this?
Cat's stool.
Why are you that hungry?
It may be very important clues.
"Brother Lone, what made you think so?"
Because of my name.
I made many clues.
How about that shoe?
When is a man safe from such wit.
if infirmity does not protect him?
If he is infirm.
then I am at death's door.
- He complained of rheumatism.
"- ""A slight ache"" was his phrase."
Edward said he would bring it himself.
"""It gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its owner."""
"""Business prevents my delivering it, which will hurt me more than you."""
"""Memories of your kindness must sustain me."
And I remain -
"- Your devoted servant, E.C. Ferrars."""
- Why hasn't he come?
"- He says he's busy, dear."
- He said he'd come.
Why hasn't he?
- I'm taking you for a walk.
- It is going to rain.
- It is not going to rain.
I fear Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.
- You must miss him.
Elinor.
"- We are not engaged, Mamma."
"- But he loves you, dearest."
- I am by no means assured of that.
"And had he such a preference, there would certainly be obstacles -"
- To his marrying a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar.
- But your heart must tell you...
- It is better to use one's head.
- It can't be good for me.
- It is.
Stop complaining.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
Not me.
You.
Island Hoppers is going to sponsor you in the Iron Man.
"Oh, no."
No way.
A person's gotta be crazy to enter that event.
Mm-hmm.
That makes you the perfect candidate.
"Besides, look at the difference in our bodies."
"I mean, I'm all shiny, muscle and power."
But you...
you got the legs to win it.
That's right!
And I intend to keep them.
"I mean, think about this, T.C."
"Swimming, running a marathon and then bicycling a hundred miles."
All right.
"What-What-What about all this """" I owe you one, T.C.""?"
When does that get paid?
"Well, that's different."
"I mean, that's entirely different."
Vouchers.
What about vouchers?
"Vouchers for... for gas, vouchers for air time, vouchers for this, vouchers for that."
When are you gonna take care of that?
"I'd do it, T.C. I really would, but, see, I'm on a case with Barbara here."
Ah.
"Now, I've had occasion during the past 24 hours to scrutinize the body in question."
- Mediocre reflexes...
- Mediocre?
Average motor skills...
Sure...
But this is not the most important thing in life.
What is most important in life?
To live in harmony with yourself and feel free.
We seem to have problems with that.
You're wrong.
This is the first place I have felt truly free.
"You're joking, aren't you?"
No.
You only value what you lose forever.
We have lost the illusion of freedom.
But we were never free in reality.
We had some troubles and communal inconveniences.
Freedom is the ability not to depend on circumstances.
It is the ability to think.
It is victory over your fears.
Do you ever feel fear?
Sometimes.
Freedom has nothing to do with bars and locks.
Somebody gave an order to do away with me.
Who did it?
My business partner?
He has been dreaming of getting rid of me for a long time.
Sell the control package of shares.
The Americans are offering great money for it.
Sell your shares to me.
I'll buy them.
May be it was Marmazin?
He is an oil-trader.
He is an authority.
"- Hey, bro!"
- He feeds the cops from his hand.
"If you're worried about Neil falling in love with someone the way I fell in love with you, that's like worrying about being struck by lightning."
Hey.
I know what he has.
You don't have to worry.
Okay?
Got everything?
Any sign of technology will throw off our theme.
"Yes, I figured that out when I tried to make a phone call."
Details are important.
"Well, it's where the devil lies... in the details."
"- So, we done here?"
- Not quite.
I believe you owe me a document.
The Bastion contract with my forged signature.
Not just yet.
You do like to play hardball.
"You'll get your contract as soon as the party's over,"
"Bastion is in the clear, and we go our separate ways."
"Oh, are we breaking up?"
"If I'd have known, I would have insisted on being your date tonight."
Break up sex is the best kind.
Not for business partners.
"Is that all I am to you, Neil?"
After all this time?
Yes.
- Honey?
- In here.
You look...
Wow.
"Here, let me help you with that."
I'm a little nervous.
Jeremy should be here any minute.
The cops find it and the bastard gets it back.
In tip-top shape.
"He drives off happy as a clam, whistling away only what he doesn't know is we've fiddled with his car."
Unscrewed the front wheel.
Is just hanging on by a thread and not for long...
One day he's driving down a nice straight road going over a hundred smoking a manly cigarette a Marlboro...
"Then, all of a sudden..."
off comes the wheel...
How's that grab you?
Right on a curve...
Trees all over!
Absolutely!
The bastard asked for it!
You must be tired...
Why don't you sit down?
Since we'll probably never see you again we'd like to ask you for a favor.
Come on...
I'll be late to work.
"Well, les hear it..."
We'd like to touch you for good luck.
"OK, but make it quick!"
I don't want any trouble at work.
I never heard about is being so lucky...
Sure it is!
Touching something dirty brings good luck.
Like stepping in shit.
You bastards!
"Sure you're in the right place, Sonny?"
Got one for me?
Got a nice trim there around the ears...
Watch out or I'll trim yours!
Saturday haircut day?
Perhaps he began to hit the bottle?
It's all right if you don't want to tell.
"Oh, my God..."
"Nina, is that you?"
- Hi.
"- Oh, howdy!"
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.
I just dropped by to...
Why not?
You're still the master of the house.
"We have no masters here anymore, we had done away with masters back in 1917, so..."
"- Look, you goat."
- I beg your pardon?
"I mean, have you no conscience?"
Conscience?
No conscience.
"That's why you walk and whistle, lost your cap and don't give a thistle."
"You know, I've never understood those metaphors of yours."
"So you, the bandit, don't give a damn about your daughter, right?"
This is too serious a subject.
We'd better leave it for later.
"For now, let me take some things that are precious to me."
So you've come for precious things!
Not in the sense you mean.
Precious in the spiritual sense of the word.
- You'll do without.
- What do you mean?
Come when Nina's here.
You mean when the she-goat's here?
"Please don't misunderstand me, but if, as you put it, I'm a goat, then, naturally, my wife is a she-goat."
Oh boy!
Let's give it another 15 seconds.
"Doyou want to sit down... together sometime, like with coffee or something?"
Yeah.
"Well, if you everfeel too old to drive, just call that number."
I can't hear you!
- Is she of color?
- And do you love me?
No.
But she's a woman.
Even though I am sometimes irritating?
And a little bit selfish!
"Oh, her."
Even when I forget to ask you how your day was?
"Yeah, okay."
Didn't we already show a local person this year?
I don't think she's ready.
Let's go to slides.
I really do love you-
"All right, what we need to ask ourselves... about each one of these is:"
"Could this have been made in any era, or only now?"
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.
"Okay, what does this tell us about digital culture?"
I don't think this tells us anything about digital culture.
I think you're right.
Let me guess.
This one's about AIDS.
"Yeah, it's not really on the theme, right?"
And we already have photography.
"You know, we have those photos and e-mails."
E-mail wouldn't even exist if it weren't for AIDS.
Fear of contamination.
I think I will have to strangle them first.
That takes too much energy.
Just push them off from somewhere high.
What about you?
I hate autographs of people who have nothing but money.
"He says he's busy, and he won't even give me time to interview him."
All the data I have is 200 pages of blabber full of spelling mistakes.
He makes it so obvious that he's ignorant.
And I'm just a con girl making 800 pages from it.
It's so annoying.
And depressing.
You should write your stuff now.
I don't think I ever will.
I messed it all up from re-writing.
I can't even write 3 lines in an hour.
I can only write cheap lines.
I can't do it.
Don't do anything for 3 years.
It will come back.
Sounds great!
What am I going to eat?
Tap water and air?
I'll feed you.
I don't have talent anyways.
I'm just going to make a living.
How can you win twice without talent?
There are plenty of writers who win that contest and have nothing to write.
"Anyways, I'm a writer too."
That's how I get paid more for re-writing.
It's ridiculous.
"Oh yeah, I got a new client yesterday, so I paid aunt back."
Ain't I great?
"Here's the thing, you need to protect your family."
OK ?
"Policies start at $250,000."
We offer term or whole life.
You really can't go wrong.
"Think about it, Sally."
"People don't plan to fail, but they do fail to plan."
It's great to see you.
"Sir, may I talk with you for a minute ?"
"Yeah, officer."
What can I do you for ?
You lost your name tag.
I didn't go to this school.
So you go to reunions for the sheer fun of it ?
What is that ?
What is that ?
"Oh, it's a mortality clock."
It shows you how many seconds you have left on this Earth.
"You factor in age, habits, height and weight, and statistics tell the rest."
But the class of '90's going to start dropping around 2055.
So you sell life insurance at the reunion ?
It's a perfect place.
People are all focused on their fading youth.
"I know, it's sleazy, but it's working."
I go to class reunions all over the state.
Our detective said he saw you talking to the victim's wife.
I was consoling her.
How are you holding up ?
Patrick was taken much too soon.
"Jennie, yeah, I wanted to see how she was doing."
I met her when I sold her a policy.
- She bought a policy ?
"That isn't the case here, is it, Mr. Morris?"
Or were you even aware it was going on?
"Uh, we live on a ranch, so Georgie does chores."
"In fact, we all do chores."
She happens to love being out with the horses before school in the morning.
It's part of her routine and we couldn't stop her if we tried.
So I would hardly call it hard labour.
That's insulting.
"No one's accusing you of anything, Mr. Morris."
These are standard questions for clarification.
"Right, well, I don't think you'd have to ask these questions if you'd done any homework and found out anything about us."
How can you take these complaints at face value like this?
Honestly.
It's ridiculous.
I've done everything that's required of me.
Let's get the next one ready for the shoot.
Whoa!
Settle down there.
Whoa...
- All right.
- That's it.
- How many is this?
- Five more to go.
Whoa... there.
Thanks for keeping him calm.
"You know, this is what I miss the most."
Us working together.
"It's what we always wanted, right?"
It was a dream.
Maybe we just keep it at that.
"Oh no, he's back."
Matt is gonna see him!
Not the kind of makeup that women use in the street.
Pancake.
Women very often use a brand of makeup that's made up for actors like pancake.
"I, for example, use precisely that product myself."
"Yes, sir."
I know.
Yes.
I'm sure you do by now.
"No, but the point here is something else, sir."
"You see, the lab found traces of four different shades of makeup on that mask."
"And women, you know, they don't usually change shades that much."
"So, in the light of that, sir, I got to thinking."
Where did it lead you to this time?
"A guess, sir."
A professional makeup man?
"Right, sir."
And then to my makeup table.
"Oh, no, sir."
"No, sir."
No.
I only came here to see you.
Honest.
I was just fooling around with the shoes just to pass the time for something to do until you came in.
No.
I didn't look at another thing while I was here.
That means you didn't have to.
You already know something.
Where did you look?
"Guess, sir."
I'll give you three guesses.
The studio wardrobe department.
"You got it in one, sir."
"Yeah, I know."
I forgot.
She wanted to talk about the vacation.
"She wanted to know, was it, ""Like the usual?"""
This was my daughter who called or my wife?
Your daughter.
"Okay, I'll call her back."
Yes?
All that glucose...
Yes?
Worries me.
I can examine you if you want.
I'm a doctor.
"All right... what can I do for you, Dr. Kay?"
"You work at St. Louis, right?"
I don't know if I'm the right...
"Nathan, I believe you have misunderstood me."
I'm very serious.
You mustn't take hypoglycemia lightly.
"In fact, you shouldn't take any symptom lightly... ever."
You can't imagine the number of cells you burn up every day.
"Of course, you'll tell me you're also manufacturing..."
- I don't want to interrupt...
- But it's not so.
Neurons can't be replaced.
Some die every day.
Every day a few more.
All that glucose you're pumping in is just cheap energy.
"Very bad for you, very bad for the neurons."
"Thank you for your concern about my health, but I'm fine."
Now why don't you tell me what you want from me?
"That slight shaking in your hands, have you had that a long time?"
Air flow in the stomach!
Energy flow from the abdomen
"Brother Jin, what is that?"
This is the art of utilizing the vital energy
It can loosen stiff joints and helps blood flow
"If you follow the instruction, not only horse stance"
But you can stand up to any stance!
Air flow in the stomach!
Energy flow from the abdomen
Eyes closed as the energy gathers!
Left and right and left and right!
A thousand pounds and I'm still alright!
Left and right and left and right!
A thousand pound and I'm still alright!
Looks like he gives a damn
Get into position!
Make a proper horse stance!
Or get stomach stance
Do it!
Higher!
Oh!
"3rd brother, what are you doing?"
You asshole!
"3rd Brother, Jian is already serving his punishment"
Why do you beat him up?
He...oh my foot!
Poor foot!
What?
Brother Jin
Would you be leaving this place tomorrow?
"Y es, during the past three months..."
I've already taught you all that I knew
Read that.
"You know, I'd like to say something big and brave right now but.."
I can't think of a thing.
How about this?
(Patricia) 'You may be down but not out.'
Sharp one.
Well.
"There's, um.."
"""They think they have me licked, but I'll show 'em."""
Here's one.
"""In the fell clutch of circumstance"
"""I have not winced nor cried aloud."
"""Under the bludgeonings of fate my head is bloody, but unbowed."""
Magnificent!
"You display a bit of histrionic talent there, my boy."
You should have been an actor.
"Of course, I perform best in my native surroundings."
"- You know, the open fields."
"- Oh, I hate the country."
- I'm afraid of wild flowers.
- Yes.
I've heard that one.
"Tell me, were you ever born in a big white house surrounded by a high green hedge?"
"With an orchard, a patch of woods and a natural spring."
- 'Yes.'
- No.
What?
No big house with little thatches growing all around it?
There's nothing like going out in the morning and picking yourself a nice fresh bunch of thatches.
"Boy, am I glad I got rid of that house."
"And now, you haven't a care in the world."
No.
He never told me that.
You see?
"You never know, do you?"
"On the other hand,"
Ward Fowler has an alibi.
He was with Mark during the whole time during the murder.
And that alibi is ain'tight.
Is it as ain'tight as Sid Daley's?
"Oh, I think it's more, sir."
"I mean, a girl that you're gonna marry is much more apt to provide an alibi than a gofer."
What do we conclude from this interrogation?
"Ward Fowler denies having a motive, he won't admit to having means,"
and he can prove that he didn't have opportunity.
So that leaves us with Sid Daley.
"That's a great third act line, isn't it?"
"""That leaves us with Sid Daley."""
"Well, I think this has been very helpful, sir."
Thank you very much.
I certainly appreciate it.
Oh.
"One more thing, sir."
We got something else on the gun.
Did I mention that?
"No, you."
Didn't.
"What, Lieutenant?"
A thread sir.
From the parka?
"No, sir."
"We haven't traced the garment from which the thread came from yet, sir."
"Lieutenant, if I were you, I'd get a search warrant for all four people involved."
"Yes, sir."
It won't happen again.
- Thank you.
- Did I fail?
- No.
- I-I'm sorry.
Um...
Did I fail?
You won't tell them...
- Most patients come to Rosewood in order to relax and recuperate away from the harsh... day-to-day life outside of these gates.
"Some patients, however, they're faced with more..."
advanced challenges.
"But not to worry, patients like that are kept in a separate wing from ladies such as yourself, Miss Porter."
Shall we?
- Of course.
"- And if you decide you don't like it,"
I'll come right back.
- Okay.
- Okay?
That girl looked really disturbed.
Are you sure you want to stay?
"- Roderick, do quit your ceaseless worrying."
This is just what I need.
I feel better already.
- I'll come visit you soon.
Take care.
- Perhaps you'd like some tea?
"- Oh, that sounds wonderful."
"- Now you just let Gunther know when you're ready, and he'll show you to your quarters."
It can be easy to get lost here until you know your way around.
- Thank you.
- She seems rather a bore.
Is she anyone of note?
Shoot him.
I've got a gun in my desk.
Last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it and then give the bastard everything he wanted.
I'm not here for foreman.
I'm here to save myself.
"Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim."
That's why you're wearing the suit.
You wanted to be here.
He just gave you the excuse.
What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?
Give me the bag.
Mildewed dish towel.
- To retest for staph.
"What is that, mouse droppings?"
Hamster droppings.
Could carry toxocara.
Explain the blindness.
"Now, that I recognize as oven crud."
Could be meat with trichinella.
Would explain the high fever.
What's with rye bread?
"Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning, which would explain the contractures."
There are three loaves.
- So?
You're going back in there.
Guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.
That's looking too far into the future.
Unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.
You on the roof yet?
"Yeah, I'm here."
I don't see any birds.
Whistle or something.
Light Yagami.
The Gods of death do not take souls.
Contrary to what humans say.
Once the notebook falls into the human world.
It belongs to the world of humans.
"In other words, it's yours."
I do not want!
"Well, well."
"Still, you should not forward saying relative and all."
You should show the hierarchy respect.
"Whatever is the idea you get, say first to me."
I will forward that after filtering.
It is a risk to you once we take a reverse.
"Even if it is a risk, I should get all the credit."
Promise on Lord Hanuman.
- You locked me so.
Okay boss!
"What is this boss, like calling the adjacent guy in a bar."
"If I call dude to boss instead of boss, it is an insult to you only."
"I see, then boss is fixed."
What is this file in hands like Panchangam in the hands of a priest?
Oh god!
Never finger this file.
This is purely personal.
Sorry Boss
Very good Karthik
- Thank you sir
You have successfully joined into his chamber.
What is your next move?
"To make the next move, I need a dummy fool from your department sir."
What?
- Yes.
"Your Honor, we call ready for trial."
[ click]
"Well, isn't this interesting?"
Call down the voir dire panel.
We're gonna pick us a jury.
What I don't understand is how you don't warn me.
"Well, you haven't been listening to me."
I wasn't sure I was going to do it when we went in.
I had to see if they were ready.
We're not ready!
- We're not ready.
"- They're not, either."
"If they were ready, they would have brought a whole crew and a bunch of video equipment, a bunch more files, all kind of shit."
So you in no way feel that this is rushed.
We have no choice.
"I mean, I could get arrested any time."
"- Oh, stop."
- Or maybe killed.
Jesus Christ.
Time's not exactly on our side here.
Tomorrow?
Hmm.
"The partners aren't happy, Donald."
"I wouldn't call it exactly a revolt, but there's definite rumbling-- mostly about the Borns Tech case and your relationship with Lucy."
"That's over, and the partners' doubts will pass."
"Well-- if... we win the Borns case, maybe."
Or what?
They'll replace me?
I'd like to meet the man they have in mind.
Or the woman.
Listen.
"Please listen to me, Donald."
- How is that saintly?
- ...she-asah il kol tzorki.
"My love, Jacob."
"If you ever loved me, stop."
- Stop.
- ...
She-asah il kol tzorki.
Stop.
Jacob?
Jacob?
Jacob?
"Jacob, you've had a complex partial seizure, which can cause psychosis, including religious psychosis."
Which means that this never was Jerusalem syndrome.
And I'm sure you're aware that were having these episodes.
Yes.
"What do you mean, you knew?"
How long has it been going on?
Since a few months before we went to the holy land.
That's when God first made himself known to me.
- No.
"- Oh, my God."
It isn't God.
It's epileptiform activity.
"Your brain has had spontaneous neural activity, and that's... that's what feels like God."
"We can't convince you of this right now, but what's more important is that we get you on the anti-seizure medication."
- And once the seizures stop...
- God will go away?
I don't want God to go away.
Repeat seizures can cause brain damage.
Listen to me.
"Yes, you are."
We need to section him.
I deny that we are intending to supply them with weapons.
These lies are useless.
We know you're helping the subversives.
I want names.
I have none to give you.
He told you already...
we don't know anything about the resistance!
I've heard that many times from many people.
Take him.
"Lieutenant, stop!"
That will not help either of us.
He's right.
Open up!
No!
Break it down!
I see soldiers out there.
Whas happening?
They're everywhere... searching the whole area.
I don't want to cause trouble for you.
I'll go soon asit's dark.
You've always been a troublemaker ever since you could walk.
I've never seen such a willful child.
But thas what I love most about you... your spirit.
"Now, don't worry."
"When they come through here, we'll be gone already."
"Now, your mother will want some of her things."
Ah...a pretty dress to wear.
They're only looking for me.
You don't have to get any more involved than you already are.
"Why, if my precious girl is involved then I'm involved, too."
Do you remember this?
She always used to wear it on special occasions.
is this what we were missing?
What were we missing?
Why do you bang that bottle down on the piano?
That's my livelihood!
You shouldn't put it there!
I paid for it.
Isn't it undignified to take the bottle with you?
It's not undignified.
You ordered Martell.
"You left it there, you acted like noble ladies."
Miss didn't want to dance...
For heaven's sake!
For heaven's sake!
I only spoke to those boys on her behalf.
You only spoke on her behalf!
Why did you need to do that?
Why did you have to say that?
What good is that to us?
And what does the Martell matter!
Here we lost thousands...
"Heavens, you made such a fuss there, until now we haven't been anywhere, and when we do go, all you care about is one Martell... all you care about is one Martell..."
People were paying thousands!
But I have to watch the budget.
It's always only you!
Your budget!
Always only you!
We've had this for years.
"Years, and now you even... I told her I didn't need to go there."
She even made an expensive dress.
This is an expensive dress?
"The dressmaker laughed, she called it a rag."
So what kind of modern dress does she want?
"Soon-shin, talk to me!"
What went wrong?
"Why, sir?"
I must know why you made such an unfair decision?
Are you really oblivious as to why you failed?
Ask your father.
How dare you even think to apply for the exam!
There is no place for descendents of traitors in the royal court?
Good hunting today.
"Here, it's your share."
"I was the lead today, isn't that right?"
Then my share is larger than that.
"Why are you sitting out here, wife?"
"Oh, you're back."
"It's been months since the exam, and Shoo-shin is yet to find peace."
I'm concerned.
Will he ever be all right?
One must hit the bottom to bounce back.
He must undergo what he must.
Let's just watch him.
I shouldn't have encouraged him.
I had resented you.
A part of me was angry with you for not allowing the boys to pursue their studies.
And I had hopes.
I believed that someone in this world would give my boy a chance... that their spirit and talent would be recognized...
Innkeeper!
Innkeeper!
Bring me more wine!
More wine!
I'm coming!
Stop this now.
Stop!
Back off!
Meredith.
This is between you and I.
"The rest of these guys, they don't matter."
This is just you and me.
And a choice.
You're shaking now.
You're getting angry.
You're letting your emotions get the better of the situation.
The adrenaline is really kicking in.
"But what I know, the reason that I'm not shaking is because this is a choice not dictated by emotion."
This is logic.
"Pure, simple."
My boy over there is rated 4th in the world on the Glock 30.
You know what that means?
What's it mean?
It means I could shoot you from Texas.
"Now, that's, of course, an exaggeration but the point stands."
He knows what he's doing.
He's a professional.
And you're you.
You've already dropped the gun.
Because this is a choice within a very strict set of parameters.
Right now you're in control.
What you don't wanna do is put him in control.
Don't give him the choice.
That way is death.
That way is the unconditional end to future choice.
That's it.
Good girl.
"I know, I know."
"It's always a tough lesson to learn, to realize that you don't have the stomach to do what's needed."
When I see him...
He will still think of me when he sees me again.
"Well, first take the money that we owe him..."
I don't want his money!
"I want...never, I want nothing more from him..."
And his child I don't want at all!
Why should it live?
He himself never wanted it but... he shall see it!
First he shall see it and know how it feels when all is taken from one.
"Then I will kill it and myself, too."
But first I'll go to this shit of a dad and throw the dead kid at his feet!
Let him see how his conscience is dead.
"He'll cry and curse, that dog..."
I don't know where to go anymore.
My employer has fired me.
I have no place to sleep...
"I have no money, no papers."
Nothing.
Nothing at all...
"Well, have the child first, and the rest will follow."
"Going by the laundry, small wonder that he's run off..."
- Did you eavesdrop again?
- My hearing is excellent.
Bring the suitcase to Mrs Kunze.
She has a room free.
She can stay there.
"- Well, when are you due?"
- That's none of your damn business!
For how long should I rent the room then?
- For as long as she works for me.
- Under the table?
With no money and no papers?
"Yeah, well, maybe he's better off on his own, anyways."
What does that mean?
"Okay, if we find him, then what?"
"Then, if he's very lucky he gets to go back with his mom?"
"I would run away, too."
"Promise me right now that you never do that, that you'd never run away, no matter how bad things may seem."
Your mother and I will always be there.
"Okay, Dad, please, take it down a notch."
"The minute you were born, I knew that I would never take another easy breath again without knowing you were safe."
So I'm like asthma?
I'm warning you.
You run away...
I'm coming with you.
I guess we can keep looking.
This song reminds me of you.
I thought you were with Luke.
I was.
I don't know why I'm here.
I just wanted to see you.
I mean...you're leaving tomorrow and...what if I never... we never...
Maybe I could spend the night.
Just to hang out.
You can't stay.
"If you stay, if you spend the night, I..."
I don't know that I could leave.
"Well, then don't."
"Yeah, you go back to school in the fall and I'll just what--hang around here?"
Hiding like some ghost?
Till the cops find me and I have to disappear again?
We're from different worlds.
That's not true.
I'm not like you.
What lessons?
Violin lessons.
Is your violin tuned up well?
"Yes, but I first have to admit something to you, professor."
Tell me.
"What is it, Uluc?"
I am really bored with this violin.
Shall we just move on to another instrument?
Another instrument?
"Yes, professor."
I don't know.
Something more popular.
"For example, we have some entertainment nights in Urfa."
Entertainment nights?
Haven't you ever heard of it?
"For example, the Mici of Kahta... or may God rest his soul, the Boiler Bedih..."
"Yes, what do we do now?"
- What do you mean by what do we do?
"- Meaning, what's our new plan?"
"It's the fatal exam robbery, Chapter 2."
Are you doing this on purpose?
Speak in Turkish.
- That means we'll rob a bank.
- What bank?
The question bank.
The test exams for intensive courses.
Come on.
Why are we stealing them?
It's just a test exam as we call it.
"Because every week, their results are being mailed home."
"When our marks are low, our parents at home start nagging."
I can't take that anymore.
You dim little shit.
I hired you out of pity and this is how you repay me.
"Tomorrow, when people find out that your precious president.."
helped a maniac open the nuclear football..
"who do you think they're going to believe, you or me?"
"You, you would be a nobody."
"But me, I'm the president of the United States."
"No, you're not."
"Eli, Eli."
"Quite the politician, huh?"
You did all of this just to keep your buddies in the defence industry happy.
How far did you fall into their pockets?
This is ridiculous.
"Take him into custody, general."
"Yes, sir, Mr. President."
"No, I'm still president."
I am still president.
"Well, just consider this a coup d'état."
Get this trash off my lawn.
You're not fit for office.
You son of a bitch!
You're selling this country out to the Arabs.
This isn't over.
I got friends.
And I'll make sure all of your friends meet you in prison.
Let's get him to the hospital.
You okay?
You look terrible.
Thank you for everything you did today.
Thank you for trusting me.
Special Agent Cale!
I'm not going anywhere without my protection.
Suppose we take a little drive this afternoon and make further inquiries.
- I guess we'll learn something.
"- Hello, hello!"
How are you today?
Why did you run away?
- Sorry.
I don't think we've met.
- Nonsense.
Of course.
- You spent last night with me.
- This lady says she doesn't know you.
"Yes, she does."
You mustn't forget old friends so soon.
Most unflattering.
I haven't the slightest idea who you are.
You can't have forgotten Brighton and my brother.
- Never been to Brighton.
"- Well, makes us even."
I haven't a brother.
You're evidently making a mistake.
This lady spent last night with her aunt.
Don't you think you ought to apologize and leave us?
"Well, if that's the way you see it, I'll toddle off and give it thought."
"I say, what's that dreadful thing you're playing?"
"- They call it ""The March of the Hussars. """
- Nothing like it.
"It so happens, my bovine friend, that ""The March of the Hussars"" is my favorite piece of music."
"I know every note of it, and you haven't played one of them."
"Well, how does it go then?"
Those are the drums.
Play it.
Those are the trumpets.
Congratulations!
You're marrying my sister!
"And you spared no expense, ya big crazy."
You know what?
"I love Barney, but this ring thing sucks."
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack and then apologized.
"And I think he really, really meant it."
"Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers... but nothing beats the rush you get when that one special person looks at you."
It's true.
"Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see."
And I see her brighter and more clearly... than anything else in this world.
You know what that is?
That's love.
And possibly alcohol mixed... with some very powerful antibiotics.
And that's how Barney sees you.
And I know that's how you see Barney.
Stay back or I'll shoot him!
"Appreciate what you're trying to do, son."
"Did the same job myself, and proudly."
"I have no quarrel with you, but I do have a deadline."
So put the gun down..
Pull the pin.
Because you're not gonna shoot the president.
You're right.
"Where does that leave us, boys?"
That leaves us with this.
Come on!
"Go, go, go!"
What are you doing?
!
"Oh, no."
"Come on, go!"
What do I know?
They...
They are very...
- Are you ill?
- No.
I only wish to lie down for a minute.
I have a room just to the side where you can relax.
"It's all right, everyone."
She's going to be all right.
- What do you suppose is wrong?
- She's probably pregnant again.
There's George.
Excuse me.
I have no desire to speak to that woman.
Chopinsky!
You hiding from George too?
You would know the reason.
I don't want to spoil a good drunken stupor by imagining your reason.
"Ever since the latest chapter of her egregious memoir was published,"
I can hardly show my face anywhere.
Did you read her latest novel?
"It's not literature, it's drainage."
She only wrote good books when she was with me.
Every morning while she was sleeping I'd cross out half her adjectives.
Hercules could not have done it.
He'd have rather cleaned out the bloody stables.
Know what's funny?
- She doesn't come.
- Oh.
"She makes a lot of pretty noise, but she can't come."
Like her books...
lovesick posturing and pretence for quick money.
Do you have any idea why he left?
I'm not sure.
I'd only be guessing.
You hesitated.
Why?
I don't know.
You know what he did during that year and a half?
"He was in the Navy, he said."
"Do you imply that he came home from the war, from combat duty just to beat you up?"
"-We object, your Honor!"
The defendant has implied no such thing.
-Sustained.
-Did your stepfather... own the house you live in?
-My brother and I fixed it up.
"-Answer the question, please."
-It wasn't a house when...
"-Please, answer the question."
Yes.
"But it was a dirty shack, and nothing else!"
"But you had the freedom to come and go, and... invite boys in... and answer to no one while Lucas was gone, didn't you?"
"Yes, I had the freedom, but I never did!"
"When you thought he was going to change all that, did you kill him?"
No!
Lucas was drunk and tried to beat me!
"The coroner testified... that Lucas was unconscious from the first or second blow... so you'd say you'd end the beating then, but you didn't stop."
Why?
I don't know.
You kept beating him until you crushed life out of him.
Why?
I don't know!
I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.
"Andres did not agree, but I insisted."
I had to know.
what madness!
"In any case, it has helped, I am now covinced it was not his imagination, he was telling the truth."
It seems his madness is contagious.
"We will soon know if its truly madness, Ricardo."
Tomorrow we will dive again.
I do not want to have a single doubt.
I will go along.
What your are doing makes no sense.
Go on holiday and forget about all this.
You would like to see me in an insane asylum.
I am not insane.
"And if you have come for that, you could have spared yourself the trip."
You are wasting our time.
Is it that you don't realize that you're risking angelica's life?
So...
That's what it is?
I hope nothing happens to her.
I doubt you will overcome this madness anytime soon.
Can you tell me why you tossed the tank and the harpoon?
"Protection, in case..."
In case of necessity.
I understand.
Andres...
"God Dammit, I don't like this."
"Here, take this."
"What is it that you are doing, Andres?"
I have to help Angelica.
Don't move.
"And you, drop that gun."
"Once again we meet,eh."
Keep it to yourself till you die.
For me.
Should I not say it?
What's wrong?
It's no crime to date them...
Changwook will not take this well.
- Did you date them?
- Yes.
How many?
I've had maybe two or three serious ones.
- That's quite a lot.
- I told you not to say anything!
I was lonely.
"Yeah, they love Asian women."
They just go crazy about them.
Even if the women are ugly.
It's not necessarily like that.
But there's a premium if they go there.
Not many Asian women in Europe.
Western men have a fantasy about them.
Many Korean men seem to think so.
"Frankly, it's rather a disgrace."
Unpopular women here are considered pretty over there.
Don't you think it's a disgrace?
"Well, that's not how I feel."
Look here.
It's a person meeting another.
It's not like what you said.
"Oh, you might think that I have an inferiority complex about my dick size compared to Western men, but that's not it."
"You have to live where you were born, whether you're ugly or not."
Why do unpopular girls here go over there to live comfortably?
That's really not cool!
Baker persuaded someone that Buckley was more use to the war than the typewriter.
It won't last.
"He'll end up in a uniform, like every mother's son."
That is if he ever had a mother.
"More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub spawning spontaneously in saw dust."
No.
"A lot of men are scared we won't go into our boxes, when this is all over."
Makes them belligerent.
Something's changed.
I tidied it.
What happened at the meeting?
I outlined our proposed changes.
They accepted them.
What's this?
Lunch.
"Girls compile the boat at home, right?"
"They compile it, the bloody boat... they can lead the damn fleet for all I care!"
But Johnnie.
Freeze the propeller.
You're late!
I took the liberty of ordering.
It's alright.
"We've guests, eh?"
Friends from Poland.
Things are very bad in Europe.
It's not exactly a picnic here.
If you haven't noticed.
You can't find a decent waiter in service since they joined the war.
"They all got rounded up in so called ""Enemy of the State""."
Apart from Jepetto over there.
Rumor is that he is a spy.
Ceres.
"""A proclamation to modify the quantitative limitations applicable to the imports of wheat gluten."""
"We are just a little rococo, aren't we?"
Why is Molly Morello less worthy of a proclamation than General Pulaski?
- I wish I knew who Pulaski was.
- This is what I mean.
"She's not less worthy, but neither is she more than the other ninety thousand public school teachers who are retiring."
Who weren't lucky enough to have a staffer as a former student.
- That's trouble.
- Who would find out?
"""Who would find out"" is also where we frequently find trouble."
- You're right.
- Yes.
"All right, you're right."
- Hey.
- You get it done?
- Yeah.
- He's taking his name off it?
Yeah.
"Well, it feels like we're almost done in there."
You wanna tell me what this meeting's about now?
Replacing Hoynes.
- What are you...?
- Bruno wanted us to look at replacing.
- Josh.
- So we're looking at it.
"We're looking at it, and everybody's treating me like... ."
- Why?
- There's electoral math.
- Was I sent away?
- No.
- So I wouldn't be at that meeting?
- No.
None.
"I'm on student loans at u.C.L.A.,"
And my parents don't give me
Any financial support whatsoever.
How much is this gonna cost me?
We'll do it for free.
Free to her.
I didn't say we won't get paid.
"Book rights,movie rights--"
"Press like this, we're gonna get paid."
Trust me.
"I told you we'd handle it, but we've gotta move fast."
Take her purse and her cell phone.
"News coverage means the chance of you getting a fair trial is going down by the second,"
So we've got to do everything we can before we turn you in.
You just need to answer one question.
I told you.
It was self-Defense.
That's not the question.
Don't guess!
Ron.
What did you do with the knife?
Threw it away?
That's not good.
"Plus,she's too calm to have just killed someone."
"She's not calm,alden."
She's numb.
Not too numb to come here instead of going to the cops.
You think she's lying to us?
A married man and a college girl go to a hotel room together--
"Someone's lying about something, and that's before anyone dies."
The d.A. Will argue that she ditched the knife
How?
Did a Duke of Edinburgh climbing course at my pupil referral unit.
What was my nickname inside?
"- Spider, right?"
- Not the nickname I heard.
We're done.
"I'm gonna go and stay with my sister, now."
"I assume we never meet again, which is a tragedy I'll just have to live with."
Here are the keys to the flat.
- We're not finished yet.
"- We had an agreement, Lenny."
I think you overestimated your ability to insist on deal breakers.
- You gave me an undertaking.
- To review.
So consider it under review.
OK.
Fine.
"- Send me back to prison, then, please."
- We can do that.
- Then do it.
"- Only this time, it's for life."
I'll make sure of it.
- You were never gonna set me free.
"- Don't be so ungrateful, John."
I've even authorised your mobile to make outgoing calls.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
"Oh, mate."
You're not gonna believe this.
I've cracked it with one of them Colombian chicks.
Big beautiful brown eyes.
"Mate, I have got a strong feeling that before long, Manuela - that's her name - she's gonna be down here dancing on the end of my bed."
Chill out.
Hospitals simply are going insane.
We've already reached the limit.
Maybe you should give up.
"A comatose patient is also a person, right?"
There are people who have woken up after 17 years!
What if my father wakes up?
"Just because of money, you decided to give up on my father?"
I already said I would pay the money.
Please carry out the stent surgery.
Hurry.
Please save my father.
Go ahead with the surgery.
Everything is settled.
I've already paid for the surgery.
"Here, your hand phone."
Wait a moment!
You... why did you help me?
I didn't help you.
I just don't want to hear that someone died because of me.
Thank you very much.
I'll pay you back the money.
Please give me your bank account number.
There's no need.
That money is only chewing gum money to me.
I'll just think of it as a donation to the poor.
It's just a small donation I gave you.
I...
"Seriously, I mean you can't compare the absence of a father with chewing gum!"
"And you can't classify us as ""poor people""."
I still owe you a debt.
Thank you!
I will surely pay you back.
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
Manoj.
Based on what you said...
After cheating me as Deepa...
She didn't take much time to meet you as Ashwini.
She has met you even when I was still at the hospital.
"So, she might've chosen Manoj as the next target after you much earlier."
Yes.
So we must find out the way she finds these blind people.
Yes.
Apart from Manoj and I being blind...
What is common between us?
A blind man is cooking...
That made people to come to my restaurant.
That gave me publicity.
That helped my business as well.
Yes.
I have even written about him.
Manoj...
Has there been any newspaper article or TV news about you?
I'm not all that famous.
I'm just a simple man.
She will not come after a simple man.
- Exactly!
You are successful in your field.
You must have gotten some recognition.
You must have been received some awards.
Or any ceremonies that you have presided over as a chief guest...
Something like of that sort?
You could have spared the biscuit.
Looks like Vijay Awards memento.
"- No, Ben, it's safe."
Very safe.
You think you can beat the system?
"This is the system, beating you back."
"You wanna count cards, you do it in Atlantic City."
- Get him up.
"- Come on, kid."
Count to five.
- Count to five!
- What?
"Count to five so I know you don't have brain damage, you can go home."
Start with one.
"One, two, three, four, five."
Good.
"Now, stop counting."
Let's go.
"You're crazy, everybody knows to split eights."
My grandmother splits eights.
Not against a 10.
It's a sucker play.
"Look, you're choosing to play two hands against the highest up card a dealer can have, right?"
"Against a five or a six, it'd be fine."
"Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play."
"Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?"
Jill's right.
All right?
"Choi, why don't you explain to Ben how we do?"
"Oh, all right."
"So, our team is divided into two kinds of players, spotters and big players, right?"
"So if you think that this table is the casino floor, then salt and pepper shakers are your spotters."
Spotters are just sitting at the various blackjack tables and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.
That's quite the Friday.
"Trick, a pint, please."
"The Ash, he's pissed, huh?"
"I told him you got there after and that we both arrived too late, so you're off the hook."
So you covered for me?
This Jenny thing's a serial killer case.
It's scored me some big points in the cop world for breaking it.
Let's just say it's returning the favour.
Cheers.
Yep.
- Still a douche.
"- Well, at least he's not a thief."
I seem to be missing a 300-year-old bottle of buckthorn mead.
You Fae and your funny words.
Look at the time.
I should be going.
Stay and let me tell you how that bottle came into my possession and why it meant so much to me.
So I was thinking.
- I'm gonna stop you right there.
- No. it's good.
Listen as recent events have suggested mixing emotions and sex can get kind of messy.
- That is what I was trying to avoid.
"- Yeah, well, I get that now."
"My offer does still stand, though."
I'm here whenever you need me.
How about for more than just healing?
- How about for fun?
- For fun?
Yeah.
"There's this ""friends with benefits"" thing that I have heard so much about."
- You don't say.
"Yeah, and you're actually kind of perfect."
No.
It's all right.
It's fine.
"Come on, come in."
"Um, I got your tea if you want me to make you some."
Sure.
"Yeah, that'd be nice."
"Of all the dozens of women you've been with, you must have fallen in love plenty of times."
Right?
What's this really about?
Neil.
"His, um, his other job..."
"We're working on being more open, but this little voice inside my head isn't so sure."
"So if I fell in love with you,"
"Neil could fall in love with one of his dates, too."
"Grace, you were the only one."
"Come on, I'm serious."
You don't do what I do and catch feelings.
It's the ultimate transgression.
You were it.
So you just sleep with all these women and you never feel anything intimate?
In passing.
It's that way with a lot of people.
Clients and escorts.
That's the fantasy.
That's... that's why this business is booming.
"When I met you, I was hungry for something more, emotionally."
But you were never going to leave Neil.
"It took me a while to figure that out, but..."
Neil's gonna be seeing someone tonight.
Someone I selected.
But I don't want to be the wife who sets rules and tells him what he can and can't do.
And what have you got?
What have you got outside of this?
Do you have a life?
- How could that possibly matter?
"- What do you mean ""how does it matter""?"
- It means everything.
- What is...
What have you got?
You've got nothing to live for except for this!
This is all you've got.
You've got your protocol.
You've got your numbers.
You're on the other side of the fucking numbers.
And you read them and you take their money.
You think you're not a part of this?
Do you think you can fuck around with these people?
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?
You're in it.
You asked for it and you're in it.
"Here, locked and loaded."
- Safety's off.
It's good to go.
- I don't want your fucking gun.
"If I was gonna kill you, I would have done it a long time ago."
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
My cell phone.
My cell phone's in your glove-box.
We can use it to call for help.
"Look, I know you're upset about what happened... but I think you're taking this personally."
How long before the reactor is brought online?
"Assuming Hoshi can translate the interface, about 12 hours."
You have to delay it until we can verify the Captain's mental state.
"If he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in the Brig."
You're asking me to betray him.
You can't allow your personal feelings for the Captain to affect your decision.
We both know he's endangering this ship and our mission.
What is it?
A subspace vortex is opening off the port bow.
Tactical Alert.
"Captain Archer, report to the Bridge."
It's an Insectoid.
Three bio-signs aboard.
They're firing.
They're moving away at full impulse.
Pursuit course.
Arm phase-cannons.
Disable their engines.
[Grave instrumental music]
No effect.
Their main deflector's charging.
They could be trying to open a vortex.
Torpedoes.
Maximum yield.
Target their impulse manifolds.
CREWMAN:
Ready.
REED:
Fire.
ARCHER:
What the hell's going on?
"I'll fix engagement next week as you wish,"
I'll make other arrangements.
"Sister...congratulations, your engagement is fixed next week."
- He ignored me.
- Who?
Who else?
That kick guy!
Bloody idiot!
Is Kalyan here?
When?
Where?
Why are you so excited?
Why did he ignore me?
I am sure he's here to ruin my life.
"It's him, right?"
It's not him...it's not him...
it's him...
I'm sure it's him.
We believe that you'll catch that thief.
You need any help sir?
I need a journalist.
I'm here for my partner.
I'll definitely find him.
"Your interview was rocking, your still in the paper is very glamourous."
You've a good photogenic face.
Have you settled in Malaysia?
How's your accommodation?
"Very good, but weather is hot like you."
"I thought you'd come to marry here, have you come here cracking my clue to catch me?"
"I feel like shaking hands with you, will you give me a chance?"
"Don't rush off buddy,"
I'll put handcuffs if I get you not shake hands with you.
When Ronny went to jail?
"Before that, when we were out on his boat."
In the storm?
That was fun?
That sucked.
"No, it didn't."
You thought it was exciting.
I wasn't excited.
I was hysterical.
There's a huge difference between hysteria and excitement.
Are we ever gonna have a relationship?
We're having a relationship.
"Here we are, having it."
Ian's got a room at the Chateau.
We'll stay there...
-...you can have the place to yourself.
-You should stay.
"Alex is still looking for an apartment, and we need something permanent so just stay."
Why don't you ask her?
Maybe she wants to be alone in the interim.
I'm sure Alex wants you to stay.
"I mean, she can't stay away from you as it is."
He's gonna give her a frontal lobe.
"No, no, he'll just give her Thorazine and then lock her up."
I think she wants to be locked up.
"Yeah, exactly."
Make your analysis at first  with three general patterns of emotional response.
Rage is the response to the primary stimulus of thwarting.
-Should I be embarrassed for us?
-I am.
I really am.
You gonna have another?
It calms his angry soul.
"You want to ask me about Trina, don't you?"
"No, I just wanted to say sorry for..."
"You loved your wife, didn't you George?"
You were happy?
"Well, we had our moments, but..."
"But yes I did, and um..."
"Yes, we were..."
Yeah.
I loved Trina too.
I don't think she ever really loved me.
Not really.
Deep down inside I always hoped she'd come back.
Even after all this time.
"You were the one who sent the postcards to the kids, weren't you?"
"I know people, plumbers, from all over the world."
"We talk, plumbing, you know, online."
I'd get them to send blank postcards from their country.
I'd copy Trina's bit of scrawl as best I could.
"Christmas cards, birthday messages, love Mummy."
And then I would courier the cards back to my plumbing mates and they'd post them.
I didn't want the kids to think that she'd just left them.
Forgotten them.
"It's bloody stupid, really."
I probably just made things worse.
You were trying to do something good.
We try to make up the loss as best we can.
"Yeah, well sometimes it's just not enough, is it?"
"It gets better, Bill."
"Not every day, but... ..trust me it does."
You hung another one of my paintings.
Yes.
and contusion on the arm.
"Look, this is an arm... the contusion, commonly called a bruise, is this big."
"So, in my opinion, she suffered a violent blow."
"Maybe she fell, I don't know."
Is it possible that she got into a fight?
She didn't say?
No she didn't talk about that.
"Mind you, she told me that... at some point she got up, she went to the window... and that's when she saw... the lady in question, on the ground."
"She would have also seen a young black man running, running..."
Did she say anything else?
I'm trying to see...
It's not my field...
"No, that's about it."
"Then, another blackout."
Any idea as to when we could interrogate her?
Not before 3 days.
3 days?
"3 full days, if not more."
Maybe you can get ahead with your investigation.
There might be other leads...
"Yes, thank you."
We'II follow other leads.
"- Thank you, doctor."
- alright.
"unfortunately, I must go to the clinic, but if you need me for anything..."
- Don't hesitate.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
"well, we'II take care of you guys."
alright... where do we do this?
"We could go in there, there are doors."
We'II get back to you shortly.
Stay here!
I'll be right back.
Are you not feeling well?
- I'm just waiting for someone.
Thanks a lot.
- Excuse me please...
Did you get her rid of her so soon?
Who am I supposed to have gotten rid of?
I've been sleeping here!
This caring is touching!
Did you not see Hassenreuter's costumes down below?
"I figured that I'd stay guard here, so that nothing is stolen."
And then you open up a chest without any authorization and take its contents out?
Should I sleep on the mattress?
"No, Bruno, that you shouldn't do!"
You need a soft pillow for your conscience to let you sleep.
Do you also sleep in your nightdress?
You piece of crap!
"If it weren't for your sister,"
I'd break every bone in your body!
You're not worthy of her blind adoration...
Here!
You can return the rags of those dames with whom you've been sinning!
"If you would at least admit to it, but no..."
You're a coward and you lie...
Lie...
"Whoever lies, steals and whoever steals..."
"No, I'll mess up the baptism..."
You hang yourself alone.
Old fool!
Now then...
Father of the child?
Let's get out of here.
We're gonna draw a crowd.
Just don't lie there.
Get 'em!
Wait.
Higgins.
Wait.
Easy.
Better?
A little trick I learned in Shanghai just after the war... from a sturdy little Oriental chap who demonstrated using dogs.
"Actually, it's still pretty bad."
I think I may be out of action for several days.
- No swimming with this.
- Perhaps a little acupuncture.
Let me just get my needles and we'll try some simple muscle testing.
"On the other hand, activity could be good for circulation."
Let's go back to the guesthouse.
"I'll give you hot packs, alternating with cold packs."
No.
Not so fast.
Aren't you forgetting something?
- You mean?
"- Yes, as a matter of fact."
The Hardy Boys out there.
Especially the one with Roger's teeth.
I was just gonna tell you about that.
You were just so busy with beauty and pain that it slipped your mind.
Roger doesn't have any gold teeth.
"Well, these two guys came to see me in Bayonne about six weeks ago."
Looking for Roger.
What story did they give you?
Even at the exercise salon it sounded phony.
- Officer.
- Come on.
"Let's go, will you?"
"No, wait a minute."
What seems to be the trouble?
"Good morning, sir."
"Officer, this man stole a quarter from my purse."
Make him give it back.
"Now, miss, does he look like a man who would steal quarters?"
- That's just what I said to the lady.
- Imagine...
I don't care what you think he looks like.
I know he stole my quarter.
"Now you run along, sister... before I run you in for disturbing the peace."
"But, Officer, he took my..."
That'll be enough.
"Run along now, you're obstructing traffic."
"Why, you Cossack."
"Officer, you had no right to speak to that little girl that way."
I suppose you're going to tell me what my duty is.
"Not at all, but..."
"Listen, guys like you pay me to protect them from screwy dames."
"That's fine, but in this instance I'm sure you were wrong."
So now I'm wrong.
You ought to thank me for what I've done.
"- All right, thank you."
- All right.
What did you say?
"I said, look out for the great big ditch."
"Pop, why didn't you tell me you had it?"
In front of the cop?
I would've been accused of stealing it.
"Amy, you are going to love the kitchen, but first I'm going to show you guys the living room."
It has a wall-mounted flat screen and a gas log fireplace.
You won't believe how easy this is.
One push of a button...
Isn't that cozy?
"Make sure you capture the back of his head, too."
- If you would be so kind.
- You got it.
-Sorry.
- Sorry.
"There's no rush, gentlemen."
Our patient isn't going anywhere.
"I don't know, Ducky, the old Gibbs is back."
The old Gibbs?
"McGee, over here."
Hands and knees.
On the floor.
"Okay, um..."
"You're not going to step on me, are you?"
Footprints.
It's a pretty tight weave.
Looks like sisal.
It's a naturally stiff fiber woven from the leaf of a cactus plant.
"It doesn't mat, trap dust, build static."
Makes it ideal for carpeting.
"Personally, I prefer a good shag."
From a criminal-investigative standpoint.
I don't see any dirty footprints.
I think it's safe to assume that our friend didn't stroll in here on his own.
"You look happy to see me, boss."
"Oh, the coffee."
Ran the military ID our local LEO's got off the body.
I was a better teacher because of you.
- Fresh pepper?
"- Not for her, but I'll have some."
Could you bring her a side dish of dressing?
She likes a little extra.
I feel I should return the favors.
Is there anything I can do for you?
I'll have to think about that.
Just glop it on.
Enjoy your dinner.
- You're not eating.
"- No, I'm watching your ritual."
"I just about got your sequence now, I think."
"You start by rotating the plate counterclockwise, cut on the diagonal, remove unwanted elements, and now comes my favorite part, the loading of the fork."
"It's fascinating, the percentages you use of different vegetables to create that one harmoniously balanced, perfect bite."
Mmm.
You have a little...
Don't smear it.
That might stain.
You might want to put a little soap on that.
I'll be right back.
Mmm.
I want to ask you something.
- Don't stop.
- I'm not a machine.
"We both have overwhelming feelings for each other, don't we?"
- You're doing great.
Keep it up.
- Okay.
Ready?
- Doesn't that music infuriate you?
"- Yeah, I'm livid."
- Things don't end this suddenly.
"- Yes, they do."
"No, they don't."
"Look, I don't know if things end this way or not... but what we had together is over."
"We'll go on Saturday, then."
For one night.
You can choose a romantic inn.
"Pedro Paulo, my darling."
Former spouses don't travel together to romantic inns.
"Technically speaking, we're not former spouses yet."
"Technically speaking, I wouldn't travel with you... if my life depended on it."
MasterJockstrap won't let you go?
If you break into my apartment again...
- Our apartment.
- My apartment.
And you're forbidden to go in when I'm not there.
Does thejapanese guy look sexy in his jockstrap?
He's notJapanese.
He's Chinese.
These Orientals are perverted.
Has he asked you to perform any strange acts yet?
"There are no ""strange acts"" for people with open minds."
Don't let him tie you up in bed.
These guys will steal your furniture.
"What do you mean ""these guys""?"
Have you gone mad?
Japanese always travel in groups.
Give me back the key.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
- I was swimming.
- No problem.
We could've picked them off easy.
"Jacoub, we're good, if we stay in this direction, yeah?"
"Yes, that way."
No point in rescuing Clare if we can't all get out again.
"You do want to get home, don't you?"
See your wife?
"That's a wedding ring, right?"
What about kids?
Got any of them?
"Okay, no kids."
Your marriage is shit.
That's starting to make more sense...
Don't fucking shrink me!
You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
I know self-loathing when I see it.
How reckless that can make a man.
That's why I'm here.
"Only I want to rescue Clare, not die trying."
"Now, we're professional fucking soldiers."
We got a job to do...
You're not a fucking soldier.
"You're a scumbag arms dealer, selling mass murder."
"So, yes, you should fucking hate yourself."
"That's why Clare hates you too, right?"
"But that's your shit to work out, not mine."
I don't give a fuck if she forgives you or not.
I'm here for one reason and one reason only.
And that's to get that information on Latif.
No...
Which I'm starting to think is just some bullshit... story you're selling...
I'll keep my part of the deal.
"Really, Crawford?"
Don't get close to me!
"If you do, I'll jump!"
Miss.
Please move away from there.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let go of me.
Will you be responsible if she jumps?
Don't come close!
What's the problem this time?
No one loves an ugly girl like me.
I have to die!
I understand how you feel.
But how could you throw your beautiful body into such a sewage-infested river?
But you put me into a box and humiliated me.
I wanted to start a new life in the circus.
"All I do is eat and sleep, so I've gained weight."
"Look, do you know how many people envy you?"
Why?
Because you're human.
Being human is a special right.
You know how many things try so hard to be human?
A werewolf.
A vampire.
And that's not all.
Even foxes.
"Yes, even foxes."
"In order to be human, they've withstood other's mockery, being called a goblin or monster."
"They've endure so much for a long time, almost 1000 years."
But you're giving up your humanity merely because of your appearance?
You know how precious your life is?
And you have one thing you have left to do.
"You need to fall in love before you die, right?"
- On her husband
- last night at the cocktail party.
- Before he was killed ?
Yes.
I don't want to get her in trouble.
Do you have the application on you ?
"Term policy, a million upon death."
Jennie Hale.
She signed it.
Any idea where she is now ?
"No, I'd like a small service."
"Uh, nothing too pricy."
"No, no."
Cremation.
That's what my husband would have wanted.
So Jennie's got a million reasons to kill her husband.
Should we bring her in ?
I want forensic proof.
She'll wiggle out of it too easily.
Everyone bought one of those policies.
We may have forensic proof.
"There was trace on the murder weapon,"
- Bahamian aragonite.
- Sand ?
"Produced by coral reefs in the Bahamas, high pH, large granule size, unique to the region."
- So our killer was in the Bahamas.
- Not necessarily.
Remember that yearbook we looked at ?
"Oh, yeah. ""Senior class trip to the Bahamas was awesome."""
"I got a way to find out where that champagne bottle came from, but we're going to have to go back in time."
"Hey, Krystal, wait up a minute."
"Oh, officer."
He unfortunately reminded me that knowledge is power.
Pack him off to Magaluf.
He can sell dodgy pills from his bar with the rest of the bent coppers.
Maybe.
It's a funny thing to sell your soul for... ..a new beamer.
Yeah.
Cars have never really done it for me.
"Well, what has?"
"Apart from your work, of course."
My work's enough.
And now you have a new toy.
"One you gave the full VIP treatment to, I'm told."
You gave me the impression he was very important.
We could have hauled him in at the hotel.
I know that.
Do you mind if I ask why?
Poor man had been in prison for five years.
That's very charitable of you.
And aren't you always telling me that the stick is a weapon for the short term?
I'm glad somebody listens to me.
We'd best hope he doesn't fall for you.
He's more likely to try and kill me.
And why should you care?
Glittering in a place where a heart should be.
Go and make a drink.
Why are we watching this geezer?
Because Lenny hasn't decided what to do with him yet.
Neighbours used to have loads of them in the garden.
With fishing rods.
Little ones.
Sitting on mushrooms.
Mum said it lowered the tone.
- Ha!
Ha!
I'd hardy call fertilizer bomb-making equipment.
"No, no, no, no, the fertilizer's outside."
I put the bomb-making stuff in the community room closet for authenticity.
"Wait, wait, wait, what other bomb-making stuff?"
"A lot of electronics, gasoline, nails, combustible hairspray."
- It's in the community room?
"- Yes, in the closet."
In the closet?
"No, Baber, no."
"No, no, no."
"You realize if someone catches wind of this,"
"You could actually be in serious trouble, right?"
"Ah, I can take it!"
"I'm very tough, I'd survive Gitmo."
Tough?
You're afraid of the moon!
I don't like the way it looks at me.
Ugh.
"You do know that Gitmo's not taking new prisoners, right?"
You'd wind up somewhere much worse like the moon.
"- OK, I'll be good."
- Yeah.
"Now, let's go."
Let's get that stuff in your van and you can return it to the store.
[ dove cooing ]
"This place is a real steal, guys."
"But like I said, I shouldn't be showing it to you, the place is set for demolition."
Are you telling me this used to be an old schoolhouse?
Who would want to demolish this?
It's amazing!
Yes.
The evenings are the most beautiful ones at us.
There is not warmth at this time.
And the blackout?
"Ow, oh my God!"
Do not have yourselves disturbed.
Go to bed.
I am a bad sleeping.
Well it because of that maybe not.
"Appropriate, that we wait for it, the major lord falls asleep."
Why is this girl so sly?
It is not possible to get used to it.
What is an idea under the piano.
"Ow, Gyula."
There is warmth here after all.
"Open it a little the door, Ágika."
what's up dear Tót?
How do you feel?
"Thank you, very well, respectable major lord."
I envy you.
You have lucky nature.
Tell Tót.
Would you not play chess with me?
"Major lord, I am really sorry for it, but i can't."
And a card game?
"I am ashamed of it very much major lord, but..."
I not know the cards.
Then we play with dominos.
"Respectable major lord, I...not know any kind of board game."
Tell it quite openly.
Do you not miss something for you if you are this here sit with your wife and your daughter in a beautiful night?
My pipe was made of the sour cherry tree only.I lost it somewhere unfortunately.
"Well, let's go eat and then you can tell me all about the mysterious John Mercer."
How's the cat?
"What cat would that be, Calum?"
The one out of them science books you was always reading in prison.
Is the cat dead?
Is it not dead?
Is it both dead and not dead?
You remember that?
It's clever shit.
"But that was always your reputation, right?"
"Don't mess with the clever, quiet one."
"Why are you so negative about it all, John?"
I enjoyed sharing a cell with you.
I learned a lot.
Why have you got your eyes closed?
Because when I open them again I'll be waking up in my nice cosy cell.
And you won't be with me.
I'm still here.
"What do you do for them, Calum?"
"You know, pretty much what I've always done."
"Multitasking, bits and bobs, needles and pins."
"Not quite how the judge described it at your sentencing, was it?"
What do they want us to do?
Do the stuff the law can't do.
Dealing with people the law can't reach.
"Come on, John, you're the clever one."
Have you not worked it out yet?
Check out the CVs.
Who can make sure the cat is most definitely dead?
You're the specialist.
You're the killer.
"Morning, flatmate."
"When it's done,"
- do you think you're gonna fly home or...
- I-I-I don't know.
"Look, you don't have a fear of flying."
"You're afraid of something else, but the thought of flying triggers that fear."
"Maybe you're not afraid of flying, you're afraid of going away."
- What do you mean?
I-I don't get that.
- Just...
Ace that presentation.
Ok.
Seniors...
How can we get them to use the Internet?
"In the past, we have simplified it, restricted access, dumbed it down."
But I think that's the wrong approach.
I don't think seniors are any more confused by the Internet than I am.
I think they're afraid of it.
"Watch this video, please."
My name's Al Jordan.
I'm 82 years old.
- Do you ever use the Internet?
- I wouldn't want to mess it up.
We created a mock form that's really a search engine.
"Each time you enter a term, it takes you to a related website, then you have to find your way back."
- The form has changed.
- Yes.
"Now I'm looking outside those,"
- put in Saskatchewan.
- Yes.
So I'm gonna leave you for about three hours
"Wait, wait."
What if I break it?
Um... those are bluebells.
They're for my sister's bouquet.
They're cute.
"We went the ""beauty and meaning"" route, so every flower is symbolic."
"Like,bluebells are for humility."
Peonies.
They're for sharing a happy life.
"And,uh... these little guys?"
Those are... those are lilies of the valley.
They're for sweetness.
# I can feel the pressure building #
# And I want you like I don't know #
"# Oh,boy #"
# I'm a sucker for your sound #
# And I love it when you're around #
# I'm a sucker for your sound #
# You know I'm playing with you now. #
"I missed you so much,my angel."
My heart... is so... full right now.
"So was he crying with... with sound, or just physical tears?"
A little sound.
Did he at least throw himself into traffic after?
No.
"After,we talked about the intense feelings he has for me and why he has them."
"Which should be fun,right?"
I don't know why I spend so much time on my abs when nothing turns women on more than indifference.
"- Not what it's about,Cy."
- All I know is rocker guy was a changed man when he was blowing you off.
And then he cried.
"Just saying,she's a girl who needs the chase."
"- No,I'm not."
"- Yeah,you are."
We're gonna need that tank.
Having a good time?
Yeah.
"By the way, I think I saw April making out with Shep Cale."
"All right, all right."
You need to stop drinking.
Listen.
Read this.
It's a speech.
"Figure you should have something ready, so you don't embarrass yourself."
"You mean so I don't embarrass you, because you don't have to worry."
"Oh, is that how you spell ""venereal disease""?"
"Jake, this day is important to me, okay?"
Just because your life's a big joke doesn't mean you have to treat mine that way.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Why is my life a joke?
Just read the speech.
"No, seriously, Eric, why is my life a joke?"
I'm not getting into this right now.
All right.
You think people don't wonder what you've been doing?
You spend all that time in flight school getting your license.
"Instead of using it, you come back here, and you hang out like it's the summer after high school."
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.
"Well, hey, if I'm such a joke, then why'd you want me as your best man?"
"You didn't want me, did you?"
"No, not really."
Where's that tank?
We're not going to last long against those trucks.
We have to hold out.
Ow!
Damn it!
Looking for some cell service.
"Hey, why don't I sit in your lap and you can drive me around?"
"Two birds, one stone?"
I wasn't that attracted to you anyway.
I'm gonna go try to find some reception.
Seeing Randy miserable is the only thing that'll cheer me up right now.
Maybe he's crying.
"One vodka for the gentleman with the neck tattoo, and two vodkas for the lady who's into that sort of thing."
Thank you.
Your catfish tower's on its way.
It takes two to carry the cocktail sauce lagoon.
Everything on double-zero.
Which has to be the Yelp rating of this boat.
Excuse me?
Could I get a white wine spritzer?
"Oh, come on, Vera."
We share a locker.
"Oh, double-zero."
Winner.
"Yes, I'm a winner again!"
"Suck it, river people."
What is going on over here?
Employees are not allowed to gamble.
"Or, as of last week, sexually harass each other."
"Thanks a lot, Craig."
Ugh.
Poindexter in the radio room wouldn't let me use the satellite phone.
"Also, I broke your satellite phone."
That is it.
You're fired.
"That's the worst news I've heard since you said ""you're hired."""
There's a tug coming to swap out the toilet tanks.
You are not going to destroy my family.
"I wouldn't let that cow, Jeanette, and I won't let you."
That's why I had to kill her.
"All right it's over, Mr. Barr."
I said it's over.
"She didn't care about James, about the family."
A money-grubbing tart.
"He'd given her shares in the company, in her name."
His shares.
Didn't tell me.
"Our American partners were ready to buy them strip our assets, junk us."
It was business trouble.
She was using that.
She wanted a million pounds to sell back the shares.
And so what if she broke us?
And the affair?
"There was no affair, just that day."
"I met her in the hotel, to try and persuade her to sell the shares for a more reasonable sum."
I thought she'd agreed to everything.
She was playing me.
I'd always had... she could look at you and make you feel... it was blackmail.
That's why she did it.
You see in the end
I didn't have a choice.
So it was a question of business.
What about your brother's first wife?
That wasn't business was it?
That was jealousy.
Because that was the one thing of your brother's that you couldn't make your own.
So you took it from him.
Hey George!
"Come on, wake up!"
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Fandor!
Open up!
"Of course, the wires have been cut."
What has happened?
You're in such a mess!
It is impossible for Fantomas to leave this room.
I have the same opinion.
Who are you?
"Inspector Juve, police."
I thought you were dead!
"I was such a bore in the next world with my stories of Fantômas, that they sent me back to Earth."
You feel better?
"Okay, okay."
I tried to help.
And someone hit me on the head.
So it's you who entered first?
Obviously since my room is the closest to yours.
Why do you say that Fantômas has not come out of this room?
He was able to leave by the window.
The glass is broken.
And his mask is hooked.
I can assure you that Fantômas did not escape through this window.
Why try to deny the obvious?
The evidence?
"You know, sir, that you're in the fourth floor, that there is no ledge or balcony, that unless proven otherwise, nobody saw Fantomas fly."
He only smashed the glass to give the change and delude us.
If not by the window so how did he get out?
"In any case, not by the door either."
- (farmers):
Ready!
I say we shoot whatever it is and ask the questions after!
- (farmers cheering)
- You pull a stunt like that and it'd be murder.
"I'll personally see to it that you all bloody hang for it, no matter who pulls the trigger."
She killed a man and won't get away with it as long as I'm standing.
"Night will fall soon, that's when she's likely to move."
Ready the torches!
"You'll not be readying anything until I say so, got it?"
Right then.
Each of you will pair up with a constable.
"Crabtree, you talk to that farmer."
"You, stick with me!"
♪♪♪ (indistinct chatter)
- Keep your eyes open!
- Yes.
Do you see that trail?
"Ah, George, there you are!"
- Sir.
- I need you to come with me.
"The girl, Fen, she's likely to flee from the light of the torches."
"But then, sir, how will we see?"
- With these.
- Good gracious!
"Now, George, if you were trying to get away, which direction would you be likely to go in?"
"- Sir, I would follow the river."
- Exactly.
(door closing)
So you have something?
Not yet.
I need more information on Roland.
Serve them!
I knew it was a fish from the beginning!
Thank you.
- Here.
"- Don't let anyone see, alright?"
"- Here, take it."
- We only got it today.
That's absurd!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Bastard!
Jean Louis!
My mother told me I'd find you in Capri.
So what are you doing in this corner of the world?
It's my duty to come here for the revolution.
"Ah, yes, I had forgotten about Count Marx."
And I had forgotten how deep your cynicism runs.
Yours and that of your entire generation.
"Come Jean Louis, you wouldn't be a student of Marx... if his blood wasn't much bluer than yours."
And where is it written that you have to be a proletariat in order to fight for justice?
You don't understand the youth of today... you can't imagine how different they are.
You wouldn't recognize the world that will come out of this world.
The imperialists and their lackeys will be defeated.
"Hey, Malaparte, Jimmy sends word that he can't come."
He was supposed to bring me a medic.
Did something happen?
"No, no."
He won't be able to come
He wants you to cover for him.
We have to go.
Ciao.
"It has, like, Compressed some minerals."
"Gold likes to travel,"
But gold gets stuck with Other heavies pretty easily.
So we're thinking All we have to do.
Is jack up one of these Boulders.
And that might give us a clue On where the gold deposits are.
"So we got to boulder here,"
But I got to get some straps Around the boulder.
Zeke will try To float the massive stone.
Using straps and an air bag.
I don't do a lot of Boulder floating so
I don't know How this is gonna go down.
"All right, Just don't be under the boulder."
When you lift it.
But hoisting A 200-pound rock 35 feet down.
In the bering sea Is easier said than done.
Is that Enough slack?
Yes.
I think I'm gonna try to lift On it and see what happens.
Whoa.
Off the coast Of remote sledge island...
I think I'm gonna try to Lift on it and see what Happens.
Zeke tenhoff Is trying to pull.
A 200-pound boulder from The depths of the bering sea.
Whoop.
Whoa.
I see it.
There it is.
Are you okay?
"Well, I just Lost a float bag."
Looks like you didn't Strap it on good enough.
"Um, well, I'm just gonna Look under this boulder."
It's a marked trail.
It's a trail.
So we're going through The middle of bum.
The only trail there.
Those are a lot Of mights and maybes.
We might find a trail.
It may be marked.
There's supposed To be a path.
"When they find The access point to the claim,"
They'll have to Bring in a dredge.
"Built specifically To launch from riverbanks,"
One that brad's commandeered For the mission.
You know what?
We really should've came here One day of scouting.
Without the boat And everything.
It doesn't matter.
It's here now.
"We need it here, Regardless of what we do."
"I know a few miners around Town, And my buddy let me use."
His dredge.
"- Good, take it forward."
- There we go.
I bring a lot of Different things.
"You know, always trying to Inspire the other family Member."
That's what We try and do.
"You know, maybe we do it In an unorthodox way,"
But we're trying To inspire each other.
"To become better citizens, Better people overall."
And probably better Gold dredgers.
"Now, hopefully, The river claim."
Is only an atv ride away... find us the easiest Road down there.
Or the kellys' plan Could be washed away.
except to say that we probably don't want to be here when they arrived.
They ?
Who's they ?
Is this an interview or a hit ?
"Whatever , man."
Do you got any more cookies ?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
How about this.
"If you shoot me, I'll tell you where they are, and I'll throw in the recipe."
How're you going to do that dead ?
Start shooting and find out !
Hadi...haha.
"Excuse me, I need to confer with my colleague ."
Again?
Yea.
Again.
"Don't worry, I won't move this time."
I'll be right here when you get back.
"I know we have to off this guy coz that's what we got to do, but I don't want to do it until I know why he wants us to do it."
"I mean, something's wrong here."
"What's this, Daze ?"
I mean a guy doesn't just get up and highjack a truck chucked full of cash and cologne to get himself rub out.
There're other ways.
I want this guy's story but getting it will just make our job harder.
I mean it changes everything.
that's why they don't name any other pigs on a sausage farm.
And for that reason I think we shouldn't talk to him anymore.
That's going to be tough.
He's interesting.
He sure is.
How about those cookies?
- I'm not in the militia.
- What's going on here?
- Keep out of this.
"No, don't do that."
"In my hospital, we don't usually leave the injured lying on the floor."
- Put him back on the drip.
"- Today, he's been lucky."
But I won't always be here to keep our men back.
"It's my job to help people, regardless of their political camp."
Does that mean you don't distinguish between victims and executioners?
He needs an operation now.
Do you have an operating theatre?
"Yes, but we don't have a doctor any more."
If you could assist me...
I can.
I studied medicine.
Our friend Benítez obviously isn't losing any time.
Right.
They'll soon be able to get supplies from the north again.
He's a cunning old fox.
I wonder how they managed to finish the bridge so quickly.
We must blow that thing up.
Look at that.
"Hey, that lorry was part of the ammunition transport."
"- Yes, we couldn't be more lucky."
- There'll be some fireworks!
All we need to do is attach the explosives.
"Hey, leave that bag here and go and meet Emiliano."
Stop!
Get out of the car!
"Come on, hurry!"
Listen.
"Well then, let's get back to business, cos I'm late for my ballet class."
Finish the job or face the consequences.
Am I clear?
Well...
"I got news for you, Number One."
"Given the situation, I see why you're T.O and all."
"But, what's done is done."
And my partner comes first.
- What's that supposed to mean?
"- It means... that if you try to take her out or get into the middle of our job, you're in front world of hurt!"
"I know what you're capable of, but we're pros too."
We also know that you're comin' now.
Do you know what I wanted to be when I was your age?
I don't either.
I like you kid.
"You're in over your head and you're scared, yet you look death in the eye without blinking."
"It's admirable, but it won't save you."
It won't save your partner and it won't save your new pal.
Finish the job or face the consequences.
You've got an hour.
Sorry about that stuff I said before.
What's them?
When I called you stupid and stuff.
That's okay.
Did you find anymore bullets all around?
Hey.
Wanna hear somethin'?
Your daughter doesn't hate you.
How do you know?
I know.
"Well, could you?"
You never even met her.
And a bit risky.
"Well, the only way to get what you want is to risk what you have."
That's a belief you and I share.
And what is it that you want?
I'll find Audrey another date.
"You want Grace involved in this, fine."
But I can't have her working against us.
Why were you even there?
"I wanted to meet the person who was planning on screwing my husband, and I'm glad I did because that woman wanted to have your baby."
They're all looking for a connection.
That's why they're seeing an escort.
You of all people should know that.
Don't make this about me and Simon.
You know I have to have a date.
Then I want to be there.
"And I want a date, too."
I tell you what.
"If it'll make you more comfortable, you choose my date, and I'll choose someone for you."
This is insane.
Maybe.
Probably.
We don't have to do this.
"You just say the word, I'll call the whole thing off."
"No, I-I don't know where we're going, but..."
We can't go back to what we were.
So... tell me... what are you looking for in a escort?
- Thanks for coming.
- This better be important.
I've left you three messages over the last couple of days.
Your date for the party.
She's fun.
She's friendly.
What does she think of herself?
Calm down!
Shut up and listen to me!
What the fuck do you think you are doing!
Come to your senses!
Have you lost it!
I don't know what kind of tuitions you have been giving.
But learn this from me.
Take out your sim card!
Stay away from them they are rich and connected!
They will get you busted so bad you won't know what hit you!
Give me the sim card I will throw it away.
If you throw my sim card then how will my sisters call me?
Give them my number!
And what if someone calls you?
- Have you ever heard my phone ring?
Use my card and give them this number.
I am not going to let her get away with this!
I will cut her to pieces!
Don't talk shit.
We are out of booze as well!
Come...
Come on...
This godforsaken town is a real shit hole!
You place your trust in people thinking they are your friends.
But the moment you turn around they ram it right up your ass.
I'll go give this number to my sisters.
"Ok, but now don't go stressing them out as well."
"Hello, Sonu!"
Are you alright?
Who's number is this?
"It's a friend's number, save it on your phone."
"Be there, Thursday church, or never after look me in the face."
- I...
- Speak not.
"Reply not, do not answer me."
My fingers itch!
"My lord, you're in the wrong, my lord, to punish her."
Is that my lady wisdom's view?
Take care.
You dice with your place in talking thus.
May not one speak?
"Oh, will you be quiet, you fool!"
- Now...
"- No, husband, you are too hot."
"God's blood, it does make me mad!"
"Day, night, month, year!"
My constant care... has been to have my only child worthily matched.
"And here I find an educated man of equal birth with honorable parts, with fine estates and handsome to behold, and what is my reward?"
"A puking fool, who answers, ""I'll not wed."
I cannot love.
I am too young.
"I pray you pardon me."""
Now think on this.
Thursday is near.
"If you will play the bride, then are you my daughter and all is forgot."
"If you will not, then you are mine no more."
Graze where you will.
You shall not house with me.
"Beg, starve or hang,"
"I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, nor pass to you the slightest thing that's mine."
"I swear to this, my word, so help me God!"
How can Father speak so to a child who loves him better than she loves herself?
"Oh, oh, God."
"- How do you do, more like."
"- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!"
- The pleasure is all mine.
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
- You've found out my name.
The area is crawling with my spies.
You cannot venture out to nature...
- So nature must be brought to you.
- How beautiful.
- These are not from the hothouse.
- Mine is not the first offering.
- They come from an obliging field.
- I always prefer wild flowers.
- Would you...?
- Our gratitude is beyond words.
I've grieved for this lonely house.
Then I heard it was taken.
I felt an interest which nothing can account for but my present delight.
"Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby."
Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?
- Marianne is reading them out.
- And which are your favourites?
Mine is 116.
"""Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments."""
"""Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds. -"
"- Or bends with the remover to remove..."""
- How does it continue?
"- ""No."
"It is an ever fixed mark..."""
"- ""That looks on tempests..."""
"- Is it ""tempests""?"
It's strange you are reading these.
Can brother come along too?
Everyone has a free will.
They can come if they want or not come... if they don't want to.
It doesn't make a difference to me.
How much is this for?
You dare attack from behind?
Come on put it in neutral.
Who is it?
Jabbar sir it wasn't us.
Here.
Get your self treated.
Here.
Goodbye.
That's Jabbar the beggar...
What happened?
Did the tank explode?
No you've been exposed.
Take look.
Look.
Last night was the most embarrassing night... in the History of politics.
The entire country was shocked to see this.
25 MLA s of minister Vishwas Pradhan... were caught along with prostitutes late in the night... and in front of the entire media.
The unknown person that informed the media... calls himself a social-worker.
This is a conspiracy of the opposition.
The parliament speaker... has decided to suspend all the MLA s.
And the ruling have given a statement that... they are ready for a hung assembly...
But they will never take the support of these MLA s.
I am ruined.
My power's gone.
And wife too.
Rascal swine pervert.
Yes!
You made me crazy.
"You,like,told me to look for the signs."
"Like bird poop and lightning bolts or,like,actual signs?"
"I don't know if you've noticed, but there's a lot of signage out there in the world."
I told you only to pay attention to the really obvious ones.
"The signs,thus far,have been conflicting."
Would you like me to come with you and show you the correct ones?
I could ring a bell and point.
"This is not about me,okay?"
A very nice person could get hurt.
Nice people get hurt every day.
"Sometimes,it's good for them."
"Did I,like,screw you out of land during the Renaissance or something?"
Why do you hate me so much?
- This is me liking you.
"- Well,can you stop?"
"And,seriously,how are you so slim?"
Here's what you got right.
Ready?
It's not just about you.
That's all you're getting.
"You want a burger,baby?"
No.
So how am I the stupidest person in the world?
When did that happen?
I think you've been working towards that for a while.
I am totally stuck.
I cannot break up with him again.
"He's the most loving,open guy."
All he wants to do is give and share.
The absolute worst word you can use to describe a guy is what?
"""Busty""? ""Emotional."""
Just switching things up a little bit.
"You know, it's like having breakfast for dinner."
Mmm!
"Now, about this van, I mean, it really is a super-cool idea for the future."
"- I mean, it's like the perfect plan."
- I haven't told you the plan.
"Great, cause I do not understand it."
"I think I've found an untapped market that, if properly assessed, may be poised... to explode."
"Okay, I get it."
"It's like you have a huge pile of dynamite, and you just lit the fuse."
I can see it right now--
I still haven't told you the idea.
"Great, 'cause I still don't understand it."
I'm gonna show you.
"And, mom, trust me, this isn't some, like, get-rich-quick plan."
"Oh, like your dad's idea for the reverse microwave, where it makes the food cold?"
Reverse microwave's a good idea in a world where a freezer doesn't exist.
Mom...
"[ Sighs ] you believe in me, right?"
Of course.
[ Both laugh ]
You think you maybe want to put on some pants today?
Pants are for closers.
I'm a bum.
What are you doing?
I always do that.
It turns me on.
Ooh!
Ooh!
What is it?
I was thinking about how you lost your mayor's job.
Stupid city council impeached me.
Okay.
I'll get corroboration from another source.
Thank you.
"All right, Dad, what did we do wrong this time?"
Nothing. I just... I have something I have to tell you guys.
is somebody sick?
"No, sweetie, it's nothing like that."
"Something has happened at work, or because of work, and I don't know that it's bad yet."
"It's too soon to tell, but it might be bad."
- You're going broke?
"- No, but I suppose it could happen."
- There's an investigation of Atlantor.
- By the police?
"Sort of, yeah."
It's called a grand jury.
- [Eli] That's serious.
- [Jessie] Do you get arrested?
"No, honey."
"No, no."
It's not like that.
[Jessie] Then what's wrong?
"Well, I'm not exactly sure, and that's part of the problem."
"There are some people who could be arrested,"
- l guess.
- But not you.
"Well, there's nothing they would arrest me for."
We should not worry about this before anything...
You're saying you could be arrested?
"Well, anything's possible, E, but, no, I really don't think that that's what this is about."
"Jess, honey, listen, listen to me."
"I do not think anything bad is going to happen, okay?"
"I can't guarantee you that, and I'm sorry."
- But she's not saying that now.
- She's lying.
She's a prime candidate for severe...
I want to be sure she doesn't have post partum depression just as much as you do.
But it can be one of the most difficult conditions to diagnose.
"And if the patient is in complete denial or lying to me, not only can I not tell, but I cannot hold her."
I gave her every opportunity to let us know.
I'm sorry.
- Need a hand?
- I need eight.
"Oh, God, it hurts!"
What's this?
Driver of our auto-versus-pedestrian.
The guy ran out in front of me.
"Please, give me something."
"No neck pain, no chest pain, good vitals, but complains of bilateral thumb pain."
Look at this.
I can't even make a fist.
And we're out of beds.
"Okay, let's park him."
I'll see what I can do.
"Dr. Weaver, Psych's refusing to admit Judy Anderson."
Psych?
I believe her condition was a deliberate act.
"Yes, I know you suspect postpartum depression,"
- but did she admit it?
- Practically.
She drove head-on into a wall.
The baby's seat wasn't properly anchored.
She's obviously overwhelmed at home.
ER.
Please hold.
"Those are my orders, I can't stand hooligans."
You've come at a good time.
It's about the meeting.
"I told the boss, he wants us to follow procedure."
"You know what to do, so get over there."
What are you doing here?
"Take the kids, quick!"
"Come here, Naou."
"Wait here, I'll be back in a while."
"Good day, Touré."
How are you?
And the family?
"Today I've come to thank you, for the work you did with my wife."
It was a complete success.
My wife adores me.
And all thanks to God and your work.
- I thank you.
- Give thanks to God!
To his Grace!
"Today, my main concern in this visit... is the factory."
"In these violent times, it's enough to wear a new shirt... to awaken envy, even if the person... is not concerned."
I come to you for protection.
I've told you Traoré is evil.
"And now the workers have stopped working, to go to the meeting."
Who could have lightened the work load?
It's the new engineer.
He's reduced the cloth price.
"And when such a person calls a meeting, to discuss our problems, I think it's... something good, that we should... all value."
What do you say?
You're right.
"Our union delegates are a bunch of stool-pigeons, trust them... and you'll bury yourself alive."
So let's fire them!
I am an Allied agent and I need your help.
- Is Major George Stirling here?
- That's me.
It's an honor to meet you.
"I have colleagues on the outside, right now, helping me plan a breakout."
The men who escape with me will help train Resistance fighters from here all the way to the Northern Coast.
I'm not risking these men's lives for anything less than a solid plan.
"If we're gonna turn things around, we need to do something now."
You can't just wait here to die.
- We're digging a tunnel.
- Danny.
You can trust me.
"I broke in for you, didn't I?"
- We're clearing a foot a day.
- When do you expect to finish?
"Three months, give or take."
Then we're all getting out.
- We don't have that much time.
- Time 'til what?
I can't say.
"But we have weeks, not months."
It's an important operation.
It could make the difference.
We need your most experienced men.
"Your strongest, to help train civilian recruits."
So what's your plan?
Next time on work detail
I'll give a signal.
My team will provide covering fire while we break for the woods.
Ahh!
They said you told them nothing at the gate.
"You are a mystery, and I am a curious person."
[tense music]
His readings could triangulate when wind and sound
- make contact with an object.
- How does that help us?
"If we can pinpoint the precise point of impact every time wind hits that object,"
I think I can build a 3D outline of what the crime scene looked like.
You can get me a face?
"If his data's reliable,"
I'll be able to show you who killed Roger before you're done with dinner.
You just signed your new client.
Give him what he wants.
[computer beeping]
[footsteps approaching]
"Dad, what're you doing?"
I was thinking we might go camping.
Like in the backyard?
"Uh, no, a little further than that."
I thought we could head up north.
Thought we could sleep under the stars just for a while.
Doesn't that sound fun?
We'd go outside the wall?
"Well, yes."
Would we have to go through the Red Zone to get there?
Since when have you been worried about the Red Zone?
"My Spiga Scout leader says bad people live there, and they hate us."
That's why we have the wall.
"Hazel, your scout leader is a dummy."
"Now, come on."
We'd be together the whole time.
We'd share an adventure.
You and me.
"- I don't wanna go there, Dad."
It closed a Iong time ago.
I'm just kidding
"Everyone, look who's here!"
Aren't you...
Rin!
It's been ages!
"We've selected promising students, and assigned them to the lacrosse and beach volleyball teams."
"In order to promote such disciplines, we plan to produce comics and novels."
We're working on sports entertainment and documentary film programs.
"We've set up a dedicated Internet server, and will soon launch a blog."
This chart shows the expected investment results.
Enough about investments.
Is this marketable or not?
There are two things worth investing in.
Power and beauty.
The days of investment in power are numbered.
This leaves beauty.
sell beauty.
The meeting's over.
The old Ms. Isezaki asked...
"Oh, he's gone."
Why did the dojo close?
I don't really know.
It was very sudden.
"But I had a premonition, you know."
"But if everyone else had no idea, it must've been a shock for them."
However I...
I've checked on the author of the article.
Remember me?
I'm Rin Sakurazawa.
Rin Sakurazawa!
Rin!
"If I go there, I got to shop around."
I'm too lazy to choose.
"You can go out, just to hang out."
It's fun.
"What do you mean, ""go out just to hang out?"""
Go out just to hang out you know?
I don't get it.
What are you saying?
Sometimes I think you are messing with me.
I'm not messing with you.
Why would I do that?
What do you find entertaining?
Hmm...
Thinking of new projects.
Hey that is work.
No.
Work is when someone hires us to do something.
This is thinking of stuff to do on our own.
Then how about sports?
Sports?
I like to play badminton but I have no one to play with.
You don't meet up with your friends at all?
I meet them sometimes at funerals and weddings.
"But I can't really invite anyone out, since my schedule always changes."
Do you have a girlfriend?
Dang!
This has anything to do with my rash?
Seriously.
"Some people think there is no link, but a patient's lifestyle has an effect on their disease."
"And if I don't, what is your medical opinion on having one or not?"
It actually depends on the person.
"Some people have one and it's good, but for some, it's bad."
- Go.
- Ain't you joining?
I joined last month.
"- Hey, I wanna ask a question."
- Yeah?
"If we joined up, don't we get a uniform or something?"
"Man, the Black Legion's got the doggonest uniform you ever laid eyes on."
"One that will throw fear into the hearts of all them rotten, ungrateful foreigners."
One bar ain't enough.
It goes to prove it.
The man was hungry and there should be two bars a day because--
He eats as much as we all do.
"Say, are you gonna let him bust in on me like that?"
"What do you mean, talking to the judge like that, you mug?"
"I'm sorry, Your Honor, but let me explain something."
There should be two bars a day.
One in the morning and one in the afternoon.
Do I have to put up with that little slug interrupting all the time?
You two guys better get along together.
I'll kick you both out of court.
"Okay, the state rests."
What do you do?
"Oh, we rest too."
Then the jury will retire and consider a verdict.
"- Hey, Butch."
"- Yes, sir?"
Come here.
- When did you see Jim last?
"- Oh, about an hour ago in the dormitory."
Yeah.
I'll look him up and have a talk with him.
Didn't I tell you everything would be all right?
Right.
You pointed the finger at Cole.
You led everyone up the garden path.
"Meanwhile, we've got two coppers murdered."
I'm not saying another word without a solicitor.
"Fine, we'll continue this conversation at AC-12 under caution, a date to be appointed by us."
Thank you.
Sir.
You have to shut this down.
I will not let anyone put you on the spot about Cole.
We both know why.
Shut this down now.
You know the secrets I can spill.
"Why don't you come into AC-12 with your solicitor, you tell us you heard the Caddy rumour about Cole off some old lag, dead or lost his marbles, and you leave me to do the rest?"
And?
There's always an and.
And... you turn over all the stuff you've got on me.
End of.
End of?
"The incriminating item I've got on you, that's my only insurance."
You need me to shut this down.
I'm small fry.
You're the big fish.
So what'll happen when they find out about all that evidence you've been sitting on?
Hm?
The contacts in that phone.
The call history.
"All in my past, mind."
"Now, that isn't something anyone could shut down."
"Now, you're what?"
Six months off retiring?
Four and a half.
"Who alibied out, by the way..."
The last two knives went missing.
"Well, Lanie discovered there are two different murderers operating on either coast using identical weapons."
All we have to do...
"Oh, whoa, whoa."
"No, no, no."
"T-there is no ""we."" You two are done."
"And if I catch either of you working this case,"
I'll have you both arrested for obstruction.
"No, no, no, no."
Mm.
"Hey, maybe a little single malt scotch will smooth things over?"
Go home.
Excuse me.
"T-this just came for you, Mr. Castle."
Oh.
Um... thanks.
Looks like Menendez isn't the only one unhappy about last night.
Mason wants to see Kendall and me right away.
Good luck.
What's that?
This is payback.
Thanks for coming in.
Where is everyone else?
Their enthusiasm for both of you waned after the way you conducted yourselves last night.
"It was messy, boarish, lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member."
- It was her fault.
- It was his fault.
"No, it was my fault, thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip's shoes."
"Mr. Wood, please."
Give me another chance.
"No, give me another chance."
Are Claire and Alex natural?
"He wants me, Mother!"
I'm sure he wants you.
He wants you to cook and clean for him!
- He found you through an ad.
"- I already know, Mom."
Sorry.
"It's not your average proposal, but let's face it."
They're not standing in line for me.
And we like each other!
Then say yes!
I can live alone.
"If you think such a marriage is normal, then go ahead."
Why do you do that?
Why do you make it sound so pathetic?
You had a life.
A husband who adored you.
Can't I have some of that?
"I'm getting older, too."
Why can't you be happy for me?
"But you can't, can you?"
You're scared to death of being alone.
And you're jealous.
Jealous because a man wants me.
A good-looking man.
How ridiculous!
"Well, you know something, Mom?"
A man does.
"Today, Gregory Larkin and Rose Morgan have exchanged rings and agreed to recognize each other as equals."
They shall seek a life of kindness and understanding.
The ceremony of marriage is a means of establishing a home.
"And as you have exchanged vows before witnesses, by the authority vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife."
"And then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud."
He'll draw every light from every goon tower.
It's our only chance to cut through.
"What do you say, barracks chief?"
"He's right, Hoffy."
It's either Price or Dunbar.
"He killed Johnson and Manfredi, didn't he?"
It's all yours.
"What's the matter, Price?"
"You said you were gonna save Dunbar, didn't you?"
So now you're getting your chance.
"So long, Cookie."
"You can have the department store, what's left of it."
"So long, Sefton."
"You're not disposing of those Russian broads, are you?"
Tell you what to do.
Get yourself 100 cigarettes for the Kraut guards.
Then get yourself another face.
- You could use a new one too.
-Ha-ha-ha.
Let's synchronize the watches.
It's 11:42 sharp.
Check.
Just one more word.
If I ever run into any of you bums on a street corner just let's pretend we never met before.
Shut off the moaning or you'll have the machine guns on us.
"Shut it off, lieutenant."
My legs are frozen.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly one minute and 20 seconds.
- Sefton.
"-What'd you expect, a St. Bernard dog?"
- Not you.
"But this is thievery of the educated, done for easy money"
"Mrs Batra, I might report him to the police."
But I haven't the heart
But he will never gain admission into any university.
That's his punishment
He will never find employment in any computer company
His future...
I'm very sorry.
But Why did he steal?
Whatever the reason might've been only Jagadish can tell
You have betrayed my faith in you!
"Not you, all of us bear the punishment"
How much money did you make out of selling papers?
Even you think I'd do such a thing?
I was just helping a friend
"At least you'd understand that, I learnt it only from you"
Learnt from me?
What?
Thieving?
What am I?
A thief?
Helping friends!
Is this how you help friends?
By robbing?
"You haven't a degree, you have no future."
You're ruined
You are a thief!
I am a thief's brother.
And that's the truth
You will achieve nothing in life
"Jai was my weakness, you were my strength"
"But today, you make me weak."
He--he's near the top of the list.
"UNOS will find him his organs, when they find him his organs."
And God knows that staying up all night chatting about it is not gonna help.
I'm gonna go get some sleep.
I suggest you do the same.
He's running out of time.
They always are.
Welcome to peds.
Of all of the tools on a surgical tray...
Sound judgment is the trickiest one to master.
"And without it, we're all just toddlers running around with 10-blades."
"Oh, I asked them not to wake you."
"I said, ""Whatever it is, it can wait till morning""."
"""Dr. Shepherd needs his beauty sleep""."
Your latest head CT shows that the brain contusions are expanding.
I'm gonna get you into the OR right away.
This--this brain thing.
It--it could kill me?
"If we don't treat it, yes."
You find that funny?
I'm sorry.
It's just that they're gonna execute me in five days.
Five days.
"Might as well take my chances with this brain thing, right?"
- Mr. Dunn--
"- You gotta admit, it's a nice way to go."
Plenty of attractive females.
All the jell-o I could want.
Have you tried the strawberry?
- It'll change your life.
- You're refusing surgery?
"Either way, I'm going to die, dr."
Kozlenko's require a Class A security clearance.
"And in 1988 there were only two people, other than the operatives themselves with that kind of clearance on that specific project."
"One of them Yale, is dead."
"Oh god, what the hell is this?"
You are the one that set up agent Kozlenko.
You told the Stazi about the defection.
And you helped set the trap that killed him.
You have no proof.
"Actually sir, I do, the money."
The ten million dollars marked for Kozlenko.
Once a year the bank needs a signature to renew the account.
I checked it out.
"It was your signature, sir."
The only thing
I can't figure out is whether Jared Clayton was working for you.
Or you were working for him?
"I knew you were ambitious, Henry."
I just didn't know how ambitious.
"Security is on its way up to you, sir."
You might want to call your lawyer.
I'm not going to be calling anybody.
"Sir, you were saying?"
Sounds good.
I'll release the statement in the morning.
"You should get some sleep, agent Davis."
You sound tired.
It's been a long week.
"Yeah, yeah, I"
- I can hear him.
"Uh, yapping in the background."
Is he house broken yet?
"Mm, sorta."
- You're all right.
"Somebody's going to snap you up, wait and see."
You saw what happened in Boise.
What happened?
Didn't you see all the guys in the diner breaking their necks to look you over?
- I didn't see that.
- Sure.
How often does a girl like you come into a place like that anyway?
"Now, you see, in the morning we'll take the old elevator down... and we'll be on our way."
I wish it could have been you.
It would have been better.
You go to sleep.
I think you should go back.
Back where?
He wasn't even sure where he was.
- What if it was them?
- He wasn't sure.
You did the right thing.
Let the National Guard go look.
- It's what they're there for.
"- Ladies, would you mind holding it down?"
I'm trying to think.
- What if it was my brother that was down?
"- Now, quit!"
I don't even want to think about that.
- Edgar'd go after him.
- You don't know that for sure.
I think he would.
"You marry a mail-plane pilot, see how anxious you are to send him off in one."
"When the time comes, we all have to take care of each other."
Nobody else will.
You'd hold your breath every time he left and wouldn't let it out until he'd come home.
"Got to keep drawing their fire, all right?"
Got it.
Give me another mag.
Where are you going?
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill and shot on the gunner.
All right.
I got your back.
All right.
Cover him!
"Rob, why eliminate witnesses?"
"I mean,whoever's tracking you, they either... want to use the bomb for themselves or... they want to keep you from using it, but... either way, wh-what difference do witnesses make?"
"I mean, the bombs have fingerprints,don't they?"
Something that make them traceable.
I remember reading that.
It's the uranium.
"It has, uh..."
It has a specific signature.
It places the origin of the device where it was made.
"So there were dozens of these things used in the attacks,right?"
And now you have the last one.
Yeah.
"Robert, I don't, I don't think these people are looking at this thing as a weapon."
It's more than that.
It's...
Evidence.
It's the smoking gun behind the greatest crime in the history of the world.
Huh.
The bomb... it could expose the people who were responsible for the attacks.
That's why they need it back.
Yeah.
Did you see what I just did?
Bittu would have died and the other kid would have gone to jail.
This is the same thing that'll happen to Boss and Shiv.
I don't understand.
Boss will kill Shiv and will be executed for that.
But boss is our man!
I don't even trust my father.
"This an old habit of mine - first clear the garbage, then clear the record."
Why are you outside?
From today your outgoing and the phone's incoming are both out.
Go into your room and shut the door
And you can watch t.v
Untill I call you out...marriage must take place
Now go?
Ayushman boss arrive
Were is your boss?
My work is to release water.
Boss so much of power Your plant grew
This is what you call Power plant
So you are Ayushman Takur?
Arrange a meeting in the 5-star lobby.
Sir how can I assist you?
Will you kill Shiv in jail?
What are you saying Takur?
I know your story.
You clear garbage and then clean your record.
If I kill him in your jail won't you be investigated or not?
The media already has footage of you and that boy.
Why provoke more attention?
So what can we do boss
Kill Shiv not in jail but outside.
Superb!
"What do you say, Ayushman?"
"That, and the fact that she speaks English."
- You didn't have to do this.
"- But it's teatime, and I wanted to..."
"Oh, no."
"Beatrice, I told you to doily-line the plates."
You don't have to doily-line the plates.
- Hello.
- We're in the dining room.
"- Rory, you're already here."
- You're out of breath.
- I ran over from the office.
- You didn't have to run.
Your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us.
That certainly justifies a run.
"All right, everybody, sit."
"Pour the tea, Beatrice."
"Actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on... pouring the tea for just a minute?"
Thank you very much.
"Grandma, Grandpa, I would like to propose an idea to you."
You can go for it or not.
It's entirely up to you.
But I would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset.
We won't get upset.
- And you will try to keep an open mind.
- All right.
And you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond.
She's been hanging around you far too much.
"Rory, we accept your terms."
Please proceed.
Thank you.
"First, let me start by saying that Mom doesn't know I'm here."
"She'd probably be mad if she knew that I was, but I feel this is important."
Do you have no pride?
"You're like a cheap whore who'll do whatever her man wants, you know that?"
What about the honeymoon?
Did the director say anything?
"Come on, cooperate with me."
That man was mine since I was sixteen.
That can't be.
Have you been here before?
Have you been here?
I just passed by it on the way to a company workshop.
I'm really a bastard.
"Ever since that day, I think about having you half the day, every day."
I think that's all that's occupying my thoughts.
"Sometimes I wonder, how can I be less of a bastard and still hold you in my arms?"
"I was always like, ""What should I do?"" ""Can I make a move first?"""
But I was afraid that I would be embarassed.
Aren't you taking too much meds?
Why are you taking meds so often?
It hurts.
Is something bothering you that I don't know about?
There's no such thing.
-Why does it hurt so often then?
- I don't know.
Maybe something's growing inside.
Don't even say that!
It just comes too often.
-Could it be really brain tumor?
-Stop saying that and go to a hospital.
It will stop.
"Sis, did you go out?"
I thought you said you weren't going out.
"What does Harry have to say this morning, my dear?"
"I said, what does Harry say this morning?"
"Oh, nothing much."
I'll wager my gout hurts him more than it does me.
Does he send any news I can hear?
"Oh, he just says that he walked through the East End recently."
"""I have never seen such deplorable housing conditions."
"Surely the city fathers should find the funds to..."""
"Well, then he just goes on to say about the housing conditions."
They must be pretty dreadful.
He's quite right.
They're disgraceful.
I was saying at the club before I left.
"Now, there's a problem Harry could get his teeth into."
He's just the man to...
"Here, here, my dear."
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I suppose I'm just not very interested in housing conditions at the moment.
You mean because a man doesn't cover the pages with sentiment?
Nonsense.
"A woman must learn to read between the lines, my dear."
"Yes, I like the tone of that letter."
"And what's more, my dear, I think my gout is getting very much better."
"- Oh, hello, Marcia."
- Are you here alone?
"Yes, yes."
I just made some tea.
Come and have a cup.
"Not me, nor you either."
We ain't got time.
"Get dressed, we're going out."
- Are you trying to shut down my performance?
"- You may have your event, if after the performance, you give up the girl."
- That's ridiculous.
- You've grown too attached.
The society has decided that they will do with Isabel as they see fit.
It's time for her to be placed.
- I refuse.
- I thought all these characters...
I thought it was part of my therapy.
"But then I started having all these dreams, and some of them turned out to be real, like..."
like... like hurting you and and Roderick.
I don't know what happened to Roderick.
He did this to me.
They need to be punished.
But how?
- Gunther.
"- You should go back to your room, Mary."
- You fill the goblets for the society rituals?
"Please, help us, Gunther."
- Thank you.
"- There's something you should know, ma'am, about one of the men who's judging you tonight."
"Look for the one that says ""wolf's bane."""
- This?
- Yes.
"- Hide, hide, hide."
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.
End this.
- Why are you in here?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Is the disgusting... repulsive little urchin sampling my wares?
And you?
I trusted you.
I had to do what was best for my family.
- Don't you ever call me again.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
Not sorry enough.
What are you reading?
Seeing with Serenity:
How to Cope With What Life Deals You.
I took a trip to the self-help section at the bookstore.
"So far, it's just pages and pages of vague platitudes."
"Mom, you've been avoiding my calls."
I didn't know what I wanted to say.
I wish I could turn back the clock and make a different decision.
- But I can't.
- I know.
You seem angrier at me than Kevin or Tommy.
Am I wrong?
Probably not.
You hold me to a different standard than anyone else.
That's not fair.
Yes.
"You're right, it's not fair."
I just always felt this connection with you.
You raise a boy and you don't expect them to tell you anything.
You're lucky if they acknowledge you on their way out the door.
But you always confided in me.
I felt like you trusted me to handle whatever came along.
I never had that relationship with my mother.
I always thought I had it with you.
"Mom, we do have that relationship."
The last thing in the world I wanted to do was hurt you.
He wasn't?
He knew.
It was just one of those things that happens.
"He was growing up, and that was hard for you both."
"He loved you very, very much, Mr Watson."
And that's what he was thinking when he died.
I just wish I could see him one more time.
I wish I could tell him that I was sorry.
"He knows, Mr Watson."
He knows.
( cries )
"It's okay, Dad."
You can let go.
Now I can see why those people want you so badly.
"When it gets dark, we shoot for the windows again."
"At the same time, we bring two men through the hallway."
"He'll be down on the floor, won't be looking to the door."
We've got a man up in the heating ducts.
"He'll coordinate by earphone, drop down through at the same time the two men from the hall enter."
And then he turns and shoots the girl.
That room is covered by snipers.
These men know what they're doing.
"It all goes by the numbers, we take him out."
- And the others?
- Not a problem.
I don't want my father to see you do it.
You look like a college kid doing his homework.
- What are you working on?
"- Oh, just a little theory."
"Their craft was, I like to call it, thought-powered."
"Allie may be a stronger manifestation of that power, that energy."
How long have you been sleeping with my daughter?
- Thank you... for letting me sleep the night in jail.
"It was the most vile, most inhuman night of my life."
"Well, coming from the guy who married Julie Cooper, that's saying something."
"So, aside from coming up with your hilarious one-liners, what's our next move?"
My next move is to meet with the partners.
Make sure they agree to my taking you on as a client.
- Why wouldn't they?
- You're not exactly the ideal client.
"- What... rich, powerful?"
- Guilty.
- You missed the turn.
- I'm not taking you to the office.
Kirsten is meeting us at the house.
- I have a business to run.
- Who are you kidding?
"We both know, with the exception of the underhanded stuff, Kirsten does everything anyway."
Step down.
Put Kirsten in charge.
That's your next move.
Excuse me.
"- I'm new, um... is it all right to park here?"
"- Sure, if you're not embarrassed."
"- Ryan, what would you like?"
- You buying?
"No, but I'm letting you order first."
"I may be selfless, but I'm still pretty stingy."
"- Well, in that case,uh, let's see."
"Can I have a... what, what do you got?"
- Large coffee.
I just didn't want to keep him waiting.
That'd be selfish.
"Iced coffee for me,please."
You risk everything if you don't act now.
If you want the vatican's righteous support
"For anything you do, for the rest of your life,"
You will claim England now.
"If you want France as an ally,"
You will claim England now.
"If you want to take England, you will need"
The next king of France by your side.
And you will wed
One of my sons tonight.
I will take my life in my own hands.
And I will not be bullied by you.
"Lady kenna requests a visit, your majesty."
No.
She requests that I inform you that she's naked under her robe.
Send her in.
It's nice to see you're still on your feet.
What does that mean?
I watched you
"Take it lying down for weeks now,"
From all the women in your life.
You don't like being bossed around
"By a girl, do you?"
Is this meant to arouse?
I was wrong to blame and demand things of you.
"I should have blamed you, absolutely."
I also should have offered you more of what you'd like
For what I'd like.
You're offering me sex for a husband?
I could get sex anywhere.
Not from me.
How little it would take for you
"Today my father will buy me a bike, and it will be prettier than yours!"
A bike?
Skidders are more fun than bikes!
They're no fun!
I don't want that!
"If you behave like this, I will not buy anything for you."
And your mother?
She went to the market to buy something.
You are a liar.
And that face?
It doesn't frighten me!
"Then throw it in the trash, if you don't want it."
I got upset because he is too egoistic.
I'm upset because papa did not buy me a bike.
"Then you were wrong, papa."
"You're good boy, don't cry."
How was I wrong?
You did not have to lie to the boy.
You don't know how much I wanted that bicycle for my son!
"Papa, you are a liar!"
You should speak with the director.
"Although I was in the right, it's normal that he dismissed me."
Be content with the skidder.
Who needs a bicycle anyway?
I didn't think that I would have to work at such a humble job.
"But you have a job, that is better than nothing."
Though I received a master's degree now I can't find work in the lowliest job.
It's all my fault.
I feel it.
"How lucky are the children, they can cry when they want."
A bear escaped from its cage!
"Although it escaped, our life remains in the same rut."
It is possible.
A lot that would need to change for that to happen.
Are we still going to Ike's for Thanksgiving?
What are we bringing?
Really?
Yeah.
You know what?
Why don't you stay at your own apartment tonight?
"My apartment is sad and has improper heating, which you know because we're standing in it right now."
So you don't want to be trapped by academia.
There are some people over there who I wish I could still call my colleagues.
They didn't want this life for themselves.
I told this to our boy here.
"You know, you have to be very careful."
Don't believe too strongly the structures they put in front of you.
This is good advice.
"For you more so than him, though."
Excuse me.
(WHISTLES QUIETLY)
You seem ill equipped to deal with someone like that.
We began by hating one another.
I think we're coming back down the other side now.
That's a very potent image.
You should write it down and use it.
"I came up with it on the silent, excruciating drive over here."
I'm glad you approve.
"Oh, I do, indeed."
I should go check on her.
Excuse me.
I think you're being rude to Ike.
I'm glad his feelings are so important.
I think I need to leave.
"No, it's not possible."
George is gonna kill me and so is Jim Jarmusch.
"Well, they can't both kill you."
Just call the dad and ask for it.
He will shoot me.
She's only 16 years old...
"Well, nearly 17."
Nearly 17.
"- You didn't sodomize her, did you?"
- No.
That's too bad.
You gotta be careful.
A lot of things fall under sodomy.
I wonder if kissing is sodomy.
Don't say that.
I need to get this screenplay.
I'm supposed to call Jarmusch and tell him what I think.
Ignore it.
Don't answer your phone.
That's what I would do.
But I don't want it to blow over.
I want this.
I can't work on my novel.
I need this job.
You let me know.
"Because what happened to me was, talking to you before, kind of stirred me up a little bit."
"Yeah, it did."
"And I realised that, you know, my opinions aren't generally taken into consideration."
"That's because in my line of activity, the attributes of loyalty are so much more important than your attributes of opinions."
"Cos, a bodyguard..."
What does a bodyguard do?
"He's gotta stay close to his subject at all times, all the time, and you're wondering what am I doing here right now, right?"
Excellent.
"You look relieved, Father."
That was the toughest yet.
Thanks for the steer.
"Anything for a peaceful life, eh?"
Partners in crime.
Who'd have thought it?
"You know what, when those two get together, they really are a deadly combination."
Of course the real reason we won is because I knew exactly which blooms Father Brown favoured.
What rot!
"If I hadn't been to finishing school, the whole thing would have been an unmitigated disaster!"
"Excuse me, we're looking for the deli counter."
Certainly.
Turn left at Lighting and it's just past Ladies Wear.
"Nice one, ta."
We should leave.
People are giving us some pretty dirty looks.
"No, we fit right in, man!"
"Sure, we might not be cash rich, but it's obvious we're classy guys."
"Here we go, the taster counter."
"Get stuck in, it's free."
"Yep, really classy."
"If you load up, you can taste a full meal."
"Can I help you, gentlemen?"
"We're just browsing, thanks."
And eating.
I'm browsing with my mouth.
Just having a little taste - try before you buy.
And are you planning to buy that chicken leg?
"Probably not now, to be honest."
We're sorry about this.
You're not the only one who worries about a tsunami.
Why don't you come with us?
"We'll just hike the lower ridge, grab some lunch; it'll be fun."
"Because it'll be just like we're dating, but we're not,so,no."
"I like how you'll take me to your sister's wedding, but you won't go for a hike with me."
"I like how you'll live with me for three years, but you won't marry me."
"Oh,see?"
Hike's ruined.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
See you guys.
Later.
"Just so you know, when Elliott showed up,I think your mole moved."
"Seriously,it's like twitched a line bit."
Skin Nugget thinks Elliott's the one.
He doesn't want to be the one.
Hey.
"We didn't really get a chance to catch up the other night,so..."
"Is there something that you want from me,Bella?"
"I thought maybe we could grab a drink, but if you're not into it..."
"""Into it""?"
"Yeah,you know what?"
I could be into it.
I could also just... want revenge.
"You know,like,big, classic John Hughes cinematic movie revenge."
But you could also be into it?
See?
Like right there.
"I mean,just for,like,a nanosecond,"
"I'm thinking,wow,she is so adorable"
I want to just die.
And then I just want to throw eggs at you.
But rather than boring you with my résumé...
I'd rather answer your questions on specific issues of foreign policy.
"I suppose I could ask you, Mr. Crenshaw, how you'd feel in the same situation."
Why would I answer that for you?
Sorry.
It's simply a privacy issue.
"Look, I won't address issues of sexuality in a hearing room... or on national television or anywhere else for that matter."
- Where's the control room for America Live?
I'm so proud of you.
I've been boasting to the forest fairies I'm marrying a devil who works and they're so envious they stopped talking to me.
"If you wanna get married, find somebody else."
I'm too busy for such tomfoolery.
Who?
There's no other young spook around!
"That one, that one at the mansion, marry the Duke, he's a fine spook."
The one from Netolice?
"No, wait..."
"Jean, bring me a window, I want to look in the garden."
Now you know?
"Come quickly, sit down."
Now watch!
"There we are, your Grace."
A fine red wine.
Delicious.
I can't see!
The mirror!
It's gone!
But there's plenty more where that came from.
Jean.
You licked off the cream!
"Your Grace, how can you..."
This is yummy.
Go.
"We could be spotted if we move together, so let's say our goodbyes here."
Be careful.
You must be out of the city before dawn.
Brothers...
Be careful.
This is it.
This is my last good turn as a friend.
I'm alone from now on.
I have no friends of any kind.
We will go our separate ways.
So don't resent me...
I will gladly accept any punishment if you withdraw your order to abolish the navy!
I will end my life here if you so desire!
You are continue your attempt to break me?
Must I take your life with my own hands before you submit?
Very well.
Consider your wish granted.
"No, Your Majesty!"
You cannot punish a subject by death for being forthright!
Do not interfere!
Please withdraw your sword!
Step aside!
Strike me instead!
This man has spent every waking moment of the day for a year protecting the southern front!
"If you forsake this faithful man, I, too, cannot observe your wishes!"
"Your Majesty, I beg you to strike me instead!"
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty!
Father nearly killed Yi Soon-shin and Minister Yu Sung-ryong?
"Yes, Your Highness."
His skull would have had to go right through the table.
The body is in the wrong position.
Was that tape torn?
I'm sure this is important.
But why?
"Because if I'm the killer and I want to get a dead body off my table,"
I'd cut the tape.
BRENNAN:
It was torn.
Which suggests Aldo tried to break free.
So perhaps he was killed somewhere else.
"They're at the sound studio, combing through the wreckage."
What's left?
"What's left is you could fit into a beer can, that's what's left."
So we're back where we started.
Who is this guy?
And why did he target Aldo Clemens?
Yeah. (phone ringing) Hold on.
(Booth groans)
(phone beeps) Yeah?
There's one possible explanation for how Aldo died.
"Well, look, does it get us any closer to finding out who killed him?"
"Well, let me show you what we have."
"All right, hold on."
What do you got?
(sighs)
BRENNAN:
"From the position of the body and the fractures, the killer couldn't have snapped Aldo's neck while he was restrained."
So what's left?
SAROYAN:
The most likely explanation is that Aldo killed himself.
"He was fastened to the table by duct tape, but he managed to loosen it."
That is one thing that has gone right today.
"My name is Michael, and I'm here to help you."
"- Everything all right in there, Michael?"
- What is she doing?
She'll wait for us to make a move and pick us off when we do.
I need a screwdriver.
Shouldn't we call the park rangers?
"Unless the park rangers have been issued body armor... and high-caliber weapons, we're on our own here."
She must have disabled my gun when we stopped for gas.
Remove the trigger bar spring from a SIG Sauer P228... and you've got a nine-millimeter semiautomatic doorstop.
"I don't know what you think you're playing at, but this is not a game you can win."
"Doug, I need a paper clip."
Got one?
I don't have a paper clip.
"Well, do you have something like a paper clip,a thin piece of metal-"
Wait.
Never mind.
Kill him yourself if you want.
- We need to wrap this thing up.
- Oh.
Fiona.
- You fix it?
- Hardly.
I might get one shot off.
- You got one chance to shoot her?
- I'm not gonna shoot her.
- Wait.
- Is she leaving?
I seriously doubt that.
You have any duct tape?
Hold that there.
"When I say ""now,"" you're gonna open that door."
You're lost on this e?
Puzzled.
"They barely knew finn, yet they let him move in,loaned him money."
They trusted a man who took advantage of them.
"If you're in a relationship and the other person is keeping secrets, how would you know?"
You'd know.
I didn'T.
Who lied to you?
You did.
"Not exactly lied,but you just didn't tell me the whole truth either."
You're comparing me to finn?
I'm just saying that you can be involved with someone without fully knowing them.
How could you not tell me about your family?
Finish your e-mail.
You wanted my advice.
Just don't be too hard on the fiancees.
Finn duped them.
And I shouldn't have brought up the past.
I know you had your reasons for not wanting to tk about it.
We're talking about it now.
Now is not paris.
Your priorities were clear on paris.
I had a job to do in europe.
"If I had told you about my first wife, would it have made a difference?"
"We'll never know,will we?"
yeah.Gibbs.
You went home early.
Stayed until 2130.
That's early for you.
"You called to talk about my work hours, Dr. Mallard?"
"No,agent gibbs."
I had a hunch which led me to trim lance corporal finn's nose hairs.
"We have a huge viral campaign push with cell phone cross promotion, playable demos that can be e-mailed with an embedded link to the site."
"We even posted game samples on Youtube, pointing towards the pre-purchase 10-day trial link"
- Brian.
- All right.
"I just wanted to add that Dave and I are scheduled to be on ""Game Gab"" tomorrow."
"Oh, that's great."
Half a million hits per day.
"Um, and where are we with your deal?"
"We haven't heard from your lawyer, Adam Hillman."
Right.
Uh... we're on it.
What about the bugs in the game?
"Dave, how are we doing on the bug thing?"
Dave?
The level three bugs?
It's bug.
Singular.
"It means, uh, it's all being resolved."
- We'll be ready for the duplicators
- Without a doubt?
We--we--just I.M.Ing the guys at the--at the shop.
It's gonna be fine.
It's all under control.
"""All under control""?"
That's the best you got?
It's a glitch in the code.
We'll figure it out.
"It could tank the whole game, Dave."
"Yeah, kinda like the fact that we don't have a signed contract which we would have if you actually talked to Adam instead of sticking his face under the sofa."
"Well, he started it."
"""He started it""?"
"What are you, 12?"
Wait...not even on Sunday?
Why take Sunday off?
You need money that bad?
"It's not about money, doc."
Let me explain.
The freelance industry is very tough.
"Whatever work comes in, we have to take it."
Or someone else will.
"And if I don't take the job, they won't hire me next month."
My calendar will be empty.
I'll be jobless.
Hire someone to help?
Get help.
Then they will call and give it to that person instead.
And the other thing is when they call they want me to do the job.
So I should be the one doing it.
Do you think your body will stop at just a rash?
It's just getting started.
F*ck you body.
Don't scratch.
Do you have a nickname?
Yoon.
Yoon.
I'm Imm.
"We're around the same age, so let's be friends."
"When I'm treating someone, I take it very seriously."
I think you also take things seriously too.
So we should be able to understand each other.
"Because when I treat someone and that patient doesn't get better, it's like I'm doing a bad job."
You know what I mean?
"You may wonder... why I ask you all kinds of personal questions that seem like none of my business, but... just trust me, I really do care."
Think of this as a partnership.
"Although in an indifferent universe there's no room for tragedy, is there?"
You've been reading something more than women's magazines.
You made him swallow his own words.
Doctor Alexander...
It's all right.
I came in to help solve these atrocious crimes.
"Yes, if you could take the DNA sample, Doctor Alexander."
"Thank you, Mr Fordyce."
If you would just open your mouth.
"Tom, you saw how he reacted, how he shifted when you mentioned the article."
His whole antagonism to Dave Stubbs' beliefs.
It's not enough.
You can't charge a man because he believes in nothing.
Tom?
"God, what's wrong with you?"
It's the chemo.
Chemo?
I have cancer.
What do you mean?
What sort of cancer?
The sort that kills you quickly.
Why didn't you tell me?
"Well, I didn't think it was relevant."
"Tom, you have cancer."
That is relevant.
What's the prognosis?
80-20 against me surviving the year.
"They never really know, people do de_ these predictions."
Let's hope.
Can we change the subject?
Shouldn't you be making the most of your life instead of chasing after murderers?
"Well, I figured if I kept busy, it might just go away."
So we just make it all nice.
"Everything's easy, fun, we're drinking, we're smiling."
Okay?
We can't leave till sundown.
"Guys, we all need to be together first thing in the morning, okay?"
Which is exactly why we have to find Trudy.
"Otherwise, we won't all be there."
Let's get out of here now.
"Reconvene later at the beach, at 1900 hours."
You with me?
"Joey, we are not gonna be able to finish the program if we get caught!"
"All right, bring it in."
"Hey, come on, Shane!"
"We walk to the other side, we get caught."
"This way, we canoe out nice and easy, we find ourselves a nice, quiet beach."
We pull up.
"We find the singles' side, we find a dance floor, we find some cocktails."
And we find Trudy and we bring her back...
"Yeah, we find Trudy and we bring her right back here."
This is crazy.
Trust me.
I was an Eagle Scout.
My mind is a compass.
I can handle these situations.
I've been trained to do so.
"Now follow me and I'm gonna get you there, but we gotta do it quick and we gotta do it quiet."
Come on.
"These are not the best laid plans, okay?"
"I'm just gonna go on record right now, okay?"
I do not think this has a high chance...
"If we keep up this pace, we'll be there in 20 minutes!"
I hope so!
They said your father could be released.
"We compared out destinies, like young girls comparing dresses."
Now she was going to be reunited with a saint.
"A martyr, beautiful... noble."
"Her gift was living, and she got theater instead."
My gift was theater.
Instead I got snarled up in life...
So it goes.
She went back.
She died of love.
I waited here for a visa that's never issued to dissidents' sister-in-laws.
And I became as bad at acting as I am in life.
"""It's like the sky in the country""."
"It's the Atlantic, the wind from the ocean."
You know we have seagulls here in Paris?
"That's what I'm doing at the moment, The Seagull."
"Well, the play."
My daughter plays the lead.
"Nowadays, after two cheap porno films, you can even become a member of the Academy."
She arranged for me to have a part in the play.
Do you know it?
Not really.
Sea birds don't fly to Hungary.
And what kind of bird are you?
What do you do in Hungary?
I was told to work with my hands.
My head still hurts.
A bird of different feather.
"I'm sorry, you make me feel uneasy."
Nestor?
To the theater!
"The bird touches down on the mud, leaves his mark, more beautiful than his flight, than his life."
!
"If they see that you've been making a detailed record of all the fancy gifts you've been going them, even a fool would know your intended use for that journal."
"You may not end up in prison, but you would lose their trust at the very least."
What?
Release the criminal who stole government property!
One of them has already died in confinement.
I fear it will hurt your esteemed name if the other one dies as well.
Add glory to your name with display of mercy.
But what if that boy starts talking and causing trouble?
Don't worry.
I will make certain that he keeps his mouth shut.
Chun-su!
Chun-su!
Thank god you're all right!
What's wrong with you?
Do you know what he did to get you out?
I don't care.
Chun-su...
What's wrong with you?
Your friend risked his...
Don't even mention him.
He's no friend of mine.
"I told you, you're wrong about him!"
"Chun-su, Baron Huh would like to see you."
Go ahead and drink it.
"Me, sir?"
I had them brew the best herbs for your injury.
It will make moving around much easier.
Sir...
A good medicine is always bitter.
Go ahead an drink it.
I apologize.
- Walking through the woods to meet my love this day in Marymount.
- Good.
"And what do you see, Lady Edith?"
Focus.
You must see through her eyes.
- I see...
I see fawns and nymphs.
They're transformed into brutes.
They dance around the maypole where we shall be married.
They are the devils in ruined souls that people the black wilderness.
- Good.
"Now, Lady Edith, what is your family's relation to evil?"
- We are well acquainted with evil.
"These darks and monsters are my brethren, maddened by their troubles into a gay despair like evil spirits in the presence of a dread magician."
- Good.
Now you will awaken... as Lucy.
"Now tell me, Lucy, is the night's ritual a dream... or a reality?"
- I...
I don't...
- Ugh!
- A dream?
- Are you trying to fail?
Are you doing this on purpose?
Are you trying to spite me?
- The men and women have seemed very pleased with my performance.
- They've been pleased.
They've been pleased with your performance?
This isn't a performance.
I don't want you to act.
I want you to become!
"And if you can't do that, you're worthless to me."
This session's over.
"What do you want,ron?"
I want to keep you up-To-Date on the case as a courtesy.
We're gonna argue self-Defense.
So?
We're thinking of calling you as a character witness.
To say what?
"In a self-Defense case, character for peacefulness,"
"For non-Violence, is admissible."
Did you know that?
Since you two are friends--
"Whoa,whoa,whoa."
We're not friends.
I took her to some basketball games.
We never even-- Fought?
Is that what you were gonna say?
You didn't get into any fights.
Good.
"It won't help us that much, but it's admissible"
To prove she had a peaceful character.
"Though i have to say,"
Testifying won't be so pleasant for you.
"The tabloids are all over this case,"
And the d.A. Will cross you pretty hard.
"As for how your wife handles it,i can't say."
"You do have a prenup, right?"
Or?
Sorry?
"You're the lawyer,ron."
Great lawyers always give you an alternative.
"Look,if you've got a business trip coming up"
"Or plans with your wife,"
I don't want a trial to mess that up.
"All right, Mov, thanks."
"Well, Mohadevan says it was some kind of insect venom although it's unlike anything she's ever seen."
It's a good thing you didn't get too much of that in you.
She said you should just keep taking the antihistamines for the next 24 hours and you should be fine.
That thing used me and my friend to get to you.
I almost got you killed.
You were right not to trust me.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"No, that's not the point."
You did fine...
all right?
You have a little work to do on the whole trust thingy.
What do you think?
Is it me?
"You just rest, okay?"
"Just, take it easy."
So what the hell was this thing again?
A demon bug?
"It's actually the other way around, a bug demon."
"Well, I think you actually both might be right."
"You two, you're just like peas in a pod lately."
"Hey, you know what?"
I am so ready to take my pension and retire somewhere else sweetheart.
- What did it want?
- Apparently it wanted me.
It was killing those kids to draw me in.
"It's dead now, so you don't have to worry about that anymore."
Which means I am free to help you two find that vampire you're been looking for.
"Oh yeah, yeah, I figured it out all by myself."
I can do that.
I'm a private detective.
- NO!
"Ok, look, look."
"I'm just gonna leave, all right, Dale?"
As long as I'm here this is not gonna end well.
"Just leave, ok?"
I bet you wanted that to happen didn't you?
"I'm seriously not following you, Hallie."
You really need to calm down.
You put on this little whoa is me act.
But I'm not buying it.
"Just because you throw yourself at every guy that's famous who you think can get you somewhere, and who you think wants you..."
"and then shoots you down, you know what, don't take that out on me, ok?"
You play the victim thing really well.
But it's a load of crap.
Shut up.
"You're not my... friend, Dale."
You're just like every other two-faced girl in L.A.
You just play it better.
"Come on, you guys."
This is retarded.
"What, you're just gonna take her side?"
"I'm not taking anybody's side, ok?"
"Come on, Hallie, let's go."
Don't touch me.
Did that really just happen?
This week on Dirty Roomies...
Would you clean this up.
I can't live like this.
I made the mess.
I don't know why I have to clean it up.
You guys have sex.
We have to do a paper edit on these and get them to run it.
The producers want to see it by Friday.
"I just heard some sounds, like animals, and was..."
"Oh, call it natural curiosity."
"That's what got me into this business, I guess."
I'm just naturally curious.
"Well, I assure you, there is nothing here"
Nor any place else on my property that could
Interest you in the slightest.
I realize it's been difficult for you
With all that's happened.
Look here.
I don't like to see anyone die.
But I didn't know this Jeff boy at all.
Were he and your niece engaged?
Not really.
There wasn't a ring or anything.
Did he stay at her house?
He had his own apartment.
Suppose she stayed with them?
That would hardly be the behavior
I'd expect from my niece.
Check up on her very often?
Lord no.
"Since her mother's death, I've look in on her"
Once in a while just to see if I could help.
"Ms. Ramsey, this is a question I have to ask."
Do you know of anyone who would want Jeff Ingram dead?
I don't know anyone who even knew who he was.
"Now... well, except Audrey."
Does that answer your question?
"I know it's crazy, but it's the only thing"
That makes any sense.
"No, it doesn't."
You have clearance.
"- Just launching the search for that spy ship, sir."
- Good.
What's the position regarding the monorail?
The sapper team have laid 18 charges in the tunnel.
They can be detonated either simultaneously or independently.
I suppose Leitz will expect a medal after this.
"Surface launch, Master."
What did I say?
"Slave, can you identify them?"
The heat pattern indicates three B 19 cruisers.
"Oh, come on, Avon."
Hit that button.
"That's a search formation, Avon."
They're not aligned for an attack.
So they're searching.
We're going to wait here till they find us?
Let's get out.
"They must have picked up Dayna and Tarrant, and realised we are up here somewhere."
"Slave, set the ship on an evasion pattern, maximum speed!"
- That's the first sensible...
- Just a minute.
This is Scorpio.
"Come in, Tarrant."
"Hold that order, Slave."
TARRANT:
"Soolin, we're almost finished here."
"Tell him if he doesn't get the hell out, we're certainly finished here."
SOOLIN:
"Tarrant, we think Scorpio has been spotted."
Teleport up now.
"I'm sorry, Soolin, we're not receiving you very clearly."
I can't afford that.
"Afford it you will, Mr. Newman or this court will see that your car is impounded and sold at auction."
"Well, don't you worry, Your Honour."
He's in my custody.
"Well, what do you think?"
I really can't say.
"- No, say."
I want you to say.
"- It's not good, okay?"
It's not good.
You look stupid.
I'm sorry.
You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.
I really think this looks pretty good.
"Why not get white shoes, move to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?"
Maybe you could show me something else.
"As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you."
But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.
"Oh, hey."
I'm being helpful.
I am the only one being helpful.
I don't think you're being helpful!
You're being disruptive.
You make it difficult for your friend to improve his life.
I'm preventing him from becoming one of those guys people snicker at because they look ridiculous.
No offence to you personally.
You people with hair think you're so superior.
You have no idea what it's like.
You ever look in the tub and see a fistful of hair?
Start your day with that!
All right.
Take it easy.
I just have to...
I just have to...
"Oh, God!"
-
- What have I done?
-
- What have you done?
It's time for a bit of advanced training.
I've got to get a bit of steel into you.
It's no good g--going through life laying back and letting things happen to you... like your mother used to!
"Oh, 'eck!"
I've been sweeping round these things for two years!
"Why don't you give up on these, eh?"
You're never gonna get rid of these.
Who's gonna buy these?
Don't worry about them.
They're too advanced for you.
Stick to basics like how the h--hell you're gonna pay for that ice cream.
"You know, you can't just drag people into the shop."
This is not dragging 'em in.
It's propelling 'em in this direction as if by accident.
-
"- All right, show me."
-
- You've seen me do it often enough.
I've always been too embarrassed to watch.
It's not a case of embarrassment.
It's a test of skill.
"Well, I hope this section never gets published in me biography."
"I'm warning you, if ever I become famous, well, one day, I want absolutely no reference to this."
I see.
"Ashamed of it, are you?"
Why?
I don't know!
"I was with Jonesy, and we were just looking Felix up on the net, just a something to do."
And his family was so stinking rich.
They just wound me up!
"People like me have to duck and die, for these blue-blood types have got it all!"
"It was just a laugh, you know?"
A little note to remind him that he wasn't so important after all!
"Not that he felt that way, as it turns out."
- You utter prick.
"- Oh, it was just a postcard!"
How was I supposed to know he'd bloody kill himself?
You couldn't have known.
He must have been unstable... like his brother.
It wasn't your fault.
See?
- Did you do that?
- Let go of me.
- Truth!
Did you do that to him?
- He did it to himself.
"I sat by him for days, weeks."
I knew that he was still alive inside.
"I knew that he'd be ashamed of what he did, ashamed of his weakness."
I knew that he'll tell me who's to blame
"Imagine being like Felix... paralysed, powerless!"
You'd hurt whoever you could!
You wanted Felix to name names.
We were the last people to piss him off.
But it doesn't justify his suicide.
And it doesn't justify this revenge.
Perhaps you're right.
I say that even now.
But how did you remember all this?
I'm caught.
It was a lie.
Coming to Malaysia for your treatment?
A naked lie.
You made us fools?
"You're right, that was true."
I hate people who act like you.
Aren't you acting?
"Though I am in your heart, you're getting ready to get engaged with someone else."
Isn't that an act?
I acted saying that I don't remember past.
And you are acting without saying that.
Not much of a difference.
Happy moments I spent with you are more important for me.
You think of our separation.
You forget things which you should remember.
Don't cheat yourself.
Is she telling me to go away?
Is she telling me to come?
What is your heart saying?
Do you know that at least?
You storm me like a tornado...
I suffocate because of you...
In such circumstances...
Is it possible to know what my heart says?
Roaring forever...
The clouds won't hide the water vapour and carry that burden...
"Like you, it won't hide its love..."
If you had embraced me with your warmth... my youth would have jumped in joy...
If you had struck the right notes...
- Same here.
- So... who was the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with?
"No, I wasn't talking about me, actually."
Jonathan here mentioned a woman that he was dating that was very lively?
- Lively.
- Really?
You've got an awfully good grip.
"It's probably kind of handy in bed, isn't it?"
How orgasmic was she?
Thank you about the grip.
"Yeah, I... she was..."
- I don't want to be rude.
- I don't mind talking about sex.
It's what everybody's thinking about anyway.
Why don't we sit down and have a drink and be civilized?
"I'd love to, but we actually were on our way out right now."
So maybe some other time.
"So anyway, hello and goodbye."
Nice to meet you.
That was really weird... the way Antrem wouldn't let go of my hand.
He's a strange and tormented creature.
It really disturbs me that Priscilla loved me once and now loves him.
I'd hate to think what that means.
They're very nice ladies.
"Well, one of them is."
I'd be doing them a huge favor.
I don't feel good about this.
I don't want you to be a sperm donor.
But it's flattering.
They're fans of my work.
I've never had lesbian fans before.
They should go to a sperm bank.
How could I?
I didn't hold a grudge against you either.
I could never hold a grudge against you.
- How's life?
Are you happy?
- I am.
Happy that you became a famous artist.
What you always wanted... and what you truly deserved to be.
"Yet, I often wondered if this is worth of being alone in life."
"'Artists should never get married,' eh?"
Remember?
I always do.
"Everything was so beautiful then, the penthouse..."
the hole in the blanket!
The pot with our one and only sovereign!
I broke the pot and the sovereign was counterfeit.
Counterfeit?
The sovereign we swore on our love never to spend was... counterfeit!
"But our love was real, Pavlos."
And my portrait?
what became of my portrait?
"It's the only thing I have from you, Aliki."
I never sold this portrait.
"It's always been in the penthouse, over my bed."
When I feel lonely...
disheartened...
I talk to that portrait as if it was alive and listening.
"I tell her... my dreams, my worries, my bitter sorrows..."
Whatever I say... she'll always answer...
I love you!
"I love you, too!"
"We lost track of time, Pavlos."
"Anything you can do for that, uh, for that little baby, please, do it."
"I'll get out of your hair right now, okay ?"
I'll come find you.
"I'll be right there, all right ?"
Okay.
Thank you.
"Yes, of course."
You feel that ?
Darryl ?
"Hey, Seth."
How's the earthquake treating you ?
"Uh, not too well."
I need to ask for your help.
"Sure, but how can I help you ?"
"Well, I'm guessing you don't have a, uh, like, a car or a walkie-talkie ?"
This shopping cart's my only worldly possession.
"Okay, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you for it."
"Sorry, no way."
I'll give you my pants.
"No, no, they look better on you."
Listen.
"It has a flat tire and possibly a broken axle, but it's a $70,000 car and it's all yours in exchange for the cart."
Sweet.
"Stay here, I'll come back to draw you a map."
Because... it's a rabbit.
"It's a he, and I'm aware of his species."
but that doesn't mean that he doesn't feel pain and that he isn't hurt.
"Please, if you have a shred of humanity, or animality in your body, you won't deprive this poor, little, adorable bunny of quality medical care."
"Well, I did do a year of veterinarian school."
Really ?
"Maybe if there's an X-ray machine free, I'll..."
Thank you.
Is there a listing for implosion grenades?
- Those were the days.
"- Artie, we've got WiFi."
"- No, no, no, I like paper."
"Actually, I hate paper."
"But, you know, it's a security issue."
"Okay, Artie, enough."
You have to fill us in.
"Okay, if the competition used an implosion grenade to steal the sword,"
Then what the hell does this sword do?
Yeah.
"I mean, it must be pretty major, right?"
You don't drop a nuclear bomb to steal a butter knife.
Exactly.
Okay.
You want to know about the sword?
I'll tell you about the sword.
"The Honjo Masamune is much, much more than a dull knife."
It kept the ruling Shogunate in power for hundreds of years
By making them invincible in battle.
And the beauty in the way these things were forged.
"I mean, ritually hammered and folded."
The blade millions of layers of steel
With a carbon content that's right off the charts.
And each layer only atoms--atoms--thick.
I mean this sword...
Is said to be perfectly aligned.
- So what does it do?
- Yeah.
"Um, ha, uh..."
"Okay, you know how geese fly in a ""v"" formation"
And the wind hits the first bird and then splits
House computer.
You require?
"You've allowed access to my private lift, to whom?"
A visitor.
Top priority.
What are you...
No sign of him?
"In the first days of the occupation, this was always our meeting point, but maybe he stopped coming."
Don't you have any other way of contacting him?
"I mean, you just turn up here at this time of day?"
It seems a bit haphazard.
We didn't have time to get organised.
"What, so you've no contact with other resistance units?"
None.
Maybe mine's the only column still fighting.
There's Leitz now.
These are friends.
"Dayna, Tarrant."
They're from Earth.
Enemies of the Federation.
- Have you any news of the other columns?
- Nothing good.
Two has been practically wiped out.
One and Three have suffered heavy casualties and pulled back into the White Mountains to regroup.
So mine is the only unit still functioning.
And you can expect to come under heavy attack in the next few days.
The General is getting impatient.
"Yes, well, we beat off their last attack."
Shot down two gunships.
I heard.
- How did you get into the city?
- I swam in under the reactors.
Got it?
Balloon jump?
"Look it up, Taffy."
What does it say?
"Oh, balloons."
The preliminary reports on the use of balloons for initial jumps are generally favourable.
"Due to the lack of the impact of the slipstream on the body, the tendency of the pupil to twist and somersault is almost eliminated."
That's nice.
The jumper has to fall a far longer distance before his parachute becomes fully opened.
This delayed opening produces an additional thrill.
You lucky people.
The phenomena known as a Roman Candle in which the parachute leaves the bag but fails to open in time...
"Lay off, will you?"
Canada?
Yeah?
"What's a ""Roman Candle""?"
A chute that doesn't open.
Did you ever see one?
"Yeah, I saw one."
What happened to the bloke?
"Got to sleep, will you?"
I'm bushed.
Miss?
"May I have another, please?"
What's wrong with this one?
"It's ex-tac, different from the others."
You're lucky.
It's what the pilots and instructors usually have.
"Change it, will you?"
"Hurry up, you."
"Well, the customer is always right."
"Though we do happen to pack about 50 parachutes a day, at least."
It's backfiring in the cockpit block!
Shut down bypass.
Removing cockpit block!
Hang on there!
This baby's never had a person on board.
It's just a little nervous.
Take your time and figure out why the pressure's rising.
"Yes, but..."
Take care of it.
Brother...
Is there anything you value more than yourself?
Something I value?
It's to save...
This world!
Result code is timed out!
It's overflowing!
Abort experiment!
Disconnect all circuits!
There's a crack in the chamber!
It's too late!
I didn't understand why he wanted to be on Dangaioh.
That's why I wanted to be on it.
So I could see for myself.
I can understand how your brother felt...
"He said, ""something more valuable than yourself,"" right?"
Uh-huh.
"That's why I'm here, too."
I'm glad you finally decided.
I'm very grateful.
"Because you agreed, our mighty States can now gain the power we need to exercise justice!"
The power to prepare us for the coming threat!
"The power you seek, namely, the power they are going to grant you, will not make you into a mighty soldier."
I feel a lot of pressure Right now.
"I mean, building a legacy For the pomrenkes."
Is what it's all about.
That's why I get out there And work as hard as I do.
That's all that's On my mind right now.
70 miles northwest...
I left my gun on my table.
I love that gun.
We got all the dredging.
That's the more important Than my gun.
"The fighting Kellys Are rolling the dice,"
Going where many believe They'd wind up anyway...
I've never River mined before.
I've wanted to do this For a long time.
Up a river.
I know we're going up against A lot of unknowns today.
And I know that It's gonna be a bitch.
So far this season...
I was wondering If it'd be a possibility.
If I could get My family on your claim.
I just don't think I want to Take a chance on you.
"Due to their Less than stellar reputation,"
The kellys have struggled To gain access to claims.
"Well, I haven't heard Any kind of good."
From anybody on you guys.
"Okay, well, thank you."
And even when they have...
Seriously?
It hasn't lasted long.
We don't have Anywhere else to work.
Could you imagine The old miners.
Having to walk out here Back in the day?
He tried to grab her in front of my old mother.
He was smelling of cheap liquor.
"So, Sarika pushed him away."
After that he just went mad.
Tried to kiss her..
Caught her arm so hard that he has left marks!
"Sir, let him return home my husband will take him to a task."
Do not let him return is what I came to say.
Your husband is due for a promotion it will be very unfortunate..
..if instead of a promotion he has to sit in front of some anti-corruption inquiry committee.
Mukesh... pack your things right away and leave the house!
"Where will I go, Buaji?"
I don't care.
Go to a friend!
Or rent a room!
Very independent you have become.
You make enough money giving tuitions to get drunk on.
Mr. Khanna is lying!
I had just gone over to meet Sarika.
Everybody is aware of Sarika's reputation.
"Why her husband is targeting you, I don't know."
"But if you stay here, you will land all of us in trouble..."
So for God's sake please spare us.
Oye!
Tuition master!
What happened?
And what's with all this luggage?
Come with me...
Come in.
Settle down.
Mauritius.
My aunt's son lives there...
How would the kts like to party with the ZBZs?
- What kind?
"- The biggest, baddest most rule-breaking party CRU will never see."
When you put it like that.
We're in.
Good!
Is you shirt on inside out and backwards?
It's just... joggging.
This is the common room.
"It looks like TV football, viewing party last night."
You guys surely know how to have a good time.
Welcome to our temple of good times and life-long brotherhood.
Our casa es su casa.
We're walkin'.
You got any question so far?
- What are your academic requirements?
- Every active member must take one course per semester or you get us skip talking to.
"But I mean, you have to take four course just to be in the Greek system?"
I'll look into that.
We're still walking.
Here are our lovely gardens.
Do you have any kind of mentorship program?
"The OC, they had a lot of connections."
"You know, CEO and like so."
"Last summer, bunch of the active did some paid internships."
That's a good point.
Jack Rabbit gives all the active and pledges 20% discount at his hut.
- Is that what you meant?
- Kind of.
It's good.
And here is the lovely recreation and relaxation room.
Excuse me.
"So, since god planned for us to have peace and happiness in this life right now,"
why are so many of us hurting and angry inside?
It's because we refuse to believe in god's unconditional love for us.
God created us in his image for one reason only -- so that we could know him personally and have a joy-filled life.
That's it.
There's no catch.
There's no hidden agenda.
"The lord sacrificed his only son for us, paying the penalty for our sins so that we might know true contentment."
"Sounds too good to be true, but it isn't."
God's provided the way.
We must make the choice.
Excuse me.
Paige!
"Hi, sweetheart."
Wow.
You look so beautiful.
You must be Paige's parents.
Such an honor to meet you.
Your daughter has been such a blessing to us.
"She's a blessing to us, too."
Paige says you work in travel.
Yeah.
"Well, we take a mission trip every year."
We should talk.
"Yeah, we -- yeah, we should."
We'd love it if Paige could join us on one of our trips -- see all the good her generous donations are doing.
We'll definitely talk about that.
Martha.
I was just about to ruin your sunday and call you in to help me.
"Well, Agent Gaad beat you to it."
What do you need?
There was a meeting between the D.O.D.
That and breast-feeding.
It just comes natural to 'em.
"So, Hadji's girlfriend finally came to her senses."
What happened?
She didn't wanna be a fifth wife?
[Laughing]
- Hadji.
- All right.
"Well, it's her loss."
The girls in my Friday night cribbage game... will be thrilled to have Fez back at the table.
You know what?
At least Fez has a social life.
Look at us.
We're hanging out with my parents.
"Yeah, about that."
Feel free to get the hell out.
"Well, we can do better than this."
"You guys, we're gonna graduate in two months... and there is a whole town out there just waiting for us."
"We just have to, you know, grab the bull by the horns."
"Okay, but I tell you this from experience."
"If we're gonna mess with the bull, we better have an escape plan."
"Well, what are the popular kids doing tonight?"
"Well, I'll bet they're not hanging around with their parents... giving them snarky looks."
I remember when the Brady kids got bored... and then that fat kid Oliver showed up.
[Chuckles]
It just all turned around.
They got in a pie fight and everything.
You know what?
Kelso might actually be onto something.
Maybe we should look for someone new to hang out with.
All right!
We're gettin' a fat kid!
I can see why you don't do this face to face.
It can be very awkward.
Hi.
And then you'd say...
"""Hi."
"How was your day?"""
"Oh, me?"
"I had a really weird day, actually."
And now I'm here... alone in my apartment.
You're probably in your big house... with your family...
and your dog.
And probably your dog has a family too.
You're probably all gathered around the fire singing carols... even though it isn't Christmas.
Just for fun.
"You will never, ever see this... because you'll never watch this far on the tape."
"You'll probably never even watch the tape, will you?"
I could do anything right now.
"If you are watching this... then just call this number, okay?"
"Just call this number, the number you see on your screen... and say ""macaroni. """
Okay?
That's all you have to do.
"Just ""macaroni""and hang up."
No questions asked.
I thought we'd have breakfast for dinner.
And then maybe sometime we'll have dinner for breakfast.
Just to mix things up a little.
But there's still ice cream for dessert.
It's fine with me if you guys want to continue this silent treatment.
It's like a Zen retreat for me.
- Can I see it?
- I didn't use the book.
I made it up.
"Always ask yourself, are there any hidden carbohydrates in the food you eat."
Watch fried foods.
"Now, whenever you do anything strenuous, check your pulse."
Do deep breathing exercises.
"Stay away from starches and sugars, and that's it."
"Now, if you will also supplement... with twice the adult minimum daily vitamin requirements... and do six and a half minutes of isometrics every day, it's easy, Bob."
Wouldn't it be easier if I just stopped eating?
"Yeah, that might work too."
"Hi, honey."
"- Hi, dear."
How'd it go with Dr. Klein?
"- Oh, fine."
Fine.
Good.
Any change since your last physical?
No.
Everything's fine.
"Oh, great."
"You want a drink before dinner, honey?"
No.
"Well, there's some fruit, if you wanna munch."
No munching.
"Bob, Is there something you're not telling me?"
"Well, I just have to go on a little diet."
I have to start counting the calories and... try to get rid of that.
"Oh, that?"
"Honey, that's just a little happy fat."
I think it's cute.
"Emily, fat isn't cute unless you're nine months old and you're playing with a Busy Box."
"Well, it shouldn't be hard to lose three or four pounds."
"- Uh, eight pounds."
- Eight?
Are we at war?
(low gurgling)
"Uh, you know I think it's that darn sophomore with the deviated septum."
He must have closed his mouth again.
"Sabrina, could you come up here?"
I think I might have an antacid.
What flavor?
Can I have two?
I always carry the essentials.
Let's see.
"No, that one's for leprosy."
"So, thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me."
"Hand me that towel, will you?"
(phone rings) What?
Fire him.
Your son?
He's not a closer.
"Anyway, I hoped if I could tell you what a wonderful place my clock shop is, you would find it in your heart to spare it."
(chuckling):
That's a good one.
Spare it!
"Oh, who sent you in here, huh?"
Artie?
"You're serious, aren't you?"
You really think there's anything you could tell me to keep me from squashing you like a bug?
We put a lot of effort into our selection of timepieces.
"Oh, well, in that case,"
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to count all the way to three before I call security.
"Before I go, could I just make one little point?"
"Oh, look who's been downsized."
This stinks.
I always wanted the good of Marie.
Are you looking for the fate of his mother.
But do
Two days after the board against the merchants of flesh guns and ideas?
And we try again with horses crazy.
"Mickey, you ..."
"The reserve, a thousand chances against one."
And the luxury of a desperate gambler.
Could I returned to Hungary but I prefer to leave in our world.
"I'm going to take the deposition of Mr. André, democratic, as a papal bull."
But I want to continue to follow your tracks.
And those of Marie.
Sharpening their teeth and shaking the handcuffs.
Gladly send you sterile with your coffin in Hungary.
You do not like me.
Fault ... her.
Marie is poor and defenseless.
She goes too far.
"Just so, innocent."
Remember that I am too generous with you.
As the same from me.
And this is my foot.
You know my foot?
A nice Calcione a hog foot Parisian.
And this in addition.
"So, courage, the man on the street with his suitcase."
So that if the steps even worse.
You still have all two ears?
"It is my fault, I would not have never had to leave you alone."
I like when bleed ...
But I would much that bloody for me.
"Curse you, Mary, full of ice."
Fantastic.
A truly great sleep.
"On the scale of one to five - 5,429,562."
Sleeping face down in the toilet is conducive to restful slumber?
And why shouldn't I sleep in the lavatory?
You wet the bed.
Once.
I had a nightmare that I was ordinary and untalented and there was a momentary aberration.
It's a sign of an extra-vivid subconscious.
It's a sign of an extra-drippy tiddler.
"Eddie, I was having a nightmare that I was a pleb."
It was a horrifying experience.
I remember the night so well.
I awoke to hear Richie screaming into the middle of the night.
"""Ah. "" His heart-rending sobs echoing round the house."
"Why, you wept like a soul in torment."
"I rushed in to find poor, frightened Richie shivering, terrified, white, sitting in a puddle."
"- Yes, and what did you do?"
- I don't remember.
You switched on my electric blanket.
Only to take your mind off the nightmare.
You completely electrocuted my love truncheon.
Love truncheon?
"Love pencil, more like."
"Well, love pin, actually."
"Eddie, what's this?"
- I don't know.
- It's one of my scary looks.
Is it really?
My intimidating frown.
So you just watch out.
Has the hair grown back yet?
Mrs. hall!
Go on to your basket now.
"Oh, I'm disgusted with you."
Go on.
Mrs. hall!
"- I heard you the first time, Mr. farnon."
How did he get out?
I've asked you to keep the gate shut.
"Aye, you have."
- He nearly ended up under the wheels of my car.
"While the hole stays in fence, dogs will stray-- the hole?"
!
- So either you or Mr. Tristan must mend it.
"Till then, you've got nothing you can complain about, have you?"
Tristan...
You almost left it too late.
"Stick that round his neck, would you, please?"
He was running with that bunch at far field.
I had no idea it had gotten to this state.
"Wooden tongue, is it?"
"Yes, that's right-- actinobacillosis, to be absolutely accurate."
"It you don't catch it in time, the tongue hardens, and they starve to death."
"Can you do aught for him, you reckon?"
"Mmm, fortunately."
"There's a new treatment, Mr. Abbot-- sodium iodide."
It's a vast improvement on the old system-- painting the tongue with iodine.
Hello.
What do you want?
"Come to keep an eye on things, haven't you, lass?"
It's vital you get some nourishment into him.
Milk or gruel will do until the injection starts to work.
"If he'll drink it, that'll do him the most good."
It took 1 0 days.
I didn't ask questions.
Should I have?
"You know, I was once a boy scout myself."
We brought concrete from Indiana.
I don't remember a sales tax.
"Was there one, or was it made to dematerialize?"
How come the union allowed us to use 50 mechanics when their contract stipulated 1 00 on a job this size?
Why would I know any of this?
Wasn't all this your job?
I didn't make these things happen.
Somebody else did.
I've tried not to ask who.
- So you don't know?
- What are you saying to me?
A lawyer once told me you can't be convicted of perjury for something you didn't say.
What are you talking about perjury?
What is going on?
I have to tell the truth about what I know.
And so you shall.
And that's it?
"You have nothing more to say, nothing to warn me about, nothing to help me to know what to expect?"
"They really could have come up with a more attractive plaza to represent our city, don't you think?"
Rick.
"Where you're standing right now used to be a mountain range, and before that, an ocean."
Keep that in mind.
All things pass away.
[sighs]
- What are you doing here?
"- Hey, Dad."
- You're supposed to be in school.
- l ditched.
"And this is my property, so police or no police, you're trespassing."
- Now what do you want?
- A man was killed last night not half a mile from here.
- Where were you?
"- ""Where were you?"""
Don't you be flimflamming with your penny-ante questions.
"You're not interested in where ""I"" was."
Very well.
Where was she?
She was locked up all night and nowhere near your dead man.
(Murdoch):
And why do you keep her caged?
To keep her safe.
It's in her own best interest.
"And charging admission to view her in a cage, is that also in her best interest?"
She's... paying her keep.
"- Mr. Travis, is it?"
- Aye.
You're coming with us to the Station House.
- I have no reason to.
- Do I have to arrest you?
- Come on!
- Don't lay your hands on me.
- (girl grunting)
- I'm doing nothing the law says I can't!
Unlawful confinement of a person or persons.
You're coming with us.
I finished my anatomy report on the unclaimed bank robber.
- Mrs. Braxton?
- Yes.
"I appreciated the opportunity, Dr. Ogden."
"Well, if you put what you learn to good use, her unfortunate death will not be for nothing."
"Alfred, find the earthquakes."
Listen to me.
What kind of place is that?
That is an underground plutonium processing plant.
Translate that into financial terms.
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.
That's why I like scientists.
"They're always discovering new, expensive things."
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.
I suppose you're going to have Tony split an atom bomb or something.
In effect Yes
"Well, I didn't count on killing anybody."
Especially not us.
It will never go that far.
They will pay anything to prevent it.
This is the first step towards my becoming the most powerful man in the world.
"IDs, please."
Take a powder.
Tony.
Those are the outer security scanners.
Put them out of commission permanently.
The scanning systems are malfunctioning.
"All right, let's run a maintenance check."
"Three million bucks, you'd think these things would work right."
- Where to?
"- Andy's place, know it?"
"Yeah, sure."
I know where everything is.
Second and third?
- Fourth and market.
- That one.
- Hop in.
"We got knocked down, but we got right back up."
"You can see that my right arm's gone, yet here I stand tall on my own two feet!"
"The Berolina Statue, the old symbol of Berlin, high above the Alexanderplatz ― they tore it down."
It's no longer standing.
Why?
"It was metal on the outside, but hollow inside."
But... this little gizmo here ― this gave me the idea.
They can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet.
That's right.
It has metal where it counts.
"Think about it, folks."
Metal where it counts.
"You get knocked over, but you'll always get back on your feet ― as long as a man's got two legs to stand on."
"But it's not a man's legs that matter, or his arms, but what he's got in here!"
The Story of Franz Biberkopf
Administration of Tegel prison
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
"Come on, leave."
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
I just can't keep up with this.
"Come on, we'll go and drink some korn."
Even such things are still around.
Where did he go with my suitcase?
I think you got mugged.
They even stole that one.
There is nothing left for me now.
But that doesn't matter.
- At least you can't lose anything.
Haven't seen you in a while.
A beer and two rissoles.
Because I didn't think anybody would be here!
I thought that Jabbar and his men would be trying -- trying to kill me!
"Look, I have millions invested in here!"
I was just trying to salvage something!
"I thought they were gone, and then a couple of guys came back."
How many?
How many guys?
Three?
Five?
I don't know!
Just get down here!
"That doesn't sound good, Sam."
I know.
"When planning an escape, patience is key."
"Someone without training might jump at the first chance to strike, but that's exactly the wrong time, because that's when your enemy's most alert."
"In fact, the best time to make your move is after you've let plenty of other opportunities go by."
The other advantage of patience is it gives you a chance to find out if the situation has changed.
What happened?
"We were on our way to his house, and my -- my men called."
He snuck into his warehouse.
"He was hiding in his office, crying like a woman."
We got the pig.
Now you'll get to see him bleed.
I been waiting for so long.
It's been 10 months since you helped my whore of a wife run away from me.
10 months.
Now I think...
My waiting is done.
"Look, I-I don't -"
"- I don't know where she is, okay?"
That's a lie.
"No, l-listen, okay?"
"Yeah, basically there's a really fit bloke"
"""His reputation precedes him."
"""He's been in and out of the scandal sheets."""
"""His attention to style has been noted."""
Something of a dandy.
"In the Regency House, the ladies are all aflutter."
Musician and dandy Mr. Austin Howard has arrived.
"Well, well."
"Famed for their wit, dandies were invited to house parties to charm and amuse the ladies."
How wonderful a greeting.
"Regency pinups, they were feted like pop stars."
Such gaiety.
Everyone's very excited about your arrival.
"Without money or status, there were few opportunities for black people to enter society."
Musical talent offered a rare way in.
There's a definite lack of musical talent in the house.
Is there indeed?
Do you play the piano?
"Uh, no, but I'm going to have..."
My quartet will be arriving shortly.
"Well, I'd like to introduce you to everybody."
"So, what did you think of Mr. Austin Howard, then?"
Um...
Marks out of ten?
An 11.
Really?
G.B.'s only an eight.
"I was going to say 12, actually."
Twelve?
There you go.
"Miss Victoria, 12."
Twelve?
Could we please just turn those lights down a little?
You need them for the public-access cameras.
I know.
It's unfortunate.
Nobody looks good in high def.
"You know, if you would like to address this council as a citizen, you can go ahead and wait at..."
Could you stop with the fucking spotlight?
"Celia, check the language at the door."
Families are watching.
"You know, I know what you're trying to do."
"I know what you're all trying to do, and it's not gonna work."
I don't need you to like me.
How about we put this to a vote?
"All those who don't like Celia, say ""aye."""
Aye.
The public has spoken.
Damn it!
"- Saturday's Dad's birthday, you know."
- I know.
"Well, we have a lot to do to get ready."
Maybe we'll scale down on the party a little this year.
- Last year was kind of a lot.
- What did you guys do last year?
"Ate his favorite food, watched his favorite movies, and beat the shit out of a piñata."
That's right.
He always did have a thing for piñatas.
"- Did he ever hit you, Nancy?"
- I'm not filled with candy.
"So, what's the plan?"
"We'll do something, maybe just not the full-on, all-day celebration."
Why can't we just do what we did last year?
I'm not sure I can handle it.
It's ugly.
It's loud.
It's always moving.
I never feel still long enough to hold a thought.
I feel sick out there among the people.
"I need to remedy this, and an opportunity has presented itself."
I'm gonna take it.
I've got no money and no hope of another advance.
I'm doing what's best for me.
"Yeah, you're doing what you're best at."
You're looking out for your own self interests without thinking about how it might affect me or anybody else.
Typical!
You're hardly around anyway.
You won't even notice.
"Hey, don't tell me I'm not gonna notice that I'm alone all of a sudden."
Why can't you do something that involves me?
Why can't we go somewhere together?
"You know, alone or..."
Is it the money?
Because I don't mind if you need to borrow some again...
"Put your money away, all right?"
I'm not taking any money from you.
Those days are behind me.
"Forever, I told myself."
I hope this will be good for us.
But especially for me.
You are selfish and unsentimental.
- Everyone knows this about you.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.
On the contrary.
"An admirable trait, if you ask me."
I come from an unsupportive background.
"And I thought, ""Well, this won't go well, I probably shouldn't."""
"But I thought, ""Well, what would my mother say?"""
LAUGHTER
"I thought, ""Well, she'd say, 'Yes'"", so I said, ""Yes"", and I snorted this not overgenerous line, and I realised, as soon as I'd done this,"
"that this wasn't cocaine, as we know it."
"It was burning at the back of my nose, and I said to this man, ""What was that?"""
"He said, ""Oh, it's crystal meth,"""
and crystal meth...
Phone your mum.
LAUGHTER
"I mean, it makes you very, shall we say, uninhibited."
And I realised I'd been groomed by this man.
"He'd sent his friend along, cos then he was able to approach me."
They were working in tandem?
I was more receptive.
And I went off with this man...
and I'll just jump ahead three days.
LAUGHTER
Please don't.
"No, you don't want to know."
"Oh, we do."
I came too in a multistorey car park in Harlem.
"Oh, what bad luck, Julian."
"Well, there's a..."
You know...
LAUGHTER
"You go to a club, have some drugs with someone you've never met before and then all hell breaks loose."
It wasn't what I was expecting.
Were you in a car?
"I was near, shall we say, an open boot."
Were you?
"But, there's a sequel to this."
"In a few seconds, staying conscious won't even be chemically possible."
Mr. Stancati.
I take it you're not a morning person?
Coffee?
No thanks.
That last drink had quite the kick.
Yes.
"Yes, indeed."
"Well, why don't you get dressed and join us outside?"
"Sorry for the, uh, the strip search."
"Trust me, it's nothing personal."
All weapons and recording devices will be returned to you once you leave the island.
"Surely, you'd let a lady have her watch."
"Ah, not when it's housing a G.P.S. Transponder, no."
"Play with me again, and I will have you shot."
You don't know where we are because I don't want you to know.
We have business.
Let's do it.
Time to see the merchandise.
It's about a 5-minute walk.
"Uh, watch out for snakes..."
And each other.
Radar detected a speedboat leaving the ship last night.
"Guys, if bosley's been taken off-board, he could be anywhere."
It's a big ocean out there.
"Charlie, we're hoping you can narrow things down for us."
"Luckily, I can."
I had my contact target the search to a few key nearby islands.
Most of them are owned by the requisite movie stars and corporate titans.
This one is the odd man out.
It belongs to Carlton Finch.
"With a name like that, he's got to be bad news."
Mr.Smith. Mr.Hilliard.
"Ambrose, you must see, you, me, the industry, we are all at the service of the war."
"""The War""? ""The War""?"
Damn bloody war.
The war has skimmed off the cream and we are left with the rancid curse.
I'm sorry I took so long.
There was a bomb crater on the Millibar Road.
Oh!
No one told me there was a meeting.
No.
We rather tried to keep this under wraps at present.
"It seems that there's someone in this disdain department, who knows there's someone who says that the Starling sisters never got to Dunkirk."
That their engine broke down before they even were out of British waters.
Pity.
Pity all around really.
Your first draft bore it so well.
"Actually, the Starking sisters lied."
What difference does it really make?
God sake!
Of course it makes a difference!
It's not the truth!
"The truth is, they stole a boat from a man, who terrified them and... set out to cross 50 miles of open sea into a war."
They never got there!
Because their engine failed!
Now that's a truth we won't be telling.
Moral sapping apparently.
We pick our truths.
Isn't that the point?
"We are saying, this is based on a true story."
We don't!
For Christ above man!
You are supposed to be a propagandist.
Use his.
Where is Alexander?
Are you stupid or what?
"There were problems, OK?"
- Why is he on the ground?
- He had this on him.
Why didn't you take him in?
- We wanted to talk to you first.
- Oh?
We were a bit hard on a pusher.
The one who supplies your son.
We broke his rib.
And you're judging the case.
Can I take my son home?
- Get in.
- What about my car?
I'll get it picked up.
If word ever gets out...
PARENTS
I am sure my father realizes perfectly well   that stuff happens that shouldn't.
I don't think he gives a shit.
To him what matters is that I get some qualifications   and when I am with him and his people -
- I play ball and behave the way he wants.
What matters to my parents is that you do something with your life.
They aren't that emotional.
They have no idea what we do at weekends   as long as we get good grades.
It's off their radar.
We haven't had the close family ties everyone else has.
Lousy attention is better than no attention.
Do I feel neglected?
My father has never been to watch me play football or anything.
Some of these parents are unable to help their children to straighten up.
That's my business.
But you...
I don't know what the hell you think you're trying to do.
"Well, I'm trying to fight a war."
I'm trying to get these people off this rock in one piece.
"Anything for the cause, Major."
"Gaius, I am on the verge of seeing the faces of the final five cylons."
Maybe the face of God himself.
"... the five lights of the apocalypse rising, struggling towards the light..."
Scenes revealed only to those who enter the temple.
Only to the chosen one.
The chosen one.
The chosen one.
The five await me.
"Gaius, I'm so close to knowing the truth."
What truth ?
Caprica.
I'd like to think that we three have shared something.
Transcended the barriers that separate people.
"And yet, somehow, the more time goes on, the more I find myself on the outside looking in."
"Well, that's not the case at all."
Is it ?
"Because we three, we're integral."
We're part of...
We're finished.
"Baltar's and my destiny lie separate from yours, Caprica."
The five lights will be revealed only to those who enter the temple.
We have to go down to the planet.
"Only you and I, can see this through."
What are you after ?
What is this secret that you keep pursuing ?
You have to tell me the truth.
That's all.
Mandrian and I were together.
The first thing I knew was when I came out into the corridor and saw Rafford.
And you?
I am called Levett.
Did you see or hear anything?
I was asleep in my quarters.
Would anybody else have seen you there?
- Why should anyone else bother?
"- All right, there's no need for that."
"There are worse things than being alone, Sonheim."
Being with you is one of them
"We're getting away from the point a little, aren't we?"
You were all knocked out by Sonovapour.
"At some time in the last 12 hours, your pilot was murdered."
"And since you're the only people here on board, then I presume..."
"No, we're not."
Dortmunn isn't here.
- Who is Dortmunn?
- Flight engineer.
"Well, where is he?"
"I want him found, Mandrian."
Search the whole ship.
He's got to be here somewhere.
"Sonheim, Levett."
Whilst your people look for him I'll go and see how my people are getting on.
They're on the flight deck assessing the damage.
Will you come with me?
Right.
"Well, there's nothing I can do with that, it'll have to be replaced."
What's the situation?
"We can fit some of it back together, but there are a lot of components that will have to be replaced."
Aka more aliases than they would care to mention.
They are small-time thieves who have inexplicably hit the big-time.
- I smell artifact.
- I smell a loser.
Come on.
"Let's let Artie get through this so we can just not be here any longer than necessary, all right?"
- Thank you very much.
Much appreciated.
- You're welcome.
- So what is this... this artifact?
- It's unconfirmed.
"But if there's one, it's given these two an unbelievable amount of luck."
That defies all the laws of probability.
"They've had winning streaks in Miami, Detroit and Atlantic City..."
Not one single gaming commission alarm bell has been tripped.
"Well, how?"
"Well, they go into a gaming room as high rollers."
Anybody?
"Okay, fine."
And they're really good.
"And they win just enough money to stay under the radar, right?"
And then they get...
Fine.
They move on and don't get caught.
So they're taking a little back from the house.
"OMG, what's the BFD?"
What?
Iniquitous hands with the means to exploit fate.
"- ""Iniquitous"" means ""bad."""
"- Thanks, Roget."
So where are they now?
"3 hours ago, they checked into room 1510 at the Maximus hotel in Las Vegas."
- Hey.
"- Hey, Madam Senator."
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.
I wish you'd heard the speech.
That line you gave me about...
"""If we can put a man on the moon, then why can't we put all men on the moon?"""
It was perfect.
It really broke the ice.
"- Great audience for that, huh?"
"- Yeah, it was great."
What's goin' on?
"Uh... well, it looks like Runyon or somebody close to him... has been running a little private investigation... looking for stuff that the Feds wouldn't even touch."
"- It's, um..."
- Yeah?
What is it?
What...
- He doesn't know anything about it.
- You're asking me to step down?
I'm asking you to do what's in the best interest of the party... and this president.
"Well, I'm sorry."
"I can't do it, not over this."
He's not going to allow me or himself... to get shot down over what would've been a private sexual encounter.
"- Some swan song for the old man, huh?"
- It's fuckin' awful.
The senator got a little wild when she was 19.
What is the big deal?
Let me explain the big deal to you.
The people of this nation can stomach quite a bit.
But one thing they can't stomach is the image of a vice president with a mouthful of cock.
You don't have to use...
Look.
I led the others.
I shot out your mirror machine.
Did you think that was the only medium of instrumentality at my command?
I took that chance.
I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong.
"Oh, then you do admit to the charges?"
"Yes, anything!"
Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey.
Uhh!
You pompous--
Immaterial!
Those people have done you no harm.
Inadmissible!
"We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement."
Silence!
This trial is over.
You are guilty.
"On all counts, you are guilty."
"According to your own laws, this court has no choice in fixing punishment."
"You will hang by the neck, Captain, until you are dead, dead, dead!"
"Captain 's Log, Stardate 2126.3."
First Officer Spock reporting.
Still no word from Captain Kirk on the surface below us.
Waiting time is almost up.
I willsoon be forced to attempt departure as per instructions.
"Until a moment ago, I didn't think it possible, but it was."
I did it.
I was angry.
I actually experienced genuine rage.
This experiment has been successful.
I'm glad you weren't disappointed.
"Why, Captain, you're still angry."
"This is Gordon, Sir."
Your wings.
"Thank you, Sir."
You're from Canada?
I'm very glad to see you here.
"Thank you, Sir."
Where do you come from?
"London, Sir."
"Yes, I suppose I should have known."
Your wings.
"Thank you, Sir."
"Company, eyes left!"
You've been rehearsing this for months on mock-ups of the terrain.
It should be as familiar to you as the back of your hand.
"Only, this is the real thing."
Operation Pegasus goes tonight.
You all know its purpose.
It's to bring back a piece of German radar equipment that's been helping to shoot down our bombers.
To recapitulate for the last time.
"Our first group will take the house and the radar post,"
"Meanwhile, we will hold off the Gerry garrison in the farmhouse."
Our second group will take and hold the beaches where we'll join them until the Navy can take us out.
Any questions?
Any suggestions?
Right.
"You men come from a lot of different places and a lot different units, but you have certain things in common."
Original Roman legions.
You are well armed.
I think you've been well trained.
You've got a full moon and a rising tide.
The rest is up to you.
Good hunting.
- No.
I misunderstood your behaviour.
But I would like this not to occur many times.
"This never happens more, respectable major lord."
Well this not something turned out nicely.
Not trouble.
It is not the important one.
The beauty arrives then.
It is necessary to wait its time out only.
It is the important one that we are here.
We are together.
Our hand moves.
The time goes by.
How do you feel?
"Very much, very much good."
"Really, very well."
Tót family did not get used to the night out however.
After 2-3 clocks the signs of the tiredness on they start appearing.
And this the tiredness showed on disciplined Tót mostly.
What it is possible to understand of course.
Since he slept in his bed already at this time another time
"Well you know, simply fascinating this work."
"Do not know to say, how much I enjoy it."
"I know that now, this work brings me into order then totally."
If only would be so.
"We would be glad the best, major lord."
Are you not tired?
"I hope so, you speak if you want to sleep."
To sleep.
Yet what no.
Very good one like that to do this with the major lord.
I am me so with him somehow.
- I don't know.
It's gonna take a little more yabba yabba.
Good.
Go help Ziva and McGee.
I gotta see a lady about a card game.
"Anything, Abbs?"
"Four decks scanned, two to go."
"Naturally, there's no shortage of fingerprints."
- I.D.'s?
- Mostly sailors.
And the blackjack dealer.
Of course.
He touched every card.
"You know, it would help to know if I was looking for someone specifically."
Yeah.
Just keep looking.
"That the best you got, McGee?"
"Well, the only surveillance of the pizzeria was from a rooftop across the street."
"Lucky us, all the video files were corrupted."
"But we believe this is Petty Officer Adams, based on the time he is seen leaving the pizzeria and the direction he is headed."
Anyone else?
There's this man.
Left a few frames before.
Who is he?
"Well, we still don't have a clear shot of his face yet, Director."
Wait-- in the window-- is that a reflection?
"Enhance it, McGee."
He appears to be a civilian.
Sailor said a guy bragged to him about winning money.
"A ton of it, only, he was too impaired to remember who it was."
"But the game was rigged, so no one could have won a ton of money."
And that would make that winner a shill.
Away from all the problems of the world.
I think I might have brought my problems with me.
Away you go then.
It's just that I want to write something.
"Well, then write it!"
About Trina.
"Ah, right."
"A life must be worth a few well chosen words more than just ""Body found in car."""
"Yeah, but there are so many rumours flying around now."
You can't even see the ducks from the trees.
I think you might find the expression is 'wood from the trees'.
It doesn't even make any sense.
Trees are made of wood.
"Yeah, yeah that's the point."
"Nah, I still don't get it."
"But anyway, back to your problem."
"Which is essentially that if I, if I write only the bare facts,"
I feel like I would have done her and injustice.
"Yeah, but on the other hand you don't want to upset anyone and you know, go into messy, gory details."
"No, I don't want to do that."
I was out here the other morning and right before my eyes
I saw two dolphins mating.
It was beautiful.
Beautiful!
But also a bit disturbing.
"Yeah, I can imagine."
"And when they get, you know, quite passionate, they actually bite each other's fins."
Quite badly.
It can scar them for life.
Is that what happened?
"Nah, nah, nah, a killer whale appeared and chased them off."
And me.
One second!
What are you doing here?
"We're tutoring them, it's all completely legal!"
Where... did the previous tenants go?
I came here two weeks ago.
And I don't know the previous tenants.
"Oh, Tae Ho!"
Why are you coming out of that room?
Did you get them mixed up?
What are you talking about?
That room was just storage space for our equipment.
Since we had a lot of communications equipment...
"And because the rent was so expensive we sent the equipment to the head office, and let the room go up for rent."
How does that make any sense?
"There were two men, and this woman, both of whom you work with, in that room!"
The two men!
Where are they?
We didn't come here to play.
We are here because of a murder!
And I know you ordered them to do all of this!
You?
So this is how you're going to be?
- Jung In!
- Yes?
Have you ever been to room 866?
No.
"See, Tae Ho?"
What reason would we have to hire two more male employees?
When all we have to do is gather the agents whenever they showed up!
I know your job is to trick people.
"But try to do it in moderation, okay?"
"I'm telling you that I saw them, very clearly, with my own eyes."
Indeed.
"The treasure remains, and amongst it is the compass."
Now it will guide us to your land.
"Cora has the means to open a portal with the wardrobe ashes, but she can't find your land without the compass."
"Once we get it, steal the ashes from her, and we're on our way."
How do we know you're not just using us to get the compass for Cora?
Because you four are far safer company.
All I need is a ride back.
I'll swear allegiance to whomever gets me there first.
Then we'd better start climbing.
Right.
So...
(Chuckles)
I failed to mention that the giant enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders.
"All right, so how do we get up there?"
"I've got a counter spell from Cora, if you'd be so kind."
"Thank you, milady."
(Whooshing tinkle) I've got one more of these.
Cora was to accompany me.
So... which one of you four lovelies shall take her place?
Hmm?
Go on.
Fight it out.
"Don't be afraid to, you know, really get into it."
"(Horns blare in distance, indistinct conversations)"
(Horn honks)
(Door squeaks)
(Clanks)
(Engine starts)
(Engine revving)
(Shifts gears)
Impressive.
To commemorate my time here. so i hope to see you there.
Both of you.
Is that a program?
Yeah. and smile.
Today's the first day of the rest of your life.
Way ahead of you.
This graduation is a celebration for us too.
No more mean girls.
We have suffered under their dictatorship for way too long.
"Starting next fall, there'll be peace in the kingdom."
J. wanna throw your hat in the ring?
What are you talking about?
Queen. what else is there to talk about?
The fact that there's not gonna be a queen next year?
What would high school be without hierarchy?
Bearable?
a nice place to spend time?
Ladies.
I thought we were matching our headbands under our caps.
- What's going on?
- your minions were just telling me
About the search for the next queen.
They don't get to choose the next queen. i do.
"And take off that hideous scarf, penelope."
You can see if from space.
Not so fast j. don't waste your time appealing to blair.
We don't listen to her anymore.
The coronation happens at midnight at nate archibald's party.
Whoever brings us the biggest piece of untold
Constance gossip wins and you've got competition.
The new girl emma boardman transferring in next year.
Nice to meet you little j.
Silence!
I made a program for you and you decided not to follow it.
You defied my instructions and you went off course.
"Why are we being held to a different standard, Marcel?"
You weren't here on time this morning.
"I was here before sunrise, sadly, by myself."
"Therefore, I chose not to wait."
"Marcel, I've got to be honest with you."
You know...
Silence!
"No, you silence!"
"Please, just..."
"I don't need some speech about moments, okay?"
"No more, okay?"
"I'm sorry that we kept you waiting this morning and that we didn't respect your program, but last night my wife and I, we spent some real time together, and for the first time in a long time,"
"we woke up actually very, very happy."
"So, with all due respect, sir,"
"I don't need you, or anyone else for that matter, to, you know, say anything, really."
I know.
Sorry?
You do?
Yes.
That is why I am giving you this.
I don't understand.
I could never reveal your true inner animal spirit.
It was always up to you.
"Cynthia, Jason, your spirit is the rabbit."
"No matter what obstacles are put in front of him, the rabbit will scrape and burrow and find a way to create his home."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Lucy, Joseph."
"For you, the wolf."
- So what are we gonna do here?
- Should we drop the balloons?
"- No, no balloons."
- Maybe just drop half of them?
- No!
- Why do we even have balloons?
"Ma'am, I seriously overstepped the mark going out onstage."
That was a fuck-up.
"Yeah, I'll say."
You might want to watch that if you become president.
"If that does happen, want to be my veep?"
Why don't you go help them with the balloons?
Copy that.
[Woman] And now begins the ancient word.
"The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down."
"In the night, we make our feast."
"For centuries, I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls."
"I've brought them the lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones."
"Now, I am free, and the world turns upside down again."
"They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them."
"No boundaries, no borders."
"They will come for me, but I am coming for them."
"Their empire of blood will fall, and will not rest until it all burns."

"Tomorrow, I may be in possession of the city and its treasures."
- A theatrical titan.
"- Not really, Commodore."
Success is in my very grasp.
- Confounded flies.
- Tell me about it.
I have invested practically everything I have in a theatrical venture which is certain to make millions.
"Millions, duchess."
"Do you know, Commodore, since you've called me duchess when others address me as Mrs. Schultz."
I positively shudder.
"Yes, I can understand that."
"Now, as I was saying..."
But let's not talk anymore of money.
There are so many more important things.
- Name one.
"- Well, happiness."
There are times when I feel I could trade all my wealth for just a sip from the cup of dreams.
"For a cottage, small, by a waterfall."
You're so understanding.
"Uh, tell me, what is your opinion of the privileges of love?"
- I'm in favor of them.
- I mean..
Do you think a woman in love is privileged to speak her mind?
How can you stop them from doing it?

How many of these did you find?
Just one so far.
"Boy, that's pretty damn good."
Near perfect.
What's perfect?
"I was doing a random check, found a counterfeit $100 chip."
Costs a lot of money to make a phony this good.
You guys found a fake chip?
How long has he been on duty?
He's been up 36 hours.
I told him to take a break-
You go home.
Get some sleep.
I'm fine.
"If it's such a good fake, how can you tell it's fake?"
"Felt a little heavy in my hand, so I weighed it."
"Ends up it's 34 centigrams over specs, which only allow for a seven centigram variance margin."
You could tell this was 34 centigrams heavy just by holding it?
So happens I could.
Why are you being such a hater?
You know how little 34 centigrams is?
Shut up.
Both of you shut up.
"You-You... go home, get some sleep or I will put you to sleep."
You want to sell that?
"It ain't for sale, and you ain't gonna crisscross me out of it!"
No?
Perhaps we can give the commodore a few ideas.
You're right.
"Tell you what- wait a minute, wait!"

Our office.
"Oh, uh, nick- will you go in and talk to josie?"
Keep her company.
Lot of people in here i got to see.
What's the matter?
It's jammed.
That's my patented burglar alarm.
I wanted to be sure i'd catch you when you came out.
"You go over and sit down, and take it easy, old friend."
"Well, what's on the docket for today?"
Here's the usual hungry ones.
Take care of them.
"So... so you're the new member of our firm, huh?"
Do you approve?
"Well, i'll say this for jimmy- he certainly has an eye for beauty."
But i don't think that women and business mix any more than oil and water.
"We poor, helpless women certainly have to fight for our place in your man's world, don't we?"
Ambitious?
Very.
Do you think that necklace is going to make you a better actress?
"No, not a bit."
But i like wearing it and i'm tired of working in a dressing room.
Are you sorry for the payoffs?
Are you sorry for the bribes?
Or are you just sorry you got caught?
I'm sorry that my sepulchre may be too late.
Your sepulchre?
We may not have many opportunities to speak in the near future.
I owe you an explanation.
"- You're losing me, Miles."
"- No, you're losing me."
- Where the hell you going this time?
- Ha.
That is actually quite funny.
I'll send a report once I get there.
Are you telling me that you know the outcome of this investigation?
I know my outcome.
Fourth-stage pancreatic carcinoma.
"Amusing, isn't it, how we're all hostage to the politics of scale?"
- You have cancer?
- Look at this.
"For months, this has been the vessel of our ambition, yours and mine, and now in a day, it's nothing more than bits of cardboard and balsa wood held together with children's glue."
- ls there no cure?
- For ambition?
No.
"For my other disease, apparently not, either."
"Why did you come here, Miles?"
"To tell you that what you did was remarkable, even if no one ever sees it but me."
[Jessie laughing]
[Jessie] Yeah.
[Jessie and Karen talking]
"- [Karen] Oh, that is way too big."
"- No, it isn't. lt's fine."
Ow.
Alright?
Good.
So tell me...
Can you be trusted?
That's enough Tom.
"... It's a place, an organism, an arrangement  that operates primarily without money or monetary transactions ... but rather human interaction, so that we may confront one another  and exchange ideas, where everyone can find their own voice  and achieve a self-realization."
That's the top priority.
We are open to everyone who really wishes to contribute and live among us.
What develops here depends on each and every one of us.
That's the basic idea.
Very good.
Hello.
"Ah, my neighbor."
"Yes, that's right."
Let's sing something together.
I'm a friend to the art of singing.
"Sounds like there's a ""but"" coming."
But... only when I feel like it.
It's much different for me.
I could sing all day long.
"Obviously, you don't like my singing."
No.
It's dreadful.
I'm just being honest.
That's how I am.
I'm very sorry but your singing annoys me.
That's why you're here?
I just wanted to make that clear before we get closer to each other.
Who says that I want to get closer to you?
Get out!
The Goldfish
- Welcome to the news!
Go away.
"Doctor, we are terribly sorry, but we aren't doing it out of spite."
We don't have it easy either.
Such research is so terribly demanding.
We are trained specialists.
I spent my youth on a simulator.
With my head downwards.
I didn't have a childhood at all.
Do you know what it means to toil through cold eternal space from planet to planet whole light years
with such a half-wit?
You should take a rest.
Do you also rest sometimes?
-Only in critical situations.
-And how?
Shall we show it to the doctor?
"Well, actually it's a secret."
But we can show it to you.
"Ten, nine, eight, seven..."
-Six.
"-...six, five, four, three, two,"
"One, now!"
"So how did you like it, doc..."
RESERVATION
In the last episode of our serial Mystical Outer Space we explained some groundless theories about the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and their alleged envoys on Earth.
Today...
-There he is!
-Fasten your seat belt and no smoking.
How many times do I have to remind you?
Doctor!
Doctor?
-Are you here?
Hallo!
"Well, then why were you staring?"
It was hard to miss.
"Trust me, Salvadore is the least of our problems."
It's freezing in here.
Why would they make a room like this?
You should have seen my masseuse.
She was so hot.
You're supposed to be relaxing out here.
Why do you think I wanted to get a full release?
You know what?
I don't even want to get into this with you.
Into what?
I don't want to get into this conversation with you.
Why is that?
"Because I don't want to be put in a position where l,d have to lie."
Why are you getting all high and mighty on me?
"No, I'm not so high and mighty."
"Joey, I'm not judging you,"
I'm just not asking anything because
I don't want...
I don't want to know.
"Because that way, if someone asks me..."
You won't have to rat me out.
I would never rat you out.
Of course I wouldn't't rat you out.
"Right, right."
"But this way, I don't have to make that decision because I really don't know."
"All right, let me ask you something, then."
"Could you honestly say that after seven years together, that you get turned on by the same woman?"
I do.
Without going to the highlight reel.
You're playing a verbal shell game.
You know he loved you like a son.
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."
"Marion, get out of here!"
Duck!
Doctor Jones.
Die herr in the bar Möchten mit ihnen Sprechen.
Kommen Sie bitte mit uns.
You're looking for me?
"Ha, ha ,ha.."
Belloq.
"Good afternoon, Dr. Jones."
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
"Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other,"
They're not going to interfere in our business.
It wasn't I who brought the girl into this business.
"Please, sit down before you fall down."
We can at least behave like civilized people.
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
"How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters."
I almost regret it.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
You and I are very much alike.
Archaeology is our religion.
Yet we have both fallen from the pure faith.
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
I am a shadowy reflection of you.
"It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light."
Now you're getting nasty.
You know it's true.
No need to wait here any longer.
He hasn't got the plans.
- We'll see you later on.
- Splendid.!
"Splendid, old boy.!"
I look forward to it.
Might have a spot of lunch at the club one day.
And don't forget to give that message to your superiors.
I know they'll be relieved to hear that.
Good morning.
I tell you the girl must have them on her.
They weren't in her room and she didn't give them to Wooster.
Why not let us go up and get her?
There's no use in being diplomatic.
"From now on, you two keep away from her."
- I'll handle this in my own way.
- If that's the way you want it.
"- Remember, this girl is clever."
- That's why I propose to take care of her myself.
I'm going to meet her in the lobby and then take her to the private garage.
- What about that Wooster?
- You don't need worry about him.
We'll take care of Mr. Wooster after we've got the girl.
"And, remember, we can't afford to fumble this time."
I've wired the chief in Paris that I'll be with him tomorrow.
"Here, you'd better put these in the safe until we get the other half."
"I'll take that, Mr. Manville."
"And now, what have you done with McDermott?"
"- If you'll give me those plans, I'll tell you."
- Don't move.
Don't panic.
She can't hurt you with that.
Why should we?
We didn't have anything anyone would want!
"Easy, easy."
They poured it on like...
"Like phasers, only worse, whatever they were using."
I tried to signal them.
"We called up, tried to surrender."
We had women and children.
I told them that.
I begged them.
They wouldn't listen.
They didn't let up for a moment.
"Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus III."
One for the Enterprise to go there and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface.
"They hit us a full day before you got there, captain."
"No messages came from us, captain."
Why did they do it?
Why?
Why did they do it?
There has to be a reason.
- There has to be a reason!
- It was a trap.
Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus III.
Getting us and our whole crew to come ashore.
Very clever.
As to the reason...
The reason is crystal clear.
The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation.
"Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open."
"You allude to invasion, captain, yet positive proof has not..."
I have all the proof I need on Cestus III.
"Not necessarily, sir."
Some women don't like to get chummy when their panties are down.
"You okay in there, bestie?"
I'm fine...
The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness;
the inability to pass uri...
"Yeah, I said I'm fine."
Stop talking to me.
She always this crabby when she urinates?
We're really not that close.
Screw it.
I'll go later.
And I'll be right by your side.
Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
"Oh, that's nice."
"No, it's not."
It's a strategic maneuver.
Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty to you and the group.
That bitch is crafty.
- You think?
- Of course.
How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests?
By going after its weakest member.
"Well, what makes me the weakest member?"
Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body.
You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.
"Okay, Amy, you're being silly."
I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who.
And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup.
"Ooh, these are cute."
"Of course if I buy them,"
I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
It doesn't matter.
"It's sad, really, to see a once-mediocre realtor reduced to this."
"Gil, please, let's keep this civil."
"Oh, by the way, if you ever speak disrespectfully again about my wife, I'll kill you."
Sorry.
That sounded like a joke.
I will actually kill you.
"Anyhoo, when you guys wake up and smell the sulfur, here's a list of other realtors, and if you need me, I'll be in the office at 9:00..."
"Uh, 10:00."
I have the dentist.
Where did that come from?
Life's too short to be ruled by fear.
"What do you say we get you the right dryer, princess?"
"Oh, my."
"I mean, Phil is usually just so..."
"But then he was just, like, so..."
And then he got even more...
There's nothing I can do.
- I can't go for that.
- No can do.
Cameron here bought an eggshell dryer.
"Not white, not oatmeal, not Swiss-coffee, not baby-powder, not bone."
Eggshell.
"Look, Rob, is it?"
That's interesting.
Here's how this is going down...
We don't leave without that eggshell dryer.
"Not swan-feather, not Chester-pig-white."
I think we've covered the colors.
I sell houses to people every day who ask me where they should buy their dryer.
I don't think you want me giving them any... static.
I may have one in the back.
"But it takes two guys to load the truck, and it's just me today."
And I did go looking for someone to help me get away.
And I am glad that I did.
"Because if I hadn't, I wouldn't have found you."
But you already had a husband.
Not in my eyes.
My father arranged that marriage when I was 14.
Did you object to the arrangement at that time?
It didn't seem real at that time.
"Besides, in my family we didn't often object to my father's wishes."
Did you make any preparations to be married?
No!
I was in school.
I was learning about the world.
And then I realised that I wasn't going to be allowed to be a part of it.
"That my world, my life, had all been decided for me."
And so I decided to leave.
And I would do it again.
You would do it again with a dowry given to you by another man?
I was frightened.
What if things didn't work out with Jimmy?
My family would have disowned me.
I would have nothing.
Nothing?
"Actually, you would have $575,000 in a Swiss bank."
You doing okay?
"I don't know, sir."
She never told me about any of that.
"You know, you have your own trial to concentrate on."
"Don't lose sight of that, huh."
"God, I wouldn't even be on trial, sir, if she'd never told me she loved me."
"Will you excuse me, sir?"
I just...
"Oh, shit, I forgot about the car."
You haven't been moving it for street cleaning?
I've been gone for three weeks.
Do you know how many tickets I must have?
(TUTS)
I kind of would have thought this to be beneath you.
"You know, at one time I would have as well, but look at me now."
- You're a man of contradictions.
"- No, I'm not."
Who are all these assholes?
They're my friends.
"""They're my friends."""
Mostly.
"I got this job, this..."
"This national ad campaign, so..."
We're celebrating.
That's great.
NARRATOR: 'Philip wished Ashley had not reminded him 'of how great it felt to be proud of her.
'His own relationship with success had forced him 'to grow out of feeling resentful towards her accomplishments.
'He was not prepared to lose that constant stream of enthusiasm.'
You see?
You don't even need me.
"God, you really believe that, don't you?"
I'm not sure how to answer that without making things worse.
I supported you when nobody gave a shit about you.
I want you to know I regret that now.
Good.
ASHLEY:
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.
So you can just...
you can be somebody else's charity case.
- Maybe Zimmerman will take care of you.
I specifically remembered making sure that he had a cot.
"I think he made that up, I think he wanted the attention."
"He totally did, he's such a drama queen."
"- He was a trouper, though."
- I don't know how he did that...
"I think it really hurt him to sit and stuff so when he's sitting in the van, you know..."
But he never really complained.
"But look at the energy, just..."
"I mean, when I'm in agony, I don't do stuff like that, normally."
"When I'm in agony, I make sure everybody knows that I'm in agony."
Absolutely.
Rule number one.
"- Hey, I'm in agony."
- Sympathy.
- put on some pants.
- I like this tune.
"- Yeah, put on some pants."
- I like this tune.
"- Yeah, put on some pants."
"- Ari, we are adorable."
"- Shut up, there we are."
This is still all reshoot stuff.
- All reshoots.
"- Oh, my gosh."
Did you guys have to revisit anything to get back into character six months later?
- No.
- All me and Kat had to do is look deep into each other's eyes and then we were back.
All we had to do was...
"There's some creepy old men teachers, like, going in and out of the hallways."
"Remember, when we were waiting to go outside?"
That was all we needed.
"- Alexis, in that outfit, is so adorable."
Follow me.
Take a seat.
- I'm DS...
- Tea or coffee?
We're fine.
"Thank you, sir."
"As I was saying, I'm DS Arnott."
DC Fleming.
"Mr Fairbank, we'd like to begin by asking you about a social worker who went missing in October '98, Oliver Stephens-Lloyd."
Doesn't ring a bell.
"If we may, sir, perhaps this report might jog your memory."
Blind as a bat without these.
Are you sure you don't want a tea or coffee?
We're fine.
"Thank you, sir."
Sorry.
The report was copied to you.
"I mean, is there any reason you might take an interest?"
None at all.
Can you explain why you'd be sent this report?
"Well, I don't remember any of this."
"I mean, you're going back a good many years."
"We'd like to show you some newspaper clippings, if we may."
You appear to be quite close to Councillor Dale Roach.
Our paths crossed occasionally.
Usually at a charity event.
We weren't close.
"Well, we're looking into allegations of child sexual exploitation involving Councillor Roach."
"As head of Vice, did you ever deal with any complaints against Roach?"
"Well, there may have been some such saying,"
"""Councillor Roach has done this,"" or, ""Councillor Roach did that."""
And what would it be that the councillor did?
Holy shit.
You got more and more beautiful since I last saw you.
How do you do that?
What is your secret?
It's youth.
And she's clever too.
I haven't seen you forever.
"Mom, can I stay for a bit?"
"Yeah, if it's okay with Nicole."
"I'm gonna put you to work if you're gonna stay, so get changed, and there's an extra pair of gloves by the door."
Okay.
"Don't dig too deep, okay?"
Why?
Is this where you're hiding all the bodies?
Kind of.
Remember when Mom had that problem with the morning glories?
"Yeah, she was obsessed."
"I mean, they're beautiful, but she said there was too much of them, too much beauty."
Yeah.
"If you don't control them, they end up taking over the whole garden, strangling all the other plants."
So you have two options.
"You can either pull them all out, start fresh, or you can ride the chaos."
"So which is it for you, Mary?"
"If anything ever happened to me, you'd take care of them, right?"
"Normally I'm not usually happy to see to see a dead man but I'm happy, I really am."
Finally got a body.
Yeah.
"Well, if pento shows up in the autopsy, then it's over, right?"
She basically handed us the case.
"We rattled her with the wire, she slipped up."
Frank Gaines.
Mr. Bennett.
"No, thanks."
"I had a raisin earlier and, boy, am I stuffed."
"Sabrina, you're looking awfully skinny."
"You're not still on that diet, are you?"
Me?
"No, I'm fine."
"Hey, do I see a little scalp up there?"
(gasps)
(gasps)
Don't tell me.
I've inherited the Spellman gene for a keister the size of Manhattan.
"Oh, I knew it."
It was just some sort of spell.
And yet the insecurity about my butt won't go away.
I think it's time to bring back suspenders.
"Sabrina, we have to talk."
"Oh, well, I only have a little while before Harvey picks me up for the dance and your stern lectures tend to eat up the clock."
"Not only are these things a scam, but they can cause serious side effects."
But I have to lose weight.
Like making you think you have to lose weight.
"Come here, look in the mirror."
"No, not the mirror!"
It's so cruel and unforgiving!
Not anymore.
"That creepy salesman put a spell on it, but I deactivated it."
See?
What are you talking about?
It's like looking at a picture of William Howard Taft.
"Oh, no."
All this dieting has affected you psychologically.
"You can't see that you're so thin, you're practically sick."
"Oh, well, what good is my health if I'm not Queen?"
Do you want to come?
EVERYTHING IS READY
I am very contented to see everyone reunited here.
For me it is something indespensible.
I am happy that you have prevailed in life and that you have become fortunate.
Today we will celebrate.
A party like in our youth.
I hope you have a prosperous future.
Today's special:
CURRY RICE. 15 CENTS
It's a pity on a day like this if you must pay.
For us the times ahead are very difficult.
"You are in luck, there's a job for you."
English Teacher in a girl's school.
How is your English?
Therefore you will no longer be anxious.
The school is in the city of Tochigi.
Shall we go?
"Don't be sad, someday we shall return to Tokyo."
You have not rid yourself of the vice of arriving late?
Let us sing the hymn of the school.
Three springs pass so quickly.
Your face is still as vibrant as a scarlet flower.
"Now we take leave of each other, in a future we'll meet again."

Go on now.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know.
If it were some female's handkerchief you would have traced it within a minute.
Look at this!
Uncle will be very happy!
Uncle is very fortunate!
When the rascal Kania doesn't find the dyes his face will be worth a look.

Are you sprinkling rosewater in some marriage or petrol?
- Hurry up. I'm very hungry.
- This petrol is very much like you.
"In appearance, it's as cold as water."
One can never know that it must have so much fire within.
"Looking at you, who would know that all the girls of Mumbai are stuffed up in your little heart!"
Don't you speak like this!
"As it is, where are the girls in Mumbai these days?"
All of them have become Putlibai's!
What are you doing?
- How fast can you run?
- l see...
You want to enter into a race with me?
Not with you but with this fire!
- You want to race with death?
- Life becomes joyful when one runs holding the fingers of death.
What do you say?
Fire is very menacing.
"As soon as it touches petrol, it shoots out like a bullet."
We are no less.
You are a flame.
And I am fire!
What do you say?
- Let's do it.
- Shall we?
Run!
"This is not good, Mr. Mogi..."
Otoharada...
Remember Me?
You should know that your acts no sense.
Make yourself.
Why do you think I agreed to share with you?
You need to know?
!
I will kill you
You will see
This is a promise!
"The man cut inside to by the police this is Otoharada Kuro, 46 years."
- The suspect in the early morning of 20...
- Otoharada... killed a taxi driver to Using a knife...
Kill the man and save my father!
Kill him!
Kill this man!
Sayu...
"If you shoot, they will launch the assault."
"If that happens, I can do anything for you."
Farm somewhat valve tone!
I also want to save the life of a murderer.
Do not condemn you!
Otoharada.
Shut up!
Shut up!
There's change .
To disarm the hostage taker special forces would prepare an assault .
The person whose name is written dies in this book
The cause of death must be written within 40 seconds to make that happen
A cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause in .
"The suspect Otoharada, would still entrenched"
And?
I haven't come up with anything conclusive.
"I'm not an expert or anything, but I have a theory."
Yea?
I figure...
I figure heaven...
"is probably a place where, nobody cares how big or small you are, or what you look like."
People probably don't even have bodies.
They're just maybe like...
essences or something.
"But if they do have bodies, everyone's gotta be naked for sure, cause that's we all showed up here in the first place, right?"
"And also, if you have a back problem... or bad knees or self-esteem issues."
That stuffs won't bother you anymore up there.
And everything's free too.
Or at least whole sale.
"I don't know if there's animal, but that'd be cool."
"Oh yea, and when you walkin' in to the gate for the very first time."
They're probably playing' that Louis Armstrong's song.
Somethin' nice like that.
Part of this came from this girl I knew.
She died.
It's a long story.
"Anyway, she thought everybody would be naked, that part was her idea."
- How did she die?
- I don't wanna talk about it!
"I mean, I do but... when I tried, never works."
Maybe someday.
Wow!
Sit up.
Who wants some snack?
You know what?
Wow!
- This dealer hasn't violated any state or federal laws?
- No.
- Hotel or Gaming Commission policies?
- I don't believe so.
"And there's no acts of moral turpitude, no guest complaints?"
What about the boss's complaints?
You have no grounds for dismissal.
And I assume I can't fire you for providing completely disagreeable advice.
I can't fire him.
Happy?
I'm so sorry.
"Well, don't celebrate too much."
I have a plan.
Can't wait.
I want you to find a cooler.
"Did you just say a ""cooler""?"
"Yeah, I just said a cooler."
Right.
"Monica, I know people talk about coolers, oh, and they made the movie, but, uh, there's no such thing as a cooler."
Did I hear someone mention a cooler?
"Hi, Monica."
Because I am one.
"Every time I go to a table, whoever's there starts to lose."
"Doesn't matter how much they were winning before, I show up, everything heads south."
It's wacky.
"Delinda, I want you to go over to that table... and stand as close to the dealer as you can get."
- I don't want to make people lose.
"- Oh, I guess I'd call it an order."
I'm just here to try to patch things up with my father.
We're not really speaking.
I work at Pure.
"Oh, my mistake."
"The posts that you're referring to,"
Raina told me about them weeks ago.
She regretted them and thought there might be consequences.
But I'm gonna tell you exactly what I told her.
Not one word of what she wrote was actionable.
So if you think you're gonna turn this into a basis of a homicide investigation...
Tendu and I had a meeting.
Two days ago.
What?
"Well, I didn't tell you 'cause I thought if an attorney was there, it might scare him away."
"We met in my office, and we made a deal."
I promised to support indigenous seal hunting if he would come out against commercial seal hunts.
Commercial hunts killing 20 times as many seals as the Inuits.
"Yeah, last thing I would want is Tendu dead or in some kind of trouble."
Can you prove any of this?
I have a draft of the agreement at my office.
We both signed it.
I can send you a copy.
You can ask other people at the meeting.
"My assistant, Tendu's girlfriend, Libena."
Libena-- that's a Czech name.
I guess so.
"I don't know, she had a thick accent."
Why?
Is that important?
(knocking)
Thanks for coming.
Of course.
You okay?
You don't look so good.
(lock clicks)
I didn't get much sleep last night.
"But...was not a ditch, major lord We jumped a shade."
"- You are crazy, Tót."
- Me?
No.
-Maybe I am the fool?
"Ow my god...no, no, no.How I would dare this assumed from my son's benefactor?"
"If you knew that this is the ditch, not ditch, you should have warned!"
Into a unpleasant situation brought for before Sóskuti.
Since just yeah.
"If I speak on the before Sóskuti,then ...major lord."
...let us go rather under the gardens.
"Nothing saves your action, Tót."
I insist on this road already now.
"Take care, major lord!"
"Jump, Tót."
After the respectable major lord only.
Do not argue.
I do not like the politesse.
- Sóskuti!
"- Yes, major lord!"
The thread of his hair will not bend for your younger brother.
Thank you very much major lord.

"I was a bag of itching dust, which they scattered into a beautiful girl's neck."
"That's the enemy's goal, no doubt."
He's right!
"Once they take Estabul, they'll take out their anger and hatred, and lengthen the fighting!"
We still have a way.
"You must not falter, Princess."
Rear Admiral Klom's army has surrounded the rebel army's main stronghold.
What is the meaning of this?
!
Withdraw the Roland army and release all war prisoners.
"If they do not heed our wishes, the people of Estabul will be beheaded on the spot."
We sent a letter with that content to the Roland army.
Roland's Hero King couldn't stand by and let commoners die.
How could you?
You're...
I know.
But this cannot be helped.
I wish to protect you...
Princess.
You would take our people hostage for my sake?
!
This is what the people want.
"If we lose now, what would happen to them?"
"How badly would the people of a defeated nation be oppressed, and be disgraced?"
And taking our people as hostages brings them no disgrace?
Can't this be stopped?
It cannot be.
I see.
I am naught but a puppet ruler propped up by others.
"In the end, I couldn't save anyone, could I?"
Princess!
The soldiers of Roland are!
Our army's soldiers are attacking the Estabul fortress!
"And then we broke up, but then we got back together again, and now she thinks that you love her more than ever."
"Oh, honey, I just wanted things... to be better between us."
By doing something completely Shady.
How could I ever trust you again?
Oh...
Honey.
"No, will."
I'm sorry.
"Well, on the plus side he's not getting married."
And you raised a son with enough character... to break up with the wrong girl... even though she has... a truly spectacular set of knockers.
"And the reason I don't have a goiter... is because as an actress, my..."
My vocal chords are so highly developed.
"Well, 's coming."
"Now, um, miss Chase, which of your parents is asian?"
What?
"Well, the disease is only carried... by people of asian descent, so-- ah."
Yes.
"Well, my father, you'll see, is asian."
"Okay, you know what?"
I just--I can't do this.
"You see, I don't really have the disease."
What?
I just said that I did because I thought... it would help me win an emmy.
"Well, that's..."
Reprehensible.
I know.
I--I feel terrible.
As you should.
"Although, in the last week, she has brought the foundation... a great deal of money and attention."
It would be nice not to share offices... with the toenail fungus people.
"Wait, what are you saying?"
"Well, um..."
Okay.
Mr. Deline.
"You, you and you."
You work pretty fast.
"Well, opportunity knocked, I answered."
Apparently.
"This ghost thing is big, Ed."
"Bookings have skyrocketed, up to a year in advance."
Really?
Yeah.
I guess there's no accounting for taste or judgment.
"Well, that reminds me, I wanna talk to you about Monica's haunted suite."
Listen to me.
"If you mention the ghost one more time like it exists, one of us is crazy and I'm not."
I'm talking about our bottom line.
I've gotten literally hundreds of calls from people wanting to rent the suite.
"Now if the Burkes don't want it, and we buy back Monica's suite and we rent it out..."
Hold it.
It's just...
"No, no, no, no."
I've already run the numbers.
"Even if we pay the Burkes top dollar, we'll still turn a profit within a few months."
We'll make a killing.
We'll make a killing?
"Oh, bad choice of words."
"I've thought about what you proposed, Mr. Burke, Mrs. Burke."
"And since you no longer want the suite,"
"I'm willing to let you out of the deal and, uh, refund your entire purchase price."
"Oh, so now that the place is famous, you want it back."
"Mr. Deline, I am not a fool."
I understand how valuable that suite's become to you.
I was downstairs.
That guy who was just here.
He's a special cop trained to track down foxes.
Special cop?
Didn't you watch that documentary on TV?
Everyone knows after watching that.
We have no time to watch TV.
"Wait, wait!"
There's a way that the special cop tracks down foxes.
He was testing you before.
The 'yes or no' thing.
That's exactly his method.
"Yeah, I was really confused before."
You're dead!
Will we eat him or not?
- What?
- Let's eat him after we talk.
"My sweety, be patient."
"- Now, keep going."
"- According to America's MK report, the number of foxes pretending to be human came out to 3,824,790.5 across the globe."
What's the 0.5 for?
Did I say that?
"Well, that one's a mixed blood."
So they organized the F.T.B.H.
The Fox-To-Become-Human secret community.
They kill people at will.
That's nonsense.
We don't kill anyone at will.
"Since we have to eat human liver on the 1000th year to become human, we don't kill anyone beforehand."
Right!
Rumors are always exaggerated anyway.
"Anyway, if you kill me now, you will be arrested by the police who are waiting to find evidence."
"Fox fur coats sold like hot cakes on the home shopping channel the other day, you know."
!
"If you want this to finally end, yes."
"No, I can't do that."
I got pride.
I'm strong.
No woman wants a man who files a restraining order in the face of danger.
I want an erection!
"How many times in life do you get a second chance, granddad?"
A chance to fix your biggest mistake?
Fine!
I'll find someone else to make me a master swordsman.
"Riley, look up ""master swordsman."""
Private lessons.
"You know I don't like a lot of people around me when I'm sweating, oh, and not too expensive."
"Uh, we're broke."
"Oh, somebody's calling me on Skype!"
Nobody ever calls me on Skype!
"What's good, nigga?"
!
Bet you weren't expecting this face!
"I'm surprised you can still see after what I did to ya, you bitch-ass, faggot ass, bitch-ass faggot!"
"Damn it, how'd you figure out how to call me on Skype?"
!
I don't even know how to use this shit.
"Hey, nigga, I just wanted to let you know that if you not too much of a pussy-ass nigga, you can meet me tomorrow in the parking lot for a rematch!"
"Oh, and I put the word out to the whole world, so if you don't show, well, you know what that means."
You's a bitch-ass nigga!
Bitch-ass.
You's a bitch-ass nigga!
"Yeah, rock with me, Robert!"
Come on!
Something's wrong.
- Then you must not give up.
There's no one here with a greater love or-or knowledge of music.
And that's the key.
You must show him... that his musical career is not over.
You can't let him waste that precious talent that God has given him.
"Thank you, Father."
"""Big surprise dinner party."""
"""Spectacularly unforgettable."""
Did you ever consider renting your mouth out to the motor pool as a garage?
"Beej, if we don't come up with something soon... we're gonna be modeling the latest in tar-and-feather wear."
- Let's attack this rationally.
- I'd rather attack you irrationally.
Come on.
Think back.
You remember some special dinner party you once went to?
Sure.
Lucia Murphy's 1 4th birthday.
We played spin the bottle and sent out for Chinese food.
"Now, there's a nice touch of home."
Dinner just like Mao used to make.
"Hawk, admit it."
No matter what kind of spectacular food we come up with... as soon as it hits those tin trays on those crummy tables in that rotten tent... it's still gonna be a mess.
So we won't have it in the tent.
What can we eat outside?
- Dirt.
- No!
A picnic!
We'll have a cookout.
Wait a minute.
Wait a-
- W-W-Wait!
I just got a great idea that will save us from a lifetime of death.
To inspect the same gift?
Two different...
I'm quite certain they will have the same question.
On the Q.T. is one thing.
"But you're tramping through my backyard,"
"Literally tripping over my agents,"
And you don't even give me a heads-up.
We have explicit instructions not to contact you any more.
Artie Nielsen.
"Look, it's not like we can't have coffee now and then."
We just can't have you on speed dial.
Look.
I get it.
For better or for worse-- and I happen to think worse--
You two are serving a new master.
This isn't your screw-up.
It was his.
It's just that he doesn't really...
Play well with others...
- Hmm.
- So much.
"So this security officer, Ogawa, Japanese embassy,"
Is waiting for my explanation of what you were doing
And if you had anything to do with whatever the hell that was.
Any suggestions what I'm supposed to tell him?
All right.
Do me one favor.
Get on a plane and leave D.C. while I can still let you.
Can I at least have that?
Be out of here as soon as possible.
I don't think this is what Dickinson had in mind.
"Well, what are we gonna do?"
"Well, I thought you might need a friend."
Come and sit.
You realize that she may never talk to me again?
"I told you, 1 9 is too young to be settling down."
"You're driving me crazy, Alex, you realize that?"
Can't help it.
"I've told you, I take getting what I want for granted."
I thought you said you were trying to change that about yourself.
I believe that people should listen to their urges.
"You are a very determined woman, aren't you?"
"Everybody already thinks you did it, Pacey so why don't you just do it?"
This is great.
Too bad we have to stop.
-We have to what?
-Stop.
But what about the heat?
"Well, just knowing that we could do it, it's enough."
It is?
It is.
It would just be inappropriate.
Could you guys get a room?
It's a library.
Check this exam out.
"It's dated May 1 0, 1 982 and it's graded by my same professor."
Multivariable calculus probably hasn't changed much since then.
"Yeah, well, based on these years' notes neither has the way that he's been teaching it."
"How did you do this, get all this stuff out of the house?"
"Well, I just put it in my backpack and just walked on out of there."
What about the bylaws?
What if somebody finds out?
"Well, then, I guess I get expelled from the house."
You're willing to risk that?
Staying together would be stranger.
You of all people should understand that.
What do you mean?
"The man on your cell phone wallpaper isn't this detective here, is it?"
"So cops have affairs, too!"
You had an affair with Ikezawa.
"No, I didn't."
Then why run away with him?
We both knew we were drawn to each other.
"He was an apprentice chef, and I was the chef's wife."
We honestly didn't have a physical relationship.
"When my husband got drunk, he used to get violent and hit me."
The restaurant itself... was renovated from a restaurant that my father had operated.
I was the owner.
My father put in all the money.
My husband had a complex about it.
He would drink and then hit me...
Ikezawa sympathized with me.
He always offered some kind words to me.
But he stole your proceeds.
I suggested we take the money and run.
That makes you an accomplice.
"That's right, I'm just as guilty as he is."
"She won't talk, she wins as long as she keeps silent for 20 hours."
"That's it, I'm taking her in."
Stand up.
I'm taking you no matter what.
Fine.
"But first I need to go to the restroom, okay?"
"Please, pick up!"
"Yasuo, get out of there, hurry!"
A cop came here as a customer and I got caught.
"Unfortunately, there is no time rest."
"Come on, dude."
We'll also have something to eat.
There are only 100 days left for the exam.
Do we even have time to eat?
If I have to calculate; we have 6 hours of school everyday that makes 18 days.
We have 82 days left.
"If we take an hour or an hour and a half lunch break... that makes 9 days, 73 days left."
"But hey, I thought we'd solve the problem we've been dissolving ourselves."
What is this dude?
"8 hours of courses on the weekends, makes 5 days."
We now have 68 days left.
We sleep for about 8 hours a day.
That makes 34.
We're left with 34 days.
Extra lessons for 3 days a week 3 hours each; adds up to 6 days. 28 days left.
We spend a lot of time on the road...
"We also have to shower, go to the bathroom, wash and iron clothes."
We should also count the homework and these meetings too; 5-6 hours a... day.
We have 3 days left.
"For your information, in 3 days, he'll say, ""Let's steal the questions."""
You can't imagine how happy you have made me.
"So, I'll be able to see you as a university student."
Of course you will mother.
Why shouldn't you?
Hey guys!
Hello man.
You look great.
You look just like one of us.
"Hey, you look really smart."
It's not enough to just get dressed in a smart way.
"Hi girl, you are back!"
"It's called grieving, Shay."
"It got embarrassing, Arlo."
"Hey, hey."
"Look, what I'm trying to say is maybe her process hasn't started yet."
Did she tell you about the postcards?
The ones her mother supposedly sent from all over the world?
"Wait, so someone was trying to pretend her Mum was still alive even though she's been dead all these years?"
"Unless Trina sent them from beyond the grave, it looks that way."
"What, like someone was trying to cover up her murder?"
"Well, there are other explanations."
"Well, yeah, but not as cool."
Some revision still might be a good idea.
"If you want, I can help."
"It's Media Studies, Arlo."
"It's not like brain science, or whatever."
You sitting an exam today?
I kind of have too.
"Well, couldn't you get a dispensation, given the circumstances?"
"Nah, I did like no work all year, so if I don't pass the exam I am sunk."
Oh.
Eggs?
Poached not fried.
Two.
"With avocado, not tomato."
"But hey, the good news is this is the last exam, so once it's over it's party time!"
Yay!
My God!
"Your mother is dead, Lindsay."
You can't just pretend it didn't happen.
Shay.
Look...
"I get that you were all totally gutted when your Mum died, but mine chose to leave us."
That picture was taken after the attack at the ruins.
Three weeks ago?
!
Why didn't you tell me about this?
!
it's obvious that they're targeting you.
That's too great of a risk for us.
my friend was used as a human bomb!
Are you asking me to look away on this one?
Noah's ark is a very dangerous ruin.
I can't let you go there in the state you're in.
this mission is too much for the injuries that you've incurred.
and...
You must be joking!
A challenge has been directed straight at me!
I'll settle this myself!
Yu!
Here you go.
Thank you.
Professor Mayzel is researching the spot.
Doc Mayzel is..?
This plane is now entering Turkish air space.
An unknown fighter of unknown origin has ordered us to change our course.
Our permission to land from at Devas airport from ground control has been cancelled.
We are now heading for Istanbul.
agents from the Turkey branch of the Arcam Foundation are working to make alternate travel arrangements.
what a tender welcome.
Did you come to fight a war?
Seize them!
I'm very sorry about that.
We were supposed to have had an agreement.
let's just take it easy.
But all right tell me something you've done in the last four years.
That's the least bit out of the ordinary.
"Other than that bizarre ""Stanford whoo"" thing."
Are you kidding me?
The last four years of my life have been anything but ordinary.
Wonderful.
How?
I can't tell you.
Then I can't reconsider your application.
"But if I could tell you You'd be all ""nuh-uh."""
"And I'd be like ""yuh-huh."""
"And you'd be like ""no way""."
"I'd be like ""yeah way""."
"Wait, please."
I never even got a cookie.
[Singing] If you're wondering what she'll do.
Now that her plans have fallen through.
And you know she's got a real strong will.
And she's got lots more show to fill.
"Now she's going, going back to Malibu."
We kinda thought we'd be singing too.
Instead we're stuck in her chorus line.
[Chuckles]
'Cause your agent's not as good as mine.
"Wait, wait, if Miley leaves, we have no ride."
Hey Miley how far away are you?
I'm turning into the driveway and I'll be in in a second.
Hey I know you're disappointed so I'm making your favorite dinner.
Mac and cheese and bacon!
That's your favorite dad.
"You know the way she's feeling, that probably wouldn't have made any difference anyway."
This way at least one of us will be happy.
It's fucking amazing.
Do you know how few people reach this level?
You seem to not care.
I really don't.
Did you ask me here so you could talk about yourself?
Next question.
Does talking about this stuff make you feel happy?
No.
I find thinking about it all to be unfulfilling and exhausting.
Does nothing for me.
"Well, that's how the rest of your life is gonna be."
Unfulfilling and exhausting.
I think success has made you ugly.
"I think you've gotten far too in touch with your selfish instincts, and it's not healthy."
But I still think about you.
I think the guy I used to know would have made a really great boyfriend.
I want to take that cupcake out of your hand right now and throw it so fucking far away from you.
"Goddamn it, you make me sick."
You're just a big baby.
Babies wanna be around sugar all the time.
No wonder you're a baker.
You're the worst.
"I'm not successful, I'm notable."
There's a difference.
"Besides, I'm not notable, either."
Noteworthy at best.
I once considered you my favourite ex-girlfriend.
That's very sweet of you.
Let's...
"let's turn this day around, do something fun."
"Maybe, I don't know, break into a bank, or rob a car or something."
"- All right, let's do it."
We're going home now.
I want us all to have dinner together.
I want the whole family... to stay together.
Please.
The sixth day.
The heavens and earth were finished and all their array.
On the seventh day God completed His work.
God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because on it He abstained from all His work.
"Blessed are You, our God, Who creates the fruit of the vine."
"Blessed are You, our God..."
"Alex, why don't you answer my calls?"
Are you afraid?
Are you avoiding me?
The play is about to open.
I didn't have time to call you back.
"Don't lie, I know you're avoiding me."
I'm not.
"It's not only me, it's everyone in the theater."
"We talked, I consulted with them."
And what conclusion did you come to?
"Publicly speaking, there's a problem here."
Publicly?
Do you want to hang him on top of everything?
I can't put a stop to the drift against him.
You are artistic director now.
You're just throwing him to the dogs?
I can't have him back until the trial is over.
And we all feel like we've been betrayed.
How did he betray you?
By fabricating expenses?
Didn't all of you fabricate expenses?
Not in those amounts.
I believe it's some kind of weapon.
A picture of my dead mother.
How come you're putting it in the box?
"Because I don't know why my dad keeps all of her pictures hidden in the attic, and tells me she looked like Grace Kelley."
Who's Grace Kelley?
"Oh, she was a very famous clown."
She was a princess.
"And, also..."
I don't know what it's like to have a mother.
We could tell you.
You can't tell somebody something like that.
Have you ever noticed that girls don't fart?
My mom farts.
Looks like a boob.
Yeah.
Make them fly around.
My boob's bigger than yours.
Let's see if you can catch my boob.
"You've got, like, a mosquito bite boob, Frank."
Why don't girls spit?
They're hiding something from us.
The rules have changed.
Gotcha.
"It's a battle of the sexes... and believe me, we are way behind."
Shit!
I can't dance.
"You see this, Frank?"
This little seedling represents an entire species of marsh grass.
"If it lives, the wetlands will survive,"
"Mortlake turtle can return to its natural habitat, and birds like the glossy ibis won't lose another precious nesting place."
"Dad, if you don't get dressed, we'll be late for school."

- Lord Kim Woo-jing.
"I can see that he harbors great ambitions, but he won't show it."
What is this great ambition?
What other ambition could a royal family member have?
It is to become king.
Please watch your words.
It could be interpreted as him plotting treason.
"It will be treason if he fails, but if he succeeds he will gain the world."
I will do anything if I can put a king on the throne.
You haven't gained your calm yet.
Your sword seemed to be thirsty for blood.
Our plan will fail if you act in haste.
Go to Chunghae at daybreak.
"Yes, sir."
Go to Chunghae?
Jang Bogo's men are guarding every inch of Chunghae.
It is impossible to penetrate into Chunghae.
I have a plan.
Do not worry.
Who are you?
We're pirates from Manwol Island.
We heard that Grand Chief Jang Bogo would spare our lives if we surrendered.
I need to go to Yangzhou.
Why?
I want to bring potters from Yangzhou.
"Kangjin, which is not far from Chunghae, has great soil for pottery making."
I will bring pottery makers and build a kiln.
We need to create jobs for the pirates who surrendered.
"If you open a pottery workshop, I will train them to be potters."
- Grand Chief.
- What is it?
The Manwol pirates have surrendered.
One way or another.
80 miles Northwest of nome... this is all Gonna be easy today.
Let's just get it over there And start making some money.
"Despite being knocked down Repeatedly this season,"
The kellys are off the mat...
- we made it.
- But now their dredge.
Is positioned on the banks Of the kougarok river.
"Gold is really what We're supposed to be making,"
And I'm not making a huge Amount Of gold for my family.
Thanks for Flying the colors.
The flag's up.
Everything's going good.
"I don't have the opportunity To get big gold,"
Not until we increase Our reputation in this town.
Hey-ho!
We got to show we can go Anywhere we need to.
And we're willing to do Anything we need to.
And that we're not Gonna give up.
- You ready?
- Go.
"There it goes, Don't stop, pull!"
"Okay, just calm down, Calm down."
I don't have Rubber boots on.
"Well, neither do I."
"Washed down from Volcanic mountaintops,"
"Gold often collects where There's a change in river flow,"
Including bends And bedrock formations.
"- Okay, get the boat set up."
- Get the hose out.
"This is how it works, okay?"
"I tell you what to do, You do it."
Dodo and Wakizaka continue to clash?
"Internal division is the greatest enemy, Your Eminence."
Reasonable amount of rivalry can so increase productivity.
But the fact that there is Konishi behind Dodo and Kato behind Wakizaka is what bothers me.
"If I keep them together, they will be more concerned with fight for power than fight against Chosun."
How about changing the lineup of the advance guards?
That's what we will do.
Send Wkizaka with Konishi.
Konishi thinks too much.
He needs a decisive comrade to push him.
"And for the same reason, we will pair Dodo with Kato."
High Commander...
His Majesty has acknowledged your loyalty.
Sir!
Weigh it.
Hurry up!
We don't need to!
It's much lighter!
Be quiet.
From now on we're going to look a hundred times before we leap.
As we should!
Is that good?
"That's good, isn't it?"
I think it's light enough that we won't have any problem with the force of restoration.
Yes!
"What's wrong, Lieutenant?"
I though you'd jump for joy.
"If we use copper and iron alloy, our problem will be solved."
Right?
Then our problem is solved!
What's wrong?
Copper is many times more expensive than iron.
I'm Dave.
- Nice to meet you.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
How are you doing?
This is where we normally jam at.
Everybody know to come here when you guys start singing?
"Oh, yeah."
My grandfather was one of the ones who introduced the drums to the church.
That's right.
"You know, Ben told me about that."
"It's an honorable, respectable family tradition, so much that you have it passed down from generation to generation."
It just brings so much joy to all of us when we can just come together and be able to just play together.
I don't know if every city considers music to be that important.
"And as a musician, I mean, that's the holy land."
Right now the storm is 225 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.
We had a little gazebo in front of the house.
"Thank you, Killelea."
We will let your teacher know.
What do we think?
Mr Chandler?
Not quite up to it.
Mr Kirkby?
Button off.
He had a button off his jacket.
Slippery slope.
We've had so many boys' voices break this year.
We've had so many boys' voices break this year.
Hey.
"There's auditions in here, hop it."
"No, I've come for the auditions."
"Well, they're over."
"Again I say unto thee, hop it."
- Has anybody else seen them?
Only Selena.
She thinks I'm a genius.
What do you think?
Are they good enough to send to a magazine?
"Yes, if you want to end up in prison."
Those stories were full of enough libel and slander and double-entendre to hang us all.
"Allison, is that how Peyton Place really looks to you?"
They were only fiction.
I didn't use any real names.
You didn't have to.
I recognized everybody in town.
But let's get down to the important part.
You have a talent.
Those stories were a good start.
"Now, where do you go from here?"
That's what I hoped to find out from you.
Then I suggest college.
With your talent and your ideas...
"Thank you, but I don't want to go to college."
I never have.
Why not?
Because I don't want to study about writing.
I want to write.
Nobody has to tell me Shakespeare was a wonderful writer or that wonderful books have already been written.
Those books tell you how and why.
I'd rather find that out myself at a typewriter.
I need someplace to get me going.
Someplace to start.
"All right if that's how you feel about it, then let's do it."
Let's start at the Peyton Place Times.
"Who said I was a cynical, hard-hearted newspaperman?"
Well honey nothing stays the same forever.
It's kind of like a mullet.
A thing of beauty in its day.
But I tell you what sooner or later even the party in the back has to end.
Are you telling me that I need to give up Hannah Montana?
No.
I could never do that.
Neither could Jesse or Lilly.
The only one that could ever answer that would have to be you.
Please don't say listen to my heart.
-Darling it's just...
-Or my kidney or my spleen.
Or any other vital organs.
Then what do you want me to tell you?
I want you to tell me that...
"If I give up Hannah, everything will be okay."
But I can't do that.
What I can tell you is you'll be able to go to that school with Lilly.
You'll be able to go out with Jesse without half the world hating him.
You will have to give up your privacy.
No matter where you go peoples are gonna recognize you.
And they're gonna treat you different.
Is it worth it?
Only you can decide that.

I always knew this day would come.
We'd be standing one by one.
With our future in our hands.
"So many dreams, so many plans."
I always knew after all these years.
"There'd be laughter, there'd be tears."
"Is it alright then, Jon?"
Well done Catrin.
"When there's raid, I want you to go down the tube station."
I didn't bring you all the way from Wales to see you get hit by a bomb.
I saw April today.
She and Tony have made up ever such clear code.
So you can write to him about what she's doing.
'The Veg green' that means England. 'Onion Soup' is France.
There's a word for regiment and one for troop...
Oh....
"Do you really have to smoke that thing, Ambrose?"
Wouldn't you just mind?
I can mind smoking.
I can't mind smoke.
That's a cut.
I wonder would it be possible to have something to do?
My hands are aching for something to do.
And it seems alright for the character.
"Perhaps, try to find some knitting?"
Water or word.
"I fully understand the national importance of what we are shooting, and obviously, there's no question of diluting the message."
I just...
I wonder if it might impact a little more punch if Mr.Brown would express a little more.
"For example, the mention of the clever code, I might say, ""Well, that will be the first clever thing, April has ever done in her life"""
Did you...do you see?
Just a...just a dash of...of humor and then follow it on.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh!
Certainly.
Oh!
No.
..against him then too I wont believe it.
How did you believe it?
Who is the fool who believes that Krishna has stolen anything?
Then.. then why did you do this?
"Its very simple, Janki."
Try and understand.
I can tolerate anything but when someone..
..tells Krishna anything it pierces in me like an arrow .
Today that arrow pierced my heart when..
..those people called him a thief.
I have controlled my injured hurt with great difficulty.
I have raised this hand with great difficulty to hit him.
I told him to get out of this house with great difficulty.
But.. butjust think..
where will he go?
"The world is very big, Janki."
He can go anywhere.
And.. after a few bumps he will also learn to get steady.
"No, I wont let him drift like that."
"No Janki, you still dont know my brothers."
You didnt think that after I die..
- No.
Dont say that.
"-Yes, Janki."
You didnt think what they will do..
..to that poorthing after I die.
He.. he cant stay in this house and understand that..
..because he has a clean heart.
But why send him like this even if we want to?
"He wont understand any otherway, Janki."
And he will never be able to leave us and go.
Sir.. bless me with the hands you beat me.
But I'm the one who processed it like this.
It's always interesting to process other people's photographs.
What about this part?
Did you cover part of the negative?
"No I didn't, the negative ends somewhere here."
"Here I didn't expose it, and here I used a light pencil."
Do you recognize me?
Is this a person?
A painting?
"It's not a painting, it's a real man."
"He wasn't naked, even though the picture suggests otherwise."
"He's perfect like this, isn't he?"
"Yes, yes."
"Is this picture called ""vertigo""?"
"Yes well, it's called like this for anecdotic reasons."
Because I saw the film after...
"I took the picture, well it was the same afternoon but.."
"It isn't very related, even though I was..."
I suffered from vertigo while taking it.
I was quite drunk.
This bottle is almost empty.
It's a very strange story.
The story of the shooting of the picture is quite special.
Would you mind telling me?
It's quite obscene.
I was...
In a position...
An embarassing situation with a friend.
Who...
"I lit a cigarette, and he told me..."
"""You're lighting a cigarette now, like an Amsterdam whore..."""
"And I say ""Yes, why not?"""
What do you think you're doing?
- My office!
Now!
"Enjoy your meal everyone, enjoy your meal."
Just calm down.
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included non violence?
Well I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.
"Be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us."
Your presence is just too disruptive.
Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways.
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.
- You don't understand us at all.
- No I do understand you.
I understand that you think you can stay out of this but you can't.
One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna take whatever power you think you have away from you.
Tris!
Tris!
"Look, Johanna, we need a little more time."
"I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are, then we can leave."
And then what?
Attack Erudite?
- I will not be a party to violence.
- No-one's asking you to.
We just need a few more days.
One.
"- One, what?"
- One more chance.
"See, to be Amity is to forgive others and yourself."
You're hurting Tris.
And my heart goes out to you.
I know what it's like to stand helpless while you lose the ones you love.
Lewd pervert!
Even the other day...
Your illustrations are really erotic.
"You can't just say that to a girl, s-so suddenly!"
Do you have to get that angry?
I was talking about how I was requesting lewd illustrations from my little sister!
"L-Lewd illustrations are my job, and I like it, so it's okay!"
But you can't talk about stuff like that!
Why?
Th-That's...
"Big Brother, you idiot!"
Dunce!
Light-novel protagonist!
Fine.
I won't say it again.
It's fine if you understand.
"I-In the first place, Big Brother, you're all sorts of no good."
All sorts?
F-For instance...
That's right!
You stay at home too much on days off!
"Writing is my side job, so of course I'd be home working!"
Even during summer vacation?
Right.
"Back then, everything I wrote was getting turned down, so I pulled a lot of all-nighters."
So I forgot to make you meals.
"The despair I felt when meals didn't arrive even after thumping the floor do you know how that feels, Big Brother?"
Come out of your room and eat.
I think I've lost if I leave my room!
"Even if you say it like a famous quote, it's not cool."
"By the way, I noticed you blog and stream stuff."
I-Is that bad?
"I know you're thinking about your next move, but there are things you don't know."
"Marcus, please just leave us alone."
Your mother didn't come back to Abnegation just to save you.
"She died trying to hide something from Jeanine, something that was entrusted to Abnegation"
- a long time ago.
- Marcus!
Stop!
"Whatever you want from us, you're not gonna get it."
I'm not the enemy here.
You found it.
"It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior, like you said."
You mind telling me what's inside?
A message from the Founders that will ensure the future our people deserve.
"Divergents will destroy our society, unless we destroy them."
And now we can.
"However, only a Divergent can open this box."
Find them!
Every last one of them.
Go with happiness.
Go with happiness.
- Go with happiness.
- Thank you.
Go with happiness.
I really don't know how much longer I can do this whole peace and love thing.
"It's the Amity way, just try to blend in."
"I'm trying to blend in, it's just not working."
"Coming through, on you right."
Okay here we go.
Oh look a rainbow.
It's pretty.
Virtual pathological friendliness with unquestioning passifism.
I love this place.
I remember when I was surrounded by pirates in the hurricane straits.
"We managed to capture them all with just a feather, two eggs, and a barrel of molasses."
I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now.
This is serious.
- Are we almost there?
- Almost.
But I just picked up a distress signal from the Southern troops.
There's a problem.
Mom!
I'm so happy you're here.
Where's dad?
Unalaq wiped out the entire Southern resistance and captured your father.
I'll get him back.
Where is my mother?
She's in the healing hut.
So many injured.
What happened?
Her soul is trapped in the spirit world.
"Oh, my goodness."
How long has she been away?
Almost a week.
"I've tried to keep her energy flowing, but I can feel her slipping away."
"You're the only one who can help her now, mom."
How much longer can she survive like this?
I don't know.
But she's very strong to have lasted this long.
I talked to the rebels.
They said Unalaq's got the Southern portal surrounded.
Harmonic convergence is only a few hours away.
Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.
There's no use in talking anymore.
We know what our mission is.
News waits for no one...
Not even Chloe.
"You texted her, you left her, three voicemail messages at the apartment."
She's not Helen Keller.
She'll get the message and meet us there.
It wouldn't kill us to wait a few more minutes.
I agree with Mr. Olsen.
Why are we outside of the kitchen?
"It's a little late for a snack, isn't it?"
"I've seen you around here before, haven't I?"
You work for Lex.
He has nothing to do with this.
I'm here about that photograph you took.
Which photograph would that be?
Because I take a whole lot of pictures.
L. Luthor in his office before he killed himself.
I want that photo destroyed.
His death was tragic enough without it being sensationalized by the media.
You could have said that before you broke out the heavy artillery.
"As soon as we saw it, I immediately jumped on the delete button."
This is all a big misunderstanding.
You're lying.
I deleted it.
"After I saw your text message,"
I went into the mainframe and pulled it from your hard drive.
But the transfer log shows you uploaded the file to a second server with a cloaked IP Address.
I want to know where.
- You shot me?
!
- You weren't cooperating.
- How about a warning?
- Tell me or she dies.
I will.
I promise you.
"Farewell, cousin."
What is the rush?
"I pray you tell, My Lord, I will not marry yet, and when I do, I swear it shall be Romeo, whom I hate, rather than Paris, whom I despise!"
Here comes your father.
You can tell him so yourself.
My girl is like a channel.
"What, more tears?"
The level of the sea will start to lift if much more water flows from your sweet eyes.
"Wife, have you told her of her marriage plans?"
"I have, and she will have none of it, I swear."
Soft.
Soft.
"Take me with you, take me with you, wife."
How?
Will she none?
Does she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud?
"Does she not think her blessed, unworthy as she is, that we have brought so worthy a gentleman to be her groom?"
"Thankful I am, and grateful for your love, but proud I cannot be of what I hate."
"How... how-how-how, chopped logic."
What is this?
"""Proud"" and ""I thank you,"" but ""I thank you not."""
"Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds!"
"Be ready, lady, Thursday morning next, to go with Paris to St. Peter's Church"
- or I will drag thee thither on a rail!
- Are you mad?
"Good father, I beseech you on my knees."
Will you not give me leave to plead my cause?
You...
I tell you what.
"- Come on, boys, get a move on."
- You always say the people are on our side.
So why do they treat us like this?
They stare at us as if we were animals.
"To them, we're no better than the government troops."
"If I were you, I'd alter my behaviour."
Then this will change.
This stuff will give you every disease in the world.
"- Shit, I've been hit really badly."
"- Nonsense, we'll fix that."
This is madness.
Who will benefit from us blowing up the dam?
"Put him here, but carefully."
Why do we destroy bridges and farmers' houses and everything they own?
"You're an engineer, not a revolutionary."
The commandante will know why.
He might not know either.
Do you have a smoke?
"We haven't got any dressing material, but there's a hospital in San Juan."
They might cure him.
There's a priest there who knows something about medicine.
You know so much.
It's kind of you to try to help us.
"If you take me with you, I'll help you fight as well."
I always win at war games.
I'm the fastest one when it comes to climbing trees.
"At war, climbing trees is the most important thing."
"He's right with one thing, Mariá."
José has to be taken to San Juan.
You should go with him.
"Jaime, Getullio and another man will accompany you."
- But I thought...
You'd know it if you went into the kitchen and checked out those supposed violations.
Though you shouldn't have to check.
What's all this?
I just keep thinking about the Burkes.
There's something... something not right with these two.
"Just 'cause they say their suite is haunted, doesn't mean they're ""not right."""
"I had the development office pull the, uh, information from the sale of Monica's condo... just so we could run a more comprehensive background check."
What are you looking for?
"Ah, what are we looking for?"
That's the question.
I wanna run a complete search on these two.
"Previous addresses, former employers, whatever you can think of."
I want as much information as possible on those two.
Sorry I asked.
Hmm?
You busy?
No.
[Together] Hey.
What's wrong?
You first.
You mean you didn't hear about Mystique being shut down?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I did hear about that."
Health code violations.
I thought it must be some kind of mistake.
Hello.
"Everyone knows you're Montecito's official ""germophobe"" when it comes to Mystique."
Thank you.
It's just because I refused to go out with that crazy-ass health inspector.
So what's your problem?
Paul Logan.
I heard he was in town.
"No, that's the..."
"Actually, the one thing that we haven't done."
We haven't had sex since we've been here.
We've barely even touched each other.
"Now, Cynthia and I are in a terrible spot."
"I come to this island, I come to the program to get some answers, find out my animal spirit..."
Yeah.
Let me help you out on the whole animal spirit thing.
It's gonna be awesome!
It always is.
"It's like if you go to a tarot card reader for past lives, you're always something cool..."
Dave like a king or a gunfighter.
"No one ever finds out that they were, like, a shopkeeper or an asshole."
Is this hilarious to you?
'Cause it's not to me.
"Tell you what+ If I get kicked off this island, I'm gonna blame all of you."
And I can't believe I let the two of you derail me!
We derailed you?
That's correct.
"If you kept a closer eye on Trudy, she wouldn't have strayed so far from the pack, all right?"
"She's not a dog, Jason."
Yeah?
"Well, listen, she's been very selfish, hasn't been a very good teammate."
I can tell you that.
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Look, I made promises, I let her down."
You don't know the ins and outs of our relationship.
Is that what it is?
It's a relationship?
"It's been two weeks, okay?"
All right?
That's not a relationship.
- I know.
I'm used to it.
- Now listen.
- Red fuck!
We need help.
Somebody has been stealing our story ideas and trading them...
"- to Nian Zamoi, at Vogue."
"- I know all about it, pussy."
- Do you know who it is?
- We're not gonna do it that way.
"First, you're going to tell me what you know and I'm gonna"
- tell you if you're right.
"- I have a sneaking suspicion... it could be Pierre Larroux, our make-up artist."
Look deeper.
Look closer.
Follow the fashion!
What do you mean?
They are brilliant!
Did you design them?
No.
I have to give credit where credit's due.
- Sebastian designed them.
"- Yes, darling, you do know... that I have a better grasp on the subject than he."
"It's time to pile into the town cars and you can check the list... for what booths you're assigned to, and the times."
"And remember... when you're not in the booths, you're still representing Skirt."
I wish I could always have a cock this big this close to my face.
- You are disgusting!
- Actually... my room service boy in Paris... wasn't so different from the dimensions on this shirt
You should see him serve more than a petit dejanuai.
You chaseabout!
What did you have on your customs card... when you came back:
Business or pleasure?
May I ask if you have any data on this?
"My colleague, he... he administered this drug to 18 volunteers, and 72% of them said that they had these profoundly spiritual experiences."
Where... where... where can we get these mushrooms?
It's not mushrooms.
We would be using medical-grade psilocybin.
When can I try this?
Good afternoon.
"So, we have some news."
Uh...
"We have all of Jacob's test results back, and, um, we can't find anything."
S-so this means everything is fine.
"Well, that's awful."
There's nothing you can fix?
- I'm afraid not.
"- We can't find anything, so we have to assume that this is Jerusalem syndrome."
Look at him.
He's had a spiritual conversion.
"- Ian, is that man sane?"
- ...
Fortify you.
Religious ecstasy isn't considered insanity.
"As much as we want to fix it, if Jacob's not ill..."
- ...she'asah il kol tzorki.
- There's nothing that we could do.
I have nowhere to go.
He gave away our house.
Barukh attah adonai melkh ha-olam she-asah il kol tzorki.
This is not what I signed up for!
You are supposed to take care of me!
Not me... you.
I gave up my career because of you.
I can't even get groceries.
Oh man !
Have you ever had anything like that in your whole life ?
"If we were rich and didn't have to kill him, we could pay him just to make those cookies for us, all the time."
"Hell, what if the cookies are just the tip of the iceberg ?"
What if he makes brownies ?
"We get so fat, but it'll be so worth it!"
"Anyway, Let's just do it as we said before..."
"I would just run in there, blast him."
You bring anymore ammo?
No.
I thought you said you have some more.
Nah...
I just wanted to sound pro and said I did.
It's not like we're facing five or six jokers who shotgunned one of Chet's nightclub.
"Beside, I was trying to save up for the dresses."
Never got the hang of these.
"I must be tiring your bucket list, but I wouldn't sweat it!"
Where is that place again ?
What place ?
The place...where you said we can get the bullets.
I thought you had some.
I was mistaken.
I've got a pretty good steak knives ... just trying to help .
You go out the front door.
You hook a right.
"Then walk three blocks, straight down on this side of the street."
You can't miss it.
"I'll go, Daze."
Why can't I ?
'Cause you look 12 and I've ID.
They might actually check in this part of the town.
"Just keep an eye on him while I 'm gone, and remember what I said."
"Ok, dad."
Right away.
My dad is really angry with me.
I have to get going now.
"Before you go, you were saying something?"
I was wondering if they'd removed the pool problems from the course outline.
You look beautiful.
"Actually, if you leave your hair loose... and put on some make up, you are a beautiful girl."
What's Ozgur doing?
"He's clinging on to his lessons, studying like crazy."
Mert is failing.
Do you know why I'm saying that Mert's failing?
Because he's not studying.
"I swear to God, I am studying."
You see me studying.
He's lying.
"It's not enough to study, Mr. Mert."
We do.
But having to study for school and selection exam both is very difficult.
What are we going to do then?
We should at least find a solution for the school.
"I thought everything would be okay if I came to school, but this is worse."
"Actually, you know what?"
We should just steal the test papers... and get it over with.
What did you say?
"I didn't say anything, dude."
This is it man!
This is the first time you have ever said something sensible.
"So, are you suggesting that we should steal the papers?"
Are you crazy?
"Actually, I've been meaning to tell you this for a long time... but I wasn't sure if I should or not."
I love it when you talk like this.
"Selena, I'm so very happy for you."
"Selena, I'm so happy for you."
Mother?
"Come on, Norman!"
We finally discovered that season of love... it is only found in someone else's heart.
"Right now,someone you know is looking everywhere for it."
And it's in you.

My name is Allison MacKenzie.
"Where I was born, time was told not by the clock or the calendar but by the seasons."
Summer was carefree contentment.
Autumn was that bittersweet time of regret for moments that had ended and things that were yet undone.
And then winter fell with a cold mantle of caution and chill.
It nipped our noses and our arrogance and made use move closer to the warm stoves of memory and desire.
Spring was promise.
But there was a fifth season of love and only the wise or the lucky ones knew where to find it.
"Hey, mister, which way to Peyton Place?"
"Go up this road, about two miles."
You'll come right to the town.
Thanks.
Lucas stole my money.
He drinks everything in sight.
I saved for a year and a half for a course.
"Don't go, Paul."
You was my firstborn... .
- Hitting everyone in his way.
Even you.
- Only when he's drinking.
That's been every night.
Why did you marry him?
Now you're gonna die in mine.
No one will even remember your name.
"I'm sorry, Clark."
I traveled halfway around the world via satellite.
There's no trace of Kara and Brainiac.
I can't let Lana sit in that asylum in pain.
Only way to help her is to find Brainiac.
I've tapped every radar screen known to mankind.
There's no bogey or blip unaccounted for.
It's like they just flew off the map.
What about Brainiac's power sources?
Check the electrical grid for any power surges again.
"Stay focused, Chloe."
Busy night out there.
What's going on?
Someone at Luthorcorp just jumped out their office window.
Rumor has it it was Lionel Luthor.
Let's go.
I just talked to him.
You said you were working down the hall from your father tonight?
I heard him yell.
Then he was gone.
"I know how difficult this must be for you, but I need a positive identification."
Whenever you're ready.
Thank you.
You killed him?
You killed dad?
"Not that I want to speak ill of the dead, but Lionel Luthor left a lot of damage in his wake."
Remember he locked you in a kryptonite box?
"He did a lot of things, but he'd never commit suicide."
I don't know about that.
He was beyond disturbed
- right. hmm.
"well, it's been a pleasure."
- oh. thank you.
"so, we cool here?"
"- based on my evaluation, you don't meet the minimum requirements for the department of child care."
- what?
what does that mean?
- we'll be in touch.
- let me see that.
- that is confidential!
- you still got to take me to town.
"- no, i can't go dressed like this. get in there."
[car engine turns over]
"- cindy, what are you doing here?"
"- don't you ""cindy"" me, you back-stabbing son of a bitch!"
- language!
"- or was it you, marge?"
- what is this all about?
- what's this all about?
!
your lard of a wife called the government people on me to take my kids away!
"- i am big-boned, and that is the way god made me."
- marjorie?
- i was doing my civic duty.
"- the kids could use a little more stability, cind."
- oh.
what kind of a person doesn't want their own mother to be with their kids?
!
"- cindy, you don't deserve those kids."
you need to take a good long look at yourself.
you rely on everybody to do things for you.
"you know, your kids don't even expect christmas presents this year from you because they know that, if you had one cent, you'd spend it on yourself, or you'd put it in some stupid scheme that doesn't pay off."
What are the windows at the back?
What's that?
I think those are dressing rooms.
"If these are the dressing rooms, these other windows are at the front."
That's gotta be the apartment where Reardon sleeps.
Could be.
This is good.
You still need some of my guys?
"No, I got a few of my own crew up here, now."
I'll be in touch when I need you.
You know this man?
That's Gordon Evans.
He's a president at my bank.
And this man?
No.
"George Browne, President of the Blackmire Group."
Evans tells me we're gonna be washing money for him.
So I understand.
I'm gonna want records of those transactions.
- Should be able to get those.
- I have another question.
"You're still getting out of the weed business, right?"
"- I'm trying hard, yeah."
- We've concerns about how that might affect the level of violence in the trade.
"Well, we'd like to see a smooth transition happen here."
We can't afford to see a whole new crop of players move in and set up shop.
We just... don't have the resources to stay on top of it.
Are you trying to tell me who I should sell to?
I'd like to have some input.
What works for you?
"Well, if you sold to Dante and the Vietnamese, 50-50... probably keep things more or less stabilised."
"Probably, but I don't know if that's gonna work."
(Clinks and whooshes)
(Cheering and laughing)
What are we gonna do now?
I'll think of something.
- What's funny?
- Russ didn't tell you?
"He told me about the job, but he didn't tell me anything funny."
- He didn't tell you about Pete?
"- No, who's Pete?"
"Well, it seems there's this physician type character named Pete was all depressed one day."
He felt terrible cause he did some stuff he just couldn't get over.
- What did he do?
- He slept with five of his patients.
"But Pete wasn't the worst guy in the universe, because no matter how hard he tried to forget about it, he couldn't."
The guilt and sense of unprofessionalism was overwhelming.
"But every once in a while he hear a voice inside that said: ""Pete, don't worry about it."""
You weren't the first licensed practitioner that sleeps with one of your patients and you won't be the last.
"Besides, you're single."
Let it go.
"But then, just when he almost over the guilt with it all, another voice would bring him back down to reality."
"And say: ""Oh Pete,"
But dude...
"You're a Veterinarian."""
Vi!
Let's go!
Wha..
What are you doing?
- I don't get it.
- Don't get what?
What's so funny about a vegetarian man?
I don't get it.
"What's the best shot you ever made, Tom?"
I don't know.
What about Mendenhour?
"If it was me, I'd say it wasn't much of a shot."
Wouldn't you rather shoot a Sharps.50 instead of that.45-.60?
"Those old buffalo guns carry better, but with a.45-.60... you can get rounds at any general store."
Keeps a drygulcher in business.
"Tom, on the killing of this kid..."
- that was quite a shot.
- Was it?
Two hundred thirteen yards.
What do you know about that?
What I just told you.
"You afraid of dying, Joe?"
"Yes, I am."
I am afraid of losing my ability to be able to come and go as I please.
Lose my freedom.
Not be able to get back up in those hills again.
What would they do to a man... that killed a 15-year-old boy with a Winchester?
I believe that man would have to die.
And you believe that a.45-.60 that's got a trajectory like a rainbow... could make that shot?
I know it could happen.
If I'd have killed that kid... it would have been the best shot I ever made... and the dirtiest trick I ever done.
"Hello, Sam."
I'm going to have to arrest you for the murder of Jimmy Nolt.
"Taking yourself kind of serious, ain't you?"
What are you going to do with that Winchester?
"We're just going to have to find out, ain't we?"
"Yeah, I guess we are."
"I'll take that rifle, Tom."
"Hello, Earl."
And the belly gun.

- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
- Again.
All
- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
"- You got to something to say, son?"
We're all ears.
"This being your first week,"
"I'm gonna cut you some slack, all right?"
"'Cause, son, you got it easy on this side of the fence."
Do you understand?
"You get to go home at night, sleep in your warm, snuggly bed."
"But you best start giving a damn, or else you'll wind up over there, in juvie, playing with the big boys."
And you sure as hell ain't going home to your mommy and daddy.
"You will be locked up, crying and pissing yourself to sleep every night."
On the ground.
Give me 50.
Now!
Again.
All
- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
- Again.
All
- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
- Devastation these furious storms are capable of unleashing.
"Living in southeast Texas, it's important we get prepared, because hurricane season is here."
What will the next one bring?
"It's not a matter of ""if"" but ""when."""
- Come on.
Let's go.
Get in your bed.
Okay.
"It's a funny thing to sell your soul for, a new Beamer."
"Yeah, cars have never really done it for me."
"Well, what has?"
"Apart from your work, of course."
My work's enough.
And now you have a new toy.
One that you gave the full VIP treatment to.
You gave me the impression he was very important.
We could've hauled him in at the hotel.
I know that.
- Do you mind if I ask why?
- He'd been in prison for five years.
That's very charitable of you.
And aren't you always telling me that the stick is a weapon for the short term?
I'm glad somebody listens to me.
Best hope he doesn't fall for you.
He's more likely to try and kill me.
And why should you care?
Glittering in a place where a heart should be.
Go and make a drink.
Why are we watching this geezer?
Because Lenny hasn't decided what to do with him yet.
Neighbours used to have loads of them in the garden.
"Fishing rods, little ones."
Sitting on mushrooms.
Mum said it lowered the tone.
Gnomes.
I don't like gnomes.
"Also, I don't like fire-eaters."
I don't like dried fruit of any kind.
And I don't like those big mental dogs that come running at you in parks.
"You wouldn't just let a lion or crocodile run loose in Regent's Park, would you?"
"You know, I didn't even think about her."
"God, what if...?"
I wonder if she even knows.
"Not exactly a normal couple night out, huh?"
It was surprisingly normal considering how blindsided you were.
You want something to drink?
"Yes, please."
I think I have to just sit.
And not move.
"If I do, who knows what else is going to come along and rip my life apart."
- You're right.
- Thank you.
Let's not move.
It's too big a risk.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.
Why do anything?
"Well, eventually I'm going to have to get up."
"The thing is, everybody keeps telling me that I have this sister."
I don't know what the hell that means.
"I mean, when I think of Sarah, I don't think of her DNA."
I think about how we grew up together in the same house with the same weird family.
"And how we, you know, shared our diaries and our shampoos."
But am I supposed to have those same feelings
- for a woman that I never even met?
- I don't think anybody expects that.
"Well, and then there's my dad."
I've been grieving for a father that I don't even know.
And I was just starting to get all... happy.
I wouldn't let this destroy that.
You hold on to what's good.
To what makes you happy.
You make me happy.
"That and the V.A. records, yes."
Do you mind passing this on to the judge?
--based on only one interview?
"The defendant has a lengthy, documented case--"
Please answer the question.
-Would you restate the question?
-All right.
"Based on that one interview, you were able--?"
Where are you going with this?
"Your Honor, the witness interprets the defendant V.A. record one way..."
... ourpsychologist interprets it another.
Another and another until the end of time.
So much for expert witnesses.
Let's take a break.
2:30 all right for everybody?
"I see you've already met Peter Ragan, my law clerk."
He's written some of my best opinions.
He appeared before me first time I presided over moot court at Yale.
You could say Peter and I are joined at the hip.
"Thanks, Peter."
Please have a seat.
"Thank you for seeing me, Judge Stern."
And how can I help you?
Tino Zapatti.
What about him?
How did he get off with probation?
I can only sentence in accordance with the conviction.
He was convicted of criminal possession of the fourth degree.
They found a kilo in his car.
is it your intention to try the case again?
Not at all.
But I read the rap sheet.
- What?
Could you repeat that without the condescension?
Just say it to me like you're talking to another guy and not your six-year-old daughter?
What are you looking at him for?
I'm talking to you.
[laughs]
That what makes Goldie Goldie.
"You know, she's a straight shooter."
[chuckles] You got your spin.
"Anyway, don't worry about it."
I took care of it.
Got one of my girls to rewrite it.
You did what?
"I'm a producer, so I'm producing."
No.
"No, you don't hire writers."
"No, not without consulting me."
"Look, Marty, if I had a prick, I might stand around holding it all day, but I don't, so I have time to actually get shit done."
She'll have your pages by the weekend.
Come on.
"You know, for a woman who usually sees the big picture, that was extremely shortsighted."
I refuse to put out a mediocre product with my name on it.
I've worked long and hard to make that name mean something.
"Oh, come on, no one is disputing that."
"The problem isn't your message, it's the way you deliver it."
You kill more flies with honey.
What's wrong with a flyswatter?
You have to respect the network.
You can't treat 'em like a necessary evil.
"You ask me, they aren't all that necessary."
"Jesus, Gold."
You're not gonna break if you bend.
You said you wanted to meet him.
Besides we just got here.
Why don't you leave me alone?
"My uncle, who you saw in passing, raised me because both of my parents were killed in a car accident."
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to contextualize my sadness.
Put whatever you're going through into perspective.
My mom was pregnant at the time.
Seven months.
I was on the news.
"I'm telling you this to hurt you right now, because you're trying to make me feel bad, horrible even, which I don't appreciate."
But I never will...
Because nothing ever feels bad once you learn what that emotion is capable of.
Now let's not make a big deal about it.
I usually don't...
But you really forced my hand on this.
Do you know that expression?
"""Forced my hand""?"
It's one of my favorites.
She seems difficult.
She is.
Very.
"Well, you're putting her in an ugly situation."
What with you trying to have two girlfriends.
That's a tawdry way to phrase it.
(IKE CHUCKLES)
You have one living in a house that you share with her in the city and another one up here that you're living with.
"Yeah, I can see the appeal."
I practically invented it.
But I did it better than you.
Nobody hated me then.
I could enjoy it.
Good luck!
All of you just wait for my move.
"If you have no counterattack, then meekly accept defeat and shut your faces!"
Angel...
"You have been blaming yourself all this time, haven't you?"
"In this world, there's no one who blames you."
Every single one of you say you don't blame me.
"But, in private, you say that Mom's death is my fault!"
"Back then, I was opposed to having the baby."
Lily was right at the peak of her career...
"At that time, she was at the prime of her modeling years."
"I can't believe that for her child, Lily was willing to sacrifice everything."
"In the end, because of a child's request, she dropped all her work, and specially flew back in order to celebrate her birthday."
"Mary, you're up."
Give Auntie a hug.
Come...
"Daddy, Mommy died because of me."
Didn't she?
Of course not.
"Why would you think that, Mary?"
Let's go.
I'll take you to get something to eat.
You can't trust what adults say.
That's not how it is at all.
Don't have such foolish thoughts.
That's definitely how it is!
That's definitely how it is!
"Even now, Dad still hates me!"
"At this time, in the script..."
Lola appears.
"She cannot hold back the tears, but gently laughs once."
Why is it disdainful laughter?
Can we do this later please ?
"Sam, I need you to command the civilians, form them into fire teams."
I'll give my deployment orders through sergeant...
Deployment orders ?
Fire teams ?
"Come on, some of these guys have never even held a rifle before."
"Well, you've supposed to be the expert in turning civilians into soldiers."
"No, we were guerilla fighters."
All right ?
Hit and run.
"Keep moving, keep the enemy off balance."
I've never had to defend a fixed position.
That's a whole different game.
"You're just gonna have to learn it fast, because that's what we're doing."
We're defending this fixed position.
Until chief finds his eye of Jupiter.
"Okay, so you want us to risk our lives for something that you haven't even found yet ?"
!
"Listen, Sam, I'm not even sure it exists."
But I don't have to tell you every little godsdamn detail.
You know what you have to explain to me ?
"The major's in charge on this one, okay ?"
Okay ?
"Well, I certainly wouldn't want to step between you and your major."
"In my thought, that went really well."
- He'll do it.
- He'd better.
I miss Nicky.
- Do you think he's okay ?
"- Yes, he's fine."
- He's on Galactica.
He's fine.
"Now, he knows that you're part owner of Denver-Carrington."
He's trying to buy up that stock to gain a controlling interest in your company.
So he can drive a wedge between the two of us.
And then what he'll try to do is position you.
So that you have to side with him on anything at all relating to that pipeline.
Doesn't surprise me.
Doesn't surprise me one damn bit.
- Thank you for telling me about it.
"- Oh, well, I hope it helps."
"It does, it all helps."
"Well, I'll talk to you later."
"- Dominique, good morning."
- Good morning.
"Oh, could I see you in my office for a minute, please?"
"- Of course you may, Adam."
- Thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you.
"Dominique, you know Jason Colby's chief counsel, Garrett Boydston."
I knew him once.
"No, thank you."
"Well, I need a complete fix on him."
"How he works, everything."
A personality and career dossier.
Yes.
"I'm sorry, Adam, but I am not in the dossier business this season."
"Look, anything, any little thing you can tell me will help."
"I've got to work with him, and at the moment, I'm flying blind."
I am no authority on Garrett Boydston.
You'll just have to find your spy elsewhere.
Dominique?
I didn't mean to strike a nerve.
Wanker.
Why don't you just stop being such a fucking pussy and let the fuck go?
Fucking leave me alone!
There you are.
Are you OK?
"Look at you, you poor thing."
Come with us.
We'll get you some warm clothes and a nice hot tea.
The Musical Society are going to do a performance for all of you.
HMS Pinafore.
"# I've treacle and toffee, I've tea and I've coffee"
# Soft tommy and succulent chops
"# So buy of your Buttercup, Poor Little Buttercup"
"# Come of your Buttercup, buy!"
#
Come back!
There'll be cheese and wine.
It'll be fun!
There's always cheese and wine!
Take a seat.
Eventful day.
"Pissing around in pools, smashing up labs, avoiding activities, getting up to no good in the dorms."
- How'd you know what I...?
"- And now you turn up for an interview like, well..."
"You know, I'm amazed you actually even bothered, really."
"But I'm a fair man, so bearing all that in mind, why don't you try to convince me into offering you a place at this university?"
"Oh, you think you're so original, don't you?"
I have met a million kids like you.
"Yeah, vaguely intelligent."
Agonisingly middle-class.
"Read a book by Camus, a book by Kafka."
"No real substance, though."
"That's what I say too, but you don't believe me."
"You're just lying to yourself, aren't you?"
You'll never know for sure whether your dad really wrote those messages.
I know!
I just know!
What's going on here?
Will the show continue?
Don't know...
You just know?
What basis do you have for saying you know?
Do you think you know your dad very well?
Back to the script.
Gong Xi is going back to Lola's lines.
She's acting again.
Yes.
She's back to Lola's lines again.
You've never had a proper conversation with your dad.
"All day and night, you just complain that Dad doesn't care about you."
You never try to be understanding of his feelings.
Isn't that true?
"Mary, how was your day at school?"
Did you play any fun games with your classmates?
Why does he ask the same question every time?
Lame.
"Bit nippy, but this time of year, what do you expect?"
"And as your daughter said, no-one really knows what's gonna happen."
You don't have to do this any more.
You can live instead.
Daddy!
You've been found guilty by a unanimous verdict.
"The law says you should be punished, but we don't have the resources to impose a custodial sentence."
"Therefore, I have no choice but to pass a sentence of death."
I'll hit at 11:00.
"When the diamonds get here, you check out."
- And don't let anyone see you.
"- What do you think I am, an amateur?"
"No, lover."
You're just a reluctant old pro trying to make a comeback.
So keep your fingers crossed.
[knock on door]
"Come in, Paul."
"Well, working kind of late, aren't you?"
Yeah.
"Well, hallelujah."
I just thought you peasants might like a touch of glamour in your drab lives.
I'm impressed.
What kind of a singing job do you do tonight?
Thanks a lot.
I happen to be going to a very posh birthday party.
Protecting the family jewels?
"No, a wealthy niece."
Her aunt thinks her young man is a fortune hunter.
- Is he?
"- Well, he's poor."
"Anyway, the girl's 21 today, so Auntie had to let the guy come to the party."
"She's just afraid that later on, when things get jumping, the two kids might try and run off together."
"If the girl's of age, how are you supposed to stop it?"
"Well, I do know he was married in Texas once, so if I have to, I can try and run a bluff on that."
Wasn't he divorced?
So far I haven't been able to establish it-- either way.
"Will if the bluff fails, you should try charming her yourself."
I must say you do look dashing.
"Oh, you finally got around to admitting it."
"Good night, Perry."
"Because every time we chase down a bad guy on foot, you drive."
Ah.
"Well, I am kind of a genius that way."
- Who's the hottie on deck?
- He's cute.
"- Our latest client, and he's engaged."
- Of course he is.
"Charlie, we're all here."
"- Morning, angels."
"- Good morning, Charlie."
I'd like you to meet Scott Foster.
He's here because his fiancee disappeared off a cruise ship.
It was supposed to be a 3-day trip.
Miami to the Bahamas.
That was two weeks ago.
Your fiancee went on a cruise without you?
She's working a story.
She's a journalist.
- And what was she chasing on the high seas?
- She never talks about her work.
"The cruise line registers their ships in the Bahamas, which puts this case out of American jurisdiction."
Cruise line give you any leads?
"They've been incredibly helpful, but the fact is, they don't have any answers, and there's no evidence of foul play aboard their ship."
"If she's alive, I need to find her, and if she's not- let's just stay positive."
Right now she's just a missing person.
"Scott, before we take your case, there is one last piece of business we need to settle internally."
You'll hear from us.
Thank you.
"All right, we'll walk you out."
Right this way.
Internal business?
"Charlie, don't leave us hanging."
Dana!
We just found out we lost our qualifying slot.
"We don't qualify, we don't race."
"Believe me, guys, I'm working on it, okay?"
The racing committee assumed we weren't racing because of what happened to Jared.
"If we don't race, we don't get points."
"Look, I know this is a hard time for you, but..."
"Don't worry, I'm on it!"
"Harrison, Cal, these are federal agents."
They're investigating the crash.
Investigating what?
I thought it was an accident.
"Yeah, we're not so sure."
"Go, get ready."
I'll get us a slot.
"Sorry, I gotta get back to work, guys."
Whoa.
"No, not until you tell us what you and Jared's father are hiding."
We know Jared was stabbed.
"We know he had over $100,000 of stolen money in his garage, and we know there's no way that you didn't know something about this."
"And this does not look good for Jared right now, Dana."
"If you care about him, you'll help us."
I wish I could.
"If you're scared for some reason, we can protect you."
"But if we find out you're withholding anything, we have to arrest you."
I have to go.
Please.
(cell phone beeps)
That must be one hell of a secret.
Yeah.
A text from Sebastian.
It says that Christopher wanted him to tell us that Jared was definitely murdered.
Mama knows you're hiding things from her.
"Leena, this isn't the right time."
When is right time?
The child is around and we can't say a word.
"Mama, why don't we talk later about the theatrical swamp?"
"Sure, stick your head in the sand."
What are you hinting at?
"I'm just saying that for the past months you come here and talk about everything aside from ""the matter""."
"- I already told you about ""the matter""."
"I told you when it was in the papers, I told about the police."
I don't sleep at night and friends is a term that doesn't exist anymore!
"Is that ""the matter"" for you?"
I understand you're talking about me.
We're talking about this whole family.
"A family with a big blemish, like cancer."
"Yitzhak is not a thief, do you understand?"
"I read the papers, they're investigating, there will be a trial, it could end badly."
And please don't smoke in the living room!
He had no choice but to write out fake invoices.
The theater wasn't paying him.
He was supposed to get percentages on ticket sales.
And it was a musical.
A grand operetta.
Who says they owe him a bonus?
He took what was coming to him!
Not honestly.
Fictitiously.
But we don't talk about that anymore.
We keep quiet here.
I don't keep quiet.
I'll tell those who need to know.
Not you.
# Go with the status quo #
# Go with the status # # 'cause that's where we should go... #
It says this D.V.D. sold more copies than any D.V.D. ever made.
They just released part three in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"Well, I'm out, guys."
"If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done."
I no longer have any connection to this world.
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.
"Good-bye, friends."
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes,"
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it either-
- Kenny?
No fucking way I'm doing it.
"All right, we promise?"
We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this.
- I swear.
- I swear too.
"Okay, good."
"What happened, I thought you were gonna kill yourself."
I tried.
Went to sleep in my Mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
But you didn't die?
"Freakin' hybrids, man."
They just don't do the trick anymore.
"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats."
Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.
This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the communist east side and the democratic west side.
# East side west side #
# Whatever side that you're on #
# As long as we care about each other #
# We can still all have some fun... #
Not a stick nor a spar.
"Looks like we're on our own, then."
What happened to them?
Where are they?
They must have sailed.
"If there are no British ships, there will be French ones."
We should go.
- We will.
- Back to Gibraltar as I suggested?
"- Bring her about, Mr. Scott-Padget."
"- Yes, sir."
"Boatswain, stand by to wear ship!"
Mr. Ponsonby I want you to send Crawford into the tops for two days.
"For punishment, sir?"
Do as I tell you.
I wish to speak to the ship's company informally.
"Muster all hands, if you please."
- All hands to the after well deck!
- Come on!
Jump to it!
Are we heading back to Gibraltar?
We'll stay on this course for the time being.
"Well, lads, I've got some explaining to do."
We seemed to have lost the fleet.
I want you to know the orders for the fleet and for us which are to escort a convoy of timber ships from the far side of Italy back to England.
"Timber to build ships of the line, and frigates."
More like her.
Defiant.
We must go to the place of rendezvous and see if the convoy is there.
"If it isn't, well, we tried."
"If it is, we'll bring it back in the face of Frenchmen, Spaniards or anyone else who tries to stop us."
- Back to your duties.
- Here we are.
"- Good-looking school, doc."
"That must be the new principal, you know?"
"They really give it to you, didn't they?"
"Like everybody else, they really give it to you."
Have you been drinking?
"Work yourself to death, then they bring in an outsider to pick the plum."
You have been drinking.
"I know you keep a bottle in the basement, but I won't have you bring it into the classroom, ever."
Don't forget.
It'd do your kids good to learn how to handle liquor instead of algebra.
- You're talking like a fool.
"- Oh, be I."
I sat in this classroom four years.
I sat right here.
Everything important was learned somewheres else.
You never applied yourself.
"If you had, you might've learned something in school."
"Tell my wife, a cleaning woman."
"- Tell me, a janitor, cleaning toilets."
- Stop it!
- Tell every mill worker behind on his bills.
"- I said, stop it."
"If you had applied yourself, you might have learned how to live intelligently."
There ain't nobody in this here town living intelligently.
Nobody.
- I don't believe that.
- All right.
Name me one important person graduated from this here school.
Name one.
You can't.
"I'm gonna tell you something, Ms. Thornton something you can teach your class someday."
He has gone with him.
"Chun-tae, listen carefully."
"When we land, I'm going to make a run for it while Yum Moon is attacking Buryung."
"But if we get caught, we're dead."
Why would we get caught?
I just don't have a good feeling about this.
Jang Bogo will kill us at this rate.
The best plan is to run away.
Got that?
Are we going to work for Madam Jami?
We can decide that later.
- Got that?
"- Yes, sir."
Chief Jang.
Yes.
I have never disobeyed the master until now.
I know.
You would obey his orders even if they led you to your death.
I still remember the time you jumped off a cliff without a word when the master ordered you to.
"At the time, I couldn't understand why the master was so cruel to you."
"But with time, I've learned how much he cares for you."
It bothers me that I've disobeyed him.
But I am doing this for him.
We will self-destruct at this rate.
He will understand my loyalty for him when we return with provisions and weapons from our attack on Buryung.
You'd better answer my questions truthfully.
Then your life will be spared.
Yes.
Where are Yi Do-hyung and Yum Moon now?
"Master is on the ship, and the head chief is not on the island."
Then where has he gone?
He's gone to secure provisions and weapons.

Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.
But now he's asking me to go to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.
That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.
"Whenever you move me, I asked once and I'll tell you again"
I don't want to go any place cold.
You don't have a choice in that matter.
Come on.
Just whoever fucking controls it... just no place cold.
Do that for me.
I'm trying to...
"He's bronchial, that's why."
"If he's legitimately bronchial, we'll take it to consideration."
I'd like to go someplace not cold.
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?
What about them?
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?
Don't I have some kind of contact with them?
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that
"God forbid, something happens to my parents they get sick, I can't going see them?"
"Maybe something can be worked out, if they're sick if there's extraordinary circumstances..."
I can't do this.
"I can't do this, Henry."
I can't leave my parents.
"Excuse me, Karen, I told you before."
I'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me.
I can't do it without you.
"So, you do whatever, but... that's it."
You?
You created Poopie Penguin?
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
What's Poopie Penguin?
That's right.
What's Poopie Penguin?
What's Poopie-- what are you-- you live under a rock?
"Poopie Penguin is a game that you play on your cell phone where you're a penguin, and you're flying around in the air, and you poop on people's heads for points."
Penguins don't fly.
No.
They do in my universe.
"Let me explain something to you, my kids, Charlie and Grace, they play this game non-stop."
Must have spent $100 on it just last month.
"Yeah, that's the beauty of in-app purchases."
"Yeah, I don't think there is anything beautiful about it."
I think that it is a scam.
You're ripping off children is what you're doing.
"I mean, you give them the app for free, and then they got to pay if they want to keep playing for the power-ups and the boosts or whatever you call it."
You're like a drug dealer pushing dope.
"First taste is free, then they're hooked for life."
"Don't hate the player, hate the game."
"I hate the game, I do very much."
Would you please stop and let him focus?
He needs to focus.
This is important.
(sighs)
"I'm just curious, how do you think of something like that anyway?"
"Ah, simple."
"A, poop is funny."
I'll give you that.
"B, it's relatable, everybody poops."
One of Sam's whales won 300 grand at a private table.
And he's back at it today.
But I checked the tape and everything's on the up-and-up.
Just one of those runs.
Right.
Look.
"I don't want Monica finding out about these phony chips, all right?"
She owns the place.
Kinda hard to keep her out of the loop.
"Unless she's preoccupied with some other major crisis like, uh, this dealer who can't seem to deal a losing hand."
"I'm just afraid, Mike, that if she finds out about it, the wrong heads can roll."
You know?
Like mine?
I don't want the cops involved.
Not yet anyway.
Not until we get our money back.
- Mr. Deline.
"- How are you, Sarasvati?"
Good.
They told me you needed to see me right away.
Right.
"The, um, daily revenue reports, when are they scheduled to go out?"
"An hour or so, but if you need it sooner-"
"No, no, no."
"Actually, I'd like the distribution delayed till I tell you."
"Mr. Deline, under normal circumstances,"
"I would gladly accommodate your request, but Miss Mancuso had already requested-"
You just tell Miss Mancuso that it was my decision.
We don't want her to find out about the counterfeit chips.
Oh.
It's very hard for me to be duplicitous.
Which is why we love you.
"You can't do that, jim!"
We got to get some of his money to pay for this presidential suite!
Jim's right.
You couldn't chase him away with a cannon.
"Here, you board of directors get into this room- all 12 of you."
"And, nick, talk out loud about all the boats we're going to build."
Open the transom so old drew can hear you.
All right.
Now try it out.
"Gentlemen, today we are gathered here for the burial of daniel drew."
"How's that, jim?"
That'll fix him.
Ha!
Well?
I reckon you ain't too busy to see your uncle daniel drew.
Uncle who?
Drew.
"Oh, yes, drew."
"Well, i'm very busy."
I've got my board of directors waiting for this report in the next room.
"Within the next 10 months, gentlemen, we'll have in operation 6 of the finest steamboats ever built in america!"
"He have not only the unanimous support of the press and public, but the financial backing of the biggest men in new york."
"Ah, very interesting."
"Proceed, my good man, proceed."
"Oh, won't you sit down?"
"The trouble is that these two great cities have condemned the intolerable ""take it and like it"" policy of daniel drew."
You must excuse them.
They don't know you're here.
"Ahem, ahem, mr."
"Boyd, i would like to ask a question."
"Yes, mr."
"Baxter, what can i do for you?"
"Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction."
This man is not a prisoner of war.
Not anymore.
He's a saboteur.
He's a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
I didn't do it.
I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
"Come now, you threw a time bomb."
How could I have had a time bomb?
They searched me when they took me prisoner.
"And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely."
All I know is he did it.
I am satisfied.
I am not.
"According to the Geneva Convention, this man-- ls there anything in the Geneva Convention that'll let a guy sleep?"
- You were saying?
-Simply this.
After the hostilities are ended there will be such a thing as a war crimes commission.
"If the man should be convicted without proper proof you will be held responsible, Oberst von Scherbach."
- Interesting.
-isn't it?
Very well.
If you insist on details I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb.
"Good day, sir."
You will forgive me for receiving you like this.
Perfectly all right.
I do not like boots.
Schulz!
I believe it.
I believe it.
Let's have your dog tags for the Christmas tree.
What's the idea?
I just started.
Oh?
Yes.
I want you to leave my crew alone.
Don't dance with him.
Did it make you angry?
"Don't accept his gifts, either."
I believe the dear captain's Jealous of me.
I don't care what you believe.
Keep your hands off her!
"How curiously human, how wonderfully barbaric."
I've had enough of your attentions to her.
Of course.
"That's the root of the matter, isn't it?"
"You fight for the attention, admiration, possession of women."
"If it's fighting that you want, you may have it."
Are you challenging me to a duel?
If you have the courage.
This is better than I'd planned.
I shall not shirk an affair of honor.
A matched set--
Just like the pair that slew your heroic Alexander Hamilton.
"And, Captain..."
I never miss.
"Captain 's Log,"
"Stardate 2126. 1, delayed report-- the whole bridge crew are the unwilling guests of the creature who calls himself Trelane."
"We are weaponless, powerless, and our only hope of escape with the Enterprise lies in playing his games."
"I've decided to make my move with the field-of-honor game, and everything depends on my one chance with the ancient dueling pistol."
"Oh, how fascinating."
I'm party to an actual human duel.
Ready?
"Quite ready, sir."
I don't wanna watch him.
I wasn't talking to you.
"Your girlfriend, she's very pretty."
She's a bitch.
Margaret is an uptight Wasp cunt from Connecticut.
Can I use your works?
"Yeah, It's allright."
But give me an extra four hours.
Sure.
Do me a favor...
Can't get around to get off.
Relax baby.
-Takes a lot.
-You should be happy.
Paul give us some money we can go take a lunch.
So what?
Get ready to go.
It gets this bitch two hours to get ready to go out somewhere.
In the beginning aliens were spotted in places with large amounts of heroin.
"Later, aliens appeared in specific sub cultures, punk cultures."
Still around heroin and in these punk cultures many more strange deaths have occured.
"Big fucking belly, eat your food!"
"Apple pie, shit!"
Why don't you ask something to eat some cheese some...and taste some wine...
Nothing strange about deaths in punk culture.
They kill each other by shooting too much dope.
I remember when we were...
in Cambridge there was war
I think between the Mods and Rockers.
They went on each other with bicycle chains.
I don't think your punks need help from the outside to kill themselves.
My mother used to bake five or six apple pies at once.
"It's ""maybe""."
Directive is now required.
"Jenna, stand by to feed all power through to the main drive when the force wall is down."
Ready.
"Gan, deactivate the force wall."
Deactivating.
Why?
For what reason?
Perhaps Sonheim was still trying to cover up.
Mandrian knew about him and threatened to expose him.
Or perhaps he went into the filter plant while Sonheim was sabotaging the equipment?
But why damage the filter?
What possible reason could he have for delaying the flight still further?
How bad is it?
The damage was minor.
I've got Levett working on it.
We've locked him in the storage hold.
He seems quiet enough.
Has he said anything more?
Nothing new.
"He claims he went in and found Mandrian dead, picked up the knife, that's where I came in."
He still says he didn't kill him.
I believe him.
But I saw him with a dagger in his hand!
But you didn't see him use it.
"I didn't see Mandrian die either, but I know he's dead."
I've just spent the last ten minutes in the filter plant looking for something that should be there but isn't.
The cable that was damaged carries a high energy charge.
"In order to cut it, he would need a laser knife or an insulated saw."
Neither of which were there.
"Then, somebody else was the saboteur?"
Yes.
I don't hate you.
It's not possible to hate you.
You're...
What the hell was it that Reynolds called you the other day?
Groovy.
You're a groovy chick.
"No, what I, um, do detest is your selfishness."
I have served this nation without regard for personal income for over ten years.
You are selfish because you want to take on a job that positions you to assume... a mantle of gigantic responsibility... and you do it full well with the knowledge...
Of what?
What?
"Greatness is the orphan of urgency, Laine."
Greatness only emerges when we need it most... in times of war or calamity.
I can't ask somebody to be a Kennedy or a Lincoln.
They were men created by their times.
What I can ask for is the promise of greatness.
"And that, Madam Senator... you don't have."
"Well, then..."
"I just wouldn't be using sex as leverage... if I were you, Sheldon."
Because there's one thing you don't want.
It's a woman with her finger on the button who isn't getting laid.
Will that be the argument the senator offers up before the committee?
Sir?
Can I get you something to drink?
"- Uh, no, I'm fine."
Thank you.
- You sure?
"No, great."
Thanks a lot.
"- Ah, Mr. Webster."
- Mr. President.
- Good to see you.
Thanks again for leaving the Earl for me.
"Oh, well, there are dozens of royals, but I only have one sister, and there'll be other men."
Please tell me sex is better than caviar.
They're both better with vodka.
"But if I could offer a piece of big sister advice, when it comes to men, be patient."
You may have to kiss a lot frogs before you find your prince.
Pardon me.
Or not.
I believe you left your boot wheel behind.
"Oh, Joy, it's like Cinderella."
"Oh, sweetie, I don't think he's here for me."
"Yes, while you're both extremely charming women..."
- you don't have to.
- Right.
"I thought it was very lovely the way you left the party early to take care of your sister, but I wanted to get to know you better."
Would you consider joining me for a drink?
I'd love to.
"Ooh, would you give me a minute?"
- I'll meet you by the car.
- Of course.

Previously on Remedy...
Come to Dallas with me.
None of it's working.
"I had this guy leave me a voicemail at work, so I called him at home."
"And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry, and so I texted to his cell."
Then he e-mailed me to my home account and the whole thing just got out of control.
And I miss the days where you had one phone number and one answering machine.
And that one answering machine housed one cassette tape and that one cassette tape either had a message from the guy or it didn't.
And now you have to go around checking all these different portals just to get rejected by seven different technologies.
It's exhausting.
What about that MySpace guy?
- Jude.
I like him.
- Good.
"Yeah, I felt like we connected."
Great.
What if she wants you to kiss her?
"Well, then I guess I'm just gonna have to kiss her."

This babe has plenty of battle scars.
Hello?
"Oh, hey, you're home."
Where am I supposed to be?
"Out, maybe?"
It's Saturday night.
You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me.
It's kind of limiting.
Right.
"Listen, I was just gonna leave a message."
I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come.
"Oh, I don't know."
Won't Conor be there?
"There's a full tactical support team on-site, and some heavy-hitter seems to be running the show."
We got them boxed in.
"Whatever it takes, I want it finished."
We have Westen.
Awaiting instructions.
Stand down and let him go.
Please confirm stand-down.
Confirmed.
All units stand down.
"I'll never stop, Westen."
I'll hunt you down to the ends of the earth if I have to.
Then I'll see you there.
"When you're a fugitive, it's tempting to flee the country and worry about the details later."
But it's also a great way to get caught.
"Since most countries now require biometric I.D.s, the first step in getting out of town is getting good documents."
You can't just go somewhere new.
You need to be someone new when you get there.
Randy Weems?
What the hell kind of name is that?
What happened to Chuck Finley?
That's my lucky name.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Weems, but my I.D. guy doesn't take requests."
"Oh, crap."
"Well, just stick with ""Sam,"" will you?"
Don't be calling me Randy until we leave.
"Speaking of leaving, shouldn't Elsa be here with the supplies already?"
Michael and Jesse are almost done with the radio.
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
I just gave her a few extra things to pick up for me.
She probably just got stuck shopping.
"""A few extra things""?"
"Jesus Christ, Emma."
Now you listen to me.
While we were goofing around... another woman got murdered.
I am gonna get someone to take you home... and you stay there with the cop who's assigned to you.
Please don't palm me off on somebody else.
I have to talk to you.
I got to work on this full-time all the time.
Ridgely's a good cop.
He's gonna look after you.
"Is Ridgely gonna take over fucking me, too?"
Did you enjoy that?
What the hell am I to you... one of your little conquests?
I've seen your friends smirk at me.
You think I'm stupid?
What do you tell them?
You give them a full report?
Listen to me.
I'm a little bit busy right now... to be playing Romeo to your Juliet.
I have one or two minor things on my mind... not the least of which is finding this killer... before he finds you... so simmer down and stop acting... like some love-crazed teenager.
You are such a prick.
Emma...
I like you.
You're a very interesting... unusual woman.
You're so full of shit.
Don't you dare treat me like we just met in a bar.
"Well, we did, didn't we?"
Fuck!
"What do you want me to say, huh?"
You want me to say I love you?
Is that what you want?
Look at us.
You think we have some kind of future together... some kind of suburban bullshit?
"It'll be over in no time, just like your five years in college"
"Thanks to your foolishness, we've lost two chances"
Last chance!
Please give sensible suggestions
Remember!
I'm doing all this only for you.
"No one must know, okay?"
Shekhar needs cash.
Immediately.
- I'll sign up tomorrow
"What do you mean, you'll sign up?"
Aren't we going back?
But Om borrowed the money for my education
Out there you can earn lots more.
Just mail the money home
No American company will give me a loan.
"And Om wants cash, immediately"
This urgency was never the point.
The decision to borrow was his own
You knew nothing about it
And you're forgetting something.
Only a few weeks to go... before your work permit expires.
And you got to return before that
Is everything all right?
What was that about the work permit?
"It's nothing, Ma."
You haven't gone to bed yet?
Go to sleep
He must return to America before his work permit expires
"Jai, will you step outside for a minute?"
"Whatever you got to say, say it in front of Nitu"
Have you informed Om about this?
They have wounded me in such a way..
..that I wont be able to forgive them in this life!
Dont be so harsh on them!
If you wont support them in their bad times..
..then who else will support them?
And did you forget what sister-in-Iaw used to say?
The one who doesnt know how to forgive..
..even God doesnt forgive that person.
"Jyoti, even if God sends me to hell for not.."
"..forgiving them, then III happily go, but I.."
..I will not give them a place in..
..my heaven-Iike house again.
"If.. if I forgive them today, then all those brothers.."
..who take care of their younger brothers..
..like theirfatherwiII neverforgive me!
"Jyoti, its very simple."
If today these people have cried in orderto improve..
"..their bad times, then can you assure me that.."
"..in future, if the time changes.."
..these people wont change themselves?
Can you assure me about this!
?
No!
You cant assure me about this.
"Krishna, get these people out of here!"
Im feeling suffocated!
"One day, you promised me that.."
..you will never let these children cry.
"And today, when these children are.."
"..in front of you, you are feeling suffocated!"
Did you forget your promise!
?
Why are you...?
Why is she pointing at me?
Why you rolling toward me?
You're in front of the door.
Uh...
Oh.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
What happened to you?
What happened was this:
The bee man was not composed of bees.
The drones nested around their queen  safe inside the bee man 's mouth.
But when he spat the queen  she signaled her drones to attack any perceived predator.
"Unlike Kentucky Fitz, Chuck kept a cool head and an open mouth."
She was not perceived as a predator  but a nest.
Look.
That's Betty Bee as a little girl.
"Well, either she was an unfortunately hairy child..."
Or Betty Bee is the terrifying bee man.
- Wasn't she with you?
- She didn't get off the elevator.
She must have come back up here to wiggity-whack you for being a spy.
Like she wiggity-whacked Kentucky.
"Well, my wiggity wasn't whacked."
And I got the bee key.
- That's a house key.
I know what house.
As Chuck followed the bee key that was key  Olive Snook followed her homesick heart to the confessional.
Ready.
Fire.
What the hell's going on?
"An Insectoid ship, sir."
You destroyed them?
They were opening a vortex.
They would've escaped.
The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery.
Sir?
We could've kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
"They would have told their superiors, sir, given away our position."
"If you'd explained to them why we were here, you might've avoided a firefight."
"With all due respect, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking."
Archer to Major Hayes.
"Go ahead, Captain."
"Report to my ready room, on the double."
"Aye, sir."
I'm relieving you as tactical officer.
"From now on, you'll report to Major Hayes."
I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission.
You'll be confined to quarters until further notice.
-Captain...
-Dismissed.
"Yes, sir."
Are you done with that translation?
Almost.
I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid language.
Transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready.
Understood.
There's nothing more important than the success of this mission.
"-Do you agree, Major?"
"- Of course, ser."
- There's Winslet.
- She's not coming off the Supreme Court.
Laine Hanson is attractive.
She's a looker.
The mere fact that she was a Republican means that she can't be too far to the left.
It's a perfect pedigree.
We can't get you in by convincing him you're the right man for the job.
We have to convince him that she's wrong.
"Once we do that, you're in."
"And Toliver, he's as much as told me..."
I'm not going for a low blow.
It's not my way.
You won't have to.
We have to go after her.
We have to make her wade in her own blood.
- Who did you say you were?
- I'm Makerowitz.
- Makerowitz.
- I'm sorry.
That doesn't mean much to me.
- Web got somebody...
- A friend of the Hathaway campaign.
Who is footing the not-too-unimpressive bill of Mr. Makerowitz.
Private citizen wants to do their own investigation...
What exactly are you trying to find out?
"Campaign irregularities, bribes?"
- Isn't that the FBI's responsibility?
"- Yes, it is."
But the FBI would not find anything.
All of her money is tied up in blind trusts.
"The kind of improprieties you're talking about, I think that only helps her."
"Personally, I think the nation would be relieved to know that just because she's a woman..."
But your servant said you were meeting with the king.
So?
It was very late.
"If you're back with him, I think it's a mistake."

It burned down last year.
I don't know what happened
"Between the two of you, but I can guess,"
So please don't counsel me on mistakes.
"Come along, girls, be of service to your queen."
Girl:
"oh, my sweetest child god's smile behind your eyes in his hand, in our arms you will find no harm."
Who are you?
Why are you singing that song?
I was told to sing it near you.
By who?
I was paid by another who was paid by a girl...
I don't know who.
She's dead.
That girl is dead.
It's impossible.
The messenger who delivered the news
Of the english queen's death isn't here.
I suppose he knew he'd served his purpose
"And that your invitation was a mere courtesy,"
A thanks for giving us both what we want.
You bribed him to bear false news.
"To get the job done,"
As you failed in that task completely.
You can thank me later.

What did you find out about Kim Yang?
"Lord Dangje, the regent's father, is looking after the new governor."
Is there a reason why?
"Kim Yang is a very competent man, who has risen in the ranks very rapidly."
He was revered by the people under his rule.
Some have even built a monument in his honor.
He seems to be an extraordinary man.
It would be wise to make an ally of him.
"Captain, it is I, Tae-bong."
Come in.
What is it?
The new governor is headed for Chunghae.
Why is he going to Chunghae?
I haven't found that out yet.
The scout ship is ready to set sail.
Search the waters near Yongeum Island.
You will be able to find Yum Moon's hideout.
He could attack any minute.
Be very careful during your mission.
"Yes, sir."
Set sail!
What division do the troops belong to?
"That's the flag of the Sajageum division, the Mujinju governor's guards."
My lord.
What brings you out in this cold weather?
The new governor is here to pay his respects to you.
What brings you to Chunghae?
I have been appointed governor of Mujinju by your grace.
I came to pay my respects.
You came all this way just to pay your respects?
"If you have the time, you should use it to carry out your duty."
You didn't seem very friendly to the governor.
"Kaman, you gotta let me go."
"Please, let me go."
What do you want?
I'll give you anything you want.
You want money?
You want a job?
"Just don't do anything stupid, man, all right?"
Damn it!
"Come on, man!"
"[Garcia] Okay, from the look of Kaman Scott's early years, he was on a fast track to be some kind of hoodlum, bad boy, super convict, but something happened in 2004 that made him change his evil tune"
"'cause then there's no arrests, there's no suspicions."
"There's no sign of rehab, but he totally cleaned up."
Maybe that's when he met someone.
Has he ever been arrested with a man named Tommy Proctor?
"Yeah, once."
"Uh, 2002."
Yikes.
And then they collided again in 2005.
"Like, literally collided."
"Kaman was in an accident, and his car blew up."
"Well, there's your gas accelerant."
"[Garcia] He was hit by that guy, Tommy Proctor."
And there's your revenge.
Twist of fate.
The life he left behind came back to haunt him.
"So Tommy walks away without a scratch, and Kaman suffers a ton of third-degree burns, had a boatload of skin grafts, was in a coma for a couple of months, lost his apartment..."
"Oh, and then there's that guy."
His landlord was Tony Torrell.
So we were right.
He does have a revenge list.
"What about family, friends, acquaintances?"
"No, that Kaman is a lone wolf."
Your money?
"My five thousand, that you owe me."
You probably mean this here.
You glue money to the wall?
Is that five thousand?
Yes.
You owe me money and glue it to the wall?
Are you insane?
"Toni, look at it like this."
"My office is your place of pilgrimage,"
You can always come here and beg forgiveness for your greed.
Stop this bullshit!
Euro-Basilica!
"From now on, we'll call it Euro-Basilica!"
I'll have you sent to the insane asylum.
You along with your loony sister and the other idiots too.
Should I explain how I really see it?
"So my dear Franz, I'll give you untill the end of the week to get these bills off the wall."
"Otherwise I'll call the police, and I'll call the press."
"That way the whole world can see the idiots, with whom I have to co-exist."
I also have to co-exist with you... with your America fetish and the stench of your bar... and the constantly changing waitresses bitching to us that you won't pay them.
"Actually, I should bash your face in for all this."
But my father and your father are brothers.
"Well, I'll come up with a plan."
Think up something.
"And you darling, come up with a plan as well."
I already have.
Try getting them off with steam.
Max the Hunter
Max the Hunter
- Excuse me.
What?
"Then Doug turned on him, and I wasn't gonna let that happen."
- I'm sure you made the right decision.
- He took him.
"He just picked him up early at school one day, and he disappeared."
Did you call the police?
Yeah.
Every day.
"But technically, we're still married, and he is Jasper's father... so without a custody order, they can't do anything."
"Oh, please."
I cannot wait for the courts to sort this out.
Do you have any idea where he might have taken him?
None.
"I have no idea, 'cause I've hardly spoken to him in months."
Do you have pictures?
Yeah.
That's Jasper.
Please.
Lucy said you could find him.
"I need to know that he's okay, and I want him back."
I'm gonna find him.
One of the things you learn in training... is to avoid situations that cut too close.
If you had a rough childhood... a situation with an abusive father and a vulnerable kid is gonna make you angry.
"That can be motivating, but it can also be dangerous."
"Well, she's a looker."
What's the story?
- Husband ran off with her kid.
"- You all right, Mike?"
I'm gonna find this guy.
Facts are the hallmark of a good false identity.
It's harder to create history than it is to alter it.
"Plus, the more truth to your lie... the easier it is to remember."
"I don't see you for weeks,and you start going through the closets?"
"Billy, did you steal something from the hotel?"
"Yeah, well, I wish I could tell you more, but that's all I know."
"Well, you helped a lot."
At least now I know when that outfit was in Gold mine Canyon.
"Yeah, that's good."
"Sheriff, I saw that RV today."
I know you did.
"Listen, I told him all about it already."
"No, you didn't."
"Sheriff,"
I stole something from that RV.
"And now I want to turn myself in, even if it means 99 years."
"Well, why don't you just give me back what you stole and maybe we can skip the 99 years."
"On the other hand, stealing is a pretty serious matter."
maybe you and me ought to have a little private talk about it.
"Sheriff, it's you and I, not you and me."
"Well, whatever."
"Listen, I want you to tell me everything you know about this medallion."
There was this man at the hotel.
He's a waiter.
He was wearing one just like it.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
"And by the van, there was this long old car with bullets in the front."
It was following us [stutters] and then I saw it there.
"Well, now that is something."
Will I be called as a witness in the trial?
"Well, it's a possibility."
"But right now, I want you to do me a favor, okay?"
I want you and your folks to go right on down there and have a real good time at that frontier town.
Will you do that?
How did you know we were going there?
"Promise you won't mention it again, or even think about it!"
- Promise me!
- Why?
"If you say that to anyone else, you'll be in big trouble, and I won't be there to help you."
"If it'll make you happier, I promise."
- However much we like her...
- Do you like her too?
"Of course, how couldn't I?"
She likes you too.
"Benigno, Alicia is practically dead!"
"She can't feel anything for anybody, not for you, not for me, not even for herself!"
Get that into your head!
Our patient Alicia Roncero has been raped and is pregnant.
I haven't told her father yet because first you're going to tell me what bastard did that in my clinic.
"Sir, we all feel extremely concerned."
You should be feeling responsible.
Alicia was on your floor.
Then let me be the one to explain the situation.
"Rosa, please..."
Alicia's periods stopped two months ago.
"At first, I thought it was only one month but I was mistaken."
That isn't mentioned in last month's report.
"In fact, it says you put the towel on her as always."
That week I was off again with the flu.
"You wrote it, didn't you, Benigno?"
It's your writing.
"Yes, it was me."
Why did you falsify the notes?
I didn't want to cause any alarm.
It isn't the first time a patient's periods have stopped.
That's true.
Why did no one notice?
Then you cook on her.
You ass.
From how long is this going on?
- Why are you hitting her unjustly?
Why are you feeling when I am hitting her?
Why are you talking so with such a great man?
What ?
He is shown concern on you at the hospital and now you are showing on him.
Are you both planning to show me a movie now?
"Hubby, it is ₹ 5 lakhs."
You liked it and bought it at Germany.
I do not care..
"Tukaram sir, you are unnecessarily imagining whatever."
He is a public figure.
But my wife is a private figure.
- You are misunderstanding.
"I am telling as a wife, he is a very great man."
And has also got Padmasri in recognition to that.
Opposition people used this photo to showcase him bad.
"Though your husband looks cunning, you look very genuine."
What do you want me to do?
You should have a press meet and say publicly.
"You want me to make all public, that happened in private till now?"
"Not that he has a relation, but you should say there is no relation."
"Still, what are these issues on our marriage day?"
Your marriage day?
- It is so in the script.
Script?
- In the script written by Lord Brahma.
I will think tonight in my drink whether to come tomorrow or not.
"Karthik, he is over acting a lot."
"- True, sir!"
My savior.
"I send you out to find more evidence against Reinhardt, and this is what you bring back?"
We supposed to apologize?
"Dental resin or no, Reinhardt is still the most viable suspect."
And that bite is the most damning piece of evidence.
I don't know what to do with this.
And I don't want it falling in the wrong hands.
"I'll put it in my bottom drawer, counselor."
"You want it, you let me know."
I don't relish the day.
Fake teeth.
Isn't that a little theatrical?
Gillian Booth is theatrical.
A mother killing her grown daughter is hard to take.
I agree.
But the evidence is pointing that way.
Laura was trying to get the love of her mother's life fired.
Philip's next job was gonna be out of state.
Gillian might have freaked out that he'd be gone for good.
"Ah, sure."
Angry enough at her daughter to lose control?
"Yeah, if her adrenaline was pumping in anger."
Anger or panic.
Panic?
/ She's not someone who handles surprises well.
Take these subway maps we found in her dressing room.
She marked her route from the opera to her apartment with a highlighter.
And she used a different color to mark the route to her daughter's house.
And she did the same thing on every single map.
She's afraid of getting lost.
Marking all these maps?
That's not afraid.
"Hey, hey, look at this."
You won a prize.
Yeah.
What is that?
Homework.
They're assigning Cosmopolitan as homework?
"No, they assigned this, but I'm getting nowhere with it."
You can't relate that to the real world.
Like how?
"Like, was Mom a virgin when you married her?"
"What are you studying, religion?"
Sex.
Are you going to tell me about Mom or not?
No.
"Boy, that's good coffee."
Fresh brewed?
Instant.
"Now, how 'bout if you love someone?"
Do you have to have sex with them?
This can't be instant.
We ran out of beans.
"And if you kiss a girl, what base is that, and where's the birth canal?"
I have a chart.
"You never have to have sex if you don't want to, kissing a girl's first base, the birth canal's right there, and you shouldn't have sex unless you're in love and probably married."
Why not?
I don't remember-- it has something to do with not wanting to have babies with people you don't know.
It says in this magazine that there's a spot on a woman you can touch to drive her completely insane.
I don't think the magazine's a good idea.
"And in my experience, there is no such place."
Dad.
What?
"When I grow up, do I have to have hair all over my body?"
- Good day.
- Good day.
How can I help you?
I'm collecting for the local children's hospital.
"Would you care to make a donation, however modest?"
"Well, cabinet makers don't make much, but I think I could contribute a little something."
- (coins clinking)
- Every penny counts.
- Do you have children?
"- No, I don't."
It's a shame.
"There was a time when I thought I'd pass my skills on to a son, or a daughter for that matter."
But it wasn't to be.
"50 cents,"
- would that be enough?
- Absolutely.
"You know, you might have more luck in another part of town."
People around here are barely putting food on the table.
"It's not they don't have good hearts, you understand?"
I just don't want my neighbours feeling badly for having to say no to you.
"Of course, it's very thoughtful."
- Thank you for your time.
- Have a good day.
- (coins clinking) - (door closing)
"I started when the poor boy's body was found, and I'm working backwards from there."
I'm down to 1890.
"It's very illuminating, sir, once you drop into the minutiae of it."
Here's a story about a sow that gave birth to 13 piglets.
Now that's a North Kawartha township record.
Very interesting.
"Sir, come look at this."
A farmer reports two British Home Children ran away from his employ:
The uncle.
That was your guy?
"No offence, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know?"
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.
- But I'll take your money!
Sure!
"- No, that offer has expired, yo."
It was kind of low anyways.
"But okay, okay, I'll take it."
"Just tell me what you need, all right?"
I'm easy.
I'm gonna keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
"All right, listen to me very carefully."
You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever.
But no deals with the DEA.
All right?
Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
"If he does, you're dead."
Why don't you just kill Badger?
"I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito is buzzing around you and it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the attorney."
You go grab a fly swatter.
"I mean, so to speak."
"I mean, all due respect, but do I have to spell this out for you?"
"- We're not killing Badger, yo!"
"- Then you got real problems, okay."
Because the DEA will come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.
"I don't think I'm going out on a limb here but, hey, he's not gonna like prison."
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion regardless of what you do to me.
Mr. Mayhew?
I recognise your cough.
"Take that mask off, you know."
No credit card or purchase receipts.
I guess he was a cash guy.
I mean if you can call a guy with $31.71 a sh guy.
His clothes were dockers from sears.
No judgments.
"The shirt is a large,the shoes are off-brand."
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.
"Like you wear,gibbs."
"You're fishin',abs."
Are they regular boxers?
Trunks?
Bikinis?
Nothing?
"Mr. Palmer,have you finished the chromatographic analysis of his volatile fatty acid?"
"Yes,doctor."
"Well,let's plug the numbers into the computer and let's how long our friend has been leaking into the topsoil."
"Agent gibbs will be here soon and he will ask... how'd the lance corporal die,doctor?"
"""How he died"" may take me a while."
"Try,""when did he die?"
""" That's my next question."
"That,I can answer."
It's a tricky calcution.
"One has to factor in temperature,soil acidity, and the variety and volume of insects who now call lance corporal finn their home."
Give me a round number.
"92 days,with a three-rcent margin of error."
"It would appear you deserted before you die gibbs,lance corporal finn's fianc?"
's upstairs.
She saw a report on the local news last night.
"W,doctor?"
"As soon as I know,you'll know."
"Her name is siri albert.She's 25, lives in manassas,and works a physical therapist."
Finn's fianc?
"All along I have tried merely to facilitate this poor girl's return, as your Major Sinclair can confirm."
Yes.
"Well, I'm glad you now accept my men were not responsible for the shootout."
The shootout?
"No, no, no, no, no."
Although there is still a fatal traffic incident about which we must question Mr Scott.
"If he can recover from his wounds, of course."
I understood he survived the surgery.
"So far, yes."
But complications do occur.
"- Hmm, may I visit him?"
"- Alas, no."
He is still under arrest.
"As for Mr Stonebridge and Mr Crawford, tomorrow we will send troops into the desert."
I only pray we find them before the bandits who have his daughter.
"It would be deeply regrettable if all my men brought back, were their two corpses."
"Rest assured, Minister, that if none of them make it back, then the photographs they took at the exchange"
will tell a story that I think most of us would rather keep private.
"Thank you, Minister."
Major.
"Yeah, I've got your back."
Move.
- What is it?
- Arakee.
Drink.
And then we shall eat.
"Come on, get it together."
Do you wish to know how much your father thinks you are worth?
I have no father.
You are all of his world.
He destroys worlds.
Like all men of violence.
- That's why they stopped and searched me on the road.
- They told me all about you.
- That must have been most interesting.
Most instructive.
I saw the same two in your room when you were having lunch.
- You did?
Why didn't you stop them?
- I thought it over.
One can't monkey about with Scotland Yard men.
I tried to tell you while you were having lunch but you fortunately stopped me.
Why was that fortunate?
Because the man you were having lunch with was another government chap.
He threatened to shoot me if I so much as look at you.
Thank you for telling me this.
"And, now, if you'll excuse me, I won't keep you any longer."
I'm in no hurry.
I haven't come to the most important thing yet.
Don't tell me there are more detectives on my trail.
"There probably are, hundreds."
"Black with them, for all I know."
I must give you one word of advice.
Will you give back those plans?
Get whatever it is you've stolen... and we'll trickle down together and just see those detectives.
- You're out of your mind.
- I'm not.
"I just love you, that's all."
"In fact, if you'll reform, I'll willingly consider marrying you."
- I suppose I should feel flattered.
- You certainly should.
I don't propose to every girl I meet.
Now put on your coat.
- Please leave my coat alone.
If I take that much energy out Of sam to follow my plan.
And it turns out That my plan was.
"Just a little bit halfassed In its architecture, then..."
"I mean, that's not cool."
"The first test buckets Are blanks,"
"But hoping to stake a claim He can work for years,"
Zeke's not giving up just yet.
We're gonna have to find a way.
To get a little further North of the hole.
You have to have faith That things are going.
To work out in the end.
"Following the geology, there's A lot of reason to believe."
That there might be A lot more gold out there.
Than anyone can Possibly imagine.
70 miles to the east...
We made it!
Hell yeah!
After an agonizing 13hour journey...
Whoo!
Kris kelly is within sight Of the bluff.
We barely made it.
"If this is half as good As everybody says it is,"
This is gonna be The greatest thing.
That's ever happened To me or my family.
Nobody has this opportunity.
"There's no chance in america You can go and say,"
"""Hey, you go do this, there,"
"And you're gonna make A million dollars."""
Nobody has that chance.
"Now, the only thing Kris has to do."
"Is figure out how to sleep, How to eat, how to mine,"
And how to avoid a mutiny.
- An elderly man blowing his hands.
Fore!
It landed near hole 6.
- Did I hit that family?
- They shouldn't bring the pram here.
"Go, go, go!"
We're in for it.
Take it easy.
- So Davis was wrong after all?
"- Well, I never did believe him."
And only a few yards from where he thought the tomb was.
- That's right.
"- Well, you deserve it, Monsieur Carter."
I shall come and inspect the tomb tomorrow.
This is a most excellent day for our department and for the country.
I shall arrange storage facilities at the Cairo Museum.
No.
It's far too early to involve the museum.
"Whatever we do, nothing must be rushed."
These things are precious.
I understand.
All care will be taken.
I'm putting together a team of experts.
I've already contacted the Metropolitan Museum as well as our own British specialists.
This is a huge task.
Please do not forget there are national interests to be considered.
That may be so but this must be preserved for all posterity.
That is far more important than the concerns of any single nation.
"And as His Lordship's field director, I intend to ensure that the correct procedures are followed at all times."
I hope that's clear.
"This is an Egyptian tomb, Monsieur Carter."
No more mozzarella mama...
Since I moved to LA I haven't really had a substantial boyfriend.
I seem to gravitate towards casual relationships of convenience.
Sometimes though I do wish for something more meaningful.
In Los Angeles most people feel like they've never actually arrived.
There's always this chase for something bigger and better.
Consequently no one puts down roots.
No one settles down.
It's like living in this state of perpetual vagrancy.
I want some roots... at least I think I do.
Oh my God did you... did you hear?
Maybe.
"2012, there is this huge planet that is going to crash into earth and kill... everyone!"

The planet... is called Nadie!

And I don't think I'm outing him by saying
Seven won't be taking any girls home.
It's all over the internet I'm obsessed with it.
I can't stop reading.
It's kind of scary don't you think?
I mean the end of the world Dale.
I don't know if I can sleep tonight?

Huh?
Come here.

Not trying to.

What is he claiming?
That mrs.

There's a chance of settlement.
I don't want to settle if it's going to leave a cloud of doubt over this hospital.
"Code zero,possible hijacking,assailants unknown."
You've got to move your belongings and find a permanent residence.
You don't have to respond to everything they throw at you.
"Yes,I do."
Maybe you can defend every action you've ever taken.
Some day you must tell me what that's like.

No other dance connects 2 people more closely than the tango.
Emotionally as well as physically.

Thought tennis was a gentleman's game.
"Hey,too bad you didn't break your arm before the match."
"Why don't you piss off,you dick!"
"Or would you like another forehead across the head, 'cause you broke the wrong arm."
Hold still.
That's the only shot you made today.
That's it.
Don't move.
I'm outta here.
You promised.
"No,I promised I'd get physical therapy not public humiliation."
Go ahead.
Ahem.
You say that the parlors and the dining saloons will be done in solid mahogany?
"Then, mr."
"Howard, all our furniture will be covered with empire plush an inch thick."
"That's right, gentlemen."
"Oh, excuse me, uncle."
Admiring our doorknobs?
No.
I was just coming to ask you if that thimble - rigging vanderbilt's got a hand in this.
The names of our directors will be announced shortly.
Are you in cahoots with that stonington crowd?
Hand and glove.
They've given us all their trade.
I heard you call me your enemy.
"Why, that there just stabbed me to the core."
I'm a pious man.
There ain't an ounce of hatred in my whole carcass.
"Why, mr."
"Fisk, i love my neighbor just as i love myself."
"In that case, uncle daniel, you won't harbor any grudge if we run you out of business."
I forgive you for the harsh words.

"Ahem, good day."
"You can't run boats no cheaper than me, because i'm losing money every day!"

"No, but I believe there's a natural order and a fine balance to life and if the rhythms are violated Oh fuck, Fuzz!"
I want you to stop seeing the wretched woman!
Do you hear me?
Most of the Eastern seaboard can!
I am going to report her to the school and she'll go to prison and you can visit her on weekends.
You can't stop us.
We love each other!

"Yes, he's good."
But you know that.
"Yeah, but he's very good, isn't he?"
I need to see more.
Goes by the name of Pica.
Formerly known as Denny Lorton.
These are Lorton's?
How recent?
"Who is he, first?"
"Who was he, you mean?"
"Prize student at Courtaulds, several major exhibitions, two paintings in the National Gallery."
"He was knocking on the door big-time, then he disappeared."
I thought he was dead.
He used to hang but he ain't been all right.
"You may not realize this, but some men prefer the company of women."
Who?
Howdy Doody?
He don't get no booty.
Maybe he's got himself a date with the Tuck Job.
Nah.
Your mother said she couldn't make it.
Reznik talk...
You okay?
Don't I look okay?
If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Deja vu?
You're tired.
Billions of lives are at risk on Earth if our mission fails.
I'm well aware of that.
These Xindi are innocent.
"If we let them die, we'll be proving to the others that they're right about us."
"I don't know much about Vulcan ethics, but humans don't throw morality out the window when things start getting a little rough."
Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Reed also believe that this would compromise our mission.
Your opinions have been noted.
"Now, get back to Enterprise and start the antimatter transfer."
"I'm sorry, Captain, I can't obey that order."
"You may not be wearing a uniform, but you can still be charged with insubordination."
Perhaps we should contact Starfleet and discuss this with Admiral Forrest.
You're relieved as First Officer.
Major... escort T'Pol back to the ship and confine her to her quarters.
-Sir...?
-I gave you an order.
Ma'am...?
- His words exactly.
You tried to drown yourself.
"- No, boss."
- A hundred yards out.
Pitch-black.
You were drowning yourself and in the course of drowning yourself
- you swam into our bloated blacksmith.
"- No, boss."
"- Yes, boss."
"You know what that will get you, Katherine McVitie?"
100 lashes.
"You might think your life miserable now, but it will be a lot worse after 100 lashes."
How dare you do this to me?
How dare you prefer death?
Get out.
- sir.
I get sick of hummus after four bites.
"Max, we have to take charge of this."
Because whatever bridesmaid's dress Sophie picks is like a Tyler Perry movie.
I don't have to see it to know it's gonna be awful.
"We'll find something classy, and beautiful, and just shove it down her throat."
Who's shoving what down whom?
"And if you don't have a story, I do."
"John, Max and I got roped into being bridesmaids."
Stop.
You had me at rope.
You lost me at bridesmaids.
"I'll be at the hostess stand, looking at dresses and silently wishing for an asteroid to wipe us off the planet."
"If wishes made things happen, we'd been in the middle of a zombie apocalypse right now."

"Coming up, a cat fight over a parking spot, [struggles] Get off of me!"
- And...
- I'm gonna kill you all!
A criminal gets his slate wiped clean.
[Screams]
What is your problem?
Bitch!
"You know, there are some things that just aren't worth fighting for."
- Don't touch me!
"- Right, that's it!"
Like a parking spot.
But don't tell that to Brenda.
"When it came to the road, she was a ticking time bomb."
"The whole parking lot, and there's not one frickin' spot!"
"For people who truly experience intermittent explosive disorder, there usually is an escalation of events, so someone cutting you off in traffic, or taking your parking spot, may not seem like a big deal to you or me,"
"but for someone with this disorder, uh, it flips them into a state that they can't control."
[Sighs]
[Growls]
Then Amy slipped into a spot she'd been patiently waiting for.
"Oh, hell no!"
And Brenda went off.
"Well, are you gonna move your car?"
What the hell?
What are gonna do?
"This is my boss' car, you crazy lady!"
Maybe you should tell your boss why you didn't move your car.
What is your problem?
- Ah!
- I said get-- get off of me!
That's how two chicks start fighting over a parking spot.
[Struggling]
"Well, not to be impolite, but, you know, sometimes a gal will be kissin' around on, like, the area near your genitals, but not quite on your genitals."
Makes me ticklish and insecure.
"You know, not to be impolite, but sometimes a gal will do some kissin' on the ears, which makes me uncomfortable, because even though I clean my ears, sometimes a tater will just roll out of there unexpected."
(CHUCKLES)
I kind of likes both those things.
"Yeah, it's why you're called ""Squirrely Dan."""
"Yeah, reason fuckin' five million."
"Well, nots to be impolite, but..."
This gal suggested that maybe I should have some attentions paid
to my butts hole.
That ever...
Ever happen to you guys?
Did you ever have a gal suggest that you need some attentions paid
to your butts holes?
"I'll take that as a hard no, I guess?"
She put a couple of fingers up there and...
It turns out you got a...
An erogenous zone up there.
Found...
Found the hot button and...
"Gaves it a tickle and, uh..."
Yeah.
"Feels, uh..."
"It feels pretty good, you guys, okay?"
- Pop fly.

It felt...
Felt very natural.
Nice.

The cult made these paintings of Atlantis based on descriptions from the platinum book itself.
It must have been paradise.
Yes.
"Torch of Truth, I presume."
"Yes, that's right."
Yes.
It doesn't tell us much.
What does it look like?
"Well, nobody knows exactly."
"I mean, these are the only visual representations that I've seen."
"Well, how can we find the Torch if we don't know what it looks like?"
"Well, Solon says that it's the mirror of the world, reflecting the past, present, and future."
"Professor, you said the cult was driven out by the Romans."
"Yes, the ones that weren't killed uh, fled with the Ark."
But they thought Solon was coming back for the Torch someday.
"Yes, that's right."
"That's right, yes."
"Well, maybe they hid it where they figured only he could find it."
Maybe.
Is this the same writing that's on the Ark?
"Yes, yes, this is the, uh, riddle of Solon."
These streaks look like rust.
Iron ore.
The altar's magnetic.
Let's check it out.
Wow.
I got accepted to Florida University.
"You mean to tell me, that you got in without hacking into the computer system... and making it all happen like you usually do?"
"All by myself, just like a big boy."
I see you guys later.
Where are you going?
What's wrong man?
Time to celebrate!
Touchy subject.
"""What are we all doing tonight?"""
Katie.
"Katie, you work at Hybra Tech don't you?"
I bet you see all sorts of examples of these scientific processes.
"Actually, I work in the monitoring station in security."
Hybra Tech is a classic example of a company... whose goods and services constantly udelices... the scientific discovery processes.
"They create almost everything, from processed cheese to napalm."
A very unfortunate part in the scientific processes is failure.
"In simple terms, you can not make a omelette without breaking a few eggs"
Where are you going?
Get back to your seat please.
What is going on here?
Julian parents was 2 of the volunteers that died last year at Hybra Tech... they where in a car-wreck.
Julian!
wait.
She didn't know.
It's cool...
They been on my mind a lot lately.
It's been really hard on my brother too.
I am so sorry.
Thanks...
I'll be alright.
"Well, well, well..."
What have we here?
"However, I see you have no such doubts."
"I shall miss you, my dear boy."
But do not hurry back on my account.
Fear worked like yeast in my thoughts.
"And the fermentation brought to the surface in great gobs of scum, the images of disaster."
"A loaded gun, held carelessly at a stile... a horse rearing and rolling over... a shaded pool with a submerged stake a car at a blind corner."
All the catalogue of threats to civilised life rose and haunted me.
I even pictured a homicidal maniac mouthing in the shadows swinging a length of lead pipe.
"Tickets, please, sir."
"- Brideshead, sir?"
- Yes.
Lady Julia's waiting in the yard.
Thank you.
- You're Mr Ryder?
- Yes.
Jump in.
- How is he?
"- Oh, he's fine."
- Have you had dinner?
"- Yes, on the train."
"Well, I expect it was beastly."
There's some more at home.
Sebastian and I are alone so we thought we'd wait for you.
- But what happened to him?
- Didn't he say?
I expect he thought you wouldn't come if you knew.
He cracked a bone in his foot so tiny that it hasn't a name.
But they X-rayed it yesterday and told him to keep it up for a month.
"It's a great bore to him, putting out all his plans."
He's been making the most enormous fuss.
Everybody else has gone.
At first he tried to make me... stay back with him.
"Nowhere at all, gunfighter."
You done killed yourself a set of perfectly good saddlebags that cost me eight Yankee dollars in gold.
And if you didn't kill my last pint of... of water between me and the angels.
Where did you ever learn to shoot?
"In a better school than you did, fortunately."
"I don't usually miss, friend."
"Neither do I, and I better straighten you out on one thing."
I am no friend of yours.
Here.
Just here.
"That'll be dry, too."
"Worth one, but it's gonna be dry, too."
I gotta admire you for finding them at all.
You must have some Apache blood in you.
"That Silmser, he was from my own part of west Texas."
I liked the man.
I'll bet you did.
I bet you cried when you staked him out on the ground.
Here.
"Well, Tyree..."
I just don't have the inclination or the breath to offer you the water a second time.
"Friend, I could say I don't want any."
"I could say that I don't want any because if I'd have shot straight,"
I wouldn't have these...
these chains on my wrist.
Or your company.
"Just my own pleasant solitude to die in, huh?"
I could say that.
"Or I could say that... that I don't want it, because I'm too proud to be given something that, in reality,"
I'm gonna take!
You have a bad disposition... and a big mouth.
"Like I told you, I am no friend of yours."
I have to get out of this as soon as possible.
My kids are still young...
They would be shocked if they knew their dad was suspected of murder.
"I just remembered, it's my oldest daughter's birthday today."
And it's just going to pass by like this.
Even though us meeting at Chung Gye Plan was an ill-fated relationship...
What was an ill-fated relationship?
We... got along like blood brothers.
We did?
- When?
"- Wow, seriously..."
"But I was thankful that you gave me 150,000 won more than the others..."
So I will repay you with this favor.
Hey...
Thanks.
"For us, as a life mentor and his apprentice..."
"We shared a lot with each other, don't you think?"
- When?
"- Oh, seriously..."
There will be moments when you suddenly remember these things...
I will go with Chan Gyu tomorrow morning.
We've been working together all along.
The remaining one percent that's crawling out...
I have that too.
"Anything I'm doing with Jung Yeon, I know I can do to the best of my ability."
What?
How should we understand this relationship?
What is there to understand?
We're friends.
"Well, more than friends..."
"I guess we should say, best friends?"
Aren't we all friends now?
"Mate, I don't know how much you know about that part of the world but they treat women in a very degrading way."
Dealing with you must have made a nice change for her.
She noshed me off for free so that tells you something.
"Yeah, it certainly does."
Lenny wants it done at the airfield.
"Problem is, isn't there a lot of CCTV down there?"
"Entrances, lobbies."
"Exit to runways, manager's office."
There's a blind spot in the toilets which could be a good thing.
It's the one thing everyone does before they get on a plane.
Didn't you say the front entrance was covered?
"Yeah, I can get you in a different way."
How?
Did a Duke of Edinburgh climbing course on my pupil referral unit.
What was my nickname inside?
"Spider, right?"
Not the nickname I heard.
Grantham Hill Private Airfield
We're done.
I'm gonna go and stay with my sister now.
I assume that we never meet again which is a tragedy I'll just have to learn to live with.
Here are the keys to the flat.
We're not finished yet.
"We had an agreement, Lenny."
"Yeah, but I think you overestimated your ability to insist on dealbreakers though."
You gave me an undertaking
To review.
So consider it under review.
OK.
Fine.
"Send me back to prison, then, please."
We can do that.
It is feasible.
I know that wasp venom has a pheromone in it that signals other members of the hive to attack.
Of course one question still stands.
"If this is a pheromone, then how did it get into their bloodstreams?"
Are you kidding me?
People will try anything if they think it's going to get them high.
"Remember a few years ago, people were licking the backs of cane toads?"
Do I!
Awful things.
"So, this substance, it could ostensibly be attracting the insects."
"It is possible, but to be sure"
I need to be able to run some tests with a pure sample.
"All right, I'll get on it."
"Oh, hey, did you have any luck with that thing you were working on the other day?"
What thing?
"The Jane Doe, you and Mike."
"Yes, we were able to get an ID off her dental records."
You going to tell me or what?
Why wouldn't I tell you?
"It's, uh..."
Gabriel Claremont.
"Oh, okay."
The thing I'm not supposed to tell you is that this may have something to do with Henry Fitzroy.
"Oh, trust me."
"According to her agent, Miss Claremont had a photo shoot three days ago."
Nobody's heard from her since.
So the last person to see her would be the photographer.
I'm still working on that.
I did however find the address to the studio.
Do you want to go check it out?
- I'll get my coat.
- Okay.
"It was wrong, sir."
I did it without thinking.
"It got me in trouble, which I accept full responsibility for."
"It made trouble for the Navy, which I would fix if I could, but I can't."
And it got Fanny in terrible trouble.
Her life is at risk for wanting to be with me.
I'm sorry about all of it.
I really am.
How long has the cord been prolapsed?
"Since right before we called you, Dr. Chadway."
Foetal heart rate is falling again.
- She had an epidural?
- Two hours ago.
All right.
Prepare for a C-section.
- Bud!
- The head's too far down.
Get me a vacuum and call Neonatal for resuscitation at delivery.
"I'll take it from here, Dr. Chadway."
"- Where have you been, Dr. Gettis?"
- With another patient.
"Okay, Harriet, the next contraction, get ready to push."
Petty Officer Elling.
Would you and your counsel please stand?
You may announce the sentence.
"Petty Officer Third Class James Elling, in consideration of your plea of guilty to all charges and specifications and your declared remorse, this court-martial sentences you to be reduced to the rank of seaman and to forfeit $500 pay per month for three months."
"Members, thank you for your service."
This court-martial is adjourned.
- No brig time?
- No brig time.
"I gotta go see Fanny, sir."
"Yes, you do."
Carson and fuckin' Carson.
"So, if any of you want to go over to Teddy's and help rearrange deck chairs for ten dollars and a sandwich, you know where the fucking door is."
Money is your fucking enemy.
"The desire for money, I get it."
"Who doesn't want something tangible for all their hard work, huh?"
"But you don't get paid until the job is done, period."
"That desire, that hunger, that's what keeps you fuckers awake!"
And raw enough to still feel the pain that delivered you to my doorstep in the first place!
"When I was a little kid, we raised chickens, hmm?"
And chicks break out of their shells.
That's what gives them their strength.
"If someone helps them, they die."
"You may think you're doing them a favor, but that struggle, that is how they survive."
"Now, that's a fucking analogy."
Fuck off.
Y'all know where I stand now.
You decide where you fucking stand.
Goldie.
You got a second?
"Oh, I am through begging you to give a shit."
[lighter clicks] [footsteps leaving] [dance music playing]
"Hey, any chance you can help me with that rewrite tonight?"
"Oh, shit."
Um...
"I can't, I...gotta fucking work at the deli."
You're a tough guy to nail down.
What's good for you?
It's just one sketch.
Um... [hums]
"I don't know, let me-- I'll just--"
I'll--I'll look at my schedule and I'll get back to you.
"You're not gonna help me, are you?"
No.
Just not to eat beef.
"If my behaviour was improper, I should be sensible of it."
It has caused impertinent remarks.
Do you not doubt your discretion?
"If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove impropriety, we are all offending."
"Good morning, Colonel."
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Marianne.
I come to issue an invitation.
A picnic on my estate at Delaford.
If you would care to join us on Thursday next.
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband are travelling up especially.
"We should be delighted, Colonel."
"I will, of course, be including Mr. Willoughby in the party."
I should be delighted to join you.
"Good morning, Miss Dashwood."
"Good morning, Colonel."
The colonel has invited us to Delaford.
- I hear you have a fine pianoforte.
- A Broadwood Grand.
- Then I shall play for you all.
- We shall look forward to it.
- Your sister seems very happy.
- She does not hide her emotions.
Her romantic prejudices tend to set propriety at naught.
- She is wholly unspoilt.
- Rather too unspoilt.
"The sooner she is acquainted with the ways of the world, the better."
I knew a lady with the same sweetness of temper -
- Who was forced into a better acquaintance with the world.
The result was only ruination and despair.
- What are you going to do?
Wait!
"Sorry, I didn't want to make you wait."
"No, no, I arrived early."
- Are you alright?
- Well...
"Sorry, really..."
"Don't worry, maybe there's still time, let's go..."
- Febo!
- Sorry to meet you here.
We're conducting a study on extreme wounds.
We needed test subjects.
To learn how to treat battle wounds.
These were stray dogs.
They would have been killed anyway.
Febo...
"It's not allowed, but I'll put it to sleep."
"It's a sweet, painless sleep."
Why this dreadful silence?
We anesthetize them.
"Don't worry, Mrs. Wyatt, nothing is gonna fall from the ceiling."
We eat here every day.
It is an honor to have a young American guest with us.
Thanks.
The U.S. Army has the same stimulating aroma... as a summer rain in the woods.
Maybe it's the woods still in you.
"It's the way the wind blows, I'm sure."
It's the only occupation army in the history of Naples... that had the courtesy of knocking on our doors... before coming in.
"Judging by the ruins I saw, I think we knocked too strongly."
"That, dear, is an insignificant detail."
"If one has to lose a war, Mrs Wyatt... it is better to be conquered by an army... that has good manners, believe me."
The Duchess is still recovering... from the Barbarian's raid into Imperial Rome.
"It was a bit dicey there for a minute, but then they gave me a shot."
Now I'm pumped!
"Okay, Nick."
Let's see what this baby can do.
I'm way ahead of you.
"Okay, you're at nine centimeters."
"Hey, when European guys measure their penis, do they get to use centimeters?"
'Cause that would sound a lot more impressive.
"Hey, let's go easy on the penis talk down there."
"The point is, you're not quite there yet."
This is not quite there?
!
"I know this sounds hard to believe, but I think the baby has a knife!"
"Well, it is a rough neighborhood."
"Now, listen to me, baby."
What's the rush?
"The next time you're going to be anywhere near one of those things is after the bar closes, and all the good-looking guys have already gone home."
"My son is going to be very handsome, and he will be taking ladies home early and often, but he won't try anything, because that's just the kind of guy he is."
Guess who's here?
Yay!
Yay!
Where's Zack?
He and Nick left before us.
I thought he'd be here.
"I am aware that you're anxious, but I do not have a spotless driving record by accident."
It's just five more blocks.
And that is statistically when most accidents occur.
I really think Zack should be here because this thing's kicking my ass from the inside out.
"Doctor, what should we do?"
Hold her.
Talk to her.
Tell her something to distract her.
"You see, it's important having a system."
"When one creates a system, he doesn't need every piece of data on his disposal."
The system is what counts.
It shows everything.
"You've heard about probability and statistics, have you?"
It never fails.
"For me, the most important is to know the number of crimes in Zagreb."
The quantity of each type.
Where they happened.
The newspapers only prove something that I already know in my own way.
"Strange, isn't it?"
"No, no..."
Statistics is generally...
How far are you ready to go?
"You mean, in depth or width?"
- Well...
"In width, for instance."
"You see, I have data for Trnje."
I begun from here.
"I have an insight into quarters, streets, houses..."
Almost the apartments.
"Maybe it's too ambitious speaking about this, but maybe it should be expanded to whole Zagreb and its suburbia."
"I have a lot of data about that, too."
And then even wider.
"Say Dubrovnik, Split, Rijeka, Osijek, Varaždin, etc."
That's fantastic!
What about the depth?
What may be the depth of it?
That's more of a philological question!
The question is: what's a crime?
What should be considered an offense?
I thought you were taking the basis of law into account.
Stop it!
"Stop it, stop it."
Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!
So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy.
Either the morphine kills him or the pain does.
- You're condoning this?
!
I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.
That'll make you feel better.
Joe has a new symptom.
Hyperalgesia.
The infection's spreading to the pain center of the brain.
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
"His brain's telling him that his whole body's in pain, and because of the location, the painkillers do nothing."
Suit up.
Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.
What if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell?
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.
Did you find any cedarwood anywhere?
"No, but maybe... maybe what?"
"Maybe somebody could go back, take a second look?"
And why aren't you pissed off that cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?
Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?
I decided you were wrong.
"God, you're weak."
Guy steals your article... tells you you're not his friend... and you still want to risk your life for him.
Foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.
Yeah.
"God, you're weak."
Guy tried to kill you.
First thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back.
- Yeah.
I also.
Why did you come back?
And you risked all this?
I was once a slave.
"I dreamed of it, like a free man walking on ice."
No matter how many men tried to pull that dream out of my mind.
I hid it deep in my heart.
And now as a free man I walk on the ice.
I found myself chained to this beautiful flower.
"And she deserved more, like my simple dream."
This is not a place where the soul of a child can flourish.
Your wife spoke of a magnificent place in the west.
Where the ice must melt.
And the seasons have agreed for decades.
It is a myth.
Anyone who has gone to look for him never came back.
Would you have returned from this place if you had discovered something beautiful?
Only a small flower changes the course of humanity
And the opinions of a man.
Your wife promised to show me the way to this place.
The next day she was dead.
The promise of Selegna Sol died with her
Do not.
She hid the coordinates deep into my DNA.
"Somehow, my intuition pushed me to find out."
Selegna Sol.
"It's a pretty long night, on the other side of the world"
It will be the journey of life.
Trajan will send the Spartans to hunt you down.
Not if he thinks I'm dead.
This is one of the original prototypes of the Ash-300 series.
"Gosh, what's this?"
You're really spoiling me.
Three days running.
"Well, you know."
It gives me a chance to try some things
I'd never bother with just for myself.
So tuck in.
"I know, but it's time I got my act together."
"I don't want you coming round here every night, do I?"
Whatever.
"So, how's life in the newsroom?"
"Oh, I don't know, Alice."
I think you get too close to it all sometimes.
"You know, we had this op-ed piece today a guy had written about the threat being posed to world peace by the militant Christian right."
"And this is a retired bishop, I have to say."
"And a veteran CND campaigner, you know, the still small voice of calm."
"It was 2,000 words and the editor spiked it 'cause he didn't want to offend the majority of our readers who probably do believe, and I'm quoting, ""The West has a God-given franchise"
"""to impose its creed upon every nation."""
I know.
-War is heck.
-Sorry?
I'm quoting.
"People who can't say the word ""hell"" but have no problem creating it."
"Now, this is delicious."
I sincerely hope that you'll be staying over again tonight.
Is that okay?
Save you the trouble of driving me back.
"Absolutely, and..."
I can have another glass of wine.
Do you know what I was thinking about the other day?
The first time we shared a bed together.
"Oh, God."
I can't do what you're asking.
"- If they take him, my son will die."
"Miriam, I think you should leave now."
Save my child.
She won't be the last.
The County Organiser thought we had little choice but to close due to catastrophic loss of membership.
"She had been in touch with Joyce but Joyce has refused to return, which means none of her supporters will either."
She suggested we join our nearest Institute for the duration.
Did she explain how we're to cover 16 miles there and back on bicycle?
"At night, with military vehicles charging all over the place?"
She did not.
So that's it.
"Either way, Joyce has got what she wanted."
The closure of the WI.
"Well, then, not if we attract more members."
How are we going to do that?
"In all honesty, I've no idea."
But that doesn't mean we give up.
I should be getting back.
- And me.
You did what you thought was the right thing to do.
Up to a point.
Then I acted on impulse and made the situation intractably worse.
Me and my big mouth strike again.
"Well, I happen to love you and your big mouth."
"Thank you, Peter."
That makes me feel...
marginally better.
Cookie says supper will be five minutes while the beef rests.
"Thank you, Claire."
Is there something else?
- I just want to thank you... for letting me come and work here after Mrs Cameron let me go.
All those men were fighting over who could buy me a drink.
"Oh, what happened to your eye?"
I got lemon juice and grease in it.
"Oh, poor Joy."
"Poor, poor Joy."
Wonderful evening.
Have you ever had five men buy you drinks?
"Please, I've had six, often seven."
Just let me do the talking.
I've flirted my way out of dozens of tickets.
"What seems to be the problem, officer?"
Your blinker's been on for the last 5 Miles.
"I'm sorry, officer."
We're trying to get to the hospital for my poor sister's eye.
"Wow, you have a beautiful accent."
- Oh.
- We have the exact same accent.
Would you like an escort to the hospital?
"No, we're fine."
We have an excellent navigation system.
"I'll let you go with a warning, but drive safe, okay?"
You're carrying precious cargo.
Did I just flirt my way out of your ticket?
Thrilling.
You don't seem very happy for me.
"Of course I am, although, thinking about it, being hot isn't for everyone, which makes me wonder if, on some level, you wouldn't be happier back in the convent."
But I don't want to go back to the convent.
I'm having fun.
"Maybe, but it doesn't suit you."
"Oh, my goodness, you're jealous 'cause I'm blossoming and you're wilting."
You just can't stand the idea of not being the prettiest woman in the room.
"Well, you know what?"
So let's find it.
There was another one...
Sammy park... an overdose two years ago.
The kid was 15. here on a full scholarship.
Physics.
"Carl, the admissions director?"
He's got solid alibis.
"Yeah, he's hiding something."
And you know that how?
Five decades in uniform is how I know.
Same way I knew that you busted my car window playing ball even though you said you didn't.
I didn't bust it playing ball.
I hit it with a bat.
How the hell did you put a bat through a window playing ball?
When you do it on purpose.
[Inhales sharply] This physics prodigy... he was seeing the school therapist.
Maybe he said something in session that will help us.
You hit my Chevy on purpose.
You made Mom cry.
"If you've got a problem with a man, you go to him."
You don't take a bat to his car.
I was 8 years old.
I knew you lied about that window.
"Well, it looks like you two are in the right place."
"Exceptional people like Sammy... they're hard on themselves to begin with, and when you push them to see how far that genius can go, the stress here can be unbearable."
But he sought out treatment.
"Well, we're understaffed."
"At most, I saw him once a week."
"I mean, it wasn't enough."
"Emotionally, he was like a child."
Did he ever mention any of those names in that file there?
Did he ever mention a Kevin Whitfield?
Not the best vantage point.
There's your escape exit.
"Yeah,except he didn't want that."
He needs to watch the show.
This is the moment he's been waiting for all year.
One where he doesn't feel inadequate or rejected.
So he watches as long as he can.
"Yeah,but fire's unpredictable."
Every second in here he's putting his own life at risk.
And this guy's obviously confident that he can get out of here before it's too late.
But there was a fire alarm.
My men were here in 5 minutes.
- And he knew it.
- How?
This unsub doesn't leave anything to chance.
He knows exactly how long he's got with his victims.
He probably knows response times or at least listens to them.
"all units,be advised of a robbery in progress at 9760 east mills."
this is your man dj cutz with an instant blast.
The feds are in town cracking down on this year's devil's night.
So i'd advise everyone to stay off of the streets and keep them radios locked to fm 99 detroit.
"the first time i looked at these victims on the map, none of it made sense."
"7 different victims,various ages,sex,and ethnicity."
- What do you see now?
- The first victim...
- Often tells us the most.
- Tommy proctor.
"Well,his rap sheet is longer than the nile."
It looks like he's always walked on the dark side.
The first kill inspired him.
What's different about it?
Two things.
"Well, I'm sorry you took such a risk to hear bad news."
"Well, that isn't why I came."
I wanted to see how far the flood level's fallen.
Why?
"I had hoped we could tunnel in from the lower city and lay mines under the Magnetrix terminal, but the floodwater's too high."
"In the early days of the fighting, we blew the reservoirs."
The terminal is their communication centre?
"If we could knock it out, they'd be isolated."
Couldn't you infiltrate an assault group?
Or is it too heavily defended?
"It's not defended, but the city's sealed off."
- What is it?
- Sealed off.
About 100 years ago they sealed off the old monorail.
"Hunda, if you could find it..."
I know where it runs.
It's still shown on the plans.
You could bring an army in through there right into the heart of the city.
You're right.
We could destroy the terminal and their command HQ in one strike.
We'll win this war yet!
I must get back to my column.
I don't think we'll meet again.
I hope you get the information you need.
"- Oh, and, Leitz."
- Yes?
Remember to keep your head down when we come in.
What's the information you need?
We've come to learn what we can about the new drug the Federation's using.
Pylene-50.
What do you want to know?
(Alarm beeping)
We were terrified.
"My parents woke us up in the dead of night, told us we were leaving and never coming home."
"But they also told us not to be frightened, because they were bringing along this weathered old steamer trunk that contained everything we needed to be protected from danger."
And what was in it?
It didn't matter.
We felt protected.
You grew up in D.C.?
"Mm, I moved around a lot, like you."
I was a military brat.
Did you find that hard- adjusting to all the moves?
- At first.
But my dad bought me a little souvenir postcard every city we went to.
That made me feel like home.
"I know it sounds silly-- a postcard from the place you just moved to, but from a guy like my dad, who had trouble showing emotion..."
I knew it didn't come easily.
Does he still send you postcards?
Not anymore.
I seem to have lost track of the time.
I'm late for this meeting.
What was that you said about balancing business and pleasure?
I'll be back at the house in an hour.
"In the meantime, try the plantains."
They put the croquetas to shame.
What are you doing?
You here for pleasure?
I had to come look for you.
"Come on, let's go."
Get in.
Glad you called.
"I've had this line scrubbed and back-checked, and I'm clear to talk on my end."
Can you speak freely?
You can.
I was a guy.
I didn't want to spend Sundays in the kitchen with my mom.
And you know what she said?
She told me that some day I would realize that taking care of people is not masculine or feminine.
It's a privilege and it's an honor.
And she was right.
And one day I realized that politics is about the privilege and the honor of taking care of people.
"Of making certain that the weak are protected, the poor are sheltered and the hungry fed."
"My mother passed away six years ago, but I work every day to honor her memory in politics and in my kitchen."
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.
It's good to see you.
Thank you.
I appreciate the support.
Good to see you.
Weren't you impressed?
You were talking to Republican women.
"What do you think, they were gonna storm the stage?"
This is your first week.
Shouldn't you be kissing up?
There is nothing sexier than a man who loves his mom.
I'm glad you enjoyed the speech.
You are so much better looking in person than you are on C-SPAN.
Nobody looks good on C-SPAN.
Believe me.
It's the lighting.
"Oh, those baby-blues, cheekbones that can cut glass, financials are impeccable."
I have to rate you a 94.5.
I have to take off something for the divorce.
Thank goodness you were not the cheater.
- I'm sorry.
- Of course.
"If it were easy or... aesthetically pleasing, then everyone would do it."
You and I are aligned in our ambitions.
My life's work is transformation.
"I can give you the freedom you desire, but you will need to trust my methods, unorthodox though they may seem."
Everything that happens at Rosewood... is done of one's own free will.
If you're brave and you're willing I can help you become the person that you wish to be.
"Are you brave, Miss Isabel Porter?"
- I want to be.
Yes.
- Good.
Come in.
"Miss Oaks, Dr. Lemelle."
- We're going to be moving you into new quarters.
- May I ask why?
- Dr. Cairn believes that the first step in your rehabilitation is to cast aside old vanities.
"- You're ashamed, yes?"
- Uh...
"- Oh, dear, that is precisely the point."
- Shame is a fallacy imposed upon us by society.
It needs to be excised from the mind like any malignant disease.
- Indeed.
It's time that you demonstrated some responsibility for your own treatment.
- I will do whatever it takes.
- Will you?
- Of course.
- Good.
Doctor.
"- Ah, thank you, Gunther."
- Miss Porter.
- What is this?
- This is your new concoction.
Transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready.
Understood.
There's nothing more important than the success of this mission.
"-Do you agree, Major?"
"-Of course, sir."
My senior officers don't seem to understand what I'm trying to do here.
ARCHER:
I guess I have myself to blame.
ARCHER:
"In the past, I've encouraged them to ask questions... but we don't have time for that now."
I need officers who respect the chain of command and can follow orders.
"It won't be a problem, sir."
ARCHER:
I thought what happened with T'Pol... might have been an isolated incident but I'm not so sure now.
Lieutenant Reed destroyed a ship that could have helped us.
I'm starting to wonder if he deliberately tried to sabotage this mission.
You're in command while I'm on the surface.
You answer to me and me alone.
"Is that understood, Major?"
"-Perfectly, sir."
-That'll be all.
[Solemn instrumental music]
TRIP:
"Can we talk to you, sir?"
ARCHER:
What is it?
I'd like you to go to Sickbay with Phlox.
Do I look sick to you?
Hoshi says you ordered her to transmit a distress call.
That's right.
Don't you think that's a little dangerous?
We'll be light-years from here before the Xindi respond to it.
I just want to... stick him in the freezer.
Maybe thaw him out later when I'm ready to deal with him.
"That's a... that's a horrible thing to say, isn't it?"
Yes.
Oh.
But the horrible things they're... things that need to be said.
Can I ask you question?
Shoot.
Where the hell is Cooper?
"He's busy saving a patient, trying to make up for the fact that he didn't save you."
What?
Is he... blaming himself for... except for the part he blames on me.
I called him that night.
I was the reason he didn't walk in that door and save you.
I guess you owe me.
Tammy has a very rare tumor on her ovary called an ectopic pheochromocytoma.
"It intermittently releases an excess of adrenaline,"
"Causing a rise in heart rate, blood pressure,"
"All leading to fear, anger and Tammy's sudden rages."
"And, Michelle, nothing that you did or do not do"
During pregnancy caused this.
"But we found it, which means we can fix it."
"Yeah, I can remove it laparoscopically."
Without the need for a large incision.
"Which means at all those moods that you've been feeling, they should stop."
"All this time, I've been blaming myself."
I can't believe it.
You're gonna be okay.
But dad isn't.
But you cannot feel guilty for something you couldn't control.
But I do.
"And taking out this tumor, it won't change that."
Give away classified information about a top secret operation?
Yes.
They will believe you.
"If I'm right, this could decide the fate of your navy or perhaps the fate of this country Chosun."
Why me?
Why are you asking me to do such an important task?
I gave you that answer when I gave you the galleys.
All right.
Let's do this.
The people of this country will be deeply grateful.
What is it?
It's a secret memo from Yi Soon-shin to Kwon Yul.
What's the content?
He will launch a second attack on Wekyo Fort on the 18th and seeks assistance of the ground troops.
Yi Soon-shin is launching a second attack on Konishi?
This is our chance.
We can strike Yi from the rear and save my father-in-law.
Oh?
But why was this boy going to Gon-yang?
"And of all roads to chose from, why by way of our camp?"
Take him and find out.
And send a few men to Gon-yang.
Are the contents of the letter accurate?
I don't know anything.
Why did you land on our beach?
I was swept off course by a storm.
Why were you headed to Gon-yang?
Don't you know anything?
General Kwon Yul is in Gon-yang assembling an army.
"You're not an adjutant or a special agent, but you were assigned to deliver classified information to the Field Marshal."
That's unlike Yi Soon-shin.
You were sent here to deceive us.
She isnt iII-mannered.
Shejust told you what the truth was.
That poor girl didnt know that you people would get..
..so irritated after knowing the truth!
"ItII be better if you talk clearly, instead of confusing us."
"If you hate us so much, then why have you kept.."
..relations with us from so many years!
?
"Because he promised your mother, when she was.."
"..about to die, that he will never let her children cry but."
.. but he didnt know that one day..
..those children will make him weep!
He did so much for you!
You forgot all that so soon!
"You are forgetting, sister-in-Iaw."
"He got those 13 thousand rupees, which he invested.."
"..in business and succeeded, after selling.."
"..that hut, and that hut didnt belong to him.."
..but to our mother.
"Whatever he did for us was not a favor, but it was his duty."
"Dont feel bad, sister-in-Iaw."
"Anyway, whateverthey are.."
"..doing, they are doing it for you both, forthis family."
You indeed eat food twice a day..
..but have you everthought who pays forthat?
"We are doing how much we can, sister-in-Iaw.."
..but brother shouldnt snatch our peace from us.
I dont want to snatch anything from you..
..but I amjust snatching a right from you today.
Janki.
No one will conduct my final riots from among these two.
"Anyway brother, this right is not meant for us.."
They do.
They record everyone that comes to the door.
"But it's got such a small hard drive, so, once it's full, it just records over itself."
So it's useless.
"Well, no, not exactly."
Stuff doesn't actually disappear.
It just gets jumbled.
I was able to plug in this facial recognition software to isolate the times that Aldo came to the house.
Is that him?
I can't see it.
"Oh, uh, that's because you're not looking at Aldo."
You're looking at what's behind him.
I'm trying to isolate the car that was following him.
AUBREY:
"Well, that's a few too many times to be a coincidence."
"Yeah, agreed."
Now we just have to figure out who was driving it.
BRENNAN:
Ms. Warren.
You wanted to see me?
"I was reexamining the spinal column, and I found these fractures on the C1 and C2."
They suggest that the vertebrae were severely displaced.
Which indicates a hyperflexion fracture.
The neck was snapped at the C2 vertebra.
That would cause complete paralysis of all muscles below the brain stem.
Yes.
"The lungs cease functioning, resulting in a complete loss of oxygen to the brain."
Cause of death wasn't exsanguination.
It was this fracture.
"Uh, Dr. Brennan."
Yes?
Didn't your father come back into your life after spending years as a fugitive?
"""Mr. Black Eagle, who had been petitioning for some time..."""
"""to be allowed to participate in the race."""
A mysterious aviator?
Look at this face!
Who else could this be other than Moriarty?
"He is going after the prize of 1 00,000 crowns, Moriarty, that fiend!"
Trying to win the championship with a stolen engine... that's thoroughly unforgivable!
Mr. Mac Bain was always so kind to my late husband.
I would like to do something to help him in return.
You look very nice.
"I promise, I won't get in your way."
"In any event, I've already decided."
Well...
Well...uh...
Right...
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up and get us to Holland!
I will capture Moriarty with my own hands!
"Well, well."
"Mr. Holmes, your reputation precedes you."
Welcome to Holland.
"In terms of this Mr. Black Eagle, we've discussed whether we should... accept his entry or not."
However...
However?
Have you heard the old story from medieval times?
Where a mysterious cavalier came out of nowhere to participate... in a joust and won the title?
So you're saying that you accepted the mysterious pilot's entry... in honor of that cavalier.
Yes.
"But, Moriarty used foul means to..."
Do you have proof that Mr. Black Eagle is Moriarty?
"No, but..."
"Brothers, what's your opinion?"
We'll obey our chief!
"Fung-wu, why did you kill your master?"
I'm innocent!
"Those that have broken our regulations must be locked in the closet, no matter how senior he is."
But my master...
"Before I leave here, I hope you learn patience."
I knew your master well.
He was a friend.
"Fung-wu, I promise you I'll see what I can do."
Thanks!
His Highness has initiated a competition between Shaolin and Wu-tang to elect the ruler of the martial arts world.
Which chamber should be our representative?
"I think among the various chambers, the Four Escorts are our best fighters."
I think the Pine Crane Chamber is enough.
Yes... enough!
"You're a senior, and your kung-fu is acknowledged to be the best."
Your 8-divine sword is superb now.
You'll surely win!
"Yes, we'll win!"
Yes... we'll win!
This contest is to see who will be supreme chief.
It decides the destiny of Wu-tang.
We can't underestimate Shaolin.
What you mean is?
Monk Wo-tao will be out tomorrow.
I think we better let him decide.
Shaolin Chin Kang Fist requires great speed.
It attacks the enemy at all his vital points.
8-divine Sword may not be able to counter it.
And your opinion is?
"Unless we can understand the Chin Kang Fist, we'll lose and bring disgrace to Wu-tang."
Take a good look at him.
"All right, sit down there."
Our job is going to be to take very good care of him.
"I'll be taking too bloody good care of myself, thank you."
"My, my, what a nice little lace doily."
Look at him.
No nerves.
Sleeps through it all.
One more crack like that it'll be no teeth.
That's enough of that.
Save all that for the Jerries.
"I think the men are getting a bit on edge, Sir."
You think they're the only ones?
Did I ever tell you about the Ghurkhas when I was in India?
Wonderful little soldiers.
"When I asked for volunteers to jump, the whole battalion stepped forward."
"So I told them about their conditions of training and that they'd do their first jump from 1,000 feet."
There was absolute uproar.
"Then finally, their subedar major, he's the equivalent of the RSM, stepped forward and said, ""Sahib, the men are not easy in their minds."
"""They would rather do their first jump from 500 feet."""
"""Look"", I said, ""At 500 feet the parachutes mayn't have time to open."
A broad grin spread over his face.
"""Ooh, Sahib,"" he said,"
"""we didn't realise we were going to have parachutes!"""
Thank you.
"I never thought it was that funny, myself."
Just crossing the French coast.
Throwing you out in a few minutes.
Thank you.
Prepare for action.
One last word.
All wounded have to be left just where they are.
He offered.
"You know how in school, there are rules you have to follow?"
"Well, the same goes for here."
"We have to follow the rules, or else we get in big trouble."
And what that man offered you...
was definitely against the rules.
She's fighting with the insurance people again.
You're not supposed to worry about stuff like that.
"Tell her something good today, even if nothing good happens."
She needs good news.
I've got a body full of-- of high-quality parts here.
3-day liquidation sale.
Everything must go.
"Even if we could do it, you have to be a match for him."
Which means we'd have to crossmatch your blood with his.
Good thing we're both in a hospital then.
Let--let me save a life before I go.
It's the--it's the least I can do.
So you really expect me to believe that you want to do this for a kid?
"Whatever helps you sleep at night, dr."
Grey.
"The infection's made its way deep into the bone, so we're gonna have to take the rods out of your legs..."
And clean out the dead infected skin and bone.
You mean I won't get my 2 inches?
All that pain for nothing?
"Mr. Ruben, at this point, you're lucky to keep your legs at all."
"Yeah, that's easy for you to say."
"What are you, 5'10"", 5'11""?"
"Leave the doctors, alone, Chuck."
They're just trying to help.
"Oh, shut up, Gary."
You are over 6 feet tall.
- So Pylene-50 is actually made here?
- It has to be.
"It only remains stable for a few days, and then the enzyme bonds break up and it's no longer effective."
If we could find a sample for analysis...
Where's the synthesising plant?
"You're sitting on top of it, but it's guarded night and day."
It's worth taking a look.
- I wouldn't leave without.
"- Well, be careful."
"I wish I could help you, but I can't stay any longer."
"You've been a great help already, Leitz."
We're very grateful.
- Have you fixed its position?
"- Not enough time, sir."
"But it's above Roche's limit, so it must be a spacecraft."
Or a spy satellite.
- What's that thing called?
Orac?
"- Yes, sir."
- Means nothing to me.
How was it detected?
"- A one-in-a-thousand chance, General."
The operator happened to pick it up while running a routine line scan.
And what was this data it was taking from the terminal?
A study on freighter design modification.
Information being relayed from Space Centre.
"Sounds like a bit of commercial jiggery-pokery, Quute."
- I shouldn't worry about it.
"- That's not really the point, sir."
"These spaceship builders, they're always at each other's throats."
- Underhanded bunch.
"- Yes, sir, but..."
"You're an offender, which means there's no chance you'll be able to rejoin the police."
- Yet I'm not a criminal.
- Let's look on the bright side.
Try getting you into work.
Everything follows from that.
OK.
"Well, erm,"
"I was a detective inspector, so I've got a valuable skill set."
"So, any news on them forensics?"
"Erm, yes, sir."
There were notable findings on the inside of the envelope recovered from Danny Waldron's flat.
They found a number of tiny stains less than a millimetre across.
"Ink, standard biro -- could have belonged to anyone."
And blood.
"And that'd be Danny's, right?"
"No, sir, it matched Linus Murphy's."
The final report states that these findings are consistent with a blood-stained note written during or shortly after
Danny Waldron's torture murder of Linus Murphy.
"- Should I send a copy to DS Arnott, sir?"
- No.
"No, I'll handle it for now, and... .. and this is just between us for now?"
Nice one.
Who is it?
Robin from the offender management team.
Come in.
Were you issued with the information leaflet?
Good.
This is difficult for you... .. and we're here to help you pick up the pieces.
How long do I have to stay here?
You served half your sentence and now you're out on licence.
"You understand all this, of course."
We want to help you move on but it's not going to be easy.
You did not just tell me another secret.
You're a home-wrecker too.
- Jiminy Crispy.
"- Oh, don't ""Jiminy Crispy"" me."
Chuck thinks her mother died during childbirth.
"I mean, according to Vivian, Chuck..."
Charlotte thought her mother died during childbirth.
"Well, it doesn't matter what Charlotte thought."
She's dead now.
"Oh, look at you, all pious."
You'd think you'd fit right in at a nunnery.
"- Hell, might even do you some good."
- Who are you?
The good-for-me police?
"Oh, come on."
That epic tanty you pitched back at The Pie Hole?
That wasn't all my doing.
I realize I have some man issues to sort out.
So sort them out.
"Sort them out here, where men won't be an issue."
"Stay as long as you like, until your head is clear."
"But Olive feared Lily's idea of ""as long as you like""  was considerably longer than hers."
"Thirty-nine miles away, north by northeast  the private detective, the Pie-Maker and Chuck climbed a windy road  to the childhood home of Betty Bee."
A home that was supposed to be vacant.
But the home was not vacant at all.
That colony collapse was a hoax.
Her bees didn't die.
She stole them.
Damn.
"You know, suddenly a crazy cat lady don't seem so crazy no more."
"So Kentucky helped Betty steal Betty's bees, they fake a colony collapse."
"Get away with conspiracy, sabotage and grand theft."
Two galleons are lost to them.
Only two?
Then it is stalemated.
Drake's Squadron
Is even now pursuing them towards the Straits of Dover.
"Without sufficient ammunition for his cannons,"
Is all they can do.
And the fleet of Flanders?
"Hold up by storms, My Lady."
Let us that it will be a
"Protestant wind, My Lords, that keeps blowing for us."
More papal propaganda the Spaniards carry is of no interest.
"""Incestuous bastard of the depraved courtesan Anne Boleyn cursed heretic, shame of her sex and princely name """
"Of no interest, indeed."
"I fear it may be of interest to your Catholic subjects, Your Grace,"
"Have faith, my lord."
they're English before they are Catholics.
Oh God!
It's Queen Bess!
My God!
She's the Queen!
The Queen!
May God save the Queen!
"God is with us, Your Majesty!"
"A statement from Cardinal Don Pedro, captured by Drake in Rosario."
"""Upon our glorious assault on England, all heretics will be whipped by chains until dead."
"""Protestant children under 7 to follow their fathers;"
"the rest, branded on the forehead with the letter L of Lutherans. """
How very original.
"When this is over, you'll go to Buxton, Robbie."
Take the water.
Or I shall brand you myself!
Socks.
"Socks we have -- in contrast to common sense, which we seem to be running a little short on today."
I'll be right down.
Don't look at my dominoes.
"All right, sir, we got white socks with red stripes, black stripes, blue stripes."
"Over there you got all your solids in black, blue, brown, and gray."
Just take your pick.
That's a real nice pair right there.
You visiting?
We just moved here.
"Oh, well, then I'm Henry Sampson."
Nice to meet you.
Jimmy Morris.
"Welcome to Big Lake, Mr. Jimmy Morris."
"You know, son, I can probably tell you where it is a whole lot quicker than you can find it."
Got any baseball stuff?
"Oh, baseball stuff."
Don't get much call for baseball stuff around these parts.
"Now if it was football, that'd be a whole different story."
"You know something, though?"
I got a catalogue over here that just might help us out some.
Let's take a look at that.
"Yeah, I think we might find something in here."
"You know, if you're interested in baseball, there's a story that people here in this town tell that you probably ought to hear."
Thought you said nobody here cared about baseball.
"Oh, they care about this."
It all started with a couple of nuns and a piece of ground not too far from here.
-
"- Morning, Esther."
-
"- Morning, Jimmy."
Any more rattlesnakes on the playground?
"And we dipped his banner in the blood and cried ot ""Sant'lago"
Child of thunder!
"Child of battle!"""
The gonfalon.
"The banner of blood, kept in my family for 1,000 years, lest we needed Sant'lago to keep his promise."
"What promise, Major?"
"His promise that he would come again if Spain were invaded, as soon as we raise his banner"
- over the cape of Torrecastro
"- Get to the point, Major."
There's only a small French garrison in Torrecastro.
"The people of the town know the legend, secretly believe it."
"As soon as we raise the banner over the little chapel, the people will rise up against the French invader."
Rise up?
For a rag on a pole?
"Are you mad, Major?"
"No, it's a legend, Mr Sharpe."
The people believe in it.
"As soon as the gonfalon is unfurled,"
Sant'lago will surely come with fire and sword.
But it takes time to raise the banner.
And before it is unfurled...
The French will come with the sabre.
Exactly
That's why we need you.
Will you help us fight off the French long enough to raise the banner?
"You lied to us, Major."
"And you, Miss."
"You picked us up and we marched with you, fought for you."
And for what?
For a stupid superstition.
For a... for a rag in a bag.
"Not a rag, but the last flag of Spain."
"Mike, tell 'em, German chocolate."
"That's cake, we're talking pie now."
Isn't he adorable?
"Mike, before we go to bed, will you read me a story?"
"Oh, come on, this has gone from weird to creepy."
"Victoria, he is not your father."
"Mom, he is not your husband."
"Hang on, Moll, they're just trying to make me feel welcome."
Which is more than you're doing.
You won't even let the poor bastard hang up a picture.
I didn't say anything.
"Plus, you're the one who told us to make him feel at home."
"I meant be friendly, make small talk, not dress him up like my dead father."
"Hey, it fits him."
There's three guys in Chicago that can wear that suit.
Then get one of the other guys 'cause this one's mine.
"You're so selfish, Molly, you never share anything."
Remember how she never let me ride her bike?
"Oh, hey, if I had lent you the ten-speed, we'd still be driving around right now looking for it!"
The two of you are giving me a headache.
She started it.
"So how come you get to dress him up, but I can't?"
Because I'm the one that's marrying him.
Is that a shot at me because I haven't found a man yet?
Have you looked in the garage?
"I'm telling you, Carl, it's like paradise."
Guess what I'm doing right now.
How'd you know?
"No, I mean, how'd you know it was pie?"
You cannot hear it in my voice.
"Fine, if you're so smart, what am I wearing?"
Wrong... green leisure suit.

Where can we find a lot of humans?
It doesn't look tasty.
THE FOX FAMILY
"Today at 7 PM, not far from the scene where a woman was axed..."
- Sir!
"- You did it, before."
"Nobody can come here, and don't touch anything."
"Since we came down too soon without adapting to humans, there was a slight mistake earlier."
"In one month, it will finally be the 1000th year."
"A month will be enough, right?"
We came down too early.
"Yeah, we've already prepared for 1000 years."
"When the sun and the moon meet, and the four pillars of the year, month, day, and time join together... 30 minutes."
"When the sun and the moon align as one for those 30 minutes, our fate will be decided."
Our chance only comes...
Only once.
If you fail...
There will never be another chance.
Never forget that!
"Planned to say that, right?"
But you said a bunch of humans will come if we perform a circus.
"Yeah, and only kids came."
Disappointed that you can't mate?
What's the use if only kids come?
They all run away.
"To catch and eat humans, we need to be more active and bold."
Isn't that the way to look for humans?
You're too passive.
You son of bitch!
"Darling, ever since you passed away,"
I've tried hard to make real people out of our kids.
That's for sure.
"""Who needs them!"" There's no television."
"And that refrigerator, guess how much I had to beg her to buy it?"
She still won't go for a washing machine.
"""Washing can be done without a thing like that,"" she says."
"A stone head, with a reed screen over it."
"It's delicious, really delicious!"
Eating with all of you makes the food extra tasty.
Grandma.
Let my sister cook the meals starting tomorrow.
I'm sure it will be good for everybody.
"And it will be much easier on you, too, Grandma."
Don't worry about me.
To put it simply...
Grandma's cooking is driving us to despair.
"In other words, your cooking just doesn't agree with our tastes."
"I mean, as a matter of fact, it's just plain lousy."
"I'm sorry, Grandma, but... this pumpkin and kidney beans, and pumpkin and chicken... it's so boiled down with soy sauce that we can't even tell which piece is which."
"-It is so black, and pulpy, and saIty--"
-Tateo!
I think Grandma's cooking is lousy because of her false teeth.
"As long as everything is soft, it's all right with her."
-But we don't have false teeth.
-Shinjiro!
"Shinjiro, you sure are great!"
You did real well.
That's true.
Because of you...
I can sit at the table starting tomorrow with a sense of relief.
You mean eating is your only concern?
But you can't get away that easy.
"Tomorrow, we go shopping in Nagasaki."
"All I know is, that's not it."
"Lieutenant, I need your help."
I need you to find out what's funny.
"Oh I can't, I've got to build this.."
I ran out of room for my shoes.
"Well this is more important, it's about me!"
Well how am I supposed to know what's funny?
What's so important about a sense of humour anyway?
Oh come on Tommy.
"Having a sense of humor is having the power, to transform someone's mood, to lift his spirit."
You give it to someone you love when she really needs it.
"And I just found out today, that Marys been getting it from another man."
"Dick, I think this whole being funny thing is just innate."
"What do you think, lieutenant?"
- What do I think?
I think either you got it or you don't.
Look what you just did!
What's wrong with you guys?
Come on!
"Wake up you two, come on!"
How am I ever gonna find out what's funny?
No I don't get it.
Give me an example of what's funny.
Okay let's see.
I thought the movie Emma was really funny.
What was funny about it?
Didn't you get it?
It was full of irony.
"Okay, so irony's funny."
"Sure, because someone says something, and the opposite is actually true."
"Oh okay, like when you told me Emma was gonna be a really great movie, when actually it sucked out loud?"
"Well, apparently, irony is a little too sophisticated for you."
(GLASS SHATTERS)
It sounds like...
"The end, the beginning?"
Or are they the same?
"Have a seat, Henry."
"When a man is first crippled, there's always one question on everyone's mind, especially his."
Does his dick work?
"Mine didn't, so I plotted my escape from this chair."
I had come to Russia when the west banned resuscitation of cadaverflssue.
"Akan's a megalomaniac, but my research was funded."
I kept my eyes on the Nobel Prize.
"Who has time for icky ethics when he's rich and his cock works, eh'?"
(GUNSHOT ON TV)
I paid a high price.
I stopped making soldiers and then I succeeded.
I grew men made of cyberflesh.
"Really, they're just fancy-pants prostheses, but don't dare tell..."
My avatars!
"Now, cyborgs, on the other hand, have bits and a brain."
"They think for themselves, in theory at least."
Shall we have a look at you?
(ZIPPER OPENS)
(SNIFFING)
"That hippie, always with the ganja."
"You're not baked, are you?"
Hope not.
All right.
(WHISTLES)
"You are the man, Henry."
Hmm.
"There's very little actual man left, of course."
"Enhanced skeletal muscular systems, cardiovascular turbo boosted with a curium-244 atomic battery."
We had a search warrant authorizing us to look for controlled substances.
On what basis had you sought the warrant?
"lnformation from a reliable informant, Joseph Gonzales."
What transpired when you reached Mr. Ortiz's place?
We knocked.
We identified ourselves as police officers.
"After 1 0 seconds, we forced entry and found Mr. Ortiz standing in his toilet trying to flush 23 ounces of crack cocaine."
I don't think you mean to say Mr. Ortiz was standing in his toilet bowl.
"He was standing in his bathroom, flushing the cocaine."
What did you do at that time?
SlPOWlCZ:
"We prevented him from destroying evidence gave him his rights, arrested him."
Mr. Ortiz has stated that you broke down his door without warning.
"No, we identified ourselves, and then we gave him time to open the door."
So you made no surprise moves to throw the ecology of Mr. Ortiz's apartment out of whack?
- Did I miss something?
"- Yeah, me getting my balls squeezed."
That'll be all.
Thanks for cooperating.
Thanks.
[BUREAU CHIEF SNEEZES]
What's wrong?
He found out.
- I got your message.
WEXLER:
You got my message?
Get in.
KELLY:
What's the matter?
I know about the 1 5 grand.
Did you think they weren't going to call me about that?
My accountant called me.
HENRY:
Make sure to mark this place.
We're leaving a fortune under these rocks.
"Glass, chart a course."
Tightest you can that gets us around the Ree.
FITZGERALD:
This ain't right.
We all know these furs ain't gonna be here by the time we come back.
There's no way we can haul them all the way to the fort.
Arikara are all through the territory.
We'll want our hands free.
We're gonna lose those pelts.
You rather keep the pelts or your life?
Life?
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.
I just got living and the only way I get that is through these pelts.
Fuck!
"Ain't no way I'm going home after six months working my ass off like a mule risking my neck, men dying, and for what?"
Damn near lost everything.
Job's been fucked from the start!
There's the one been fucking us.
You wonder how the Ree got the dead drop on us when Mr. Glass was supposed to look out for that very thing?
All them Pawnee buddies of his.
Pawnee's as much against the Ree as the rest of us.
Yeah?
"Well, what about his little half-breed son?"
What kind of savage you think his mama was?
"Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz."
All I'm saying is a savage...is savage.
"Hey, Glass is it true what they say about you shooting a lieutenant while living with them savages?"
Twenty-one dead soldiers and 40 dead feathernecks.
Because he threatened me with rain when I wanted it fine.
He found fault with my high flyer and will not buy my brown mare.
If it will be of satisfaction to you. -
- I believe his character to be.
"In all other respects, irreproachable."
"In return for this acknowledgement, don't deny me the privilege -"
- Of disliking him as much as I adore this cottage.
- I have plans for improvements.
- That.
I will never consent to.
Not a stone must be added to its walls.
"Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild Combe Magna to this exact image."
- With a fire that smokes?
- Especially the fire that smokes.
Then I'd be as happy at Combe as I've been at Barton.
But this place has one claim on my affections none other can share.
Promise never to change it.
I'm honoured you risk your honour by seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.
- That is what Elinor would say.
- And she would be right.
"Miss Marianne, will you grant me an interview tomorrow... alone?"
"- Willoughby, we are always alone."
- But there is...
There is something very particular I should like to ask you.
Of course.
I shall ask Mamma if I may stay behind from church.
Thank you.
Until tomorrow.
Then.
Oh.
Virtue...
"Silently and with fear, enter the hearts of all that hear me this day."
He is a genius when it comes to information technology.
And he has a doctorate in network engineering.
This young man here is blessed with a tall physique.
He is our compatriot from Texas who made Korea proud.
I present you Dr. Lee Yun Seong.
"Pleased to meet you all, may you all guide me well."
Dr. Lee Yun Seong?
Yes?
I will depend on you from now on.
Yes.
I understand.
"Everybody, go back to your respective work, quick, quick!"
"Dr. Lee, your desk is right here."
I'm Go Gi Jun.
"Yes, nice to meet you."
I've been working in this department for 2 years.
"If you just do as I say, then it won't be difficult."
Take good care of it.
Don't mistake these with the midnight snack coupons that you can get by the fountain near the main entrance.
Why?
"Well, because the canteen is generally closed around that time."
I think you can have it back.
Not working overtime is one of my working conditions.
How is it possible that you're the only one who doesn't have to work overtime?
Are you trying to pass your dinner task to him?
"Stop dreaming, Go Gi Jun."
"You're already an expert in this, so continue doing it in the future."
He dares to ask someone from MIT to do this.
"Yes, I will continue to do it in the future."
What?
Aren't we going to camping training?
"It has been cancelled, right?"
"Sorry, man."
I'm just being honest.
Dean:
"So, you were scheduled to close the gym last night?"
"Yeah, but I didn't exactly lock up."
"Carol was still working out, and [sighs] I had a date."
"I didn't want to shortchange her, you know?"
"I mean, the poor girl has been working so hard to lose weight for her wedding."
"I slipped her the key, and I told her to lock up on her way out."
[ Gasps ]
"Oh, it's all my fault."
"[ Exhales sharply, sniffles ]"
Hey.
Find anything at the morgue?
Yeah.
"Uh, so, Wayne was banged up pretty bad."
"But on the back of his neck, just below his hairline... suction mark -- identical to Carol's."
"Okay, so, they both had marks, just like the hot trainer at Rollz."
But she was skinny... and alive.
And just recently lost a ton of weight.
"When I asked her about the mark, she, uh -- she clammed up, got all embarrassed."
"So, uh, I did some checking."
"And it turns out that she took a couple of ""me"" days last month and, uh, went here."
Canyon Valley?
Hm.
Yeah.
[ Mid-tempo music plays ]
"[ Peruvian accent ] When you look in the mirror, do you recognize the fat person staring back at you?"
"Have you tried every fad diet, every fitness trend out there, but nothing seems to work?"
"Here at Canyon Valley, we guarantee weight loss with no surgery..."
No extreme dieting and no intensive workout regimen.
Guaranteed results in one week!
I...
You have to make your own decisions.
I'm just saying I don't want to know.
"I'm saying, if you're..."
"When you're sleeping with her, if you're hitting up some fan favorites,"
I think you're cheating on some level.
"You might not be acting on it, but you're fantasizing."
You know what?
"I don't know what journey you're on, but I..."
I can't take this trip with you.
"But if I told you, as a friend..."
"I came up to you, I said, ""Hey, Dave, I'm attracted to men."""
"I was thinking about their bodies and things, but I didn't act on it because I'm straight and I was being very strong, would you consider me straight or gay?"
If I desired a man.
"If I was thinking about a man's body, like how the light reflects off of his sweaty back..."
Am I interrupting something?
No.
We're great.
Have a seat.
Want to sit down?
Enjoy this.
Enjoy it.
"No, I'm good here."
Thank you.
"If I was sleeping with my wife and thinking about, like, a dude's wet mouth..."
"Snow and steam, huh?"
Is this place outstanding?
"Okay, Jason, let me ask you a question here."
Is the highlight reel considered cheating?
The highlight reel?
No.
"I'm just saying everybody cheats and everybody lies, and whether they act upon it or not is a secondary conversation."
"Nitu, I made pasta for you"
"Drink it up, nothing will go wrong."
That's the water we drink
"I think she can't digest our waters, reminds her of American waters"
One gets accustomed to habits and habits can only be changed slowly
Only bad habits
"Good habits need not be changed, Om"
What is habit?
"Habit has two meanings... one in India, one in America"
"In America, when youngsters butt into discussions between elders... it's called freedom."
Freedom is Nothing bad
But freedom is different from decency
What was that...?
Not indecency
Decency.
"Which means, manners."
Manners...?
I don't need to learn manners from you
"At least, not here in India"
No matter.
Manners apart... there's much you may pick up.
Just make a beginning
"Jagadish, enough!"
Can we eat now?
"Sure, when did I forbid you...?"
Come off it Jagadish
Changing circumstances
I can't take family politics.
I speak my heart and you know it
I can't pull off this typical Indian-bride-act
"But I'll still tell you like a typical Indian husband, I love you"
My family members love me dearly.
We have Skinnarland on radio.
Haukelid and two local guys to execute the mission.
They will place 19 pounds of high explosive below deck.
Something which ought to create an 11 square foot hole.
The ferry with all its cargo should go down in less than five minutes.
Too fast to get to shore before it sinks.
Right.
"Another attempt, another blast, another fuckload of people die."
That's war.
There's a price to pay for success.
"How successful were we, really?"
We lost 41 men with Freshman.
We sabotaged the factory and had it the Germans rebuild it in two months   and listened to the Yanks and bombed the entire valley.
- All right.
And now about to blow up a passenger ferry.
- Very successful.
"- It's war Julie, you told me..."
The Heavy Water War:
Stopping Hitler's Atomic Bomb
What the hell are you thinking?
The alternative is bombing again.
We're talking about 40-50 civilians.
Plus even more reprisals.
Can't we blast it on the way down?
"Or after the ferry, out on the ocean?"
- I estimate most of them will get to shore.
- With the water temperature below freezing?
- They have two life boats.
- What if the ferry sinks before that?
Then they swim.
And those who can't?
The children and the elderly?
Why are you laughing?
Why would you miss me when we see each other every day?
It's not the same...
I want to be alone with you like this.
They are Yon and Ha-jin.
- Why those...
- Boss.
They must be pretty anxious.
"I should give them a wedding, as soon as we capture Yum Moon."
"That sounds good, but he can't marry before you do."
It seems to bother him too.
It is all right with me.
"We should suppress the pirates as soon as possible, if not just for them."
- Warrior slaves?
- Yes.
The Jie Du Shi of Jiangsu Province enjoyed gladiator fights.
"He would invite nobles and wealthy merchants to the fights, and wager money."
"Head Chief Jang was the greatest gladiator in Jiangsu, and I discovered him."
"If he had continued to fight as a warrior slave,"
"I would have made a lot of money, and he would have died in the arena."
"But I have put my greed aside, and made him the security officer of a merchant group."
"I do not mean to brag, but I played a big part in his being who he is today."
What is it you wish to say?
My lord.
What is it?
I believe that my ability as a great judge of character has made me a successful merchant.
I would like to stake everything I have on you.
Please take me in.

"Well, that's Amy for you."

"But it is our house, and we do have the legal right to tell you to get the hell outta here."
"I'm pushing for that cull to happen, and when it does, those damn horses are gonna be the first to go."
"- Okay, let's get 'em outta here."
- What the hell are you doing?

I told you not to fight me on this!
Keep 'em moving!
I'm with the child protection society.
James Barr's lawyers might pull their boy through.
"I know, sir, Inspector Frost..."
Is off the case.
Remember it.
This place is in chaos.
They're shifting CID out en masse.
What they're doing is setting up is a station within a station.
No one is to go in there.
Including me.
"Not very good for Denton's image is it, sir?"
The image of the station is not my chief concern right now.
What about you?
What have you done about representation?
Someone from the Federation maybe?
A solicitor perhaps?
No that's not my style.
"Jack, try and keep your style..."
Under control?
"I don't always like the way you do things but whatever our disagreements,"
I have the highest regard for your integrity.
And I shall be making that clear at the highest level.
"Don't try too hard, sir."
(Knock on door)
Yes!
"Mr. Mullett, I'd like to make a start, with Inspector Frost."
"Yes, superintendent?"
I am concerned that Inspector Frost has no communication with any officers here.
Are you telling me that when one of my senior officers is suspended
I can't speak to him?
It makes it tidier.
"Let me remind you, Superintendent, that this is my station."
"I have a responsibility for the people who work here, and I intend to ensure that"
That should have been me.
- It was my idea.
- Igin volunteered.
I should never have sent him.
He was too old.
"But that's why he volunteered, Hunda, don't you see?"
- He wanted to be of use.
"- Nevertheless, it was my idea, I should have gone!"
"Yes, sir, with any luck the rebel's Fourth Column has just ceased to exist."
- Well done.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Mind you, I have a sneaking respect for these Helots."
I led a squadron of them once.
"Marvellous fighters, especially at close quarters."
They love the hand-to-hand stuff.
"Not really necessary, of course, these days, sir."
"Don't you believe it, Quute."
You can't do everything with your missiles.
"Bunkers, strong points, inner city combat."
You've got to winkle them out with cold steel.
It's the only way of clearing the ground.
"- Gas, sir?"
- It's not always effective.
- Do you remember the Fletch expedition of '29?
"- No, I don't think I do."
Fletch used gas against the Wazis.
"Complete massacre, bodies everywhere."
"Took dinner with his officers that night, suddenly the Wazis came over the wall, butchered the whole expedition."
"It seems Wazis are gill-breathers, they can lie dormant for days."
"That's very interesting, sir."
- You'll send out a patrol to do a body count?
"- Of course, sir."
"The medicine cured him, Jacob."
- Not faith healing.
- That's your version.
Mine is that I experienced God's love moving through me to Larry.
"Now, wait a minute."
Aren't faith healers frowned upon in judaism?
Religious dogma is meaningless in the face of God's new revelations!
I have a power to heal!
And more than that...
I understand things.
You are missing something from your life.
Perhaps it is God's grace.
May we pray together?
"That's a very lovely offer, but... no, thank you."
"So, we have all of Jacob's test results back."
He's completely healthy.
No.
He's barking mad.
"You know, I bet they said that about Joan of Arc."
"Just because we don't share in Jacob's faith, it doesn't mean that it's a condition, right?"
"Just out of curiosity, does anyone in this room believe in God?"
Have you seen me operate?
- I am God.
- Mm.
I believe in God.
- She's awesome.
"- I am a scientist, and I am trained to equate truth with things that can be proven."
"Not only does faith ask you to accept things that are impossible to prove, it's just they defy all reason."
But isn't that the very definition of faith?
That you believe without proof?
Then why not believe in leprechauns or unicorns?
"Santa Claus, bigfoot."
Do you think I'm not worried?
Aren't they beautiful?
is that how you're getting ready to go to Austria?
"It's half past ten, when do you want to be ready?"
In a minute.
"- Marcel, you, too!"
- What for?
"We're going to see her off, aren't we?"
I don't know how to explain it.
"I trust her, but here it's not a question of trust."
I don't want her to experience some disappointment there.
"She's an idealist, she always imagines..."
Do you think I don't care?
"I didn't want to agree at first, after all, she's going to a strange world..."
"When it comes to such things, I'm totally..."
What should I do now?
Give her some guidance?
"In Salzburg the water in the lakes is cold, take care not to catch cold there."
Be careful about bathing!
- There's salt water there.
"- lt's not salty, but cold."
"I don't want you to bathe dressed up warm, but..."
You catch cold quickly and that's no simple matter.
I know I can bathe only in the afternoon.
And no playing the hero!
I know how such girls like showing off!
I never show off.
That's what we're worried about.
"After all, there must be some trust."
"You know, it's hard to explain what I feel... my wish for her is that everything will go smoothly."
"I wish she may have a great love, and that everything will be beautifully harmonious for the rest of her life."
A great love... are you thinking of the kind in novels?
-A lot of the crew's on edge lately.
-They certainly are.
I heard things got pretty ugly down there.
It's not every day I'm asked to confine a senior officer.
I can't say I disagree with the Captain's decision.
"If one of my men disobeyed orders, I'd throw him in the stockade."
I've got to get back to the Bridge.
Let me know if your simulation finds anything else.
I need to see T'Pol.
She's not supposed to have any visitors.
This isn't a social call.
I'm here for my neuro-pressure treatment.
Doctor's orders.
"You don't want me to bring Phlox down here, do you?"
What's our status?
The antimatter's on its way.
I had a talk with him.
Everything's gonna be all right.
This whole thing'll blow over in a day or two.
Our antimatter supply will be depleted by then.
"The Captain's behaviour is becoming increasingly illogical, even for a human."
"He's preoccupied with the hatchery, he's displaying signs of paranoia."
I think you're overstating things just a little.
You can't allow him to use our antimatter.
What do you suggest I do?
Start a mutiny?
You have to speak with Phlox.
Ask him to run a full exam on the Captain.
What good would that do?
"If the Doctor can find something wrong, we may have medical grounds..."
-to relieve him of command.
-Relieve him?
- Units 17...
- They intend to break through to the north.
"- Yes, that was to be expected."
- How are you going to prevent that?
We only have a handful of men left.
It would be suicide.
"Oh, yeah?"
"If Ramírez's position in the north is strengthened, we can't hold out, whether we have 10 or 1, OOO men."
The refinery will be destroyed.
"- Would you like a bite, Padre Julio?"
- First you must tell me where you got it.
- Stealing is not a very nice thing to do.
"- Maybe, but it's better than being hungry."
"- Can I talk to you for a minute, Padre?"
"- Sure, go ahead."
"Your food supplies are scarce, and it won't get any better in the near future."
"It would be a great risk for everyone involved, but if you do me a favour, I'll help you get these people across the border."
I like that suggestion.
- Tell me what your motives are.
- We'll be honest with you.
We're planning a coup.
We want to destroy the Marbella refinery.
That would be a great gain.
All traffic would be brought to a halt.
- Ramírez would be finished.
- But Marbella can't be destroyed.
- You've been trying to do that for two years.
- I've got something I didn't have before.
I suppose you know the story of the Trojan Horse.
"I don't know what it has to do with this, but I'm sure you'll explain."
Think about who might be the Trojan Horse.
It will be you.
But they'll eat him alive.
"My brother is innocent Inspector, and so am I."
"All this, all this just shows how desperate you are."
You don't believe a jury will convict James either.
"If there's any more of this,"
I'll have to bring in my solicitor.
There will be more of this.
You know that.
(Phone ringing)
Alec Barr.
This is Father Sullivan.
The thing is I...
I need to speak to you before I go to the police.
What do you mean?
"What's all this about, Father?"
"I think you know that, Mr. Barr."
I know my family is under a great deal of pressure.
I'd have hoped even the modern church would give support and prayer.
Instead of which you phone me with some bizarre threat.
I'm not threatening you.
You said you had to talk to me before you talked to the police.
"I don't know what nonsense you've dreamed up, but a priest."
"Mr. Barr,"
I know it was you who came into my confessional the day before James's wife was killed.
I know it was your voice.
You said you were going to kill someone.
I'm quite prepared to testify to that if necessary.
But the best thing for you to do is to go to the police and tell them what happened.
What sort of priest are you?
And what sort of brother are you?
Anything I said is sacred.
"It's a sacrament, you bastard."
"Sometimes daydream it, what there would be if even more, much more are men could deal with box folding?"
"That time comes possibly once, when can be put on all of the humanity will be."
It would be a big thing.
"Sure, I think that it is not allowed to make this uniform."
All nations could fold boxes with an other form with an other colour.
"The Dutchmen round one like that, than their cheese."
The French in the colours of the tricolour.
"The Germans do the largest, most beautiful boxes then naturally."
"But this does not mean it, that for the Russians, it will be allowed to fold boxes if we defeated them already, sure only small ones, than the match box."
"Clear, that this will not be soon,"
Hard work is needed for him.
But if the idea wins if it succeeds all of the humanity will bless our name.
"You do not pay attention to me, Tót!"
- But yes.
- But your mind is somewhere else entirely!
Maybe is on the red spotted butterfly?
"No, no."
Well then what?
Major lord.
I know an other road.
"Somewhat longer, but more beautiful."
Let us go under the gardens.
Why?
This road is very good.
"What happened to you, Tót?"
Tell?
Honestly.
"-Be sick at something, major lord."
- What?
"It before, when we were spent on this you jumped a ditch."
And I jumped over.
"Of course, the man it jump the ditch."
"It caught fire, and the flames seared his face and the backs of his hands."
"His father thought it would be better if he died, but his mother said he would grow up to be a great man because of it."
I first met your father... some AIA affairs.
And I sat right next to Lou.
"And I praised him, on the Richards Laboratory."
I thought that was really a marvelous group of buildings.
"And it was then that he told me, ""You know,"
"""go to Scotland."""
- Really?
- Know that?
No.
The Scottish castle gave him the inspiration.
- For Richards?
- Yes.
"And I said, ""That group of buildings are really one of your best."""
"And he said, ""Well, the best is yet to come."""
That was Salk.
So then he told me about his relationship with Salk.
"He said, ""I have the best client."""
"And he said, ""Well, I view somehow that this will be an important piece of work."""
And as it turned out to be.
I consider it to be a masterpiece of his.
The two of you have varying degrees of success with clients.
You seem to have succeeded very well.
I am...
"I am, but I'm a little bit more able to... a little more patient, perhaps, because of my being Chinese."
If my client...
"let's say a person did not agree with me,"
"I'll let it pass, and I'll come back another day."
I don't think Lou would do that.
Lou would probably...
push it right through.
"I'll butt him, but I won't reach."
"I was talking to an independent local dealer the other week about waiting lists, three-year-old Toyota Rav 4s."
How does that work?
"Whenever you went to your local dealer and had a good stock of three-year-old cars, he would've bought those from company fleets that sold them at auction."
"All of a sudden, they've changed tactics."
They're holding onto cars so they can save money on buying cars.
They're not selling cars off - they might keep them for five years.
Usual supply of three-year-old mainstream cars has dried up.
Top Gear top tip - don't buy something like that now.
"If anyone's got a three-year-old Toyota Rav 4 they want rid of,"
I know a bloke who'll have your arm off.
Time to sell it is now.
OK.
"Cars are facelifted throughout their lives, and when that happens the old version costs less."
It's often not very different.
It's tweaks.
Tweaks and things.
The VW Passat.
"Earlier this year, this car was facelifted."
The little rubber strips on the bumper were replaced with little chrome strips.
"As a result, cars with the rubber strips on the bumper are worth a bit less."
It's ridiculous.
How much?
VW Passat 1.
"8T, metallic paint,"
"list price £18,200."
"With rubber bits on the bumper, a bit over £15,500."
Hey?
!
Yeah.
You save how much?
I want to ask you this.
Cora seeks it.
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
Your longest stint anywhere was two years.
What did you enjoy so much about Tallahassee?
(Henry) It's poison.
"(Emma) I love you, Henry."
(Henry) You saved me.
(Thunder rumbles)
It's a little freakier than I remember from the story.
Reminds me of death.
Encouraging.
"Well, your compass awaits."
Shall we?
Wait.
"If these beans... create... portals, why not just pick one and go home?"
Why the compass?
Because there aren't any more beans.
"Whatever story you think you know, my dear, is most certainly wrong."
There was a guy named Jack and a cow and something about an evil giant with a treasure and a golden goose.
Or harp.
"Sounds like a lovely tale, but the truth's a little bit more gruesome."
"The giants grew the beans, but rather than use them for good, they used them to plunder all the lands."
"Jack was a man who fought a terrible war, defeating all but one of the evil giants."
The beans were destroyed by the giants as they died.
"If they couldn't have their magic, then nobody could."
It's really very bad form.
Evil giants who made magic portal beans?
Why doesn't anyone just go up and grow some more?
Because one giant survived... the strongest and most terrible of them all.
And we'll have to get past him to...
The magic compass.
It's probably just the generator.
You mean the thing that runs the electricity and water.
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired of feeling slightly terrified all the time.
It's not like I wanna be.
"Hey, look, it's going to get better."
Sean?
"If Jackson doesn't know what he's doing, then he probably doesn't know someone's controlling him."
Or he doesn't remember.
What if it's the same kind of thing that happened with
Lydia when she took off from the hospital?
A fugue state?
He'd have to forget everything... the murder.
Getting rid of the blood.
But he had help with one thing... the video.
And someone else helped him forget that.
Whoever's controlling him.
Are you sure Jackson has no clue about any of this?
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf and that being with
Lydia somehow delayed the whole thing.
So do we try to convince him he's not?
"If it helps us find out who's controlling him, then yeah."
Do you think he'll talk to us after what we did?
"Yeah, it's us."
He'll talk to us.
Right?
You will not go within 50 feet of Jackson whittemore.
You will not speak to him.
You will not approach him.
You will not assault or harass him physically or psychologically.
What about school?
You can attend classes while attempting to maintain a 50-foot distance.
"I mean, he's kind of the guy who connects old basketball with modern basketball and had such a recall of all that."
It sort of defined the essence of the man.
"And that at the end of his life, it leaves him."
"Dean Smith passed away on February 8, 2015."
"Dean Smith passed away on February 8, 2015."
"Tributes poured in from all over the country, from friends and rivals."
"And, on February 22nd, the Dean dome was filled in his honor one final time,"
at a memorial service to remember north Carolina's beloved coach.
Thank you.
Thank you for what you did for Carolina.
Thank you for what you did for college basketball.
You showed us how to live.
You showed us how to be engaged.
You showed us how to be engaged.
"You set an example to show people how, through determination, to never give up, to never quit, to keep pushing forward."
Look at Dean Smith.
What composure.
"This man is very much in control of himself, his team."
Gets the 20.
Has a little discussion with his guys.
It has been a program to be envied.
"Dean's trying to say, ""attention!"
He's trying to kill the guy!
It should be a 2-hot foul!
"He's mugging him!"""
Push it up.
That's the shot Williams loves.
Push it up.
That's the shot Williams loves.
And he puts the tar heels ahead by one.
What is the impact that coach Smith has had on us?
"There's not one or two things, it's our life."
"Even if you refuse, I'll shake hands with you."
"You couldn't catch me in India, how can you catch me in Malaysia?"
"Aren't you over expecting, partner?"
"When I've come so far using your clue, can't I come to you, partner?"
You can't!
"I'm giving you another opportunity, catch me before December 16th, after that even if you want to catch me, I won't get caught."
This is your last opportunity.
"Thanks, I gave that interview to lure you,"
"I know you'll call me back, and you got caught."
"You gave a good knock-out punch, I'm your fan."
"Hello partner, you've made me run long distance,"
"I'm new to Malaysia, where do you want me to go?"
Want me to take right or left side?
I'll take the left side.
"Partner, helicopter also to catch me?"
You've so much power here?
I need to speed up.
I need to run!
Why are you so moody?
- Is it about him?
- No.
"New movie has opened, shall we go?"
No mood.
It's him!
Why is he entering hospital?
"This is a special case from India, he has forgotten the past with a blockage after being hit on head."
"He's under observation, take care of him."
What's this silly meeting going on here?
Somebody has hijacked my patient.
Why are you staring at me?
I'll rip out your skin if you don't answer me.
"He's missing since two days, I've high BP also."
This season's about Starting over...
Hell yeah.
And getting this Mega dredge built.
"We got a long day Ahead of us, tomorrow."
In the glow of The golden nugget...
"Let's go to bed, man."
"Shawn heads for camp, Unaware that a determined rival."
Has reached the gates.
That mega dredge will Keep nome alive.
"I mean, you start bringing In $100,000, $200,000."
"A day into a small Community like that,"
It'll definitely be a really Good thing for nome.
"I guess this is where We're setting up camp, boys."
There's a lot of families that Depend on my business and me.
"I don't want to think about how Many people depend on me, but..."
"Long as I keep finding Big piles of gold,"
It should keep all These families happy.
We'll be nice and warm Here in a minute.
I have a feeling this winter Will be the best icemining.
Season I've ever had.
"I think it's the next Big gold rush, for me,"
And I think it'll have people Trying to come down there.
"To mine, but..."
"Not too worried about anybody Showing up anytime soon,"
Because it's taken me years To get ready for it.
"I mean, if people think They're gonna come up here."
"And do it in one season, They got..."
They got another thing coming.
Anything this tough Has got to be worth it.
"On the next episode of ""Bering sea gold""..."
"We're the reaper, and we've Come here to do business."
Ricky!
Is it?
I mean...
"Has it ever really been over, for you?"
"Monsieur, your generosity will not be overlooked or forgotten."
The Bible says that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven.
That is true if the rich man does not repent of his sins.
But all who renounce Satan and are contrite are welcome in the house of God.
LOUIS:
Mmm.
I will pray for your soul.
"Word's spread that a man is visiting churches, handing out money and a crowd is gathering outside."
I suggest we return to the palace immediately.
Do you believe in heaven and hell?
"Yes, I believe I do."
"That a man will be punished for his wrongdoing, for his sins?"
"Yes, Your Majesty."
So do I.
I wish to visit the tomb of my father in Saint-Denis before we return to the palace.
(SNICKERING)
"Ah, after all the battles I've been in,"
I cannot believe that this is how I'm gonna die.
Watching the last barrel of wine spill into the dirt.
"I'm sorry about that, by the way."
I know.
Death is mocking me.
You know we're not going to die today.
You might want to tell them that...
"I'm not ready, not here, not like this, not now."
(LAUGHS)
And I've too much left to do.
"And I can't die without seeing Constance's face one last time, can I?"
Or laying eyes on the children we will have together.
"-Harmony, architecture."
When I report this at home...
"And I would like to repeat once more in this solemn moment, as a poet says:"
"""O, thanks, thanks to your effort."""
Because miniaturization and electronics... are the future of mankind.
Do you know what I like the most about people?
That they can always celebrate something.
"All right, I'm coming."
-They're always pestering.
"-Hurry, these are ours."
Inhabitants of Earth live in houses.
"In small, bigger and the biggest."
Many houses together are called a town.
A town provides comfort for people.
People start the day with a row of typical actions.
"When they have done the prescribed number of actions, they leave their houses and rush away."
"They attend to useful activities, which they call work."
On Earth work is the meaning of life.
People get money for work.
"People buy things with money, which increases their comfort."
After work people return to their homes.
By pressing a button they set in motion a device for amusement.
"Amusement serves people by drawing in new energy, so they can successfully repeat another cycle of daily activities."
-Oh no.
-Oh yes.
You put more effort in your work.
"As we say, toil."
Not so.
"You put into it more intelligence, as we say, craft."
"Well, all right."
It's beautiful!
Splendid.
No.
"I was never punished, except for the fact that he wouldn't look at me or speak to me for an entire week."
It was the longest week of my life.
And you've given us copies of all these contracts?
"Uh, yeah."
"We only had 48 hours, but my lawyer and I have done the best we could."
Are there other documents?
I don't see any e-mails between you and Mr. Drentell after December.
I...
We're...
"We changed computer systems, uh, in December, I think it was, because we couldn't handle the volume of a job this size."
It's possible that some e-mails were misplaced at that time.
- Or destroyed.
- They were not destroyed.
- You keep copies of correspondence?
- l do.
They're all there.
- They're not.
- l'll check into it.
How hard?
"If you want to accuse me of perjury, you go ahead, but otherwise... I understand you're a pack rat when it comes to keeping things."
We'll keep this part of the inquiry open while Mr. Sammler checks into materials he needs.
"[Bob fading] Now, in March, there was a disagreement between the corporation..."
[Lily] I don't understand why they have to make it adversarial.
[Rick] They're looking for people to put in jail.
"- [Grace] Good night, Mom, Rick."
"- Good night, honey."
"- Good night, Grace."
- Five hours?
It felt like five days.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
I don't care what they say.
Few who lived through the last conflict will set much store by government assurances that any war against Germany will be over swiftly.
Mrs Barden -
"- When war does begin, it will hurl us all into a period of great change."
"Something you, Madam President, have proven steadfastly resistant to over the course of your term in office."
"Mrs Collingborne, would you kindly control your sister?"
"As you know, Madam President, that isn't as straightforward as you imply."
Ooh.
Can you help me up?
Blimey... what happened to you?
Army lorry.
Ow.
- Ooh.
Oh...
- Oh!
Sorry.
Are you all right?
- I'm late.
Where are you going?
I am more than willing to put my proposition to the vote.
"Any objections to that, Mrs Barden?"
"Only that the membership has been so tightly managed over the years, it will almost certainly deliver whatever you ask of it."
Shame on you for not sharing my faith in our colleagues' independence of mind.
Shame... on... you.
"If we walk slower, it might not hurt so much."
"I can't walk slower, Mr Wilson."
I'm late.
"Well, why don't we leave your bike here... and I'll get you to where you need to be double-quick on the back of mine?"
Sure you can carry me?
You're no heavier than a bag of mail.
- Charming!
"A small, light, bag of mail."
- Hmm.
That's absolutely amazing.
You're right.
The parka and the ski mask.
That's where they both came from.
And the gun?
"Come on, sir."
You're putting me on.
You know that guns don't come from the wardrobe department.
Of course.
How stupid of me.
"No, that's the prop department, sir, not the wardrobe department."
How does a smart man like Lieutenant Lucerne make a mistake like that?
"Because you're not talking to Lieutenant Lucerne at the moment, are you, Lieutenant?"
You're talking to Ward Fowler.
"Well, what's the difference, sir?"
The difference is Ward Fowler's under suspicion of murder.
And a man under that kind of threat is apt to make mistakes.
He's apt to get rattled.
"Well, who ever said anything about Ward Fowler being under suspicion of murder?"
Lieutenant Lucerne did.
He did?
"Well, how did he come to that conclusion, sir?"
He had to face the same fact you did.
"What fact is that, sir?"
There are only four people who could have murdered Claire.
You mean the four people who knew where Claire Daley was going to be that night.
Exactly!
"And only one of those is instantly associated with makeup, wardrobe and props."
COLUMBO:
"Well, now, let's see."
Mrs. Daley took the call from her secretary in your dressing room when she said that she was going to...
"Oh, what's his name, sir?"
"Uh, a private investigator."
See...
You don't understand.
"Roger, wait!"
"I love you, Roger!"
Get in the car.
Oh!
Hold it!
U.S. Treasury Department.
You two are in big trouble.
It was a double blow to my ego.
"The good guys were bad guys, and vice versa."
"The dumb kid in the blue sedan turned out to be a mafia hit man, while gold teeth and his partner were really treasury agents."
"And all of them, including Barbara and I, were hunting for Roger."
"For different reasons, of course."
It seems the love of Barbara's life used to be Godfather Bracito's gardener.
"One day while tending the roses, he dug up two million from an armored car robbery... that had been cooling until the statute of limitations had run out."
Roger dropped it into a fertilizer bag and walked away.
In a funny way I had to admire him.
Walking out of a don's estate with two million in a bag of bat guano.
Barbara.
Barbara.
I can't believe it.
Why didn't he tell me?
"Well, maybe he loved you too much to involve you."
Oh.
You think so?
"Well, he wrote you all those letters after he already had the two million dollars."
How many guys do you know who would do that if they didn't love you?
We gotta find him.
"Oh, don't worry, Babs."
"This guy with the gun won't harm him until he has the money, and Roger's not dumb enough to tell him where it is."
- We discussed it at the last meeting.
"That's right, you weren't there."
"As our brother, you deserve our forgiveness, and our loving ridicule."
Line it up.
For
Curses...
"You met my friend Calvin, I was wondering, if you'd consider taking him as one of our pledges, he dropped out of the Omega Chis."
"- He's smart, really good at sports."
"- You'd me at ""dropped out of the OCs."""
"Cultivating a new pledge, not to mention stealing one from our arsh enemies,"
- this is what brotherhood is all about.
- I do what I can.
- I'll get it
"- You're not sucking up, I'll get it."
Which Law  Order are you with?
Can I have to issue you your citation?
Open container of an alcoholic beverage.
Again?
There's nothing even here.
Except of maybe the tiniest bit of foam.
That's not gonna hold up on a court of law.
Try to stay out of trouble.
Give my love to dean Bowman.
Here's your ball.
"At least, we're gonna have a party."
"I went to wilder parties in elementary school, I can't believe this, it's like"
"I have no control anymore, my relationship with Evan span out of control,"
- I can't manage with Lizzi.
- OK stop.
"Compromise is what comes with territory,"
- you're just being a good president.
- I'm a terrible president.
Our ancestors existed with the land.
"But despite that, they were driven from their land, and forced to live a life of poverty and disgrace."
"But on the day our mighty soldier awakens, we know we can regain our once lost pride."
And we know that this mighty soldier is the one that will save this world from the coming threat!
"Everything ended, and started, with meeting her."
You were young then.
"Tears, screams and decisions..."
Fate dictates how the wheels of time will spin.
And its only mission is to create a steel giant.
You were a student.
"Don't miss Great Dangaioh Episode 11, ""The Past Returns."""
You were really so young.
"Commander, what is it you want to say?"
Err... nothing.
Get outta here...
GET OUT!
"This is Dangaioh's new weapon, the super pyrogenic Stream Blaster."
This will be able to burn away
Exceptions' outer layer of mirrored armor.
Then what was the point of having me use my sai?
"Of course, this will put a bigger stress on you physically and mentally."
It's best if we never have to use it.
"Yeah, yeah..."
Tell me about it.
Any other questions?
"If there are none, I'll explain the firing mechanism."
"Okay, then let's move on."
A bigger strain...
"First, look at this part of the monitor."
Brother...
Looks like there's a storm coming...
"The sea was rough, that day, too."
To die for!
"Fooffy, green tea."
We gotta make sure this trend catches on.
We gotta make sure... this trend is covered with pages in the magazine.
- Roxanne doesn't understand this.
- It's gonna be an outrage.
"By this time next year, We'll have every single woman... wearing helmets."
Helmets on Wall Street... helmets in the opera... women in maternity wards with helmets.
No more will lesbians have a lock on helmets.
I'll see that personally.
It's great.
Great.
Everybody is gonna run out and spend 4 grand for a helmet.
"It's insane, these people wouldn't care about safety if a top..."
- designer didn't tell them to.
- How do you deal?
A sense of humor is essential for this job.
"- Richard, how are you doing?"
- Kenneth!
Great shoot.
"Hi, Cornelia, great to see you."
- Did you just see that?
- Statement.
Statement?
Kenneth Cole just cut me dead.
Obviously he didn't appreciate our dominatrix baby shoot.
Where were we...
"US$ 25.000, I repeat, is not enough... to do a piece."
"It's an insult to the designer, it's an... insult to the make-up artist, it's an insult to the photographer..."
- and it's an insult to me.
- Don't hurt her.
Raymond Meyer said Skirt isn't wort his time... if we can't put out the dough to hang the Henry Winston... on the gargoyles of the Chrysler Building.
"Well, I guess we better find a sponsor then."
"Tomorrow we make proposals to our bosses and every business in town, okay?"
- Deal.
- Cool.
"Later, Dairy Queen."
There he is.
"Hey there, pal, I'm Mark, the mayor's VP of PR."
How are you?
"Rocking, dude."
"Look, I was actually really hoping to speak with the mayor."
Yes.
"Sorry, that's not going to happen."
"He is on a vision quest, listening to the flowers with Shaman Maria somewhere near Machu Picchu."
"And he's not going to be back for a couple of months, if he even survives at all."
Crazy old codger's got a bit of a death wish if you ask me.
"Anywho, you gang are looking for a sponsor, am I right, for your little orphan hockey team?"
"Which is super, it's great."
We love the kids without the parents.
Love it.
"Here's the sitch, though, we already sponsor a bowling team."
Yes.
"Tenpin, kind of awesome."
"Tell you what I can do, though."
"How about a box of Charlestown snow globes for you and the guys, all right?"
"Enjoy those and, hey, thanks for stopping by."
Bowling team?
Support for closing the home is up 36% since you fostered the baby orphans.
And your approval ratings jumped a total of 50%.
"God, I love the power of good PR."
Keep those little brats in the basement till after the vote.
I don't even want to smell them.
And watch out for boogers and spit-up.
She been planning this affair for over 20 years.
If only Charles were here.
My condolences
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision
I hope you don't think I've taken advantage of your misfortunes
Of course not.
I'm pleased that you've purchased the company.
I was a fool for not investing in his mad venture when I had the chance
Charles thought so too
"Hamish, do you ever get tired of quadrille?"
On the contrary.
I find it envigorating
Do I amuse you?
No.
"I had a sudden vision, of all the ladies in trousers and the men wearing dresses"
It would be best to keep your visons to yourself.
"When in doubt, remain silent."
"Pardon us, sir."
Ms. Kingsley is distracted today.
- Where is your head?
- I was wondering what it would be like to fly.
Why would you spend your time thinking about such an impossible thing?
Why wouldn't I?
My father said he sometimes believed in six impossible things before breakfast.
"Alice, meet me at the Gazebo in precisely ten minutes."
We have a secret to tell you.
"If you're telling me, then it's not much of a secret"
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.
"- If you tell us, we won't be surprised."
- Will you be surprised?
He is buying all the real estate he can get his hands on.
How much do you want for it?
This is not a gas filling station.
The mega-centre is not for sale.
I won't offer it twice.
I'm not a parrot either.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
Why are you standing here?
Get in the cars and let's go!
Illychenko could have done it too.
He is a new oligarch and a member of parliament.
This issue will be decided at the highest level.
I respect you and the highest level.
"But it seems to me that we're living in a democratic country, aren't we?"
We are.
But democracy is not permissiveness.
One may pay dearly for one's self-confidence.
I agree with you.
Do you know how I got here?
I headed a department in a mental hospital.
I was to retire in a year.
I was silly enough not to acknowledge the fact that a young mediocre specialist had bought the post of the head doctor and stolen everything in the hospital away.
I wrote to the Ministry of Health and to the General Prosecutor's Office about it.
So here I am!
I'm waiting for the court hearing with broken ribs.
I'm accused of dealing drugs.
But I'm grateful to those who sent me here.
For here I got to know what real freedom is.
I have lots of free time.
I read the Bible from beginning to end here for the first time both the Old and the New Testaments.
Don't you hate those who broke your ribs?
They begin killing hostages.
Salawell?
"The one commanding the riot is you, Princess."
No... does that mean?
"And the one to kill the rioting princess and end the battle, the Estabul noble, Salawell Seile, is greeted by Roland as the savior of the kingdom."
"So our armies' being directly met, the suggestion to take hostages..."
That was all you?
I trusted you.
"At first, though, I planned to make you my wife and take control of this kingdom."
All I wanted was to make a kingdom where everyone could live happily.
And yet...
The world isn't moved by pretty words.
Even still...
Even still!
"How adorable you are, Princess."
But this is the end!
Please relax.
Roland is not in need of a hero so badly that such a man could become one.
A hero?
"Is this the doing of Roland's Hero King, Sion Astal?"
!
My king has no taste for such things.
All of this is my doing alone.
"Then, the one to conspire with Salawell and lead us into revolt was..."
"Yes, it was me."
"He saw through it and appointed Rear Admiral Klom to suppress the revolt, not me."
That is the kind of man my king is.
"However, just as Salawell said, it is a fact that the world isn't moved by pretty words."
"After Lady Noa Ehn kills the hostages, she commits suicide."
That is how the story goes.
Would King Astal forgive that?
"Ideally, I wouldn't be found out, but perhaps he would come to forgive it?"
- Another call.
- Who called you that night?
Calls of a suspicious nature were made shortly before you volunteered to continue serving on Danny Waldron's squad and before you murdered him.
Who made those calls and what did they ask you to do?
"For the tape, the interviewee is not answering."
"This pattern of communication, unregistered pay-as-you-go phones used for a short period then discarded, is one we all recognise from organised crime."
Who's got you in their pocket?
Nobody.
"Hari, we have you receiving phone calls linked to Danny's murder."
We have you lobbying to stay on Danny's squad.
We have your hands all over the firearm.
We have you consistently lying about Danny's activities.
We have a witness who says it was you who did all this and not PC Rod Kennedy.
We have you at the murder scene and we have you in possession of the instruments of Kennedy's death.
"Now, that's about the height of it and it's a great big pile of evidence that is going to crush you flat."
"Now, come on... .. you killed Danny Waldron, yes or no?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
Now we're getting somewhere.
We know you can't have been acting alone.
Help us help you.
Who gave the order to kill Danny Waldron?
Who was it?
It...
"Come on, who was it?"
Who was it?
You've got the bastard.
"Come on, talk."
- He never gave me a name.
- Who didn't?
The bloke I always spoke to.
"Uh, I went over what's left of the car with a fine-tooth comb."
I didn't find any evidence of a mechanical problem or even sabotage.
But?
"But... when I ran a full diagnostic on the car's controller area network-- that's, like, the brain."
Pretty much controls everything in the car these days.
"The CAN, I know."
It's a computer?
"Right, and just like any computer, it can be upgraded with new software but it can also be hacked-- made to do whatever the hacker wants it to do."
Like accelerate instead of brake?
"Yeah, in this case, exactly."
Somebody overrode the accelerator module wirelessly.
Told it to keep going faster.
"If done at the right time, there's nothing a driver can do."
And the right time is just as
"Jared entered the turn, which means he was definitely murdered."
"Yeah, it also means that whoever did this knows exactly what they're doing."
"No, what is she doing?"
"Why, what's up?"
Never mind.
But I gotta go.
"Hey, fill in Pride on what you found out, all right?"
Uh... okey-dokey.
TRACK ANNOUNCER:
And that's Scott Hamilton...
DANA:
"I wish I could help you, I do, but I don't know how."
PRIDE:
"Yes, you do, Dana."
There's no way you're Jared's girlfriend and didn't know something.
"Dana, your boyfriend was murdered."
Doesn't that matter to you?
"Of course it does, but I'm not gonna..."
"That's too bad, because we could use a break in this case, Frank."
"Three young women, all killed within the last 48 hours, all in the exact same manner."
"We're due a break, huh?"
You got any background on Callisto?
"Well, she used to take in these teenage, pregnant street girls."
"She believed in them, she redeemed them and just like Goodrich and Lundy, she was a good Catholic who used all of her time and energies to help others."
Damn him.
"- Who, the killer?"
- God.
Frank...
I really don't think you can ask God to damn himself.
OK?
"And if you are, move away from me."
I don't wanna get hit by lightning.
This is a new suit.
Why does God allow people to suffer?
Why exactly did he allow his own son to die in torment.
"He died to save the world, hmm?"
"But here we are, still, in an alley, asking questions with no answers."
"You know something Frank, you Catholics are all so tortured."
"I mean, you're just so prone to despair."
"Turning your back on God, that is the worst sin of all."
"Even I know that, Frank."
The worst sin in my book?
The killing that goes unpunished.
"The archdiocese would like to post a $25,000 reward to help find this killer."
"That's very generous, Monsignor."
But totally unnecessary.
"- In fact, it'll work against us."
- How so?
That money will bring out every screwball with a cashflow problem.
They'll all claim to have seen the murder.
You've been one of them all along?
I oughta knock you flat on your back!
"Well, I wouldn't blame you, Matthew."
"Truth is, you already floored me once."
You were never supposed to get to Mace.
That's why they partnered us - said I'd make sure you stuck to wild goose chases.
Mm.
"You see, I figured Malone's stepson was just another dead end."
"After all, the guy hadn't seen Mace since, what, 1924."
But then... (laughs) you had to muck everything up with that photograph and the Flora Dreidel connection.
"- I mean, who knew?"
"- I'm not laughing, Hacker."
"Neither are we, Matthew."
"Like Mace said, you impressed us."
The pin makes it official.
You passed the test.
You're Illuminati now.
But wh?
Goliath got away.
Your job was to get him there.
It's not your fault if old Mace couldn't hold him.
"- See you again soon, Matthew."
"- Yes, you will."
(under breath) And that's a promise.
"The big new accessory with eyeglasses seems to be that strap that connects so you can take them on and off which I don't get because if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses?"
"""You need glasses."" Isn't that what they say?"
An eye doctor doesn't say:
"""Would you care for some glasses?"""
People with crutches don't have a chain attached to their belt so they can just let go of them every now and then.
Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for water- skiing?
The thing could just...
Yeah.
"It was touch and go for a minute there, but I think she's gonna be ok."
You ever heard of something like this happening before?
"Unfortunately, all the time."
"They fill balloons or condoms with heroin, they have the kids swallow them, load them up with suppositories to keep them from moving their bowels for 2 or 3 days, then when they get to the contact,"
they force-feed them laxatives.
Uncle Joe.
Exactly.
This is nice.
Burton:
Very nice.
"To be here with family, it's nice."
Mm-hmm.
"So, Jeremy, how's school?"
"I go to the townsend academy, Uncle Burton, located in the lovely cumberland county, away from any civilization, where we enjoy a small teacher-student ratio, great college placement, and the constant aroma of cow dung."
[Burton chuckles]
Nick went to prep school.
Did you like it?
"No, not really."
"Jeremy, didn't you want to ask Nick about soccer?"
No.
Jeremy's on the soccer team.
"Yeah, that was months ago, mom."
We thought it would be fun to go down to the civic arena.
"They're going to have a professional indoor soc-- they don't want to do that, mom."
Maybe they do.
"You know, what is with you?"
Huh?
"Suddenly you want to, like, spend time with me, suddenly you're inviting cousin Ernie and Uncle Bert to soccer games."
"You want to pass the wine, please?"
You know what?
Allow me.
"I need to study Wickes' language, his body, and most importantly, his limbic, physical response the first time he hears the word AUTEC."
"And from that, I need to decide whether or not he's involved."
"Hmm, usually I just get 'em to say they did it."
It's easier.
"Breakfast the other night, did I or did I not deduce that you like powdered sugar and not syrup on your pancakes before the pancakes were ordered without you saying one word?"
I rest my case.
His hat was definitely blue.
I...
"I wrote in my notes, uh, (sighs) more royal, than navy."
I think that's correct.
"Oh, don't tell me you can't last longer than this."
GIBBS:
"We've been at this a long time, Mr. Wickes."
It's unfair to see a guy go through this for over two hours with nothing in return.
I want to help all that I can.
"See, he's a giver."
"Okay, keep 'em rolling."
Repeat after me:
How many employees from your company were aware of today's symposium?
A lot of your people know about this thing today?
WICKES:
Yes.
Why?
Are you suggesting that someone from my company could be involved?
"No, tell him it's unlikely."
Make him your friend first.
We'll get to that later.
Tell him.
Not likely.
Wickes Steel is going through a... (sighs) pretty tough time.
"But we'll push through, I mean, this company was built on simple pride."
My grandfather started with an idea.
- it doesn't mean she can't be as ruthless as the rest of us.
- Governor?
You ever stabbed a man in the navel?
You?
Me?
"No, I haven't."
"Stab a man in the navel, and that's all she wrote."
"Bleeding is so swift and severe, it wouldn't matter if Jesus put His healing hand on the wound... the bastard is dead."
We have to gut the bitch in the belly.
"We all have to understand, we're going to obliterate her life... but it will get you the vice presidency."
"- Hey, Dog!"
"- Lewis, how you doin'?"
"Wow, that's a plate of food!"
You didn't have to dress up for me.
I had to accompany the senator to the Gridiron Lunch.
"If John Q. Public could see the money that the knuckleheads that run this country... spend on these lunches, there would be a second revolution."
"I'm telling you, there is some money spent on these stupid lunches."
- What is this?
- It's the reason you're here.
You can't let anybody know where you got this from.
"If Runyon found out I gave this to you... he'd fire me, and I don't want him as an enemy."
That's Lainey Hanson getting gang-banged.
Looks like something out of Hustler.
That's her for sure.
I know it's hard to tell with her...
"her face in someone's crotch... but that's her, man."
Why are you showing me this?
I will not be party to an ambush.
"Why are you showing me this, Ted?"
Okay.
I want out of Runyon's office.
And I thought maybe you could get me on staff...
"Well, I'm going to Philadelphia."
"Well, I could take you as far as..."
That farmhouse there.
"And that's very nice of you, but maybe I'll just wait for some form of transportation that involves combustion."
I understand.
"But if you change your mind, I'll be at..."
That farmhouse there.
"Yes, but you see, if that's as far as you're going, then it does me no good."
That is true.
"But my intent was just, and my heart is pure."
Also does me no good.
"Frankly, that's the best darn pea soup I've ever had."
"Well, it's the soup that brings you in, but it's the pie keeps you here forever."
I was only three hours from home.
Oh.
Oh!
That is delicious!
What kind is this?
Pie.
Pie.
"Well, you know, with food this good, you must have people lining up to get in here."
"Truth is, we're probably going to have to close her down."
Irene?
I'm afraid it's true.
"I mean, ever since they built the new highway, folks kind of just blow by this town."
"You know, they wouldn't if they knew how good your soup and pie are."
I told you that.
"Okay, now, I don't know if this is anything, but when I was driving through Texas,"
"I started noticing all these signs advertising the world's best chili, and, like, every mile, there would be another sign that would say, like,"
"""100 miles to the world's best chili."""
"""99 miles. 98 miles."""
"So by the time I finally got there,"
"Idea given by dude is not bad, sir!"
Actually they do not know each other.
"- Meaning do you both have it, sir?"
That girl is my Facebook friend.
- Who is that girl?
Means..
Aunty.
"That is when I put message asking how she was, she replied saying her son is not well."
"When I went to hospital for consoling, some bloody guy took photos and published in the magazine."
Why don't you tell the same matter to madam clearly sir?
"You know about ladies, right?"
Yes sir.
They give life if believed and take lives when they get a doubt.
Thus we need to do something and see that Vasundhara doesn't get any doubt.
I would somehow catch that stranger and make him agree to act that husband character.
You convince your Facebook friend and somehow make her agree to act in the wife character.
We will make them both sit in front of the media.
Our problem will be solved.
"Thanks Karthi, you be on that job."
"- OK sir,"
"Master, you do your job."
Leave!
"Jayaraj, why has that IB officer come here?"
Which IB officer?
Him..
How is that guy an IB officer?
He is the son of my plant manager Ramachandra Rao.
He is the same officer who closed down your liquor factory and closed down your Hawala hub and also the one who hit your son and sent into coma.
I have seen him with IB Chief.
Shit.
Ramachandra Rao
- Sir.
(SCREAMING) mus GROANS)
I gather your brother explained to you how vital the work you're doing here is to the future of this city?
"Please, just let Four go."
If his well-being is of such concern then you should focus on the task at hand.
(JEANINE SIGHS)
"Tell me, do you appreciate irony?"
"You tested positive for Erudite, so you must have the intellectual capacity."
Irony?
"For instance, right now you're filled with hate."
But you need to pass an Amity sim.
(LAUGHING)
"Then there are other ironies at work, too."
Such as the fact that your cherished mother...
Don't.
...who you so dauntlessly saved in the sim is the reason you're in this mess to begin with.
You're the reason I'm in this mess.
Then there's the most poignant irony of all...
Stop.
...that Natalie Prior not only died trying to protect the data that
- I now have in my possession.
-Because you stole it from her.
You killed her for it!
Data that she so selfishly withheld.
But her own daughter.
Her beloved Divergent Tris is going to be the one to deliver it to me.
I said stop!
"Therefore, your mother's death, just like your boyfriend's death, will mean absolutely nothing."
(RUMBLING)
Don't pull her out.
Not yet.
JEANNE'.
NO.
I'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me.
"I can't do it without you, ok?"
"So you do whatever, but...that's it."
"-You need Henry, not me, right?"
-That's right.
I don't care whether you go or not.
"If it'll make him a better witness, I want you with him."
They don't want me.
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.
They can only get to him by getting to you or your kids.
If he goes into the program you're in danger.
-l don't know anything.
-Don't give me the babe-in-the-woods routine.
I've listened to those wiretaps and I've heard you talk about cocaine.
Conversation after conversation you talked to Henry on the phone.
It doesn't matter.
"Whether he goes to jail or stays on the streets, he's a dead man."
He knows it and you know it.
What about the kids and school?
"I mean, what goes on?"
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.
Whoever sold you those suits had a sense of humor.
What it comes down to is we're your only salvation.
"We'll save your life, his life, and we'll keep you out of jail."
This morning you told the jury about your background.
It was easy for us to disappear.
My house was in my mother-in-law's name.
My cars were registered to my wife.
My Social Security cards and driver's licenses were phonies.
I never voted or paid taxes.
My birth certificate and arrest sheet were all that showed I was alive.
"Caitlin, if you'll just listen..."
"I heard you, you're sorry."
I get it.
"Truthfully, I'm not sorry."
Tonight was the best night of my life.
Gary...
"Given the chance, I'd do everything exactly the same."
"Caitlin, honey, you coming ?"
"Oh, yeah, just give me one second."
"Okay, we'll wait for you in the car."
"Look, I should go."
"But I am into ice cream, and you're obviously hooked up as far as that goes."
And the makeover was pretty successful.
And the asthma attack had me completely fooled.
Sweet.
"So I guess once you guys get this place back up and running,"
I'll come stop by.
Gold Medal Ribbon on the house.
Best... earthquake... ever.
"Dr. Harris, are those my wife's tests ?"
"Oh, no, Mr. Cohen, it's going to be awhile before we get the results."
"Oh, of course, it's just a little bit too soon for that."
I know you have your hands full.
"Yes, we have a pretty full house right now."
"Well, as soon as you know anything, you know, good or bad... if you could please let me know."
"I will, of course."
"Let me know first, just so I can prepare my wife."
Of course.
Thank you.
"I mean, it's kind of crazy in that we have two other boys that are just going off to college, so we were expecting to have an empty nest, you know, when then, all of a sudden,"
"this unplanned, miraculous event and, well, uh, the fact of the matter is,"
"I can't imagine anything worse than an empty nest, so, uh..."
I will see if a way is clear to the hangar deck:
Okay:
"Hey, come on, Wilma, pull out of it:"
"I'm sorry, Buck, for falling apart like that:"
I guess I was just shocked seeing that... that thing disintegrate:
"Hey, hey, you all right?"
I will be:
Just being close to you chases the fears away:
"Just hold me, please:"
Just hold me close:
I'm so frightened:
"Buck, the engine room is clear of guards:"
"On the real Searcher, there is an access door from there to the hangar deck:"
Let's hope whoever or whatever duplicated the Searcher included that little detail:
You all right?
Sure:
Okay:
Let's keep our fingers crossed:
There they are!
The emergency access hatch to the launch bay:
- An empty chamber!
- It's a trap:!
Get back:!
They were waiting for us:
It's almost as if they knew our plans:
Maybe they did:
What do you mean?
Hawk is the one who suggested we try going through the engine room:
Isn't it a little suspicious that the guards happened to be waiting for us?
You are accusing me?
That is absurd:
You said yourself that something strange happened to Hawk: : :
She wants asylum.
"Mr. mooney, don't be fooled."
This is certainly not her first trip into the states carrying drugs.
"Her passport indicates she's been here twice before, and that's just this passport."
She's still a 10-year-old girl who needs a chance.
"I understand that, but I can't change the rules."
I'll pay Liz 1 and a half million.
"Ok, we need to get to 2."
[Whispering] 2 and a half.
2.5.
"There's nothing I'd like better than to pay Liz your number, but we're in the second straight year of an ad decline"
"Brian, Liz doesn't have to sell."
She's posting strong growth even in this slow time.
"I mean, let's face it."
This is the top ad firm in the city.
"Now either you want to do business with this woman, or you don't."
"All right, let me talk to my board."
Your board?
It was my understanding that you could get to yes.
I can.
Ms. hetherington offered you an exclusive first-look option because she believed that you would negotiate in good faith.
1.75 million.
"2.5 for that, she has to sign a 5-year employment agreement with strict non-compete terms."
"No, Brian, that ties up too much of her time."
"Without Liz, this company is nothing but phones and paper, and we'll expect her to get a life insurance policy."
"That's not a problem, is it?"
No.
"No, it's not a problem at all."
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Burton.
I'm confused.
Everything ok?
-Can you feel it?
"The fresh air, birds singing, the ocean, the bushes down there."
"-This is good for you, it is so nice out here."
"-It's nice in the city too, right Gustaf?"
-It really isn't.
Just imagine the amount of time you'll have to fix the house now that you're single.
"-Don't worry about the house right now, it'll work itself out"
"He's not single, they haven't separated yet."
"You're just on a little break, right?"
"-But still, break is fake."
"-The fact is it's routine, slow and steady."
"Just like you like it, dad."
-Can I talk to you real quick?
-It's like a dream.
It doesn't get any better than this.
- But that first time.
"- That first... well, that first... I think it's lasted till now."
Just the objects have probably changed.
But I'm still as keen.
"We have a new student, who I should like to welcome and I hope she will enjoy being with us to the end of the school year."
"Well, go to the blackboard."
Sit down!
Sit next to Marcel!
"He's calling her, isn't he?"
"Marcel, why did you want me to sit next to you?"
"I thought, I have to explain, when something comes up... I say something, so I sit alone, so we have a chance to laugh..."
Why do they laugh at you?
"I'm known for my remarks, they make everyone laugh."
I've heard you broke a plate and bumped into a cook.
"They were pushing, the plate fell and the cook ran for the deputy head."
I quickly picked up the bits...
It looks like it's working.
How long has he been sick?
"Oh, since he was three."
Kyle has polycystic kidney disease.
"We didn't know when we got pregnant, but James and I both carry an abnormal gene that causes PKD."
How long has Kyle been on the NTCC list?
Two year.
"But, uh... we just keep praying for a miracle."
So anyone suddenly come into a kidney?
The only folks that dropped off the transplant list died.
John Doe's kidney could've gone into someone from out of town.
Let's focus on finding the surgeon and the next buyer.
James McGovern?
"He was debt free, so to speak, until two weeks ago."
McGovern took out a second mortgage.
Cash advances on his credit card.
And drained Kyle's college fund.
- The TOF?
"- $125,000."
Which was wired yesterday into the personal account of our favorite local body snatcher.
Russ Bianco.
"Okay, I made a deal with James McGovern."
So you admit you sold him a kidney.
Did I say that?
"See, I don't think I said that."
"He wants to be a wise ass, let's let the feds deal with him."
"Yeah, they're gonna need someone to testify against me, so good luck. / You really enjoy playing god, don't you?"
I'm saving lives.
"I'm a hero, man, I'm the future."
I connect the needy with the need.
"Yeah, you're a real humanitarian using the poor as spare parts suppliers for people with money."
"The donor gets paid, a dying person lives, everybody wins."
"Come on, let's get down to the office."
"Hold your horses, i'm waiting here for a printer."
What printer?
A printer with a show bill of josie.
"Now look here, jim, you know more about injunctions than i do."
"Go on down to the office, i'll wait here for your show bill, if it's so important."
Will you?
It's not a bad idea.
And don't be afraid of him.
His bark is worse than his bite.
"Come on, luke."
"Come on, uncle daniel."
"Ohh... oh, stop moaning, will you?"
"Look here - if you don't smile, i won't go with you."
Come on.
"Won't you sit down, mr."
Boyd?
We'll not bother with formalities.
I had a reason for wanting to stay here.
Yes?
You know jim is spending more time on you than he does on business.
"Well, i'm sorry, but i've tried- look here, miss mansfield, there's only one thing in the world that's stopping jim fisk from being the richest man in this town."
That's you.
"He's in a tight spot, and if you're as smart as i think you are, you'll let him alone."
Even the right horse can't win if he's carrying too heavy a load.
"Excuse me, ma'am, the printer just brought this."
Thank you.
The 12 temptations.
And every one of them called josie mansfield.
All i can find in this erie charter is 40 different ways to issue stock.
And every one of them's padlocked by that pesky injunction.
"In 24 hours cornele will be sitting in that chair, cracking his bullwhip at me."
"You carry crime scene gloves now, too?"
"Well, it's become kind of a habit."
"No I.D. on him, McGee, other than the air marshal credentials."
"If I had your crime scene gizmo, I could get his prints."
Do you have any adhesive tape and baby powder handy?
"Wait, hold on, Bishop."
Is that Beer's wallet?
Yeah.
Killer took his credentials but not this.
"Driver's license, cash, credit cards-- it's all there."
What are you thinking?
He wasn't looking to play air marshal very long.
Just long enough to go to the airport to do what he needed to do.
"Whatever that was, he was obviously killed before he got the job done."
Unless his job was to kill Beers and take his identity.
And deliver his weapon to the airport.
But deliver it to who?
And why?
Why would someone deliver a gun just to end up dead himself?
Honor among thieves?
That's not really a thing.
Beers was a good man.
But our TSA screeners don't know every air marshal on sight.
New ones come through here every day.
At least now we know what all the chatter was about.
"But whoever's got the gun is outside, waiting to use it."
So we start searching passengers.
That's one sure way to force our killer's hand.
I was thinking of a less violent idea.
He had to walk right past us in the eight minutes we were waiting outside.
We have a surveillance camera pointed right at that door.
"Be right back, Bishop."
"You were not wasting funds to aid Madam Jami, who sponsors you?"
On what grounds do you accuse me of this?
The governor arrived a month ago to observe the state of things in Mujinju.
You served as captain of the Manbo Division.
How did you rise from such an insignificant post to the post of governor?
I know that Madam Jami is sponsoring you.
"I also know that you have yielded the operation of Dukjin Harbor to Madam Jami,"
and aided her in winning trade rights with China when she was involved in a mishap in Yangzhou.
Can you still say you have governed well?
"I am of a mind to report your wrongdoings to the imperial court, but I will overlook them as a courtesy to the former governor."
The new governor has arrived.
I know.
What am I to do now?
Why are you asking me that?
You should find your own way out of this mess.
Madam.
How could she do this?
Kim Chang-gyum knows a lot about you.
He could bring harm to you if you turn him away cold.
He lacks the courage to do so.
This is Madam Jami.
What brings you here?
I came to greet the governor.
Please wait a moment.
Madam Jami has been waiting for hours.
You should return for today and come back another day.
I will wait.
Governor.
Tell her I do not wish to see her.
"Yes, sir."
The governor wishes to see you another day.
Certainly.
You've brought me all the way up here to show me statues?
- Give them room.
"- ""Give them room""?"
(roars)
"Heads up, lads."
We've got a bit more company than usual.
So... you finally decided it was time?
Better late than never.
"So they've taken an oath to protect the city, as they once protected their castle centuries ago."
Except these days the people we watch over have no clue that we exist.
Aye.
And that's fine by us.
"Elisa's done well by you, Bluestone."
You've proven yourself a loyal partner and a righteous policeman.
"- And you'll keep their secret, right?"
"- Oh, I'll keep it."
But I want a favor in return.
Trust is not a commodity to be bartered for.
"Time you and I talked, Goliath... man-to-gargoyle."
"Goliath was nobody's fool, but Mace Malone had made it clear- if I didn't deliver the big guy to Hotel Cabal, I could kiss the Illuminati goodbye."
Don't you think it's about time you told us what's up?
Malone has an office in a condemned hotel.
All the entrances are sealed off.
"If Goliath can get me inside, I can find the proof I need to expose the Illuminati."
"We'll back you up, lad."
Just say the word.
"We don't want to lay siege to the place, Hudson, just sneak in and out."
- This job is for two.
- Make that three.
Not this time.
"If you trust me, Elisa, really trust me, stay out of this."
All right.
"Do you see what happened to that circle, sir?"
"When I dropped my hands, the circle dropped, too."
"Now, when I first saw Mrs. Daley's body,"
I noticed that she was wearing one of those tight-fitting dresses.
"And that the bullet hole in the dress was about an inch below the actual wound in her body,"
which meant that she had to be holding her hands up when she was shot.
"And she couldn't be running away, could she?"
"I mean, with her hands standing like this."
No one runs for their lives with their hands straight up.
"So, either she was walking with her hands straight up or she was standing still with her hands straight up when the gunman shot her in the back."
Very well done.
But I wish you had said something before about this.
"It would've saved us a lot of time, wouldn't it?"
"Well, we're back to our deliberate murderer, aren't we?"
And this time there's no doubt about it.
"Really, Lieutenant, really well done."
MAN:
"Ward, the car's ready to leave for the back lot."
COLUMBO:
This is what the police artist came up with.
WARD:
"Not much help, is it?"
"No help at all, sir."
I shouldn't have wasted your time.
"Well, I'll just let myself out."
Thank you very much.
Where is the...
Oh!
There's the door.
"Lieutenant, where do you think he got the costume?"
"Well, funny you should mention that, sir."
I've been asking myself that same question all day.
I love pancakes in the afternoon.
"- You like pancakes, Sofia?"
- I like pancakes.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Seem more like a napalm-in-the-morning-guy.
"Well, that too."
"I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to Sofia."
- It's a broad question.
- Who the hell are you guys?
"Sofia, we know that you spoke to Dawkins this morning."
"You seem like a reasonable, nice lady, who has made some bad relationship decisions, which I can totally relate to."
- So we're gonna give you a break.
- Yeah.
"I mean, this can really only go two ways."
"First, you sit down, you tell us what we wanna know, then you finish your shift and you go home."
"Second, is that we arrest you in front of all these nice customers and you lose your job."
And I gotta get my pancakes to go.
"Because you've been uncooperative, and helped a man who killed three people today,"
You go to jail for aiding and abetting a fugitive.
Why don't you take a seat?
You recognize this couple?
No.
Who are they?
"They're two tourists that your boyfriend attacked today,"
- Dana Thorpe and Craig Ellers.
- They're staying at the Kahiko.
- How do you know that?
- I have a friend who works there.
"Last time I went to see Walton, he asked me to call her, find out when those two were scheduled to check in."
That information got Dana shot.
"Look, he didn't say anything about hurting them."
"Therefore if we want to catch Ronaldo, we have to focus on Niko."
All right?
The whores change places often so as not to be noticed.
"According to Jésus' info, they were on quai de la Charente."
"So, starting tonight, we're camping there with sleeping bags and Thermos flasks."
What do we do about the Crime Squad?
- Nothing.
I want to be the only one informed about the investigation.
"It's every man for himself, and God for all."
Questions?
Finding the garage where he mutilated his victims confirms he was involved in Karine Lavergne and Célia Moreau's deaths.
A bench warrant has been issued for him.
"So, what do you think?"
I think you freed a man who killed two women.
You think like a prosecutor!
It's really good for the practice.
Do you know where he is?
"It's stupid, he came by yesterday."
"If I'd known, he was right here."
I'm not sure I understand you correctly.
You wanted to turn him in?
- A client on the run is worth nothing.
"However, a good trial..."
"It's this kind of case that I get up every morning for, Pierre."
"Everybody can fight for a victim, but it bores me."
"Fighting for a monster, though... that's exciting."
It's challenging!
"It may not be easy to hear, but welcome to the adult world."
Can you just tell me why you became a lawyer?
Don't you have an appointment at the court?
Yes.
What's the judge going to think?
That's it?
That's all she said?
Seriously?
You know what?
"Actually, Allie did tell me one other thing about you."
What?
Remember that night when you were freaking out about your history exam?
"She told me that she wished that you were there because when she was a kid and was nervous about something, you'd always climb into bed with her until she fell asleep."
"Yeah, that was before she became the second coming of the Boston Strangler."
- Allie.
- So you obviously don't know that I am batshit crazy.
"- Well, he does now."
- You're not batshit crazy.
You were batshit crazy.
"Allie, why didn't you tell him?"
"Compliments, everybody."
Compliments.
You turn to the person across the table from you and give them a compliment.
"Hugh, you start."
"Oh, okay."
"Luke, that's a heck of a shirt you got on there."
Thank you.
Uh...
"Um, I'm still a little stuck on this whole trying-to-kill-you thing."
"Yeah, me too."
I have schizophrenia.
"So, um, is that like the one with different personalities and...?"
"No, that's multiple personality disorder."
Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder.
"It doesn't normally make people violent, but it can impair their thinking, emotions, behavior."
I don't really know what that means either.
"Basically, I have hallucinations and sometimes I hear voices that tell me to do things."
"Oh, this is the pump!"
LEVINE:
Yup!
We're in the process of building all across the city.
This street right here used to be fully underwater.
During high tide you may need a canoe.
"And now what we did was we raised this road and you can see the difference, see how that area there kind of goes, slopes down a little bit."
DICAPRIO:
"So the main investment is in these systems right here, raising the roads and the electric pumps."
LEVINE:
"Yeah, this is a 400‐million‐dollar project."
City wide.
And of course we're paying for it by our city revenues.
"I had to raise tax revenue, which you can imagine is not a very popular thing to do as a politician."
DICAPRIO:
And this construction is it going to make a major difference.
LEVINE:
Major difference.
DICAPRIO:
And buy you a significant amount of time.
LEVINE:
"Absolutely I would think about 40, 50 years."
DICAPRIO:
That's it?
LEVINE:
Yes.

"Now one of the things I always say when people ask me this,"
"Mayor what about after 50 years, what's going to happen?"
"Well what we have to do is come up with solutions, and unfortunately we have a governor and we have a cabinet that doesn't believe that this is a major issue."
REPORTERS:
Officials in Florida were banned from using the words climate change.
So we get Hilliard to coach him.
"Some sort of a...on the spot ""dumb show"" so that the Yank knows what he's supposed to be doing."
"Gentlemen, I fear that there has been some sort of misapprehension."
I'm an actor.
By somewhat derided calling but mine nonetheless.
"Perhaps because we're engaged in an imitation of life, there's a common misconception, that anything living can do what we do."
"You have found not to be so, for which I offer my....sincerest consolations."
"I'm an actor, I know only my art."
Of teaching.
Of coaching.
"Of ""dumb show""."
"These things, I'm afraid, I know nothing."
I'm so sorry to disappoint.
Mr.Hilliard. You're right.
You're right.
Everything you just said.
It's about respect.
For the art and for the artists.
"And it makes me think, how wrong we've been, playing Uncle Frank for laughs."
"Yes, he's a drunkard and a clown."
But he's also all those people who gave their sons to one war and now their grandsons to another.
If we served that truth.
"If we gave you an Uncle Frank really worth your time and your talent,"
"I wonder, if you would consider putting that same time and talent with helping Mr.Lundbeck... and the picture."
Hm...
I don't think we've been properly introduced.
I'm Catrin Cole.
I'm one of the writers.
Catrin.
"Between us, we'll have them weeping in the aisles."
I need to let Ellis know that I won't be there for his opening.
I'll arrange a telegram.
Apple pie...
She put them in the porch to cool.
We had an apple tree in the backyard.
When coming from play and the porch would be filled with steam.
We couldn't have any pie until after dinner.
You were lucky baby she sounds like a real angel.
Listen I happen to have a free evening tonight.
I'd love you to come at my place I've done some changes.
I'd love to know what you're doing.
I'd love you for dinner.
"Well I have an appointment with a fashion photographer, I can't get out of it."
Well I'm glad your carrer is going so well.
The most interesting fact we found these killings occur during sexual intercourse.
"You don't know my mom was great, listen to this:"
One time she came out of the house for a ride.
And she was OK she was cool she was great.
"So she went out with this guy, this really straight guy, they went to this really fancy restaurant."
"You know, best in town!"
Right?
She was doing fine.
"And all of a sudden, man, she stood up on the balcony."
"She could be right up on the balcony man, and she pulled up her skirt and she looked at all the people and she said:"
"I'm Jesus Christ, man."
And I baptize you in the name of the son the father and the holly ghost and she pissed on every body.
It must have gone in the fucking food and everything.
Can you beat that?
Shit...
Then what happened?
Then they threw her back in.
Thank you.
"Get check, please."
Remember the last time you were off at the studio?
And love them more than you?
Never.
"Remember, in my life, in this world there will always only be one Harriet."
So get back to work...
you've lost nearly an entire day on your notebook.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter?
"Did I hear you say ""It doesn't matter""?"
Because I thought I heard you say
"""It doesn't matter,"""
"but Harriet wouldn't say that, would she?"
"Now come on... just because you're on your own, doesn't mean the world stops turning, or that there are no more fascinating people to observe and fill your notebooks with."
"That's your job, Harriet."
That's your job for life.
"And when you're all grown up and you sell your first novel,"
"I'll be first in line at that bookstore, getting my autographed copy."
I hope.
I'm not going to cry.
I'm not going to cry.
I'm not going to cry.
"Ah, it's okay to cry."
"But whatever you do, don't laugh."
"No, Harriet,"
"I will not tolerate laughter as I leave, no."
Hey... come here.
You remember... a good spy can get in there and fight.
"Good-bye, Harriet the Spy."
"I was kind of worried, you know?"
"I kind of thought, ""Well, there's something wrong with me or something,"" and so..."
"Growing up from girl to woman, there's so much to get used to."
This is the time when a whole new set of feelings unfold.
Feelings about yourself and your maturing body...
"Why would this guy come after me, man?"
I've never even seen the coins.
"He probably won't, but we don't know that for sure."
[Sighs]
Now all three guys involved in the jewelry store robbery were also involved in the killing of my parents.
I just found out Kimura was tied to them.
He might be the last link I have to find out why my parents were killed and who killed them.
Okay.
I got it.
"He's super dangerous, and you want to catch this piece of garbage alive."
I want him alone and not in an interrogation room.
So you want a little Grimm time?
Yeah.
I could probably help you with that.
I think I found just what you need.
"Says here this Grimm captured this Siegbarste with his trusty crossbow and an arrow filled with schlaftrunk, which is basically a sleeping toxin."
He was able to subdue the big fella with one shot to the neck.
And they were able to keep him alive?
"Uh, yeah."
"Just long enough to draw and quarter him, which is not actually as easy as it seems."
"You need a lot of ropes and chains and, like, a minimum of four horses, but all you need is some schlaftrunk."
Let's hope your aunt has some.
Got it.
How much do we need?
There's not much left.
[Flipping pages]
"Um, they don't really say in the book."
Here.
Well...
"If you're supposed to use an eyedropper,"
I'd say a little probably goes a long way.
It better.
He cares more about work than anything else.
Sounds like someone is dreading something.
"Well, he hates me."
So I can think of a number of places
I'd rather be.
(Dozer) Nothing good on the surveillance footage from the reception.
Unless you consider guests sipping Chardonnay and eating mini-quiches helpful.
That's Walker.
Staying next to the woman in the hat.
"He pretty much spent his time glad-handing and listening to people ""ooh"" and ""aah"" about his art."
That's all we got.
The tape finishes when the party ends.
Maybe it was sabotage.
"I mean, Walker's a pretty controversial guy."
"Yeah, maybe the theft was a political statement."
Someone did vandalize some of his pieces at an exhibit three years ago.
Never caught the guy.
"Well, the only thing is that this was his least controversial series in years."
Maybe we should be looking elsewhere.
(Walker) I don't believe this!
You're telling me someone just waltzed in here and stole my work?
"That's two years of my life, Marla!"
"Gus, honey, that's exactly what we're trying to find out."
"Mr. Walker, Special Agent Henson, FBI."
"What about surveillance, huh?"
"I mean, there's security cameras here everywhere."
Someone disconnected them.
"Actually, uh, they were turned off."
"Well, either way."
"No, not exactly."
"No, they weren't broken or disconnected."
They were shut down by someone with a password.
What?
What about Ajussi...?
He left home over ten days ago.
So you two are alone...
"Ah, I'm almost going crazy."
Then why not go to the orphanage to eat?
Why eat bread?
What if our friends find out that we're on welfare?
They'll make fun of us and call us beggars.
"Instead of everyone treating us like beggars, we'd rather starve and eat bread or noodles."
It's better to starve than to be pitied.
Anything is better than being called a beggar!
Sleep.
How can you make a sick child cry?
"Oh, what bad luck is this!"
"If there was nothing wrong with my leg, I wouldn't have asked you to come, so stop complaining!"
I hate places with no beautiful girls the most!
You're using your leg injury as an excuse to order me around.
Aren't you going to give me some sort of stamp?
The welfare office says that they don't have an application for the children.
"They said that the children cannot be added to the current waiting list, so they are currently starving."
The staff responsible aren't available at the moment.
Could you please wait a moment?
What are the children's names?
"Song Mi Jin, and Song Do Jin, living in Hongji-dong."
"From this information, they have already been registered for the meals."
It's from Sunshine Welfare.
Sunshine Welfare?
"Because the children are registered, there's a mark here."
Check it out.
11 million Won is transferred to this account every month.
"Ah, Shin Jae Dong!"
I'm just tired of feeling slightly terrified all the time.
It's not like I wanna be.
"Hey, look, it's going to get better."
Sean?
Noooo!
"If Jackson doesn't know what he's doing, then he probably"
He'd have to forget everything... the murder.
Or he doesn't remember.
What if it's the same kind of thing that happened with
Lydia when she took off from the hospital?
A fugue state?
doesn't know someone's controlling him.
Getting rid of the blood.
But he had help with one thing... the video.
And someone else helped him forget that.
Whoever's controlling him.
Are you sure Jackson has no clue about any of this?
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf and that being with
Lydia somehow delayed the whole thing.
So do we try to convince him he's not?
"If it helps us find out who's controlling him, then yeah."
Do you think he'll talk to us after what we did?
"Yeah, it's us."
He'll talk to us.
Right?
You will not go within 50 feet of Jackson whittemore.
You will not speak to him.
You will not approach him.
You will not assault or harass him physically or psychologically.
What about school?
You can attend classes while attempting to maintain a 50-foot distance.
"Okay, what if we both have to use the bathroom at the same time and there's only two stalls available and they're only right next to each other?"
Who are you?
I am Casshern.
"Luna,"
I'm going to kill you.
"Hey, for what reason were we born?"
"Hey, for what reason did our lives cross?"
"I'm scared because I don't know, so I take your hand"
"Right now, I want you to firmly squeeze mine back"
I try to escape this harrowing reality
Everything I hoped for in my life turned out to be an illusion
"A flood of emotions, struggles that lead me astray..."
"I just want to cling onto them and move forward, forward!"
"On these shattered hills, under a sky of rust, you and I are fraught with life like azure flowers"
"We dream that we're bubbles, nestled together, and yet I'm not ready to wither yet!"
"Hey, for what reason were we born?"
"Hey, for what reason did our lives cross?"
"I'm scared because I don't know, so I take your hand"
"Right now, I want you to firmly squeeze mine back"
That's the day the Ruin began.
"From the moment Luna was killed, the world as we knew it began its unstoppable descent towards destruction."
And the name of the man who killed her is Casshern!
Yes.
Casshern!
He must pay the price for what he's done to the world.
Kill him...
Kill Casshern!
Kill Casshern!
Kill Casshern!
Kill Casshern!
Casshern...
Kill Casshern!
"The harbinger of the Ruin of the world,"
"So, that's it?"
Nothing goes on my permanent record about causing anyone any trouble?
No.
And my record?
You might want to ask for this to be made part of your record.
"The school board was really pleased with the way you handled the matter, especially considering you're a student teacher and this was your first day of school."
"They thought you followed the rules and,"
"""Conducted himself in a professional manner at a time"
"""when it would have been easier to avoid filing a report."""
Nice.
But I think I'd like to keep it confidential and off-record anyway.
Done.
Read something they said about me.
Did they say anything about me like that?
"About how quickly I apologized, admitted I was in the wrong?"
"Um, uh, I don't think so."
"Let me see, um..."
"""Understandable, considering the stress Ben has been under during the past year and..."""
So forth.
What's the so forth?
You want to just leave this alone?
"I mean, we both caught a break here."
"No, I do not just want to leave this alone, if you don't mind."
"I would like to know about the ""and so forth."""
"Oh, they just understood that there might be some jealousy since you both had a relationship with Adrian."
Both had a relationship?
I was married to her.
He wasn't married to her.
He's not married to her.
I might get married to her.
I asked her to marry me.
What?
"Nearly got yourselves killed, poking around the ruins."
MacGyver and Atticus have found the Ark of Solon.
Isn't that amazing?
"So Atticus is still hunting for the mythical Atlantis, is he?"
Heh.
The man will never learn.
"But if the Ark is genuine, and the Torch is inside, it's the greatest find of the century."
Where is this so-called Ark?
"The Royal Academy, sir."
"Well, I'll go and see for myself."
We have to run some tests.
I'll meet you back at your hotel room.
Don't be long.
My flight back to Greece leaves this afternoon.
Nice talking to you.
The years haven't mellowed him.
No.
That's my grandfather.
I thought he never left Greece.
I made the mistake of telling him that the university had offered me tenure.
So he made a special trip to talk me into accepting.
"According to Simon, staying at the university will mature me, like I was a bottle of wine or a wedge of cheese."
"What's with this ""Simon"" thing?"
He doesn't like being called grandfather.
Says it makes him feel old.
Simon's planned my whole life.
"It's all right for him to spend his time digging in ancient ruins, but I'm supposed to stay at the university and have a solid career."
"Which, roughly translated, means a safe career."
"Well, what do you want?"
A challenge.
Right now teaching is just repeating what I already know.
"I want to get out, see the world, learn new things."
"First page, no context, but you throw in a couple more, suddenly you're announcing the weaknesses of every port on the Eastern seaboard."
"Cyber division couldn't ID the source of the breach in AUTEC's firewall, but they did tell us the blackmail message was e-mailed from..."
Wickes Steel.
"Last month, the Navy said that they were done with Wickes."
"Good-bye government contracts, hello bankruptcy."
"So, the blackmailer is Phillip Wickes?"
GIBBS:
It's his company.
He's got a pretty good motive.
But how is pretending to shoot SECNAV going to lead us to our blackmailer?
RYAN:
"Seeing his childhood friend shot,"
Wickes is highly vulnerable.
The idea is to tell him that we've connected the shooting to Wickes Steel and AUTEC.
"If Wickes is part of this blackmail, then he's going to want to know why his people pulled the trigger."
Eyes and ears on this guy 24/7.
Anyone he connects with is a suspect.
What if Wickes isn't involved?
"Oh, he'll tell us something, even if he doesn't intend to."
Got your earpiece.
"No, I don't need you in my ear, Doc."
(chuckles) You know what you need.
"Oh, yes I do."
Really?
Yeah.
"Hey, you think you don't need me,"
"Agent Gibbs, but you're wrong."
But now I'm curious.
What do you need?
"Well, that question works both ways."
"I need you to go in there, and man-to-man, establish a bond with Wickes."
"I need you to say what I tell you, when I tell you."
"If I'm declared unfit for duty, then she takes over."
"Captain, if you won't come with me, I'll be required under Starfleet Order 104,"
"Section C, to relieve you of command."
"I expected something like this from her, but not from the two of you."
Corporal.
I've already confined two senior officers today.
His neurochemistry appears normal.
There's nothing wrong with him?
This scan is hardly conclusive.
I'll need to get him into the Imaging Chamber and run a complete neurological series.
"When Hoshi sends that distress call, every Xindi ship that picks it up will start heading this way."
He's got Hayes on the bridge...
macos posted all over the ship.
"Whatever we do, we're going to have to do it fast."
"What are you proposing, Commander?"
I think it's time we throw the rule book out the window.
Captain.
"I'm sorry, sir, no visitors."
You let me in before.
I have new orders from Major Hayes.
"Look, T'Pol was a little rough with me during the last session."
I think she caused some nerve damage.
"You'll have to speak with the Major, sir."
This is a Starfleet ship.
I don't have to ask Major Hayes for anything.
"Step away, sir."
"Stand down, Corporal."
"The captain gave Hayes control of the bridge, posted macos on every deck."
Is he still on the surface?
Yeah.
Retrieving him and the antimatter should be a priority.
I'd advise securing the bridge first.
There's seriously not one single job that doesn't require prior experience.
"What about prior experiences, you know,like experiencing the nitty-gritty of real life?"
You should say that on your next interview.
"Yeah,I'm taking advice from the chick who bases her decisions on vomit and bird poop."
"Dude,cinnamon graham crackers?"
I grabbed without looking.
"Cyrus,why can't you just take that job at the nursing home?"
"Because when I went to visit my grandmother, one of the old ladies sexually harassed me."
And the hospital director has the balls to say it's my fault 'cause I dressed too sexy.
I don't need that.
Hey.
"Baby,what did you want for breakfast, but you just couldn't have?"
S'mores.
"Oh,baby... why did you get the cinnamon ones?"
Oh...
Want to come to a show with me tonight?
It'll suck.
"You know what,I would, but,um..."
I can't.
You can't come to a show because your crotch shed?
What do you think?
"I was the afraid the Hitler made me look too fat,so I went with Gandhi."
- You want my honest opinion?
- Of course.
"My main thought is,really?"
"I mean,come on already."
You ladies and your advanced grooming.
When did having a vagina become a full-time job?
"You know how much pressure you're putting on the lazy,pain-fearing Lincolns of the world?"
I'm just giving it a try.
Relax.
"I'm sorry,but you teach high school history."
"Ram G, kill them."
"- What to kill, my Dosa?"
What man..
"He is not your CI Ram G, but my master."
What are these twists over twists like one plus one offer sir?
"To know about your schemes daily, I locked your Ram G in and put my master in his place with you."
That third box is waiting for you.
IB chief is safe.
"Once my brother opens his eyes tomorrow, one non-bailable warrant will be issued on your name."
Your meter will be shattered with that.
"Sir, he is a real fighter and is thus hitting very strongly."
We are left now with just one way.
We will escape to foreign in special flight.
We will have many sites there.
I will not leave the guy who killed my son.
"Sir, ruthless fellows like you should not have such revenge and emotions."
He showed me my son's corpse.
I will show him what I am.
Hello..
Where is my dad?
Ramachandra Rao
Sir..
"Ramachandra Rao, I called to say a few facts about your son."
What has he done sir?
- He has done a lot.
He sacrificed his education for his sister's education in his childhood.
Did you not understand?
"Knowing you cannot educate both, he purposefully scored low marks."
"As you cannot make your daughter as a Collector with your income alone, he became a stuntman."
After arranging everything for an opportunity to make your daughter an IAS..
He handled it carefully without your knowledge.
Do you know why?
I kept it so distant.
( blasting effect )
( screams )
( screams )
"All this madness... the destruction... the human suffering... I, too, was trapped in the whirlwind we created--"
an empty mirror filled with hate.
I expected God to reach down and stop me but He never did.
Please... please say something.
Please help me.
"So I said to her, ""hey mom your birthday was last month, hoist it up yourself""."
"I don't get it, what are they laughing at?"
"Anyway, I'm not saying my mom is overweight, she's got that flabby skin under her arm."
You know what I'm talking about.
"Well, the other day this wind picks up, this stuff starts jiggling out dropped a tricycle I lost when I was seven."
Excuse me.
Perhaps you can help me out.
"Those things you said about your mother,"
I don't understand why they're considered funny.
"Well, um.."
- Is it because the toned arms that once cradled you securely now have large deposits of cellulite hanging from them?
Is aging funny?
- If you think about it..
"And you, is it all the alcohol you're consuming that makes it okay to laugh at the expense of your loved ones?"
He's right!
I love my fat mama!
And you're a bad man!
"Dr. Albright, have you ever lost a tricycle in your mother?"
"Please Dick, I am in a cruddy mood."
This fundraiser is turning out to be a nightmare.
"Well, why are you laughing?"
You just said you were in a cruddy mood.
Don't bring an Austrian back with you from your holiday.
I'll bring an Italian.
"Or, God forbid, a little Austrian."
"Marcel, keep your stupid remarks to yourself!"
"Just wait, if someone comes."
You shouldn't have said that!
Such girls can be easily duped by some older... I'm telling you that from experience.
That's no trivial matter.
Why are you surprised?
Can't I have experience of young people?
"As it happens, we met some young people in a bar... a group of young girls, I don't know what attracted them, an old man knows how to..."
So what attracted them?
I don't know either.
"Nor do I, but they rose to the bait."
Such girls easily let themselves...
"A young girl rises to the bait, and an older man..."
"That young girl can take it idealistically, but the greedy old tomcat needn't."
- l know that very well.
- What do you know?
Tell us.
What should I tell you?
"I was in Bratislava... I'd compare it to the white nights in Moscow, but Bratislava wasn't Moscow."
"I'm an idealist from that point of view, I can imagine it, and I led that girl on to the point where..."
- What's up?
- Can't I look at you?
What you're saying surprises me.
It surprises you?
Better not take the tips.
It doesn't look good.
"They give it to the chamber maid, but we don't have to rely on it."
Who knows what they would think of us.
- l shouldn't take them?
"Tell me, what does this girl have that you don't?"
You mean besides millions of dollars and an abusive rock-star boyfriend?
That's what's wrong with our society.
"See, we emphasize beauty to such a degree, it's downright unhealthy."
"Hey, look, a pill to stop hair loss."
"Hey, Salem."
Want to see the dress that's going to get me elected
Queen of the Snowflake Ball?
Put it on.
"But I should warn you, I can be catty."
It's the only one they had;
isn't it perfect?
Except for the fact that it's one size too small.
I see.
"In your world ""perfect"" means ""doesn't fit."""
"And since it's an Other Realm original, it can't be altered."
Really?
Now I know why the Other Realm trails behind Paris as the fashion capital.
"Okay, well, if I can't alter the dress,"
I'll alter myself.
I'll diet.
"I've never done it before, but how hard can it be?"
"Yeah, the fact that weight-loss products comprise a billion-dollar industry is probably just a funny coincidence."
"Good morning, Sabrina."
How would you like your eggs?
"Oh, as far away from me as possible."
I'm on a diet so I can fit in my new dress and be elected Queen of the Snowflake Ball.
"Hmm, and if you go down two dress sizes, you can get into an Ivy League school."
You're fine just the way you are.
Fine?
Harvey and I are competing with two other really cute couples.
Fine is going to come in third.
Do you even get what you've done?
Mom is furious.
Kitty and Justin are reeling.
"I mean, Sarah is mortified."
As am I. As is Tommy.
Did you stop and think for a split second how bad this makes us look?
I wasn't thinking about you.
- You weren't thinking of anyone!
- I was thinking about your mother.
You had absolutely no right to do this without consulting us.
I have every right.
She's my sister.
You wouldn't do the same thing if it were Kitty or Sarah?
"I wouldn't single-handedly sell out the rest of my family, no."
"You weren't there, Kevin."
"She was sitting in front of me, opening up her heart to Holly."
Berating herself for misjudging her.
She expected me to tell her that she was doing the right thing.
"And I will be damned if I will let her make herself vulnerable in that way, only to have her world come crashing down again."
You better hope this family finds a way to repair itself.
"Because if this does any lasting damage,"
I'm holding you responsible.
I learned something interesting today.
You know the San Francisco cable cars are the only moving national monument?
Didn't know that.
I've told you every time I sleep with somebody I work with.
- You can't tell me we have a sister?
- Half-sister.
"For the 400th time, Kitty, I am sorry."
- I don't know what else to say.
- I thought you were gonna table this.
"- Yeah, so did I!"
"That's just exactly what I've done, sir."
In fact... (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
"Could you open this, sir?"
I still don't have the knack.
"I would like for us to know, Lieutenant, the meaning of this."
"Sid, please."
"He asked me where you were, Lieutenant."
I hope it's okay that I told him.
May I ask what this was all about?
"Oh, there's the sweater."
Does it match up with the thread?
I think so.
"We gotta take it down to the lab, though, Lieutenant."
It's the only piece of clothing that even came close.
"I don't know what you're talking about, Lieutenant, but I do know that suspicion is being deliberately cast on me and I can guess by whom."
"Well, sir, I won't deny that Lieutenant Lucerne..."
Will you stop calling him Lieutenant Lucerne?
He's a television detective.
You can't conduct an investigation based on his suspicions.
"Well, sir."
I did have a reason beyond his suspicions.
"You see, the gun that killed your wife, sir, had a little piece of thread that got caught on the trigger."
"I'm afraid, sir, that that thread came from this sweater."
A thread from my sweater?
"Yes, sir."
Mohair.
And the lab said navy blue mohair.
And I remembered that was the color of the sweater that you were wearing the first day that I met you.
The morning after she was murdered.
But that's incredible.
"Yes, sir, I agree with you."
But I've always had a good memory for colors.
"Rescue Bots, good luck!"
It is an honor and a privilege.
Over here.
"Cody, come here!"
"- Hey, Doc, Frankie."
- Isn't this exciting?
The techs like nothing I've ever seen.
"Thank you for coming, folks."
"I'm not talking about the rescue stuff, I'm talking about this."

"Now, thanks to our friends in Washington,"
I give you... the latest in emergency response... the Rescue Bots!
"Robots, transform!"
These robotic rescue vehicles will streamline our resources.
"Now one human teamed with one robot can do the work of an entire police force, fire department, emergency response unit"
and engineering core.
"Each robot is programmed to respond only to the commands of its handler, so you can sleep at night knowing that Griffin Rock is protected by the very best technology and humanity have to offer."
"Hey, that robot moved on its own."
"You, kid."
"Can you move, I want a photo of Burns family of heroes."
This is the Chief.
Go ahead.

"Hey, I didn't tell to do that."
"It's new technologies, son."

"Come on, faster!"
We'll be outruned by a bulldozer.
I do not understand.
Not so slow.
That's the big threat.
Sharks the world over are being killed by the million.
They reckon 150 million sharks are killed every year - every year - just for shark fin soup.
Things like this are a by-product.
"Most of them just get caught and the fins get cut off, and they get thrown overboard, often alive, so most of the shark is wasted, and in these cases they just take the jaws, which they sell to tourists."
And there are so many of them.

"Just from lying, you know..."
"Weird.Stephen, are you coming?"
"Yes, sorry, just chatting to the ladies and gentlemen."
Ah...
"Oh, dear..."
Hello.
It'll be dark soon.
"Oi, less of it."
Ouch.
"Oh, I see."
"Oh, dear, excuse me."
Ow!
"For goodness' sake, it's impossible."
"Yeah, exactly!"
Ow!
Have mercy on my poor flesh.
"Say if it starts to hurt.Oh, yeah, that's usually what I mean by ""ow""!"
"That was lovely, really good."
"We were lucky to see one, cos they're so well camouflaged, aren't they?"
"They really are, especially when they stretch themselves out - they become like a caterpillar."
They do.
Hm.
"Well, you're having the best of the argument so far."
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
"I'm George Parker, travelling with my wife Agatha and my niece Louisa."
We're Methodist missionaries.
Any more of us lot around?
"Tell me, Major, why was the colonel trying to draw you away from the canyon?"
- Draw me away?
- Yes.
I speak quite good French.
I heard him tell his men to set fire to the village to draw you away from the canyon.
That chest.
"You've lost that chest, Major."
I will give you one hundred guineas in gold and safe passage to America.
America!
That'd be nice.
"But you see, the King of England owes me last month's wages."
There is no way I could rest easy in America knowing that bastard owed me a shilling.
You would die for a shilling?
That's what I signed on to do.
"You will have to do it, then."
It's a grand day for it.
"Chapter and verse, Rifleman Harper."
"Well, sir, I met this old fella who was dressed like an undertaker, sir."
There were two other fellas with him

"- Oh, you're photogenic, okay."
Let's see if anybody's home.
Just calling for you.
"Oh, that was kind of you."
"No camera, please."
- No camera?
- No camera.
"No, I understand."
"I know you were skeptical, so I wanted to show you my birth certificate, which, um, you know..."
My bris certificate?
I don't have that.
What do they do?
"That's okay, I understand."
"Not that I'm proud of being... but I'm trying... '74, right, and you..."
"the two of you were there at his funeral, right?"
"But people in the family really didn't know that he was an internationally known architect, did they?"
"Does that mean no money to show for it, you mean, or what?"
Why did they think that he traveled the world and he didn't amount to anything?
I grew up not knowing anything about Lou's family and the Jewish half of my background.

"Something else was happening, though."
Details about my father were coming back to me:
"his voice, the rough feel of his scars."
That was one of my favorite stories.
I made him tell it to me over and over.
He was three years old back in Estonia.
There were coals glowing in a stove.
He was captivated by the light.
He took the coals out and put them in his apron.

She never reply my message.
"Xiaotian,"

She is okay.
Don't worry!

"Let us take care of Yawang, no problem!"
"Shu Yawang, two days ago, an intentional homicide uccured in Haide Industry Group."
You are here today to help cooperating with our investigation.
"Shu Yawang, why were you there when the case happened?"
What is your relationship with the victim?
There is another man in the scene.
What is your relationship with that man?
Where is he now?
Here is the new update.
"One month ago in our city, the murder case that happened in Haide Industry building, has ne development."
"Yesterday, a woman suspect has been held by police."
"Since the suspect is pregnant, the police has kept her in custody waiting for trail."
"For further development about this case, our channel will continue to follow up and report ."
How is the bastard?
His life no longer in threat.
"However, it may does not sound good for Xiamu."
How about Xiamu?
"If he gets caught, for attempted murder, the minimum sentence will be 7 years or so."
Is commuted sentence possible?
"If Qu Weiran gives up further charges, it might be possible."
"But... based on this situation, it seems impossible."
This is your son's baby.
We were 15 and 16 during that time.
I didn't know he was going to turn out to be such a great pianist.
"If I hadn't got shot in my finger,"
I would probably still be playing the guitar.
What?
Really?
That's fucking crazy.
How did that happen?
"Well, this guy was pistol-whipping the singer of my band."
This was a problem.
"His mamae was cutting some meat, and she told me if anything happened to him while he was on the road with me,"
"""I'm gonna chop your cajones off."""
I remembered that.
It kind of freaked me out.
"Anyway, when I was hitting the guy, the gun went off."
It was really crazy.
"They sewed it back on, but they didn't, ya know, do the greatest of a job."
But that's life.

The Neville family was extremely important to our music.
"I mean, they are the first family of funk."
"At times I'd come into the living room at my house, and there he was standing up in the living room talking to my brothers."
All these cats was great.
Sometimes I would be handed the drumsticks.
I always prayed that I could make people feel the same way Ray Charles made me feel.
Those cats would always make a good blend.

It was slamming.

Lee Kyeong Wan is in the country now for a meeting with his members.
He has participated in various voluntary activities to improve his image.
A significant amount of his supporters consists of women.
He is now the chairman of the Committee of the transportation construction.
"From my source, I know that the approval of his maritime project was bribed."
He is now being investigated.
I checked with his lover.
It seems that the government's side also got some money.
He abandoned his former members who at least had ethic values.
Just get rid of him.

You don't want me to do that.
That knitting thing is uncanny.
How do you do that?
"Market research, my friend."
Years and years of market research which led to my greatest triumph... the trivection oven.
Oh.
My wife wants one of those.
"Can we get Pete an oven, please?"
"The GE trivection oven cooks perfect food five times faster than a conventional oven because it uses three kinds of heat... thermal technology for consistent temperature,"
"GE precise air-convection technology for optimal air circulation, and microwave technology for incredible speed."
"I was trying to hide it from him, but then..."

He's our friend.
I'm not gonna debate my father's mental state with you.
I'm grieving.
I think you know what it's like to lose a father.
Don't bring my father into this.
Why not?
Our fathers were a lot alike...
"Smart, strong-willed, and both died prematurely."
"You're right, Lex."
Lionel did die too soon.
I want to know the truth about how he died.
The truth is... our dads were alike in another way.
They both felt that you were the kind of son a father could be proud of.

She sued him for emotional distress.
She couldn't sing for a month.
"And here, four years ago, another broken engagement."
He sued her for trying to get him fired.
"Well, they looked pretty cozy here."
"Oh... ""It was truly the season to be nice and naughty."""
"""Your little elf, Gillian."""
"Christmas, 2004."
"Ah, they get engaged, they break up."
They get back together.
But she can never quite land him.
Maybe this time she figured out how.
Gillian and Philip applied for a marriage license just two hours after his arraignment.
This is what she bartered her testimony for?

"I am an admirer of you and wish to tell you of an experience,... which might interest you."
"I am Francesca, 28 years old and... married to Paolo, seven years older than me."
It all started like a game of chance.
"One night, whilst we made love,... my husband whispered in my ear."
"""My dear, would you like to do it with someone else?"""
"I felt offended, but on the inside my blood was boiling."
"The idea of being unfaithful plunged me into a state, of a great sexual arousal."
You have never seen anythink like it.
Leave me at peace.
-Who can think of things like that?
"-Stop it, paolo."
This is nothing but a fantasy of yours.
It is not my desire.
"But soon, the fantasies became insufficient."
"So to prove that he had doubled my pleasure,..."
"I accepted, a little reluctantly, to go to a place where my husband... said, we would experience a different kind of evening."

"Would you know, sir, whether or not she was seeing somebody?"
"I don't mean to get personal, but somebody whom she might be emotionally involved with?"
"Claire was devoted to her work, Lieutenant."
She wasrt any more interested in lovers than she was in her husband.
It made for a pretty miserable marriage.
"Well, still, you must've gotten along pretty good."
"I mean, you were partners in business."
Partners?
"That was on paper, Lieutenant."
Claire fought me on everything.
She had to have things done her way.
"If I said white, she'd say black."
All you have to do is take a look at this new Ward Fowler contract.
Paying an actor that kind of money is insanity.
"Now, wait a minute."
Let me get this straight.
Are you saying that you didn't wanna pay him that money?
I think they should have turned him down.
I think he would have folded.
But Claire argued me right under the table.
I was an idiot for giving in.
"Now, if this show takes a dip they'll drop it."
I still don't understand.
You and your wife were partners.
"Now, isn't it to her best interest not to give him all that money?"
"In anything involving Ward, she always took his side."
"Forgive me for asking this, sir."
I seem to remember stories that at one time they were pretty close.
Are you suggesting that their relationship was still pretty close?
Yeah.
"But not the way you mean it, Lieutenant."
"Oh, sure, they'd had a big romance, but by the time I came into the picture, it was dead."
Lionel deserves better.
At least we know how Lionel truly felt about you.
He thought of you as his second son.

And now Lionel's been murdered for protecting my secret.
They did die for you.
"But ultimately, they died for all of us."
There was a reason those men were in your life.
Each of them added something to the man that you are today.
How can Lex have done it?
How does a son... murder his own father?
Total absence of love.
Some say that's the definition of evil.
"You have to get those keys away from Lex, before he kills anyone else."
He's not gonna have the chance.
I won't let him.

And don't bother telling me how much you cared about the guy or what an art lover you are.
"Don't underestimate my appreciation for the finer things in life, Angela."
And don't underestimate my skepticism of you offering to help.
I'll pass along your condolences.
Fine.
I need to see Walker's files.
And you think I'd disrupt a crime scene for that?
Just hear me out.
"When the exhibit was vandalized,"
I put Walker in touch with an associate of mine.
Name?

I promised Fredel that I would make sure there was nothing compromising about him in Walker's papers.

That's the name of the organization I was working for.
"Its goals are the research and development of the latest weapons, and the testing of them in actual combat."
They would even create regional conflicts to do so.
A large number of Amalgam sympathizers have permeated the hard-line factions of every nation.
"There are a lot of guys in both the East and West who want to create a Cold War, and maintain a demand for munitions."
"Is that organization involved in the turmoil here, too?"
"No, this is my own handiwork."

"And if they don't get her, she'll just get killed by Amalgam's Task Force."
Task Force?

"It was so well-made, I thought it was to show you."
Yoon Jae is really energetic so he likes to work out.
That's right!
He needs to be really energetic and work on it at least 2 hours a day to get this body!
"If it's like that, then do you really have to set aside 2 hours a day just to exercise?"
Without a doubt.
"During that time, he could have met you."
He claims to be busy at work but can find the time to exercise.
It seems like he likes his abs better than you.
"He always said he was busy, but I guess he had time for exercise."
"So, whenever he said he was busy and out of time, was it all just an excuse?"
Did he just not want to meet me?
What do you mean he didn't want to meet you?
That day he was going to come meet you!
"He said he was meeting you to tell you something, too!"

They can't possibly think that Flack's responsible for Todd Fleming's death.
"I mean, he is so by the book."
He doesn't even swear.
None of us are happy about this.
"In the meantime, IA's got a job to do and so do we."
"All right, well, Fleming's been ruled out as a suspect in Coach Nelson's death."
"According to his mother, he was taking an SAT prep class at the time of Vince Nelson's murder."
The police confirmed that.
"Still working on the sawdust, but based on extracted hydrocarbons,"
I've narrowed it down to three families.
Good.
Stay with it.
"Yeah, well, I wasn't so lucky with the Christmas wrapping paper."

I also found this fleck of blood adhering to the skin at the contusion site on the vic's throat.
"And unlike the blood around the wound, this particle was deposited when it was already dry."
Which means it could've come from our killer.

Fugitive's name is Walton Dawkins.
"He's originally from the mainland, but he did ten years at the Allen Correctional Facility in Cleveland for multiple home invasions."
Apparently our guy likes hitting families with big money.
Then he violated his parole by coming to Hawaii six years ago.
My guess is it wasn't for the surf.

But get this:
"according to the warden, he's been a model prisoner up until now."

"Then tell me, what can he show her?"

"You have your little finger here, like this and now..."

But stretch your hand a bit.

"And you, Admiral, your double was cruel and inhuman like a Captain Bligh:"

"Yes, Buck, what was the imitation Wilma like?"

Loose-leaf is perfect.
Scribble it with crayon.
Save the money.
Just send me a piece of paper that's got the date of the wedding and tell me if you're gonna have alcohol at the reception or not.
"Because if you're not gonna serve alcohol at your wedding reception, show some balls and put that on the invitation."
Find out the hard way how many of your friends and family... truly give a fuck about your wedding.
You get to a reception...
"""Yeah, I'II take a beer."""
"""Oh, we don't have any alcohol."""
"""Then what the fuck did I just sit through?"
"A shitty play?"""
That's what a wedding is.
A wedding is a shitty play.
"The only people who like it are in it, like all plays."
"Everybody else is in the audience like,"
"""Twenty more minutes, we are getting fucked!"""
"""Not at our wedding!"
"We invited Jesus."""
I was at a wedding.
You were sailing to South Africa and I was getting better.
"I kept thinking about us,"
about when we were going to see each other again.
telling to myself that I was fighting for both of us.
"And then somebody had to tell me that you never got to your ship,"
"that it was you, the guy on the highway who was in the crash and that the new heart beating now in my chest, it was your's."
I'd prepared myself to the idea that to live someone had to die.
That it wouldn't be fair.
I used to tell to myself that this person will still living in some way thanks to me.
That's exactly what happened.
"Yes but, you are here, and you're not, and I talk to you, and I can't touch you."
"Of course you can, I'm right here."
And you know Simon...
You gave me the best gift ever.
The rest of your life.
This is the dock where I left my ship.
"Alright,"
I'm going back in for a swim.
Are you coming ?
"Are you sure, you don't want to come ?"
The waters never been so good.
"Please, come on..."
You nerver want to and then when you get in you love it.
I'll join you.
"In 2010 in France, 15 613 persons were waiting for a tranplantation"
Only 4708 could have one.
"Because of the improvement of the transplantation techniques, the demand keeps increasing."
The main reason for the lack of organs is that we don't know the will of our loved ones about it.
A donor can save 4 lives.
Let's talk about it...
Go!
"Desires you to attach his son who has ﬂed from his father, from his hopes"
And with a shepherd's daughter.
- Where's Polixenes?
Speak!
"- Here, in your cily"
"To your court whilst he mas hastening, meets he on the way"
The father of this seeming lady and her brother.
O my poor father!
- You are married?
"- We are not, sir, nor are we like to be."
"- My lord, Is this the daughter of a king?"
"- She is, when on she is my wife."
That on I see by your good father's speed will me on very slowly.
"Beseech you, sir, step forth mine advocate"
At your request my father will grant precious things as triﬂes.
I will to your father.
Come.
"'And so as the two kings met, the old shepherd's box and bundle were opened 'and the secret of Perdita's birth revealed at last."
"'The oracle had been fulfilled, the King's daughter had been found."
"'Great was the rejoicing, 'though it was a rejoicing tinged with sadness."
"'And away they all went to see a newly finished statue of Hermione, 'whose cruel loss had been mourned for sixteen years. '"
Here me those I have done good to against my will.
"I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed."
"Prithee, son, do."
"For we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen."
Thou will amend thy life?
"Ay, an it like your good worship."
"Come, follow us."
we will be thy good masters.
"O Paulina, we came to see the statue of our queen"
Here it is; mes it not something near?
Her natural posture!
Your father and I never had a childhood.
Nothing came easy for us.
Ever.
"You are so lucky, Paige."
Mop and bucket are in the basement.
You know who I am?
I do.
Then we can forgo the pleasantries.
This war has gotten very personal for me.
"And I need you to listen carefully, because it affects you too."
I'm listening.
I'm in a lot of trouble... because your Soviet foreign minister won't accept... that Vlad Kosygin was the tragic victim of a mugging gone wrong.
I could lose my job... or even go to jail because of it.
If either of those things happens...
I'll make sure you go down with me.
"Uh, nothing."
Thank you.
Before he disappeared...
Richard Patterson gave a very detailed testimony... about his kidnapping and torture by two K.G.B. Illegals.
The second my punishment is handed down...
I'll release his classified testimony to the press.
"Now, think of what that will mean... for you and your people at the Rezidentura... all those deportations."
Moscow will not be pleased... when they have to rebuild their U.S. Operation from scratch.
As we like to say in America... heads will roll... your head being at the top of the list.
"So... you see, my problem... is now your problem."
"I heard so much about you, Mr. Gaad."
I hoped that one day we would have the chance to meet face-to-face.
I just wish... it was under less trying circumstances.
Good day.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"You are here because the K.G.B. Is targeting you, your family... everyone and anyone you care about."
Dr Alexander could take it if you agree.
Fine.
I'm happy to be of help.
OK.
Dave Stubbs attended a family funeral on December the 7th.
It was a Tuesday.
Can you remember where you were?
Yes.
I was here.
In London.
I remember that much because he asked me to hold the fort while he went to his grandmother's funeral.
Grandfather's.
Whatever.
He said he'd be attending a funeral.
"Well, we have found your editor."
Gosh.
Where?
In Africa?
"No, in a grave near his parents' home in Surrey."
He was buried alive.
How extraordinary.
"What's particularly extraordinary about it, well apart from the fact that he'd been buried alive, was that he'd been made to swallow a page from his own magazine."
An article he'd written.
"A piece you described as ""mumbo jumbo""."
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.
It's just an odd coincidence.
"I object to the insinuation, both personally and philosophically."
"Coincidence is a by-product of the random universe, separate events linked by nothing more than man's desire to create meaning."
Some people see meaning in connected events.
That's because you are desperate for answers that are not forthcoming and attributing meaning to events where there really is none.
"I strongly disliked Mr Stubbs' world view and objected to him infecting the journal with it, but I'm not so callous as to not see the tragedy in all of this."
Show me your kicks!
Let's Go!
Yes!
renda kick
Make us shake with excitement!
abisete mushaburui
You've got a super tale to tell!
sugee koto ga matte'run da ze
"At long last, the God of Destruction Beerus has set to work."
"The Kaio take notice, and fear that a new battle may begin..."
"Elsewhere, a large crowd of friends have gathered aboard the cruise ship where Bulma's birthday party is being held, however..."
Vegeta's not coming because he's training?
!
And Son-kun too?
!
I had some rawness to me.
I had some athletic ability.
He shaped all that.
"He was competitive, he wanted to win, he was competitive, he wanted to win, but he never let that interfere with what he thought of you as a young man."
He was a very humble man.
He was a very proud man.
"He's taught me the importance of competing and working hard and focusing on the process and the practice, as opposed to the end result and the stats."
Always respect the people you're around --
"Your teammates, your peers, your professors, your parents."
"We knew we were in the midst of greatness, just being on the same court with him."
"I still remember, you know, the last time I actually saw him, you know?"
I couldn't do nothing but hug him.
There's not a day goes by that I don't try to make him proud of me.
That I don't try to make him proud of me.
He's still our coach.
He's still our coach.
Come on.
"Rae Plachecki, this is Jack Bauer."
"You know the drill, Jack."
"I'm gonna ask you some questions, but I want you to know, I'm on your side."
We just want to establish that this heroin addiction was a necessary part of your cover.
It was necessary to maintain my cover.
Are we done now?
"Sit down, Jack."
This is Rae Plachecki.
The time is 2:31 A.M.
"This is the interrogation of Jack Bauer, director of field ops, CTU."
Ryan Chappelle is present.
"Jack, tell us how you established your cover with Ramon Salazar."
I first came in contact with the Salazars approximately two years ago.
"They were an up-and-coming narcotic cartel, coming out of Mexico."
"So, when did you meet Amador?"
Did you know him when you were working at CTU?
"Tell me something, Nina, what kind of a deal you think you're gonna cut?"
"You've betrayed everybody you know, including me."
You murdered Jack's wife.
You helped terrorists smuggle a nuclear bomb into this country.
You're helping to unleash a deadly virus into the general population.
Help me understand this.
What do you want?
What is it you get out of being a mass murderer?
Your neck is bleeding.
"Dalton, what do you got?"
"So far, the only reactions we're getting from her are subliminal."
"If she's not gonna say anything, we need to be more plugged in to her vitals."
"We can take her down to seven, give her a passive response test."
Seven's not secure enough.
She stays here.
No.
That was my impression also.
I doubt if any of our guests will count this among their happiest evenings.
That young foreigner behaved atrociously I thought.
Where can I have met him?
"And Miss Constantia Smethwick, where can I have met her?"
But the obligations of hospitality must be observed.
"While you are here, you shall not be dull!"
"Finally, one Sunday afternoon, a telegram arrived from Sebastian which threw me into a state of fevered anxiety."
Father...
You'll never guess where I've spent the day.
I've been to the zoo.
It was most agreeable.
The animals seem to like the sunshine so much.
"- Father, I have to leave at once."
- Yes?
"A friend of mine, he's gravely injured."
I must go to him.
There's a train in about half an hour.
"""Gravely injured, come at once."
"Sebastian."""
"Well, I'm sorry you are upset."
Reading this message...
"I do not think that the accident can be quite so serious... as you seem to think, otherwise it would hardly be signed by the victim himself."
"Still, of course, he may well be fully conscious but blind or paralysed with a broken back."
Why exactly is your presence so necessary?
You have no medical knowledge.
You are not in holy orders.
Do you hope for a legacy?
"I told you, he is a great friend."
"Well, Orme-Herrick is a very great friend of mine, but I should not go tearing off to his death bed on a warm Sunday afternoon."
I rather doubt whether Lady Orme-Herrick would welcome me.
That's all you saw?
"Well, her head some when she leaned out, but she had a towel draped over it like she was washing her hair, maybe."
"With the light behind her, I couldn't see what she looked like"
"When you make a delivery, you get a signature, don't you?"
"Uh, well, yeah, only--"
This one?
This one right here?
"Well, the trouble is, see, she shut the door real quick, and I-"
- I guess I sort of filled in the signature line myself.
"That could get you in trouble, couldn't it?"
"I know, mister, but, I mean, the way she was and everything,"
I just didn't want to push the door down.
"What do you mean, the way she was?"
"Well, the bare arm and the towel--"
"Holy smoke, I just figured she was maybe-- maybe naked."
All right.
"Paul, you'd better go down to police headquarters with him."
"- Good night, Miss."
- Good night.
- And thank you.
"- [Man] Yes, sir."
"Della, I want you to get a subpoena for--"
"What's the matter, Perry?"
Suppose the woman in that room wasn't maybe naked.
"Mr. Pierce, did you steal that diamond necklace?"
"No sir, I did not."
Did you induce chloral hydrate into Mrs. Langley's system?
No.
Isn't it true that you never had any intentions of marrying Miss Telford?
"No, that's not true."
"Then you must have intended to commit bigamy, Mr. Pierce, because you knew all along your wife had never divorced you."
I didn't know any such thing.
"We would've called, but by the time I knew, Vivian was already on the bus."
Lily was very tenacious.
She tried to get me to come home in six consecutive stops.
She insisted on coming all this way just to ask why you stopped delivering pies.
I'm really flaky.
- That's what I told her.
"It's not about the pies although the pies were always lovely, and so vivid."
"I gotta go get somebody's, uh, something."
Get under there.
They're here because you stopped delivering their pies.
"All this time, I've been making pies..."
"And dosing them with what you claim is vanilla, but that ain't vanilla."
I'm gonna dose the both of y'all with shut-the-fudge-up.
The weight of kept secrets had become unbearable  for the pint-sized pie-slinger.
Why don't we talk?
I thought you were my friend.
"- Like I said, flaky."
- I got something to say.
I'm gonna say it to you and you and you and your hump.
Olive wanted to let loose the secrets and lies  she'd been force-fed by her friends:
"That Chuck was still alive  that Lily was her mother  but instead, what came out was this:"
What's gotten into you?
I am a sawed-off shotgun full of secrets.
- Did she say she was armed?
"- No, I don't have a gun."
I am a gun.
"At any moment, truth buckshot could come spewing out of my muzzle."
Look out.
That's enough.
Truer words were never spoken.
This rifle is gonna go away in a little satin-lined case with the trigger locked and the safety on.
I quit.
"Well, there's still a letter from Mr. Banks with your instructions being typed."
- I'll tell Lita to--
"- Yes, sir."
I've already made arrangements to pick it up from Miss Krail.
"Mr. Sellers, you don't think my old roomie would overlook anything, do you?"
You don't think he'd fail to pack in an extra timetable or make a note of how many erasers he's leaving in the second drawer?
"Enos, shut up."
"Sandover, we want you to have some fun on this trip."
Forget the work.
"You find yourself the fanciest hotel suite and the thickest T-bone steaks in town, all on us, mind you-- all on us."
"And when they turn on those bright lights, you just tell the nearest bartender--"
I-
"- I rather thought I'd stay at the YMCA, sir."
[laughs]
"Well, good luck, Sandy."
"Don't you worry, Mr. Sellers, I'll be back at my desk at 9:00 Monday morning."
Thank you.
"[recording] White paper, three reams,: yellow, two,:"
"ledger books, seven."
Now let's see.
"I have one full box of black pencils, four red, one, two, three extra pen fillers, seven air-mail stamps, and a full roll of 4¢."
[recording continues]
"""The level of my sherry,"" he said--"
Listen to this.
It's true.
"""The level of my sherry is precisely at the top of the letter S."""
- [women groaning]
- So help me!
[all laughing]
Haven't you girls any work to do?
"I know you haven't, Mr. Watterton."
"It's a man's world, Miss Krail."
"But if I don't, you know, I ain't gonna be no drug dealer, you know... cry about it, come back and, you know... stick up gas stations or nothing like that, you know."
"Probably go into comedian or architecture, something like that."
You don't think that you'll have the kind of tough times like your dad's been through?
No.
I can't say
- I can't say that I will.
I can't say that I don't.
I don't know.
"Four years ago, that's all"
I used to dream about was playing in the NBA.
I don't really dream about it like that anymore.
"You know, even though..."
"I love playing basketball, but, you know..."
I want to do other things with my life too.
"- Say, ""hi, Daddy. '"" - hi, Daddy."
"- ""how you doing?"
"'"" - how you doing?"
"- Say, ""I love you. '"""
- I love you.
"If I had to stop playing basketball right now, I think I'd still be happy."
- I think I would.
"- Thank you, Daddy."
- Where'd Daddy get to?
"- Uh, Marquette."
Marquette?
"That's why when somebody say,you know..."
"""When you get to the NBA, don't forget about me, '""and all that stuff..."
"I should say to them, ""Well, if I don't make it, watch you don't forget about me. '"""
There are still a few places left that you can't get to from here.
Places without phones or faxesor even roads.
There are still a few corners of the globe so remote they remain aloof from what we call the modern world.
Why'd you leave me in such a hurry?

Oh my.
- Don't you remember me?
- Sorry?
- Who are you?
- I have a feeling we've met before.
That's strange.
Your face is very familiar to me.
"Your hometown is down south, right?"
"No, my hometown is here."
Here?
"""We'll remember this forever."" So my wife and I are having sex."
"What I didn't realise was that right over the ridge, when they took off to leave to go to town three hours away, there was a ranch, and on the ranch, luckily enough, this guy had a spare tyre, the same exact size."
"They were back about 20 minutes later, mid-sex."
They come over the hill.
I'm like this.
"My wife and I look, we make eye contact with them and they just drove by us as if nothing was happening."
Tactful.
That's tactful.
"We get dressed as quickly as possible, we get in the van, five-hour drive home."
Nobody brings it up.
Five hours of silence.
Five hours?
Really?
"And in the six years that I worked with that woman, her and her husband invited us to do one other thing, and that was to go to a concert."
"We go to the concert, and I'm with her husband and I see this woman who's just dressed slutty and I turn to him and go,"
"""Oh, my God!"
"Look at this slut!"""
"And he goes, ""Dude, that's my sister."""
"I go, ""Bullshit that's your sister!"""
And he calls her over and it was his sister.
You deserved that one.
"And you go off and you find a bucket of water and you go,"
"""Does she want a shower?"""
Good one.
Really?
"Five hours all the way home and no-one could say,"
"""Well, that was awkward."
We thought you were going to be gone longer
"""and, you know, we got caught up in nature and everything."""
I had to see her at work every day.
Every day I had to go back to work.
Do you think they might have been watching you for a while?
"Look, better than wearing nothing at all."
"In my half season as player and one day as announcer, no, I've never seen anything like this."
"Even though your playing career was cut short by an irrational fear of having your throat stuffed with vulcanized rubber,"
"I'm proud of you all the same, Son."
- Welcome to the booth.
- Glad to be here.
"And here they are now, the three-time defending champ Ice Hounds, led by their MVP Kain ""Stonewall"" Frazier."
"Yes, his Hounds look to easily devour these Zenovators today, much in the same way his mother hopes to destroy their home."
"No one stands in the way of Binghamton folks, on the ice or otherwise."
And the Ice Hounds look every bit the monstrous machine that has dominated the region for many seasons.
"Mon Dieu, those guys are bigger than you are?"
Maybe they'll win.
It'll be like a miracle on ice.
It'll be a miracle if they make it off the ice.
"We keep it loose, we have fun, we play it Newman style, all right?"
"We're gonna win this one for the home, guys."
Let's do it.
- You guys shouldn't be out here.
- You guys shouldn't be on steroids.
And we're underway.
"Binghamton's star scorer,"
"Janislav, controls the puck."
Here he comes up the aisle.
He did not make the Zen defender.
He's driving on goal all by himself.
He shoots.
The Hounds have scored at five seconds in.
That must be some kind of a record.
The orphans need a fatter goalie.
"Now, some crisp passing by the Zenovators."
Gorrall shoots and denied by Frazier.
Who's your daddy?
"And if so, Dana could already be dead."
PATTON:
Maybe not.
I hit Dana's e-mails and text messages with some Triple P-grade hacking of my own.
"Turns out, she's not just the advance coordinator for the races, she's the advance planner for the robberies."
"Well, it makes sense."
Advance coordinators go to the next town a week ahead of each race.
"That's plenty of time to prep for the next heist, and it's a perfect cover, too."
PATTON:
"And that text indicates that they're planning a hit today, in our town."
You know where?
She left the location out of the digiverse.
You think they took Dana to pull off one more heist?
LASALLE:
"If they did, then they did it by force."
Means figuring out where the heist is gonna go down might be our only chance to save her.
"Oh, we'll narrow down possible targets in the area."
No.
Percy and Patton can do that.
Have Sebastian see if he can figure out what those schematics and blueprints go to.
"Well, what does that leave me?"
Let's talk.
"I know, King, I messed up."
"You did more than that, Christopher."
"Bad enough you went M.I.A. in the middle of a case... and that can't ever happen again, understand?"
"It won't, but..."
"NOPD called, said Darrell filed assault charges against you."
What?
He swung at me first.
"Yeah, well, lucky they found a witness who said the same thing, but that doesn't explain what you were doing there in the first place."
"Look, Melody tried to get a restraining order on him, all right?"
Said she was worried for both her and Tucker.
"What do you mean, it's not for sale?"
"Everything has a price, Michelangelo."
Everybody has a price.
"In the end, everything and everybody is for sale."
"All right, all right, you think about it."
You think about it and you give me a call when you're ready.
You will be.
You will be.
"I have decided to sit the show out, Michelangelo."
This time with you.
"After all, what's the point in watching it, when my opinions can subsequently be cut to suit the needs of of the sales graph of a perfume?"
"The fact is, Michelangelo, until now I've had reservations about Merlin's work, serious reservations."
"He's always had big ideas, but, in my view, they were the wrong ones."
"But now, I feel Merlin is having his moment."
You could say he was a prophet in this age of AIDS and... century of terror.
His clothes are shrouds.
"Are you crying, sweetheart?"
"There, there."
It's better to face up to things as they really are.
"But the truth hurts, my love, doesn't it?"
It was chaos out there.
I think I may have...
I was...
I was trying to save the white sister.
And... and...
and there was a lot of people...
"Even some... some kids, who were here because a certain brother invited them here on his website/cell-phone/blog thing!"
"You know what Macbeth said, Michelangelo?"
"He said ""My life has become a tale told by an idiot,"
"...""all full of sound and fury signifying nothing."""
"I think you better start running, Michelangelo."
There's blood on your hands.
I can see my last breaths!
"He's so scared and vulnerable, and it's hilarious."
This is how it's gonna end for me... in an icy igloo with you two morons.
- He's freaking out.
- Shut up and help me!
"You got it, pal."
You're not trying to help me.
You're just playing with my face to mess with me.
"Dude, you push like this."
Stop!
"As we continued to mess with my dad, my mom was cleaning Erica's room."
"Okay, she was ransacking it like an FBI agent."
It was a desperate attempt to uncover the person Erica chose as her hero.
And then she found it...
"hidden in plain view behind the circuit board of a Lite-Brite, the piece of paper that would change my mom's life forever."
"Dad, I stumbled upon something incredible hidden in Erica's room, and I need to tell someone, but I can't because she'll never forgive me."
"Okay, you twisted my arm, so here it is."
I'm Erica's hero.
"Me, baby, me!"
"Well, I'm glad this worked out for you."
"You know what this means, right?"
I have succeeded as a mother.
"Now, I know there were times when I quietly wondered if I had failed as a mother, but now I know the truth."
Success!
Did it ever occur to you that Erica hid that essay so you wouldn't overreact like you are right now?
Did it occur to you that none of this matters because I'm her hero?
"Bevy, you snooped."
You broke her trust.
"If I were you, I wouldn't speak a word of this."
Obviously.
"Erica will never, ever know."
And she wouldn't... for 10 minutes.
"She was in a hurry, but did not say where she was going."
"If she is not here on time, you start the show with the special design, allez, allez!"
"Yes, Madame, I will be ready."
"And you follow with the ""Springtime Dream"" design!"
And then in the rehearsed order.
"Yes, Madame."
Where where you!
"At the beauty salon, Madame."
"You are so late, we are about to start!"
"Yes, Madame."
"Good luck, girls, and don't get nervous."
"Say, don't you think its lovely?"
"My dear Adriana, I have had no time to admire the swimsuits."
No doubt our convention has been a success.
"We needed a convention such as this,"
"We will coordinate our plans, and correct misteakes."
"This design is so lovely, right?"
I think its precious.
"I am refering to... the bikini, yes, thats what I said."
"This one is also lovely, but I just don't like the color."
"Don't see what's wrong with the color, its wonderful."
"This was an idea formidable, if it wasn't for... there is nothing to worry about, all has been taken care of, Madame."
"""Tonight, San Francisco Convent"""
May I be informed at what time the date starts?
Take a look.
"Quite mysterious for a love date, don't you think?"
"Come on, we are next."
"Ok, Ok, if you want to stick your nose in this, go ahead."
It is enough that there are skirts involved for you to be interested.
"but let me tell you this, we will find out nothing, untill we know all of the victim's background."
"unless you know something, Alex."
What do you know?
"""Whoever learns this tune, nothing else remains for him to learn."""
"""You also learn this, and you will prosper-Will you stop talking..."""

You don't deserve to be Daityaguru any more.
Which is why I never said anything.
"He invited me down there, didn't he, one day."
Took his plane up in the air....
CLEO:
"At which point, fate suddenly threw temptation in your way."
"And so then, of course, I started seeing this mate of his, who was really great, you know."
"Except, our first night together, we're in his bedroom and it's all, you know, and suddenly he asks me what are my feelings about capital punishment."
You're joking.
"What, where you stand on the issue ethically?"
"Wow, that's a first."
I think she means corporal punishment.
"Yeah, well, whatever."
"Spanking basically, right."
"Over the knee, bare bottom, all that caper."
"To which at first, obviously, I was like, yuck, you know."
"But I don't know, I just thought if you really care about someone and what gives them pleasure..."
so I just closed my eyes and went for it.
"God, you star."
-And did it hurt?
"-Well, that's the thing."
"At first, not that much, but then gradually I could feel it really starting to sting."
"And after about half an hour, my God!"
"Oh, why do I know what you're going to say?"
"Your hands just went completely numb, right?"
It really did.
I'm not joking.
"I said, ""Look, do you mind if we stop now, Terry,"
"""'cause you're not going to be able to sit down tomorrow at this rate."""
And after that he was so turned on.
"I tell you what, it made such a difference."
"You see, Ali, this is all vital stress management you're missing out on."
"That every woman needs on a regular basis, even when you're on your own."
Wait.
"Verified, sir."
We must be in some sort of light warp or we would have picked it up earlier.
Put it on visual.
"Iron silica body, planet size-- magnitude 1-E."
We'll be passing close.
Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on our records.
"And yet, here it is."
No time to investigate.
"Science stations, gather data for computer banks."
"Uhura, notify the Discovery on subspace radio."
"A strong interference on subspace, Captain."
The planet must be a natural radio source.
Let's get out of its range.
"Veer 40 degrees to starboard, Mr. Sulu."
40 degrees.
Sulu!
"Mr. Spock, they're gone!"
Emergency!
Full reverse power!
Space-- the final frontier.
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Its five-year mission-- to explore strange new worlds... to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man has gone before.
Ship 's log-
- Stardate 2124.5.
First Officer Spock reporting for Captain James Kirk.
We are orbiting the lone unrecorded planet in the star desert.
"For four hours, we have made every possible instrument sweep, but Captain Kirk and Helmsman Sulu remain unaccounted for."
I have placed the ship on red alert.
We've searched again from stem to stern.
"If they're not down on that planet, they're now here."
"No sign of human life on the surface, sir, unless the instruments aren't functioning."
We'll need the second umpire.
Yes or no?
Yes or no?
Foul!
Yeah!
"As the Bruiser and the Killer slug it out, the gloves are also coming off back at the house."
"Hi, Mrs. Rogers."
"Determined to attract the master's attention, the countess approaches her chaperone with an immodest proposal."
"And I know you'll appreciate this because, as we've discussed before, we're both very good girls at school."
The thing with very good girls is that when they're bad...
"They are very, very bad."
"Yes, absolutely."
"with this very Regency Regency idea, but only one that can be played by a lady of very, very high status."
"So, the precedent for it is that very naughty lady,"
"Lady Caroline Lamb, who, over dinner apparently, either at Lord Melbourne's or at some other country house, served herself up... as one of the courses."
"Yes, I'm feeling faint, I'm feeling faint!"
But...
"My first thought is, ""What was she wearing?"""
"Well, ""Not very much"" is the answer, because she was meant to be eaten."
So... she will be covered...
I'm delighted to hear that.
"But by fruits, vines, etc."
"And apparently she came in on a silver platter, but I don't know if we could quite manage that."
But you must be decent.
"I mean, she presumably must have been married when she did it."
"Mmm, so I will have..."
I will be covered.
So you've got to be relatively careful that you are not so shocking that you become unmarriageable.
"Yes, that's true."
"Come on, Yankee!"
Come on!
Leave your man down.
I love them.
I do.
"But damn, they get on my nerves."
I wanted to -- everyone knows what I want to do --
what I want to do every second of every day.
I don't even have to say it.
"But...then I remember the last drink that got me here 2 years, 1 month, 10 days ago."
"And I didn't, and..."
"I'm just grateful, I guess... to have this place."
And that's all.
"Um, the surveillance reports that you requested --"
"Alexandria, Virgina, the week of January 23rd."
There's a list of every person at the meeting and the names of all of their security personnel.
"Thank you, Martha."
"I included the local police reports from that area, as well, as the DOD meeting was on the same day as that horrible murder."
"There was a ton of extra police around, so maybe someone saw something useful to you."
You mean that...couple and their -- and their daughter?
That scared the hell out of me.
"I thought it was a Charles Manson thing, but I think they've ruled that out."
You know what?
Get me all the files and physical evidence connected to those murders also.
Sure thing.
You think they're related?
I think I can't rule anything out.
"I thought we were through the hard times, you know?"
"I'd been sick for about three months, uh, and he was just so amazing."
"He took such great care of me and the kids, and...this is gonna sound weird."
Please.
My life?
No judgment.
"I-it's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that, but I..."
"I wanted... the opportunity to show him that I could be there for him, you know?"
"But when a woman says that she's going to collapse, she usually ends up pushing the man over."
That's why I'd like to leave another way out.
I don't think Mother has collapsed.
Is that right?
She must be staggering or having an affair.
"No, she's not."
"And if she were, why don't you help her?"
Mother has been holding up the household all by herself all this time.
"You've just kicked stuff down on her and looked on, without helping her at all."
It's perfectly understandable why she would be straying off the straight and narrow after these twenty years.
You don't know the whole story.
"Since Mother has been living with me, she's been living with Takehara in spirit."
"Dear, are you so sure about that?"
That's because you're so cold to her.
She has no choice but to look for love somewhere else.
"Father, there's something I want to ask you."
Yes?
I've found out that you have a bank account that you keep secret from Mother.
You have someone at the university keep the passbook at school.
What's all that about?
"Dear, is what Takao says true?"
"Yes, it is."
That's terrible.
And we've been selling our kimonos and gnashing our teeth this whole time.
I'm all alone here.
I'm all by myself.
"I've put up with you saying things like that all this time, but..."
But what?
What are you going to do?
Are you going to tell me you're going to live at Takehara's?
"If I could have done that,"
I wouldn't have been trying to be your wife in spirit as well as fact.
"I'll just cross that off my list, then."
I haven't ruled out workplace romance.
Romance does give you motive.
Somebody always loving somebody they shouldn't be loving.
- Is that for your aunts?
- Extra vanilla.
Olive Snook discovered it wasn 't vanilla while delivering pie to Chuck's aunts.
It wasn 't the only secret she would discover that night.
The high doses of herbal mood-enhancers  not only caused particularly vivid side effects  but they also prompted a confession.
I'm Charlotte's mother.
"It was a confession not even Lily's sister, Vivian, had heard  and to ensure that she never would, Lily banished Olive from their lives."
Since both Chuck and her mother were supposed to be dead  neither could know the other was alive.
"I don't know if Betty killed Kentucky, or if she didn't but I know this:"
Betty knows something about something.
"- All right, I'll give Betty the shakedown."
- No.
No shaking.
What if someone from Betty's Bees finds out you're a spy?
Spying is like sabotage in that they kill you for it.
That's what you do with spies.
"You kill them and you don't feel bad, because they're spying."
"Ned, they're not gonna kill me during office hours."
Yeah.
Stop trying to spook my inside man.
- You could die.
- And you're already dead.
Told you she wasn't dead.
"If I could breathe, I would vomit."
Olive Snook.
"Every week, a delicious, life-giving pie, and then nothing."
"I thought you were dead, and so soon after Charlotte."
I was beginning to take dying personally.
I almost forgot.
You'll need this.
"As you know, working at the CIA gives me certain privileges too."
And they include summoning a federal prisoner whenever I damn well please.
Fair enough.
"Guard, hold all my calls."
I'm here to tell you a story out the first time I met Jai.
Langley was buzzing.
The son of a DCS was coming off the farm.
"And everyone said he was arrogant, entitled, selfabsorbed."
Just like dad.
Exactly.
But that wasn't my impression of him.
"Maybe it's because I was blind and I couldn't see the $1,000 John Lobbs or that hardened glare."
"What was your impression, then?"
Jai had this unstoppable thirst for knowledge...
A yen for solving puzzles and understanding the complexities of this world.
He got that from his mother.
If I did have something... what could you give me in return?
Nothing.
"You want to keep playing these angles,"
Jai's murder will remain unsolved.
"But for once, instead of son trying to emulate father, maybe father should try to emulate son."
"Chantilly Lofts, Unit 317."
What is that?
The location of Jai's safe house.
So how long are we gonna wait before we talk about last night?
"Oh, what's there to talk about?"
I got a trash can full of broken plates that might jog your memory.
That might have been a bit excessive.
"If you wanted off the short list, you chose a hell of a way to announce it."
"Well, maybe I don't want it as much as I thought, not if it means selling out the Agency."
- Are you not scared?
- No I am not
But your eyes doesn't reveal the courage of your lips
I am daily praying God for his well being
Nothing will happen to him My husband is with him
He will take care
-What?
-I want to know either of the two
- What is that two?
- Will you marry me or not?
When did I say I will marry you?
"Then is your dance, songs and talks with me a farce?"
- You can take it that way
- Sir..
Sir..
If you don't marry I will marry her and make her my wife
"Don't worry, I have 40 acres of ancestral property share"
I will transfer that to your name
Why did you marry that beggar in haste?
I am loving you dearly
- Really
- Yes
- Then swear on my head
- Not true
Dont feel for it If we give 1 0 Rs she will give it back
Have this 1 0Rs and give me the chain back
Is the sacred thread so cheap to you?
For each lady that is the protection I am a Tamilnadu beggar
Come and live with me
All of you come what happened?
He is trying to decieve me after marrying me
"After marrying,is he deceiving?"
Why are you only telling me about Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan?
"Among the 5 individuals, I understand Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan the most."
"As long as those 5 forget about the incident, it will be all right."
What about Lee Kyeong Wan?
Stay close to Lee Kyeong Wan.
The other four will expose themselves.
So first we eliminate Lee Kyeong Wan and let the remaining four individuals show themselves.
"I understand, but why send me to Cheong Wa Dae?"
"This, I will let you know in the future."
"When you begin your plan,"
"As long as you believe in me, it is enough."
I will use my plan to eliminate them.
In a way that it will be unforgivable by others.
Really?
You also have thoughts.
I will follow you from the side.
I will try to track the source of the maritime construction account.
Go to the assistant Officer's wife account.
Find out if Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan used her to cover up his construction plans.
I've already told you who is behind the maritime construction.
"You haven't seen the invoice, have you?"
A few days ago I wrote this down in a rush.
That...
That can be written any time when there is mutual trust.
Investigator Jang.
Proceed with the source of the maritime construction research.
And prepare the arrest warrant.
That's great!
I will prepare the arrest warrant for Investigator Jang.
Who permitted the arrest?
Lee Kyeong Wan has become very powerful.
He is immune from prosecution.
It's all very well in theory.
I just wish I didn't get sucked in like that.
"For one moment, you know, the defences are all down."
"You think it's all going to have this nice happy ending, well, from my point of view anyway, and then...."
Life just kicks you in the teeth...every time.
"From what you would saying, this other cousin of yours, what's her name, Janice?"
Sounds like a right drip.
I suppose that was a sure sign when you think of it.
The clashing clothes of two people who really didn't get on.
"The worst of it all, he's got no idea obviously, about her and Stephen."
And now tonight we're all going off to see this play together at the Lyric.
With me just there basically to make the number up.
Still wondering whether to give it a miss.
That's supposed to be really funny from what I've heard.
"No, you should definitely go."
Get a few drinks down you.
At least have a good chuckle.
"The Daily Mail calls it ""a real, riotous rib-tickler""."
"Well, there you are, then."
"I suppose so, but I don't know."
"Whenever I go to the theatre to see a comedy,"
I seem to be the only one there who's not laughing.
She'll be here any second.

They're organised and they have the numbers.
Little stinkers trying to get into the feeder?
- Morning.
"- Hey, Roy."
This isn't the most glamorous job in the world.
"Look, I appreciate it very much."
"- Yeah, we'll be there in 10 minutes."
"- As leaders, we have a choice."
We can sit back and let the same cycle of war continue in the Middle East or we can do something about it.
You know how much money we've spent on the war since 2001?
Over a trillion dollars.
Could you imagine if you had...
"It's gonna be a busy morning, boys."
"--Education, food, health care and infrastructure in the Middle East."
"Now, we've begun historic talks with the republic of Iran's newly elected president, Al-Sharif to build peace throughout his region."
America can't do this alone.
We need the full financial support of all of our allies.
But what we can do is take the first step.
"Therefore, I'm announcing today that all U. S. troops will be removed from the Middle East."
Let's not repeat the same mistakes that we made in the past.
"And Lord knows, I've made some mistakes myself."
"Instead, I ask you to stand with me today."
Sign this treaty.
Let's end this debilitating pattern of violence and let's show the world that the pen is truly mightier than the sword.
Thank you.

-...earlier today in Geneva.

I'm gonna be late tonight.
All is calm on the water according to reconnaissance.
The archery competition between Soon-chun and Kwang-yang troops was completed as scheduled.
The results of the battle formation drills are satisfactory as well.
"We've completed spread formation and single file formation drills, so we'd like to begin the overlapping reversed V formation drills tomorrow."
"Well done, everyone."
"Oh, at any rate, when will the High Commander be back with us?"
I'm getting so anxious waiting for him...
Sir.
"Was the artillery training conducted on land again, Captain Chung?"
Yes.
I believe my Soon-chun and Kwang-yang troops are scheduled for an onboard artillery training tomorrow.
There will be no training onboard.
Captain Chung!
"Let me make it clear, Constable Kwon."
There will be no more naval training as far as the artillery is concerned.
Ensign Chung!
"Yes, sir."
I want the cannons mounted on Soon-chun and Kwang-yang galleys tomorrow.
Constable Kwon!
I will do it.
"From now on, I will conduct the artillery training."
The High Commander is wrong!
He's making a bad mistake!
You have got to stop confusing the soldiers by blindly following the
High Commander!
We are trying to do our duty as naval officers of Left Cholla.
Constable Kwon!
Have the cannons mounted by 09:00!
"Yes, sir!"
Give it up now.
Some things are just not possible.
We have to reduce the weight of the iron plates.
"Only it wasn't winter, and it wasn't cold."
"And nevertheless, you saw Mr. Norstaad that morning lighting a match to something in that stove, didn't you?"
Yes.
"They made me tell it, Axel."
No further questions.
"Now, Miss Pedersen, since you've described yourself as the whole office force, perhaps you can tell us about the bids."
Bids?
"Oh, you mean for Axel's real estate?"
His shop and trademark.
Yes.
How many bidders were there?
I think there were about 15 bids.
"They were all in writing, by-- by registered mail."
"Now, who looked at those bids?"
"Prior to the granting of the contract, that is."
Mostly just Axel.
Mostly?
Did anyone else see them?
They were always locked in my desk.
Did Axel tell you to show them to anyone else?
Yes.
To Miss Morrow.
"When my men went to look at Norstaad's shop, there was still smoke coming out of the chimney."
"Naturally, they checked further."
I see.
"I show you now this police exhibit and ask you if you can identify it for us, Lieutenant."
It's a scorched bit of material we found in the stove.
"Was this material subjected to laboratory analysis, and if so, what were the results?"
We found a bloodstain on it-- blood of the same type as that of the victim.
"Were you able to discover where this material with the victim's bloodstain on it came from, Lieutenant?"
"Uh, Norstaad, the defendant, had two pair of pants to the suit he was wearing the night Somers was killed."
One pair is now missing.
"- If you'd like me to stop,Warden..."
"- don't be sensitive,Milton."
Tell us where they are and you'Il have a wool blanket with tea piping hot in a ceramic bowl waiting for your purple pruned hands.
We'Il find out one way or another.
He'Il break.
Never had a man in this tub that didn't.
"He's already broken,Dr.Beauregard."
What we need to do is put him back together again.

"Time for the talking cure.Step aside,Milton."
"Yes,ma'am,it's a military medal,all right."
These etching lines?
"They symbolize rays that the Laurel wreath encircles, in the center of which would sit a silver star."
Was Petty awarded any medals in Korea?
"No.He thought he deserved one,though."
"Fired off a lot of angry letters to uncle Sam while he was,you know,in jail."
Got denied every time.
So maybe this is payback.Instead of ball bearings or nails.
Where would you get a silver star if you didn't earn it?
A real one?
"Well,you wouldn't."
"What about,like,Craigslist?"
"Not from a military family I take it,sir."
Silver star is the third-highest combat military decoration.
"If it's not left to the family,most are buried with the soldiers."
The Presidio.
- Graveyard detail.
"- Thank you,sir."
Hey.What the hell are you doing here?
My suspect worked the graveyard detail here at the Presidio from 1952 to '54 during his court-martial.
I'm very disappointed.
"If you came just to discuss this,"
Then please go back.
"Your Majesty,"
"I, Yeo Mi-Eul, have never once lived my life for myself."
"Before I became Priestess, I was a woman who kept Your Majesty in my heart."
"After becoming Priestess,"
"I only have BuYeo in my heart, I live for BuYeo."
I lived my whole life for BuYeo and Your Majesty.
How can you treat me like this?
"Like you, Yeo Mi-Eul,"
"I, too... have a person whom I deepy respect, Hae Mo-Su."
"Whenever I think of the cruelty you inflicted on him,"
I can't stand it.
This scar will be with me till the day that I die.
I heard Your Majesty is prepared to wage war against the Han Dynasty.
Indeed.
Do you think we stand a chance of winning?
"Because of your animosity towards the Divination Palace and I,"
You made a wrong decision.
Such reckless decisions will be frowned upon by the Gods.
"For the sake of BuYeo,"
Please act with wisdom and prudence.
"Then,"
"You suppose that sacrificing the lives of 10,000 soldiers to appease the ruthless Han Dynasty will garner Divine protection for us?"
Stop exploiting the Gods to blind and deafen me.
A cloud of war hangs over BuYeo now.
"If war erupts, should we move the fleet to Gyeh-Ru?"
"Don't worry,"
We'll know of it as soon as they mobilize the troops.
It's not too late if we move then.
I wonder how So Seo-No is doing.
"Catchphrase is slightly easier to win than Only Connect, but you can win like 30 grand on Catchphrase, and Only Connect you get like a mug, maybe?"
LAUGHTER
What's Mr Chips doing?
"That's it, right?"
Rather than what's the fucking square root of what Mr Chips is doing?
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
"Jessica, do you think you'd be any good on a quiz?"
I don't even...
I can't even get like basic questions right.
"I sort of panic under pressure like, you know when you're in the opticians?"
"OK, like, ""Is it better WITH, or better WITHOUT?"""
"And I'm like, ""I don't know!"""
LAUGHTER
"I can't answer, like, basic questions, so, no, too much pressure for me."
"I think people THINK that they can win on a quiz show in the same way people always think they can parallel park, and they're like, ""Yeah I can do this."""
"And then they have a go and then ten minutes and, like, a dead old person later, they're like"
"""A bit harder than it looks!"""
LAUGHTER
What I got from that is you can't parallel park.
"LAUGHTER For shit, mate."
For shit.
"I can't, either."
This is so bad.
It's so hard!
"I had to pick my dad up from the hospital, he was getting his cataracts done, right, and I couldn't parallel park it, and in the end, he got out and did it with no eyes."
LAUGHTER
"So, most people think they're smart enough to win a quiz show."
True or false?
What are you going to say?
"False, I think."
Most people are quite...
He's going to get up.

The Kentchurch Bruiser did not come to scratch on time.
"Gentlemen, I authorize the purse holder to hand over his 200 guineas to today's victor, Matt Skelton."
"Killer... well done, sir."
Fantastic fight.
Fantastic fight.
Fantastic fight.
Mr. Gorell Barnes is...
is a very attractive man.
"And he looks fantastic in his Mr. Darcy outfit,"
I have to say... very decorative and elegant.
is very against the idea of men and women just being friends and... and talking to each other a lot.
"And I think, yeah, we're still kind of quite playful, because you need a bit of excitement in the house, because otherwise, it is a bit boring."
You need someone to dress for dinner for.
How wonderful.
Definitely some people didn't even know it was me.
"And then some were, like, ""Is that the countess?"""
"Oh, my God!"
"Is that your real bust, then?"
I couldn't see people's reactions;
I could just hear.
I just don't think they knew what to do with themselves.
"Welcome to Disney, Princess."
"I'm hoping the chaperone reaction isn't too extreme, because of course, it is very bad behavior."
Very seductive.
"Very seductive, isn't she?"
"Ladies and gents, shall we raise our glasses to the countess to drink to, uh... rude food?"
Rude food.
"I think everyone thinks the Regency is a very Jane Austen kind of time and everyone being prim and in bonnets, but then there were certain people who had a lot more fun."

Your opinions have been noted.
Now get back to Enterprise and start the antimatter transfer.
"I'm sorry, Captain, I can't obey that order."
You may not be wearing a uniform... but you can still be charged with insubordination.
Perhaps we should contact Starfleet and discuss this with Admiral Forrest.
You're relieved as First Officer.

How long will it take to transfer the antimatter?

"You said the Cult of Solon lived in some caves near Exeter, right?"
Of course.
That cut in the Ark was made by a tool forged near there.
You mean the cult opened the Ark and removed the Torch?
Call the police.
Hey!
"A man planted on the inside fires a tranquilizer dart, escapes in a dummy cab to a waiting speedboat."
I think we can safely say this was no ordinary smash and grab.
"No, this was planned like a military operation."
Isn't that an awful lot of trouble to go through to steal artifacts?
The Ark and the medallion would sell for millions on the black market.
"Inspector Rhodes, this just came in."
Thank you.
"Now, we ran your description of the thief through Interpol."
Is this the man?
"No, I-"
- I didn't get a good look at him.
I did.
That's the guy.
Yannis Zavros.
"A general in the Greek army, until he was court-martialed."
For what?
He's the leader of a militant group of fanatics who claim Macedonia as their birthright.
They see themselves as the heirs of Alexander the Great.
I thought they just beamed us straight up.
The church has a job retiring us.
"You lose your parish, you lose your family."
They say it happens to you in your late forties.
"What celibacy really means, not sex, but a woman that you love, that you're going to grow old with, kids."
"Yes, well you don't have a monopoly on that."
"Father Clarke, this is Inspector Frost."
"How do you do, Father?"
"You're the policeman, who wants to know what people say in confession."
"Well, I have to tell you, it's none of your business."
Are you a Catholic?
No.
"They that say ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law, it's no excuse in the eyes of the Lord either."
Yes.
"Father, I don't suppose..."
"I gather that what Father Sullivan wants me to talk to you about, is something that was said to him in confession, but it wasn't said to me in confession."
Not that I have any idea what was said to Father Sullivan.
"But if we haven't too much idea what we're talking about, well there can't be any sin in that."
"We'd like some tea, for the whisky."
"About James Barr, Father."
"James was an altar boy, when I could get hold of him, he always had something infinitely more interesting to do."
"His wife said he was a bit, well a bit obsessive about his religion."
You're saying but not when he was a kid thought?
At eleven this world is infinitely more interesting than the next.
What about his brother?
Alec.
Yes.
Alec.
He was the religious one.
That's right.
I put him in the choir.
I had to find something for him to do.
"""so it's not all about you."""
I didn't say that.
"So I got there and I was worried that everyone was going to be quite pretentious and kind of, you know, ""I'm so organic""."
But everyone was really nice.
I really liked everyone and it's a very sort of nice place.
How many people were there?
"There's about 40, you get assigned rooms and I got assigned a room with quite a famous actress."
Can we guess?
You'll never guess it.
Downton Abbey.
EastEnders.
You'll never guess it.
No?
"But in the first couple of minutes, she went to me, ""You're not very good with silence, are you?"""
"I was like, ""Me?"
Love a bit of silence.
"Love it!"""
"And I'm not very good with silence either, being an anxious person and so we go for the day of silence, and I thought it'd be fine,"
"""I'll just read, eat, you know, it's fine,"""
"and then they say, ""You can't do those things,"
"""you just have to be alone in your own head with your own thoughts."""
Whoa.
"So about ten minutes in, I was ruined, I was like, ""What?"
"!"""
"They didn't say you couldn't walk anywhere, so it was on this lovely grounds and I went walking and there was a big, old tyre swing."
You know those tyre swings on a rope?
"And I got up and thought,"
"""I'll walk there, they didn't say anything about the tyre."
"""They would've mentioned if we couldn't go."""
I got up and there was like 30 other people queuing to get on this tyre.
"For three hours, we just got on and off this tyre, just eyeballing each other, like, ""You've been on there long enough, mate""."
It was the longest 12 hours.
It's about 45 minutes away.
So we're in a bit of a race to get there in time.
Big bear in there.
"As well as relocating bears,"
Professor Izumiyama also studies them.
"By fitting radio collars to track them, he hopes to discover more about their movements."
I'm not sure how much more time we've got.
"They have to work fast, before the drugs wear off."
Hirokun.
Hirokun.
"As Hirokun begins to stir, it's wise to take some precautions."
Just John and Izumiyama-san we'll leave here.
So we should retreat to the inside of the car?
Yeah.
Professor Izumiyama carries pepper spray just in case of attack.
John knows how nervous local people can get.
"People get so scared and so angry about these bears that unless he did something, they'd just end up dead."
"A few hours of unpleasantness, which it will have forgotten by tomorrow, is well worth it."
"Another bear on its way, but now its movements can be tracked."
Hunter.
"Yeah, that one."
"If, maybe in a weeks' time..."
"Over 25 years, Professor Izumiyama has caught a lot of bears."
"More than 1,000."
"More than 1,000 bears."
"1,000 bears and counting and there's no sign of stopping yet."
"As soon as one bear is released, it's straight on to another."
"Throughout the summer, he's on call 24/7."
"Despite being such a populated country,"
"Honshu is home to over 10,000 bears... ..and what Professor Izumiyama is discovering is remarkable."
These bears have huge territories.
They can roam nearly 50 square miles in search of food.

"- Baby,i was born green."
- We're going to detroit.
It's halloween weekend.
Arson investigators have noticed a 3-year trend
- in the days leading up to halloween.
- Devil's night.
This unsub is killing only these 3 days out of the year.
- How's he doing it?
- He's burning his victims alive.
He's abducting seemingly random people and dumping their bodies in abandoned parts of town.
He struck again last night.
Yeah.
"Tony torrell,40."
"he lives in the suburbs, but he was found 20 miles away in the rivertown district."
He's attacking the city at its most vulnerable time.
- what does he do during the rest of the year?
- He's dormant.
"You know,arsonists are typically white males between 17 and 25 who can't stay away from fire."
"Yeah,they're addicted to it and there's no rehab."
"And they target dwellings,not people."
So you're saying he burns his victims alive but he's not an arsonist?
Fire is simply his weapon.
And devil's night gives him the perfect cover to kill.
Then we've got 48 hours before he disappears again.
"Well,his last victim was athletic."
He wouldn't be easy to subdue.
The offender must be just as strong or might have an upper hand if he's younger.
"Still,how does he transport his victims across the city and get them inside buildings without being noticed?"

Who is going to give us the money when they want to get rid of the navy altogether?
You don't need to worry about the budget.
High Commander!
I'm very proud of you.
You finally resolved the problem!
Sir!
Now you can go full speed ahead with the construction of the Turtle Ship.
Don't worry about the budget and just get the Turtle Ship built.
Sir!
"Yes, just get it built!"
I'll go around to all the temples in the country and steal their bells if
"I have to, so you just build the ship!"
His Majesty has withdraw his order to abolish the navy!
"You've worked hard o maintain the base, Captain Chung."
The navy is powerless without the cannons.
I'm counting on you.
"If it is an order, I will obey it."
Preserve the navy?
His Majesty has given Yi Soon-shin his hand of support?
That man has go to stop sabotaging the front with his arrogance and guileful tongue!
Perhaps it was not Yi Soon-shin's guile but His Majesty came to a decision on his own that it might be unwise to organize the military to one extreme.
Captain Han!
Are you trying to add insult to injury?
Why do you always take Yi Soon-shin's side?
This is not matter to take sides.
Then do you think that the King is a gullible man that can be played by a servant?
That would be grave impiety.
"If we must fight as a navy, perhaps we should seek counsel of"
High Commander Yi Soon-shin.
What?
Seek counsel?
High Commander Won has everything under control!
You guys get it.

"On the topic of guns, not everyone here likes guns."
Not everyone here hates guns.
Maybe some guns shouldn't be available.
"But what we do know for a fact is that right now, all of the guns are currently available."
And some people are collecting guns.
"And some people are picking flowers, hoping it all goes away one day."
"I assure you, it is not going to go away."
"You've been led to believe at some point, it's gonna be us versus them."
"We just don't know who ""them"" is."
"But in reality, it's gonna be red versus blue, and it's gonna be a fuckin' bloodbath."
So while guns are currently available... consider having a few around.
"You know, for when the shit hits the fan."

I'm in a lot of trouble because your Soviet foreign minister won't accept that Vlad Kosygin was the tragic victim of a mugging gone wrong.

"Good question, Senator."
"Hey, guys."

Miyo got sick from eating bad candy.
"The doctor said that if it's disentery, she could die."
Why did you let her eat that candy?

Have you also come to look for work?
I heard you left the university 24 years ago.
"After the university, I worked as a professor in the radio."
"and 1 or 2 months ago, I opened a western restaurant."
"If you're looking for work, why don't you come work for a season with me?"
What?
To work in a restaurant?
"If you help me with the restaurant, I will help find a job for you."
Thus is the shared fate of a pair well known in the Ministry of Education.
"If you offered me this out of pity for my poverty, I would be offended."
"However, being an old student of yours, I accept."
"I did not want to seem disagreeable, but when one becomes poor, a man also becomes sensitive."
I met Mr. Ryojima at the employment office.
He will help us with the restaurant.
"Please, see that Mr. Ryojima is comfortable here."

What Michelle didn't know was that boiling water had been poured into the thermos earlier in the night.
[Coughs and gasps]
"When the girl was disinhibited by the drug she was on, and she took the swig of the boiling water, her natural response to spit it out wasn't present, and she caused burns in the back of her throat and epiglottis."
"This epiglottis, which normally covers up the airway during swallowing, swelled up and blocked the airway."
She would've passed out within five to 15 seconds.
"Death would've ensued within minutes, as there was no oxygen getting to her brain."
Michelle thought she'd play a little joke on her religious friends.

"Almost ready, Mr. Josephson."
That was a pretty dangerous and radical maneuver from the police... especially with a hostage at risk and that roadblock up ahead.

"During the bank robbery, the actual thief cut his hand... on the teller's paper spindle."
A sample of that dried blood was taken and tested... and compared with a sample of my client's blood.
"Jack's blood is type ""B"" positive."
"The red-nosed robber's blood is type ""A."""
But because the evidence was collected improperly from the crime scene... it was deemed inadmissible in court.
Thank you very much.

Where's my jacket ?
"Oh, gross."
Sorry.
"You know, I've actually stockpiled some rudimentary supplies in case of, you know, the Apocalypse or whatever."
I got all sorts of stuff in there.
Got extra tennis shoes and flashlights and canned goods and...
A space heater...
I'm not...
Hey... getting good reception here.
I'm going to step out in the hall.
Okay...
"Yes, Orange County, as you probably figured out, that was an earthquake."
"So far, no reports of fatalities, but power is out, cell lines are jammed and the roads are for emergency vehicles only."
As more information comes in we'll relay it to you.
"So if you're safe, stay calm and stay put."
So we got our marching orders and our staying put orders.
So no one's to leave the plaza unless they have to.
Yes.
He is becoming one of the key members.
"If they have a Whispered, then why are they targeting Chidori?"
"They shouldn't need her anymore, right?"
Because it's not complete.
Apparently there are differences in the knowledge that each individual Whispered has.
"If there's someone who has extensive knowledge of the theory behind Lambda Driver technology, there's also someone who only has knowledge of submarine technology."
"That's why every time a new Whispered is found, it's necessary to determine which field that one is strong in."
That's what those tests that we ran on that girl in the Khanka Autonomous Region were for.
And the results showed that Kaname Chidori is a Whispered.
"That's all I've heard, though."
Where is Amalgam's base?
!
Who are their key figures?
Gimme a break already.
I'm getting sick of this subject.
"It's boring, and it's not even the main issue here."
"Hey now, does it look like I care if I die?"
Tell me.
Please.
"""Please,"" huh?"
Are you really the same Kashim I knew?
What?
Remember!
What were you doing when I first met you five years ago?
"Back then, I was an instructor at a mercenary camp."
You were a guerilla fighting against the Soviets.
"We weren't allies, but we weren't really enemies either."
I still remember it very well.
You had a really good look in your eyes back then.
Eyes that didn't either reject or affirm life.
"Eyes without any worries, doubts, or suffering."
"There would seem to be a coffin inside the tomb, Monsieur Carter."
You looking forward to seeing what's inside?
Yes and no.
I wish people would stop interfering.
They just...
"Well, they just get in the way, don't they?"
I know what you mean.
"Sometimes it's hard to keep in mind what we're all here for, isn't it?"
No.
I know exactly why I'm here.
I never forget it for a second.
"And why do you think that is, then?"
"I want to find him, Arthur."
I want to know who he was.
I want to talk to him.
"Well, you may well find him."
"But at the end of it, all he will be is a mummy."
"He's not going to talk to you, is he?"
And if I can also ask you to be careful on the steps into the tomb.
They are very steep.
Ibrahim.
"This letter is for you, Mr Carter."
"Gentlemen, I have an announcement to make."
Today I was forbidden by letter from Monsieur Lacau from escorting friends and wives of my team into the tomb to show them the sarcophagus.
This follows a number of discourtesies shown by the Egyptian Public Works Department and its Antiquities Service.
The level of interference is now intolerable and shows a total lack of respect for the late Lord Carnarvon and his extraordinary generosity and affection for this country over the last 10 years.
"As a protest, myself and my collaborators refuse to continue our work in the tomb until such impossible restrictions have been removed."
That's all I have to say.
I've been asked to go and lecture in America.
You'll like it there.
They'll treat you like a king.
(Coughing)
He had some Scots to slaughter.
The Comyn family and their many supporters were still loyal to the Balliol claim.
There was only one thing to do with such opposition...
Kill it!
"He left the borders to his increasingly trusted lieutenant, James Douglas."
"Himself, he marched north, accompanied by his brother Edward."
The Bruce's campaign gathered momentum as he moved up the Great Glen.
"His forces were never large, although by now they had a reputation."
His tactics were thorough and unpleasant.
He reduced one Comyn castle after another.
He reduced them to rubble.
He killed the occupants.
He burnt Nairn to the ground.
"A ruined castle, after all, was no use to the Comyns, no use to the English if they returned and no use to a king who had settled on a strategy - hit and run."
"Right now, the Bruce had no use for castles."
Castles meant you couldn't move.
"So, burn the castle, fill the well, move on."
It took him just two months.
"By November, he was in the north-east, his forces now joined by those of the Bishop of Moray."
"Another man of war, Bishop Moray."
The vestments were just for weekends.
And then...
The King is ill!
"The Bruce's illness was nameless, mysterious."
It left him weak as a kitten.
"There was no medicine to hand, no doctor."
He grew steadily weaker as the days passed.
The King is dying.
It was winter.
The army was perilously close to running out of food.
"The Earl of Buchan, cousin of the murdered John Comyn, had gathered a sizeable force and was waiting for the moment to attack."
The Bruce's forces withdrew into the Highlands.
"He was mean sometimes, but he loved us."
Get out of my head.
Get out of my head!
You shouldnt have done it!
I had no choice!
"""For Kal-El, in the event of my death."""
"In my lifetime, I've known many famous and powerful men..."
"Presidents, sultans, kings...  and I believed that I was superior to them all."
"But I've come to know the truth, Kal-El."
My greatest accomplishment is that I have dedicated myself to protecting your life and serving you.
"For that, I am grateful."
"But if you are reading this, it means that I cannot protect you any longer from a terrible truth."
Two lockets exist...
Two.
Each one has its own key.
"These keys used together, unlock the secret of controlling you."
"You must find the keys, or your destiny will fall into the hands of another man."
You must save yourself.
What is it with the Luthors?
I swear death follows that family around like a stray puppy.
You're not gonna...
I wanted to search Luthorcorp tonight for evidence that Lex had Patricia Swann killed.
"But you, genius that you are, wanted to stay here and... search through meaningless memos in Lex's office."
"So while we were over here, photographing everything but the bottled water, the story of a lifetime was happening right across the street."
Take a look at the view.
One of tonight's shots from Lex's office.
What?
"The schoolboy crush is sweet, but you need to adjust your focus in more ways than one here."
This is serious.
Bodies are literally falling out of the sky.
And we have the picture to prove it.
- Lex's office looks out over Luthorcorp.
"Why not just go for the kill in the beginning, just knock him out, first round?"
The fancy embraced sporting enthusiasts from all classes of society.
"The Regent himself was a devotee, but so were servants and even highwaymen."
Fantastic.
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
The Regency was an age of gambling mania.
Gentlemen risked vast fortunes and dismissed their losses with an attitude bordering on the cavalier.
Five... five...
I'll take the first blood.
"That's it, I'm closing this book."
"Gentlemen of the fancy, the first fighter to make his appearance..."
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
Will be your local hero and champion...
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
The Kentchurch Bruiser!
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
"And now, gentlemen, the challenger will arrive from across a boundary."
"Give him a Kentchurch welcome, gentlemen."
"Like music, boxing was another area of Regency life in which black men flourished, and some of the most famous fighters of the age... former slaves... became household names."
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
"The favorite tonight, despite what you all think about your local lad, is the Killer..."
"Matthew ""Killer"" Skelton from Virginia in the United States."
"Now, many of us... many of us still regard it as ""the colonies."""
They will come back into the empire.
It's only a matter of time before they realize the error of their ways.
Jeez!
"When I opened my eyes, I was on board in fishing trawler."
"It was then I learned, that I have been two months since I have disappeared."
"Since that date forward, I have not had the guts to head out to sea."
"Andres, we all know there's something down there."
Another world.
Another form of life.
myabe they are from the past.
from a vanished from of life.
I do not know what is it that they want.
But I do know is that they need us.
"I am an old man now, and my only regret is not having returned to unravel that mystery."
"But you can, go there, but speak of this to no one, or you would be considered as insane!"
Are you worried?
I am.
I is I who should be going down there.
Do you fear for me?
"I do, yes, this is where Enrique and I dived, but, please, do not dive all the way down."
"and if you feel a queer sensation of listlesness and hopelesness, return immediatedly."
"It is a sign of danger, you would be at the treshold of another dimension."
"Do not let yourself be decieved and return immediatedly, I beg of you!"
You must not hesitate!
"If you wait one moment, it would be too late!"
"Paco, help her!"
"""another ship dissapears"""
How is it going?
"Ricardo, I am glad to see you."
"I came as soon as I could, what is wrong?"
"You be the judge, appart from Maria's boat, other ships have dissapeared in the same place."
And some mysterious images that appear and dissapear from underwater photographs.
"And there was also a shark that nudged me, as if to only scare me from going deeper."
You went diving?
Andres should not have allowed it.
"Now, if my suspicions are sustained, I won't wait for a formal hearing:"
I'll have you summarily executed:
"Guards, take him away:!"
"Why, good afternoon, Captain Rogers, Hawk:"
I trust your excursion to Vor-Deeth was a pleasant one:
"Crichton, I can't believe this:"
You're actually being courteous today?
"But why shouldn't I be, sir?"
"After all, a robot owes his human masters every measure of respect:"
[Chuckles] You mean you are acknowledging that we are your masters?
"You created us, did you not?"
"- How about you, Twiki?"
"- What do you mean, how about me?"
Are we playing guessing games?
"Twiki, are you all right?"
What do you care?
What do any of you care?
Since when have you humans been overly concerned about how I feel?
All I am is a mechanical servant:
"Now if you'll excuse me, I've been summoned to the bridge:"
The admiral probably expects me to fix him a cup of tea: : :
Or something equally important:
Ha!
I don't know what they want me to do:
Always asking me to do something:
Have a most pleasant day:
"[Twiki] Twiki do this, Twiki, do that:"
"It's discrimination, if you ask me:"
I think they're both out of their heads:
Incredible:
Their personalities are completely transformed:
"Yeah, I think we better get to that sick bay as quickly as possible:"
"Well, you see, I felt so... so happy and delighted to work on things."
"I mean, to work on something like this was just... was just thrilling."
"And when... when we were working on projects, we were just completely absorbed with the ideas."
And... and... and there was just great freedom and love of what we were doing.
And so that was the price that I paid.
"It was worth it, you know?"
My parents met by chance at a party in Philadelphia.
"My mother was 32, and Lou was almost 60."
Her family was appalled by the relationship.
"And when she got pregnant, she decided to disappear for a while."
"She went to stay with her friends,"
Charles and Susannah Jones.
They offered to adopt me if she had to give me up.
I was amazed to see this little man that she was so taken with.
"And I didn't quite get his number, I have to say."
"I mean, he turned on the charm."
"And I was sort of a Yankee, and it didn't rub off."
"I mean, I didn't get it."
And then it revolved that she was pregnant and that her family really resented that and...
- didn't accept...
"- No, they didn't."
They didn't accept that.
"And time went by, and I said to Charles,"
"""You know, what's she going to do?"
"""She hasn't made arrangements,"
"""and the family isn't coming through."
"""They're making it difficult."
"""I really think we should do something."""
"And there was one sister, Edwina, who did stand by her and said, ""You know what I can do?"
"""I can provide a man to stand up with you"
"""and get married and give a name to that child,"
"""and then you just can get divorced two weeks later."""
- You said...
"- You should go, too lt's pointless staying"
Can't we do something?
Forget it
We tried everything.
The power won't come back
Pass me the crowbar
What are you doing here?
Welcome.
Have a seat
I'm afraid I can't offer you anything
Any idea when the power might come back?
You can stay at the Helping Hand.
We have electrical generators
And supplies
Not to mention dormitories if you want to sleep in the warm
Thank you for coming I'm sure you realise we have something important to say
"A few days ago, Claire had an experience that was absolutely extraordinary"
She shared it with me and I'm grateful
Now we both want to share this news with you
Because we trust you and because we need your help
What you are about to see goes beyond logic and will change how you see the world
You will have to accept it
"From now on, we are all on the same journey"
Camille?
Camille?
Claire you know this is impossible
But it's real
"If Audrey came back, you would know her immediately"
Camille has come back to us
And it's our duty to make her welcome
Does that mean that other children will come back?
"I didn't mean to intrude,"
"That's all right, Lieutenant."
That's remarkable.
"Yes, sir."
"Remarkable how you do that, sir."
My wife would like to have you around.
"Thank you, Lieutenant."
"You know, this bio, sir, it doesn't say anything about when you were first discovered, and what you were doing when you were discovered, who discovered you."
I'm going to have a little chat with the publicity department about that.
"Come to think of it, sir, it was Mrs. Daley who discovered you, wasrt it?"
"Now, Lieutenant, I told you all about that with great emotion and in great detail the first time we met."
"Well, that's what I mean, sir, it should be in here."
"Excuse me, Kenny."
Thank you.
Where were you and when...
"Lieutenant, why don't you just ask me what it is you wanna know?"
"Where did Mrs. Daley discover you, sir?"
That's something even my wife doesn't know.
It doesn't say anything here in the bio.
It doesn't even say whether Ward Fowler's your real name or not.
And that's something any Lieutenant Lucerne fan would wanna know.
Why don't we stop pretending that I'm brilliant and you're simple for one moment.
I'm gonna confide something in you.
"Anything you tell me, sir, it's between us."
Like the shoes.
"Lieutenant, my real name, so help me, Charles Kipling."
And you're the only one who knows that.
"Now, Charles Kipling was in a little bit of trouble when Claire first found him."
"Actually, I was doing theater in Toronto."
"Claire and I hit it off big, she thought I had a great future, she persuaded me to leave Canada."
And that was the beginning.
"The trouble straightened itself out, of course."
"In the First World War, the Jews and the Bolsheviks stabbed Germany in the back."
"Even as German blood spilled in our just and noble cause, the enemy within sought to destroy us by treachery!"
The bad within must be extracted.
We must protect Germany!
I must save the motherland from this defilement!

You could never understand a man of will.
"The problem with you Jews is you think you know so much-- the inside of a man, this nonsense about the ""id"" and ""superego."""
A man is the sum total of his acts.
Success justifies all.
"So, what can we learn from your actions?"
"That a man is his own creation, his own artwork."
To use only reason is to close the door to the power of an idea like blood and soil.

What of your inner world?
"I know myself completely, I know my personal myths."
That is enough.
"With the answers to 1,000 questions, you and your kind could not begin to understand me."
Only a poet could touch the edge of the Führer mystery.
Where was I?
"Ah, I remember now."
"One power alone makes a great leader-- imagination, divine vision."
I took those words from someone.
I can't remember whom.
It's good to be writing again.
"Film is the magician's mirror... the first art form which allows the artist to project his dreams and fantasies, into the inner life of the viewer, to reshape and capture his soul, to create a perfect reality"

I am the artist.
I am the artwork.
I was Homer.
I was Ulysses.
Hmm?
She is... horny!
...cannot be connected.
After the beep-
Who?
The guy that you went to KAIST with?
Is that guy ignoring you call again?
I'm going to be working overnight in the lab since some important pieces came in.
Again?
How nice would it have been if you had just gone to med school and become a doctor like your mom had suggested?
That c-c-conser-whatever that you're saying you...
"Conservation science, Unni."
If you say that medical science is extending the life of humanity as it's goal then conservation science is an important work that extends the life of humanity's cultural heritage.
Sure.
"Hurry and go extend the lives of those ceramic pots, ink stones, and those kids."
But did Ji Hyeon's aunt graduate from KAIST?
That's why she acts so high and mighty like that all the time.
Why?
My son went there too.
"The one you brag about all the time, the one you say is so handsome?"
Yes.
"When my son was young, his eyes were so pretty when I took him out it was hard to walk ten steps straight with him because people asked so much if they could hold him and touch him."
That son was even so good a student?
It's a difficult age for a dragon to be born from a small stream.
(IT'S DIFFICULT TO GO FROM RAGS TO RICHES IN THIS DAY AND AGE)
It's not a small stream.
What?
It's a very wide and blue sea.
What's she saying.
Do you have some great background that I don't know about?
What is it?
As if.
"As you know, Mom's been going to business school... at the community college for three years now."
I believe she's mentioned it.
She's doing very well and she's finishing up.
"Actually, she's graduating Thursday, and there's going to be a ceremony."
I think it would mean a lot to her if you guys were there.
"It may not seem like it would, but it's true."
"If it would mean so much to her, why didn't she invite us herself?"
'Cause she didn't think you'd want to go.
"And I get that, but I think it's a mistake."
I had a school thing once.
"I wasn't sure if Mom would want to go, so I didn't invite her."
It was my kindergarten Salute To Vegetables pageant... and I was Broccoli and I did a tap dance with Beets.
"And the entire number, I was just thinking, 'Mom's not here. '"
And it was my fault that she wasn't there.
"Well, it was kind of a life lesson for me."
"Now, if the thought of going to Mom's graduation... upsets you, or makes you unhappy, or uncomfortable in any way... then please don't go."
"Because this is an important night for Mom... and if you go, you should go under the right circumstances."
Those are the tickets.
"It's Thursday, 7:00 p. m."
"It's indoors, so weather's not an issue."
You can use them or not.
No hard feelings.
Do what you feel is best.
"And, if you don't mind, I would really appreciate it... if you would keep this conversation between the three of us."
That's all I have to say.
Thanks very much for your patience.
I believe I have time for a scone before my bus leaves.
"Beatrice, the tea, please."
"Emily, these look delicious."
"So, Richard, how was your day today?"
"I am feeling so good, sister, because it's over."
"No more finals, no more studying, no more school."
The division staff is on the line.
"Comrade colonel, it is lnozemtsev reporting."
-The pawn has reached the last line.
- l got it.
Now let it keep the positions with all possible might.
"Comrade colonel, Malyutin is preventing the enemyfrom unwrapping into the battle formation."
and adjusting the friendly artilleryfire.
The communication with him now is off.
"Put me through to the front staff operative section, quickly ls the enemy advancing at the main direction?"
There is a considerable advance.
Our last data shows that the Germans are rushing theirtank reserves to our breakthrough point at Hill 89.
"lnozemtsev, you are right as always."
"Comrade colonel, the Army staff is on the line."
"Comrade general, Yegorov reporting."
The Germans moved their mobile reserves in.
-The offensive is on the verge of defaulting.
- l can see that.
What can you suggest?
"While lnozemtsev is keeping this hill, we still have chances."
"Your suggestions, please."
"First, to move the fire of the corps artilleryto the hill."
Your point taken.
"Second, immediately move ourtank reserves in."
The Germans are about to close the breakthrough at the key section ofthe main advance direction.
- Right.
"- lt is the onlyway out, comrade general."
"Wait forthe final decision, and in the meantime support lnozemtsev."
"- Report to me every 10, no, every 5 minutes."
-All right.
- lnozemtsev!
"-Yes, mayor."
I'm urgently moving mytanks from the road to the positions ofyour regiment.

He seems to be a great authority

"Then please you, sir, to undertake the business for us"
Here is that gold I have.
Walk before toward the sea-side.
If I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune would not suffer me

Because landing fees here are very reasonable... so it's one cent.
These are for you to do as you wish to improve your airport.
I think that's the cheapest airport
I've ever landed at in my whole life.
"When you fly in the day it's very bumpy, because the sun heats the surface of the African earth and it just gets these currents of air straight up."
"At night, it's completely different."
The air is calm and still.
You can see the stars.
You can see fires on the ground.
You can see the moonlight reflecting off of lakes.
And it's very calm and peaceful and kind of reflective time.
You're suspended in space over this large black think that you can't see.
It's mysterious.
The chimpanzee orphanage in northern Burundi was founded by the Jane Goodall Institute in 1989.
Chimps confiscated from smugglers are brought here to be cared for by conservationists and volunteers.
Dean Anderson is the director of the refuge.
"At the moment, it is home to 17 chimpanzees, and one baby gorilla."
How old is she?
She's about three
She was confiscated at the airport.
She was taken from her forest home as all the other chimps here...
"In Zaire... eastern Zaire, because she's an eastern lowland gorilla, by poachers and then she was brought to ;"
she was in transport... now what they were going to do with her there
I don't know.
Probably a zoo or...
Is that where they were mostly going to zoos at one point?
Zoos probably.
A gorilla would probably go to a zoo.
'Cuz a private person would just...
No...
"Not be so interested, right, because they get too big and too violent?"
"Yes, well too big."
"And Charles and I said, ""No way."
"""We don't want to have anything to do with that."
"""That's such a travesty of marriage."
"""Just go ahead with it and have this baby."
"""It's going to be all right."
"""Let him keep his name if you want,"
"""or have him take your name."
"Don't worry about that."""
"And I also have to say that you had to recognize it right at the beginning from Harriet's point of view as a very true love, an immense love... and that it would be a lifelong love,"
which I think it has been.
"And you can't judge that, because that kind of love is on the side of life and is a good thing."
"My uncles, Abbot and Willie, never bought that romantic love affair idea."
They hated my father and refused to ever even mention his name.
"Maybe if he'd married my mother, it would have been different."
"But even as her husband,"
Lou would not exactly have been their idea of an Episcopalian gentleman.
"My mothers' sisters, however, would talk with me about him."
Did the family feel that she needed to get away from... from everybody for a while?
I don't think our family had anything to do with it.
"I mean, I think it was your father who determined that Harriet should go."
- Ask her sometime.
- Really?
But she... but you didn't think she should come to the vineyard with you to live?
I couldn't at the time.
I wasn't in a position to have her.
"And she didn't want to come to New York with me, 'cause I told her that she could come to New York with me."
"And she chose not to, which was fine."
I don't...
"And Abbot came to me, and he said,"
"""I think she should have an abortion""."
I said abs...
I said no.
"Pablo, look at the sea!"
The sea
Isn't it beautiful?
Didn't you want the sea?
"Well, there you have it"
All for you
No security guard in the outside?
Not that I know
Let's sit down
Did you see that sign?
SAFE VAULT WITH DELAYED OPENING
It's a delayed opening for them
We'll know for sure once we're inside
"For me, it's a go what do you think, Angela?"
Alright How much cash is there inside?
"On saturdays Four or five millions, for sure"
I like that
"What I find crazy is coming here with the car, Pablo"
Let's do something
We'll leave my car far away
And get here by walk
And steal a car from the ones parked here
"Look, look"
Do you see that guy?
We get inside along with him
"Then I take the keys from him and you wait for us in the outside, right?"
"The three of us, as soon as we get out of the bank We'll leave in the car if we're able to"
"If we aren't, each one has to escape by himself"
And we'll reunite later in the flat
OK
"We'll have to do it fast One minute, one and a half minutes top"
"If not, it's dangerous"
"Yes, yes."
"Inarticulacy, authenticity."
- He still can't act.
"- No, no, he really can't."
"But Hilliard can, so we get Hilliard to coach him, some sort of on-the-spot dumb show, so the Yank knows what he's meant to be doing."
"Gentlemen, I fear there has been some sort of misapprehension."
"I am an actor, a somewhat derided calling, but mine nonetheless."
"Perhaps because we are engaged in an imitation of life, there is a common misconception that anything living can do what we do."
"You have found that not to be so, for which I offer my, um, sincerest commiserations."
But I am an actor.
I know only my art.
"Of teaching, of coaching, of dumb show, of these things, I'm afraid I know nothing."
I'm so sorry to disappoint.
"Mr. Hilliard, you're right."
You're right.
Everything you just said.
It's about respect for the art and for the artists.
"And it makes me think how wrong we've been, playing Uncle Frank for laughs."
"Yes, he's a drunkard and a clown, but he's also all those people who gave their sons to one war and now their grandsons to another."
"If we served that truth, if we gave you an Uncle Frank really worth your time and your talent,"
I wonder if you would consider putting that same time and talent towards helping Mr. Lundbeck and the picture?
Mmm.
I don't think we've been properly introduced.
I'm Catrin Cole.
I'm one of the writers.
"Catrin, between us, we'll have them weeping in the aisles."
I need to let Ellis know that I won't be there for his opening.
I'll arrange a telegram.
The least we can do.
Time and talent was good.
- Did you think of it beforehand?
His exhibition only lasts two weeks.
- Stopping.
- Crossing.
- Waiting.
The Pie-Maker took precautions to ensure Chuck felt safe at home.
"Slippers were worn, adorned with bells."
- Going.
- Stopping.
Following.
Digby kept his eyes open to the hazards of touch  a canine proximity alert  who could not only play dead  but could do so from experience.
"Neither the Pie-Maker nor Chuck could move  without the other one knowing  and to the Pie-Maker, it felt like home."
"So Chuck and the Pie-Maker built a home together, bee by bee."
"Tragically, rogue pesticides killed those bees, but only briefly."
This will go better if you wear less clothes.
You've already got me shucked like an ear of corn.
"Well, I'm shucked too, way down to my silky intimates just to put on a beekeeper suit."
Remind me why you're shucked and silky.
I thought it was only fair.
You stopped being fair.
Right.
You do realize I can get new bees.
I can make a new home for new bees.
You love these bees.
"A happy hive's a happy home, and you can't be happy if you're dead."
There are a thousand dead bees here.
I don't want butterflies to die because you bring my bees back.
Think about it as a pest-control issue.
There's a water-bug infestation in the drainpipes.
If I touch 1000 little dead bees to life maybe 1000 little water bugs will no longer be a problem.
"Last time I asked you to bring something back, you said no."
It was your dad.
"That would've been weird, if not actively traumatic."
"To bring my dad back even for a minute, it may be ghoulish, but it's also sweet like a taxidermied pet, or someone's ashes in a teddy bear."
lies only a way to death
I suggest you beg for mercy we uphold our principles to be righteous
Death to us is no concern
"You want us to surrender, forget it"
Hack off all their right arms
See how tough they are
Yes wait
Aren't you ashamed of this barbaric deed?
what's so shameful about destroying an evil sect?
who do you think you are?
You dare to lecture me?
Even if you had the Dragon Sabre
You have spar with our Heaven Sword first
I have no Dragon Sabre but I have a better heart than you
I am willing to take the punishment you've planned for them
You've all heard this
"Right, if you could take 3 palm strikes from me"
I'll let them go but if you lose
I will die with no complaints
I have one more request
If I win I get to take the girl as well
"Okay, release him"
Yes
I have took your first blow
I used only less than half my normal power
Looks like I'll have to use the Jiu Yang kung fu
You still have one more blow
Teacher...
Teacher...
"Strange, how does he know the Jiu Yang kung fu?"
we're saved...
I have blocked 3 of your blows now you can let them go
Have you read it?
No.
Are you anti-semitic?
No!
Is Hitler right doing what he's doing to the Jews?
No!
You don't understand.
I just wanted the facts.
Spencer gave them to you?
"While he was at the hotel,"
"Spencer took possession of a letter smuggled out of whitehall and given to him by a traitor--Rosemary harwood, and given to him in the hope that he'd pass it on to the enemy."
"After the murder, Spencer was trapped."
"He had the letter, but he didn't know what to do with it."
He gave it to you because you were the one person at the hotel we wouldn't dream of searching.
"After the investigation, you'd send it back to him, and he'd pass it on to the Germans."
Do you want my resignation?
"No, I don't want your resignation."
That's the last thing I want.
I can't do this bloody godforsaken job on my own.
"What I want is to forget all of this happened and, more importantly, for you, starting now, to be with me 100%."
"In spite of whatever problems you're going through, it's important that you and me and Sam are able to trust each other and we're on the same side."
Is that understood?
"Yes, sir."
Understood.
Good.
That's all.
Radio:
"We've known them and laughed at them, these fussy little steamers, all our lives."
"We've called them the ""shilling sicks."""
"We've watched them load and unload their crowds of holiday passengers, the gents full of high spirits and bottled beer, the ladies eating pork pies, the children sticky with peppermint rock."
"But now, look."
"This little steamer, like all her brave and battered sisters, is immortal."
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do -- all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
Your father and I never had a childhood.
Nothing came easy for us -- ever.
"You're so lucky, Paige."
Mop and bucket are in the basement.
You know who I am?
I do.
Then we can forgo the pleasantries.
This war has gotten very personal for me.
"And I need you to listen carefully, because it affects you, too."
I'm listening.
I'm in a lot of trouble because your Soviet Foreign Minister won't accept that Vlad Kosygin was the tragic victim of a mugging gone wrong.
I could lose my job or even go to jail because of it.
"If either of those things happens,"
I'll make sure you go down with me.
"Uh, nothing."
Thank you.
"Before he disappeared,"
Richard Patterson gave a very detailed testimony about his kidnapping and torture by two KGB illegals.
"The second my punishment is handed down,"
I'll release his classified testimony to the press.
"Now, think of what that will mean for you and your people at the Rezidentura -- all those deportations."
Moscow will not be pleased when they have to rebuild their US operation from scratch.
"As we like to say in America, ""Heads will roll"" -- your head being at the top of the list."
"So... you see, my problem is now your problem."
"I heard so much about you, Mr. Gaad."
"I hoped that one day, we would have the chance to meet face-to-face."
I just wish it was under less trying circumstances.
Good day.
Are you okay?
What?
It's Halloween weekend.
Arson investigators have noticed a three-year trend in the days leading up to Halloween.
Devil's Night.
This unsub is killing only these three days out of the year.
How's he doing it?
He's burning his victims alive.
He's abducting seemingly random people and dumping their bodies in abandoned parts of town.
- He struck again last night.
- Yeah.
"Tony Torrell, 40."
"He lives in the suburbs, but he was found 20 miles away in the Rivertown district."
He's attacking the city at its most vulnerable time.
What does he do during the rest of the year?
He's dormant.
"You know, arsonists are typically white males between 17 and 25 who can't stay away from fire."
"Yeah, they're addicted to it, and there's no rehab."
"And they target dwellings, not people."
"So you're saying he burns his victims alive, but he's not an arsonist?"
Fire is simply his weapon.
And Devil's Night gives him the perfect cover to kill.
And we've got 48 hours before he disappears again.
"Well, his last victim was athletic."
He wouldn't be easy to subdue.
The offender must be just as strong or might have an upper hand if he's younger.
"Still, how does he transport his victims across the city and get them inside buildings without being noticed?"
"[Hotch] Niccolo Machiavelli wrote,"
"""If an injury has to be done to a man, it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared. """
"Now, I thought Devil's Night was Halloween Eve."
"You know, the moniker ""Devil's Night"" is somewhat deceiving."
"In Detroit, it's actually a three-day citywide cultural phenomenon, complete with masks, chaos, and costumes."
Say that three times fast.
I have to go.
Hibara-san?
Now I get it!
It's not possessing her!
It's coming out of her!
There was a monster calledEnenra that Sekien made prints of.
Something coming up from the poor mas's house like smoke to rid the air of mosquitos...
It twists and becomes a suspicious shape.
"If it is something that is opaque and easily destroyed by the wind, it is called Enenra."
What that means is that shabby houses were made to smolder.
The fire and smoke would twist around each other and produce strange shapes.
But that smoke was like a thin cloth that could easily be torn apart.
"If the wind blows, it was blown away."
It was something that was very fleeting.
Is that the smoke that I see around Saho-san?
The ra of Enenra can mean net.
"If she simply keeps thinking about the fact that she cannot get the answers to her questions, it is like her vision is obstructed by smoke."
It is like she's caught in a net because she can't even see the things that occur around in her daily life.
It is just like the description of an Enenra.
Enenra...
It is not a good thing.
"If it were a little smoke there might be some benefit to it, but that much smoke makes it hard to breathe around her."
The only way to get rid of the smoke is to give her some wind.
Wind?
Don't you think she wants some form of wind?
Sis...
Are you thinking about Saho-san?
"Yeah, I was."
I was thinking about the fact that Saho-san wants to see the other side.
I don't know what to do since she has so much interest in that stuff.
Maybe that is just because I am still immature.
Mizuki...
Carter.
"Forgive me, I..."
I've been foolish.
No.
It was my fault that we argued.
No.
- There's something I want to say to you.
"- Please, don't tire yourself."
My affection for you has never changed.
You must believe that.
I...
I thought you might like to see this.
It's part of a lamp that we found in the tomb.
"There were two cups, this is the inner, which when lit would cast its picture on the outer."
It shows Tutankhamun and his queen.
It's beautiful.
Even I can tell it's the real thing.
Tell Evelyn not to worry.
I'm prepared.
(Evelyn sobbing)
"For an Egyptian Pharaoh, death was not the end."
It was a beginning.
Tutankhamun now embarked on his most important journey into the underworld.
"There, he would be united with the gods and complete the cycle of resurrection and regeneration."
"But first, Tutankhamun's body must be preserved with salt."
All of his internal organs except the heart and kidneys were removed.
"His brain was withdrawn through his nose and discarded, while other organs were preserved in an alabaster chest."
"Finally, Tutankhamun's mummified body was wrapped in bandages and placed within a series of golden coffins for transportation to the Valley of the Kings."
"Tutankhamun's young widow, Ankhesamun, had produced no heir, so the former advisor, Ay, now came to the throne."
"To cement his power, he married Tutankhamun's widow, probably another incestuous marriage."
There is evidence that Ankhesamun was Ay's own granddaughter.
What saddens me the most is that he won't be at my wedding.
"""Did she really say that or did I imagine it?"""
"I mean, I think I'm probably the only person in the country who picked up on it."
"So, what do you think?"
She's actually serious about this man.
Talk about shock.
I do feel for you.
"But, the thing is, you have to somehow... find a way out of it and let go of all that torment and analysis."
I know I sound like one of those West Coast self-help books.
But that's because there's one I've just been reading...
"The Power of Now, if you really start to listen to what he's saying, that you've got to try and focus on the present, because that's actually all we've got, and spiritually try and lose all that mental baggage...."
"Any poppadoms, sir?"
"Madam, for you?"
Would you like plain or spicy?
"Plain, thank you."
"-And spicy for me, please."
"-Spicy, for sir."
Thank you.
"I know, it's interesting you said all that because once I went away and started thinking about everything...."
How can I put this?
"The awful thing, or the good thing, depending how you look at it, is that I actually found that I wasn't as shocked or upset as I suppose I should have been."
"-Oh, really?"
-Which sort of suggests....
Anything to drink at all?
Small cocktail or aperitif?
"Or, would you like to see our wine list here?"
"-Just a glass of white wine, thank you."
"-And a pint of lager for me, please."
-Lager.
-Thank you.
"You see, there's something that..."
"I'm not sure if you're aware of this, Alice, but when my mother conceived me it was actually about 1 2 months before she met my dad."
"And so, you know, strictly speaking..."
No.
Didn't you also find that the necklace had been stolen?
"And didn't you then kill your wife, using this weapon?"
That's not true!
Not true that the necklace had been stolen?
"Did you also take the necklace, Mr. Langley?"
"No, I didn't."
"No, I was in the garden, I tell you, all that time."
I never left!
"But a certain woman left that garden, didn't she?"
The nameless woman you'd been embracing--
"That woman left the garden, didn't she?"
Well--
"Well, yes."
"She did, as a matter of fact."
"Who was that woman, Mr. Langley?"
Gina Gilbert.
You filthy old man!
You didn't have to tell him!
[judge pounding]
Don't you know what I did for you?
"Stupid, filthy, rotten man!"
"I knew Howard made a hopeful play for every woman he ever met, but I never guessed he'd got around to Gina."
"It had gone further than that, Mr. Kirk."
"Gina wanted to marry Howard and help him manage Merle's estate, if only Olivia could have been disposed of."
A divorce wasn't the answer because Olivia had such a hold over Merle.
Then Danny came on the scene.
Danny was looking for someone who had entree to the wealthy set.
Gina went along with his plan to steal the necklace because first he knew that she was wanted by the police back east and second because it afforded her a perfect chance to murder Olivia.
"Gina put on an evening gown, slipped quietly through the party, killed the unconscious Olivia, and got back in time to meet the messenger who delivered the stolen diamonds."
"Oh, that's what you meant when you said the girl at the motel was not maybe disrobed."
Exactly.
"Let me begin by saying that I am glad to see you safe, Count Mazuurek."
"My apologies for causing you to worry, Count Barouhcruz."
"So, what are your plans?"
I have none as yet.
"I have lost my Kataphraktos, as well."
"If you wish to ally yourself with Count Troyard, I can act as intermediary."
I have heard what happened with Count Marylcian.
It must have been most galling.
"No, both sides fought fairly, and that was the result."
There is nothing to hold a grudge over.
"Count Barouhcruz, Troyard is dangerous."
"He not only killed Marylcian, there are even suspicions that he also killed Count Saazbaum-."
It doesn't matter who it is.
I merely...
But you-.
Hold your tongue.
How could you let yourself be misled by such unfounded rumors?
"You heard Princess Asseylum's proclamation, I take it?"
No one can stop Count Troyard's rise.
"Not when he holds all the cards, even Aldnoah activation privileges."
"As they say, ""Do not try to fight an Olympian sandstorm."""
"If you wish to make a comeback, I suggest you choose wisely."
Count Barouhcruz pledges his full and unconditional cooperation.
"Counts Sebring and Raffia have have yet to make their allegiances clear, but they appear to be amenable to acknowledging the new kingdom."
Morale is also on the increase within the base.
We have almost finished going through the list of knights who seem likely to oppose you.
We are ready to take forceful steps at any time.
Milord Slaine?
Is something the matter?
"Begging your pardon, Milord, but is it about Princess Asseylum's recovery?"
You want me to give her time off?
Eddelrittuo?
"Mr. Sheridan wasn't the only recipient of Jeanette's favors, was he?"
Having an affair with your sister-in-law isn't very nice.
That's more in Father Sullivan's area than mine.
"Your brother and your wife, they don't know,"
I presume?
Inspector...
Don't try and protest.
We' got a witness from the hotel.
It's not what it seems.
"No, well it's not for me to judge, is it, sir."
I mean we must face these things ourselves.
"Mea Culpa, as they used to say."
"Anyway, can you tell me where you were the night your sister- in -law was killed?"
"I was here, my wife was at a charity dinner."
My children were at a party.
Are you reduced to throwing accusations at anyone who spent the evening alone?
"No not anyone, Mr. Barr."
Shall I tell you what I've got.
Now I don't know what happened the first time around with Harriet but you got away with it.
You seemed to be getting away with it the second time around.
"Be that as it may,"
"let's look at it another way, shall we?"
We've got proof that you spent the afternoon in bed with your sister-in-law.
"Now suppose, just suppose that your brother found out."
That would be a pretty powerful motive for him to want to kill her.
Now she was a big shareholder in the company she was trying to screw money out of Barr Electronics.
That's another reason why James would want to kill his wife.
So you see.
"If I can't prove anything else since you won't budge,"
I'm afraid your brother James is looking at somewhere between ten to fifteen years inside.
How do you think he will survive jail?
"I mean you, you've got through that special school, didn't you?"
It says Stephen means...
"Well, I think you'll find that when they invented the name Alan, it was a boulder, and over time, it might have worn down."
Perhaps now it's a little pebble.
But a beautiful pebble that would skim really well across a flat surface.
I'll tell you the answer.
"You do get your points though, I think, for knowing that Alan means rock or pebble."
"You'll actually find most of them not in any Celtic country, but on the Russian border, in the northern Caucasus mountains, where the Alan tribe have lived since being driven there by the Huns in the 4th century."
- The Alans...
- That was a bad weekend.
We still talk about that.
"- Alan Coren, Alan Bennett and Alan Parsons."
- All of us.
We get together.
We conference call.
"And if someone mentions the Huns, quite often there's a lull in the conversation and we have to gather ourselves."
"Of course, the Alans were master horsemen who introduced the idea of chivalry to Europe and may have inspired the stories of King Arthur and his knights."
"The great Pliny the Elder, however, takes..."
"Pliny the Elder, who I know is a source of constant mental nourishment to you, Alan."
He takes a very...
"a very different view, firmly telling us that Alans are a race of bastard degenerates."
(applause)
- He doesn't know anything at all.
- (Stephen) No.
- Is he the Roman one?
- But I have to come clean myself.
"If Alans are going to be attacked, I will be in the queue being herded onto the trains too because my father is an Alan."
- Is he?
- So there's a little bit of Alan in me.
- Is there any Alan in you?
"- No, no."
Do you want some?
My name means...
Attack Yi Soon-shin's camp in Yudo on November 19th?
"Yes, General."
"Water level is high for three days after the spring tide, and the current will be favorable, so it is the best day for battle?"
General Konishi is impressive.
"In order to sail clear to Japan, we need the water to be calm."
I'm sure he took that into consideration as well.
Yes...
But So...
Yi Soon-shin is likely to have figured all of this out the moment he saw Yoshira's messenger craft getting away.
General...
There is nothing Yi Soon-shin does not know about naval warfare.
His knowledge is almost supernatural.
So he will place his men at the best location and wait for us to sail right into his trap.
Where do you think that location is?
"Noryang Channel, sir?"
But will Wakizaka come through Noryang?
He fell into similar traps twice in Hansando and Myongryang and suffered crushing defeat both times.
He probably learned his lesson by now.
"If he has any brains, he will avoid Noryang."
That's why we will have to make him come.
How?
We can't hit him in the head and make him stupid...
All we have to do is abandon Noryang.
Pardon?
Avoid Noryang and go around Mijo to the open sea?
"But sir, the open sea is very rough and dangerous."
Unless we're prepared for some losses...
"If we go through Noryang, we could lose the entire fleet."
That's the painful lesson I learned in Myongryang.
We will go around Mijo as close to the shore as possible and strike
Yi Soon-shin's fleet positioned in Noryang from the rear.
Deliver it to General Kwon Yul immediately.
- Fur coats?
- Fur coats?
So what I'm trying to say is that let's not cause any trouble.
"Since you're planning to kill, how about doing it on the 1000th year?"
I'd be glad to do a good deed before I die.
And another thing.
"You need three more livers, right?"
We do indeed.
"Okay, I will be responsible to find the rest for you all."
"I'm very talented at conning people, you know."

"And if I get high with one of my main life stressors,"
I don't think I'm gonna have a good time.
"And when I went to visit her, I had a rental car, and I let my mom drive it."
"And the steering wheel was thinner than the steering wheel in her car that she drives every day, so she made note of it and was like,"
"""This steering wheel is too thin."
"I like a big, thick steering wheel."""
"And I was like, ""Okay."""
"And she goes, ""Yeah, you know why?"
"'Cause it reminds me of gripping a big dick."""
"And I was like, ""No!"""
"And then she kept going... and was like, ""Yeah, bet you didn't think"
"I had a preference."""
"And I was like,"
"""Why would I ever think about that?"
"No, it hasn't crossed my mind."""
But looking back at how many grips and covers and cushions my mom used to put on her steering wheel when I was younger... safe to say that Mommy likes it big.
"Which is good for me to know, because it shows me that we have more in common that I thought."
"I like getting to know my mom as an adult, because there were so many holes of knowledge when I was younger."
There were just so many things I didn't know.
"Like, I knew certain things, but didn't know the backstory of those things."
I knew that she doesn't like white people.
And I could take some guesses as to why.
But it was never explained.
"One day, we were in her car, and she stopped to let this old white couple pass in front of us, and she lets out this deep sigh like, ""Ugh..."
"White people."""
"And I was like, ""Uh...what's wrong?"
"They're not even talking to us right now."""
"And she goes, ""Memories."""
And that's where the conversation ended.
And she would do that a lot.
"She'd just chalk things up to memories, and I would never follow up and ask what those memories were."
"And I was so young and just, like, left to my own devices."
Tót lived exemplary domestic life.
"His wife, Mariska, not only liked it, but felt it so own one being superior to himself that she obeyed him eye-moving."
Could have pricked it yet the my darling
"Everything, which was beautiful on the world, was his father though for Ágika."
The flying of a swallow
"Oh, my God so beautiful."
Than the dad.
The chocolate melting in the mouth
"Sweet, good."
Than my dad.
"That dizziness, when into a red rose we are watching."
Than the dad.
But the in the village was a fan of a fireman commander.
Since the postman was called in for a soldier on the front of the war...
Gyuri carried away the letters handling the holiness of the privacy of correspondence somewhat freely
With truth division passion one is individual on a manner interpreted.
Yes.
"Was a little bit idiotic, but not dangerously."
The dogs were the principal targets of his idiotic impulses.
He annoyed the Alsatians with superstitious hatred.
He adored Tót Lajos.
Was amorous quasi into him.
He was able to look at his pictures until clocks if he got into the living room of Tót.
"The human symmetry was Tót in Gyuri's eye, so the superlative of the dignity, and liked it until being enthusiastic about this."
Tót may have thanked this adoration for the fact that the bad news was obtained never from the war.
But if the post brought good news...
Lajos uncle!
Mariska is an old lady!
Post!
Good news!
"Ágika, my glasses!"
Show me Gyuri!
And gross.
"Anyway, you want to start decorating?"
- No.
"- Well, don't leave it for tomorrow."
It's gonna be a clusterfuck.
- What are you doing?
"- Uhh, cutting limes."
- What for?
- For fucking gin and tonics.
"Iâm not asking anymore, Iâm just doing, it's fucking stupid."
You don't have to use them.
We're gonna have limes and lemons and olives like every bar on the face of the earth.
- Okay.
man:
"Hey, you know what?"
I figured out Trump.
woman:
Yeah?
- Yeah.
He's the neediest guy in the world.
"Like, he's really needy and he really needs this to be president more than anything, and we're all gonna vote for him, 'cause we're a generous country and we help people that are in need."
- Maybe he just wants to give back.
"You ever think of that, you cynical chimp?"
"- No, he can't do that."
He cannot give back.
That's gonna make his hole way deeper.
You understand that?
"Google ""Trump charity,"" okay?"
"All that's gonna come up is, you know, some teenager blowing a black guy, which is what everything connects to, but Trump has a president hole, get it?"
"Nothing short of the presidency is gonna fill that hole, and he's gonna get it like he got that ten billion, 'cause when he got the ten billion, it didn't fill his hole."
"He went, oh, my God, there's still more hole and my-- my many Russian war brides aren't filling it, and you know, saying hi to my doorman is not filling it and my stupid show, I get to tell Penn Gillette what to do, that didn't fill it."
"I need to be the leader of the free world and everyone has to love me, like he knows what his hole is and he's going for it, you see?"
"What are you talking about, Lloyd?"
Who the hell in this world goes to an orgy?
"Well, I did, as it happens, in the early 80s."

"And some bright spark, who shall remain nameless, who works in the music business... thought it would be really wild and retro to try and get us all back together again."

"'Cause you know, I'm feeling a bit creaky myself today."
Did I have a weird night.
"This Irene woman from next door turns up in my bedroom, can you believe?"
To tell me she's just got back with her husband.
"I mean, what's that all about?"
"You know, 'cause remember after that dinner party last week, she was all over me and...."
"I mean, I admit for my part,"
"I was not above shamelessly mauling her body, but...."
"And what made it worse, when she came in"
I had just been having this really erotic dream about my dentist.
-As you do.
"-Who I hasten to add is a woman, but..."
"I don't know what it was, you know?"
The fact that I'm lying there stretched out beneath her... completely at her mercy as she's leaning over me.
Her breasts softly brushing against my shoulders.
And I don't remember...
"You were there with your mother, but I don't remember..."
I don't think we spoke.
"Well, my mother..."
this is what happened.
"Before the funeral, my mother was called by a friend of your mother's and told to not show up, because your mother had requested to not... she didn't want to see my mother at the funeral."
I wonder if that's true.
That's what we were told too.
"Oh, yes, she was called up and asked that that would... that she was carrying out the wishes of your mother, and..."
"Oh, but you came anyway."
But I... my mother was absolutely furious and hung up the phone.
"So I said, ""Well, Mom,"
"""what's the point of being furious?"
"We're going anyway."""
"The casket was there, and I remember being... some arms went in front of us, and we were pushed into the side room."
You were very...
"I remember you being on the side, because I had to search for you."
"And I went deliberately to Harriet to say something, 'cause I-I had never met you, and I knew, whoever you are, you must be suffering in some way."
And she just...
"I said, ""Hello, Harriet."""
And she just stared straight ahead.
And she didn't have anything to do with me.
"And I felt really bad about that, because I went up with the best of intentions to say, ""Look, I'm not my mother,"" or..."
"- You're not, you know?"
"- You're not, yeah."
I had nothing to do with that.
"And, you know, on the other hand,"
I hadn't really made contact with her since you were born.
"And I felt badly about that, but I knew I couldn't have handled it."
But...
"I guess what I've always wondered is, are we a family?"
What are your expectations of what a family is?
"Do you know what, Steve?"
This is all a bit too late.
"You should have told me the truth, given me the chance to work with you on this."
That's what partners do.
"For the tape, image 313 is a photograph of item reference NTW-7."
Said item is a rope found hanging from an overhead support.
Detective Inspector Cottan has given us a statement where you attempted to overpower him with the intent of causing death by hanging.
The exact same means as PC Rod Kennedy.
I didn't murder Rod and I absolutely didn't attempt to murder DI Cottan.
"In fact, DI Cottan set me up."
He set you up?
!
"Yeah, Cottan smashed himself in the face to make it look like I hit him but I didn't."
"As far as the rope goes, he must have planted it there beforehand."
- He'll say anything to save his own skin.
- Yeah.
"And why would an officer of mine do such a thing, eh?"
To frame me for Rod's murder.
Do you have anything to support these claims against DI Cottan?
"I mean, anything at all?"
"For the tape, the interviewee is offering no supporting evidence."
Moving on.
DS Arnott.
"For the tape, image 291, item reference MR-3 and image 292, item reference MR-4."
MR-3 and 4 are mobile phones.
A Section 18 search of your property recovered a pair of unregistered pay-as-you-go phones concealed in the garage.
"Document 16, analysis of activity on these phones reveals they made and received calls within the telecommunications cell that covers your home address."
"Three nights before the murder of Danny Waldron, a call was received by one of these phones."
Who called you?
No comment.
Document 16 again.
The night before Danny Waldron's murder.
Raina's not great at being on time.
"Well, actually, Raina's not gonna be joining us today."
"We've been doing some digging, Ms. Lundquist."
It turns out your work at the Animal Salvation Fund is completely pro Bono.
Your day job is contract law at Mather and Kline.
"According to this, your current assignment is to secure port locations along the Northwest Passage for a company called Newhall Transocean."
"Now, if you manage to succeed, you're in line to make partner."
GREGSON:
A partner at a white-shoe firm like Mather and Kline makes millions of dollars a year.
WATSON:
"But securing the ports hasn't been easy, has it?"
"The locals are poor, and they're attached to their traditions."
So you volunteered your legal services to an animal rights group here in New York and managed to convince them to pursue a ban on seal hunting.
GREGSON:
Ban like that would've wrecked the locals' traditional way of life.
They would've been forced to either relocate or seek new income.
You were hoping that they'd fold and agree to Newhall's port deal.
WATSON:
But Tendu Otolik's Sealfies turned public opinion against the ban.
"So, when you switched to Plan B and tried to buy the village outright, he stopped that, too."
He sent money home in exchange for a promise from the village elders to never agree to Newhall's port.
No way were you gonna make partner after that.
Not unless you could make Tendu go away.
"Which brings us to your fixer, Kurt Godwyn."
"No, no, you see..."
Save it.
We've already got a full confession from Mr. Godwyn.
You might want to call your firm.
You're gonna need a good lawyer.
Hey.
Hey.
I wanted you to know that boy Lucien won't be bothering you no more.
-Mmm.
Hm?
"Gotta be a good book that, Ali."
You can't seem to put it down.
"Yes, it is."
"Erm...no, I was just thinking about this party I'm supposed to be going to tomorrow."
"What I'm going to wear, what everyone else will be wearing, whether I'll end up looking like a transvestite again."
-Don't know.
Did you tell us about this?
-Didn't I?
"Yeah, my dopey cousin Janice in Hove, who can barely string a sentence together at the best of times, rang me up the other day."
"I'm sure you met her once, she came in the store with her husband."
"They're one of these couples, whatever they've got on, they always clash."
He'll be in this shirt or something that's lime green and she'll be in turquoise.
The whole principle of tonal harmony is lost on them.
"And she said I've got to come to Brian's birthday bash 'cause this year it's the ""big four""."
She's not having any excuses.
"Actually, I wonder if I'm getting tonsillitis."
"Ali, will you get your arse out of the comfort zone for once and just make the effort?"
"You see, this is why you never meet anyone."
"And, I mean, it's not as if you're not good-looking."
"Yeah, you've got loads of great qualities that would be really attractive to a man."
You know....
"Well, you seem to have backed yourselves into a corner on that one, don't you?"
-Thank you very much.
"-No, it's just...."
I don't know.
"It wouldn't hurt you to be a bit more flexible sometimes, that's all."
"I mean, it's like this bloke Milly's seeing at the moment."
"Right, the one who works at the airfield."
You said you thought was getting really serious.
"Well, that all went a bit pear-shaped in the end as it happened."
"But, you know, he was a real nomad."
"And, you know, when I was in the office, he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely."
And he would pack up and go.
And there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.
"I mean, you know, as tragic as his death was in a railway station, it was so consistent with his life."
"You know, I mean, I often think I'm going to die in a plane or I'm going to die in an airport or, you know, die jogging without an identification on me."
"I don't know why I sort of carry that from that memory of his, the way he died."
But he was sort of a nomad at heart.
I remember now that Lou had a little carpet in the office that he'd roll out in the floor and sleep on when he was too tired to keep working.
Maybe he never felt settled anywhere.
He was a wanderer from the beginning.
His family moved 17 times in their first two years in America.
And it turns out Kahn wasn't even his real name.
It was Shmalowsky.
His father changed it in 1915.
"The only constant in Lou's life, was his wife Esther."
They were together from when he was 28 until he died.
"I don't know if he thought of her house as home, but it was certainly his base."
"I used to say to Lou,"
"""You know, Lou, if you would put some of your energy into making money, you'd be a billionaire."""
Money was something that was there.
"He would... he kept saying... and unfortunately, my daughter, who's also an artist, says the same thing."
"""But, Mother, it's only money."""
And he owned nothing.
He owned nothing.
He didn't believe in owning anything.
Books and neckties.
"Other than that, nothing."
He would not own...
I only saw Esther once.
It was at Lou's funeral.
She looked right through me.
A 12!
"Well, I would like the opportunity to get to know him better, but at the moment he's an 8½."
Hi.
The arrival of an attractive gentleman is a sharp reminder the main objective of a house party...
bagging a husband.
How are you?
That was some welcome you got.
Kind of romance issue is not being addressed.
We don't really have that much opportunity
"Firstly, I think we... kind of girls came in here and said,"
"""You know, if it doesn't happen naturally,"
"And the chaperones are saying, ""How on earth can we control,"
"""you know, kind of strong, independent, successful women?"
"They're not going do as we tell them to do."""
Then we'll have a jolly good time.
"We are going to have a very good time, actually."
We're having a good time;
we'll have an even better time now.
The chaperones should really be encouraged to do a lot more chaperoning and a lot more orchestrating meetings with their charges and... and the gentlemen.
Do you...
"Can I just ask, do you mean... do you mean orchestrating chaperoned time or orchestrating unchaperoned time?"
"Well, I think..."
I think what should happen is that we can go out with the chaperone...
"with the man... and the chaperone could, um... yeah, exactly, like, ""sprain the ankle."""
It's from the ladies.
"Oh, yes?"
"""The dandy will be entertaining the chaperones from 3:00 p.m.,"
"""therefore leaving the ladies unsupervised."
"""Fancy meeting up for a few cheeky lemonades?"
"""Please reply ASAP to Miss Hopkins"
"""should you choose to accept our invitation."
"Fondest regards, the girls."""
"Now, you and Michael have only just begun."
To fight.
You and Michael have only just begun your marriage.
"You know, you may be my daughter, but sarcasm does not become you."
Don't throw away a wonderful relationship before you've given it a chance.
"Such good advice, Mommy."
But who are you of all people to give it to me?
"You, who wouldn't even claim me as your daughter, all those years I was growing up and really needed you."
Where were you then?
"Do you know I'm sick and tired of your pathetic little Oliver Twist routine, your poor-little-me act?"
How dare you give me that I wasn't there as a mother when I was every step of the way and I reared you fit for a prince?
"Dancing lessons, singing lessons, tennis lessons, French lessons."
I paid for them all.
"And I couldn't afford it because I wasn't Mrs. Colby or Mrs. Dexter then, but I was the exiled Mrs. Blake Carrington."
"Well, that was my kind of mother love."
"So stop feeling sorry for yourself, Amanda."
"Get your act together, or you may find that your prince has flown to greener pastures."
Do you have to go?
I'd better.
"Now, remember, you're sick, under the weather."
"Blake Carrington isn't going to force you to lie with him, biblically speaking, while you're not feeling well."
Which takes care of a couple of days.
Except that Blake Carrington is a very loving husband.
"Oh, I know, a true paragon of caring, I'm sure."
"Well, he is, Joel, I mean, he'll be worried if I was sick for long."
Don't you worry.
I've got everything under control.
Here.
These are barbiturates.
"Now, if he starts to get amorous, slip him one of these beauties."
"He'll be so drugged, he won't be interested in anything except sleeping next to his wife."
"Good, because I don't wanna blow this."

The book I ordered has arrived
Can you bring it to my place?
"""Salmonella was rife in the town of Frankenhausen"""
When Dr. Gartner discovered the baccilus name after him in 1888
The mode of infection is yet to be discovered
But a detectable relationship has been established with the spirochette of the encephalitic bacterium which reaches epidemic proportions
"Nowadays, what we call encephalitis was identified by a Dr. Ekonomo in Vienna in 1919"
Whether the two are the same or not is still a matter of speculation
Looking beyond these questions at Dr. Ekonomo's diagnosis of lethargic encephalitis...
Like our friend here there's no evidence it attacks during winter
So he doesn't have it
Ready?
Going back to the original question...
I felt uncomfortable with all his piety.
"A boy at that age should be looking for mischief, not telling his rosary."
What you're saying was
"James didn't want to know about the church, yet you couldn't get Alec out of the place."
Surely you've got that the wrong way round?
"I was booked in for senility, but it hasn't come through yet, Inspector."
But I do need more prompting things are starting to get a little vague.
"So how did they get on together, James and Alec?"
There were problems.
I think the Barrs were having financial difficulties.
It all hit Alec very hard.
"And his behavior was difficult, very difficult."
What happened Father?
He became very jealous of his brother.
"It started with toys being broken, books torn up."
And I believe James's pet was killed.
"Then he set light some clothes, and gutted James' bedroom."
It was all very hard for the family.
How long did this go on for?
Well Alec spent some time at a special school.
"He came back a spotty adolescent, but still with too much piety and not enough faith, and healthily more interested in girls than what his brother was up to."
"Go on, was there still something wrong."
He made a point of taking James's girlfriends off him.
But he grew out of it eventually.
"He'd still sneak into confession if he felt he'd done something bad, thinking I wouldn't know who it was."
And always insisting that I conduct the proceedings in Latin.
"Thanks for coming, Charlie."
"Yes, well, that doesn't mean there's anything to say."
Are you off to see Ms. Bailey?
That's right.
"And I'm not going to say much to her either, practically nothing in fact."
"No, you've just got to keep your mouth shut that's all."
Nicely.
Sorry.
Couldn't you try to be nice?
"What, like that?"
Yeah.
This is science;
it's not meant to be a head massage.
"Thanks to Mr. Foxsmith's unfailing efforts to use science to inspire passion,"
Miss Hopkins gets to make a move on Mr. Carrington.
"You have clean hair, which is great."
"Honestly, you don't have very many lumps on your head."
Did you not have any bumps when you were a child?
"I'm kind of perfect, you know?"
"And I just sat there; no one came up to touch my head, so after about a couple of minutes I thought,"
"""I'm not going sit here and wait for someone or go and ask somebody if they wanted to feel my head."""
"I'd rather just, um, come and breathe some night air and, uh, hopefully that'll..."
"that nonsense and, you know... we'll do something else for the evening."
"Mr. Everett would be the more sincere, truer, genuine kind of guy, and I think Mr. Carrington will break my heart."
The countess has invited anatomist Gunther von Hagens
"The Regency was, after all, the age that invented the autopsy."
"""Liebe Comtesse, I am very pleased"
"""that you have taken the time to send me correspondence"
"""from your Kentchurch house party."
"the detail and functioning of our bodies."""
"""My work with plastinates is as unique as the first steps taken by earlier anatomists."""
"""I look forward to meeting you."
"Professor Gunther von Hagens."""
"Ladies, I've taken the liberty of inviting a special guest who's an anatomist... called Professor von Hagens, to Kentchurch."
He's going to come here?
The one that strips the muscles and...
I presume that his demonstration will take place after dinner.
He's so controversial.
What kind of a fire is this?
"I'm melting, mmm... melting"
The rains are stranger
The rains cannot douse the raging fire
"My heartbeats are straying, time has come under an intoxicating spell"
"Why is every pore of my body assailed by smoke, these clouds of smoke?"
What are you looking at?
"I can see colours, a glow"
That glow  the colour is a face...
an identity.
My gaze has made an identity that identity is a wondrous face which you have worn
"Aren't you getting cheated, are you?"
What you see dosen't exist.
"What you don't see, does exists"

I'm not

"I think the girls are getting a little tired, and possibly wondering why it is we're practicing on a Friday night, when rush isn't until next year."
"We do these drills because practice makes perfect, if we wanna get this house back in shape, we need all the perfect we can get."
- Where are you going?

"ZBZs work hard, and we play hard."
Define play.
"Back at Polytech, we started a book club."

This is the vault where thousands upon thousands of MGM films are stored.
"Their worth in dollars, film history, entertainment is immeasurable."
"There are a few of these, of course, in which I appeared."
"This one, Rose Marie was the first wide-screen, CinemaScope musical."
"Now, in the 1950s, Hollywood went into a panic that rivaled the advent of talking pictures."
A monster had taken over the movie-going public:
Television.
"So the movies went into new technologies such as CinemaScope, stereophonic sound to try to recapture their audience."

They simply haven't grown up being used to using a toilet.
We've seen a study in the northern city of uttar pradesh.
"A large number of toilets are built,"
And 67% of the toilets have never been used.
And people are continuing to live near those toilets
And go out into the fields.
It's habit to some degree.
"For generations, I guess, they found it comfortable"
And pleasant to be communing with nature.
"So you have open defecation that puts toxins into the ground water,"
"Which in turn affects the water kids drink,"

The turbulent political situation in Zaire makes it extremely difficult to get permission to enter the country.
"Claytor decides to go in any way, without an official clearance."
He'll touch down at a small airstrip where he can refuel form his own supply.
"If he's lucky, no one will ask him for his papers."
"In Africa there's a rule an unwritten rule, and that is that it's easier to get pardoned than to get permission."
"Because of communications and how difficult it is to get clearance and things, its sometimes easier just tot do them and afterwards, of course, you get in trouble."

An interesting day on the World Wide Web.
A second helping of the AUTEC file has been leaked.
Page is a table of contents listing all the ports analyzed in the file.
They're toying with us.
"First leak was Baylor, second one has got to be her, too."
So let's grab her.
Working on it.
"Work harder, Gibbs, I'm about to go down as the ass who took a fake shot in the chest for nothing."
"I think ""nothing"" would be stretching it, sir."
Where'd you get this?
Borrowed it from Wickes.
He took a good look at it right after Gibbs updated him about your condition.
"Well, that makes sense-- picture of the two of them together."
He also looked at it directly after he heard that Ridgeway was shot with a rare hunting rifle.
Can you think of any possible connection between that photo and a weapon of that type?
Picture was taken at his family's cabin.
We were on a hunting trip.
Are you gonna try to tell me that Wickes was implicating himself?
"Wickes didn't pull the trigger, but the rifle could have been his and so could the hire."
The plan was to monitor Phillip's communication after the mention of AUTEC.
"You did that, you came up with nothing."
"Sir, there is a good possibility that Wickes looking at this picture was a tell."
"I suggest that you press him further, search his house..."
No.
"And as with most such stories, no one else believed him."
"Except in this case for two nuns, who in 1923 met the man and believed so much in him and his dream that they invested money no one knew they had."
"Now, when the nuns told their parish priest about the man's dream and their investment in it, now, he counseled them to try and get their money back."
"Sheepishly, they admitted that it was too late, that the money was already spent."
"Well, the priest, he sighed, shook his head, and offered just one small bit of advice -- bless the site with rose petals, and invoke the help of Saint Rita, patron saint of impossible dreams."
"And while the workers waited for the oil that would eventually come, they played baseball."
He's outta here.
Played baseball so well that some were able to give up the dirt and the despair and went on to play major-league ball in the glory days of Ruth and Gehrig.
Come on!
"I've heard and told that story on many occasions, but that was long before"
Saint Rita decided to bless our little town just one more time.
-
- Yeah!
"First game in the big leagues, and Jimmy Morris has a no-hitter going."
"Agh, Jimmy, don't throw it so hard."
My hands are cold.
Agh!
What are you doing?
"Waiting till Spring, that's what I'm doing."
Jimmy...
Your father and I need to talk to you.
I hear Virginia's real nice -- at least that's what the Navy folks told your father.
"Isn't that right, Jim?"
We'll just be moving again.
It's my job to decide when we move.
It's yourjob to make the best of it.
"Jim, please."
Who knows?
Maybe it won't snow so much in Virginia.
"""Jimmy Morris,"
"""with another masterful pitching performance,"
"""well on his way to another World Series title."""
"Burn me a copy, put it in my office."
- Julianna's completely out of hand.
- She is.
"- Very talented, however."
- Very clever.
Did you make me a copy of the contents of that briefcase?
- Did you get a chance to look at it?
- Very interesting.
"We now have a list of all the Canadian companies involved with the Blackmire Group and the donation expected to funnel to the various lobbyists and politicians, or whoever it is they're pissing off."
- Names and amounts?
"- There you go, on top, there."
It's like a shopping list.
Julianna's expecting to get her passport today.
She's supposed to travel with Browne to the Blackmire summit in Mexico.
I don't think it's safe to let her go.
She might find the life of a billionaire's mistress hard to resist.
Been a few songs written about that.
- I think I've got to reel her back in.
- I agree.
Have Immigration pick her up on something...
- completely unrelated to us.
- As you wish.
Tell them to hold her until she misses her flight.
"When she calls us to help her out, we help her out."
How could we not?
"- Grateful, but too late to travel."
- Too late to travel.
You asked me to find out about the recent arrival of some Americans on the dope scene.
I spoke to the Vancouver Drug Squad and they said they've been noticing a steady influx of Americans arriving over the last five to six months and it seems to be growing.
"It started out as street trade, dime bags."
"But they've moved steadily into wholesaling and they probably already account for 5 to 10% of the Vancouver market, which is a... pretty quite entry into the scene."
"So, who are they?"
Excellent
- Consider it ours
- God bless
May God keep the vultures away
"By the way, I forgot to tell you"
Selim Za'atar the customs agent has a new big office and he insists that you attend the opening
"He deserves it, I'll go"
Fifi got me a new job at a clothing store
Where's this job?
- For a man called Talal Elshamy
"- What's wrong with you, Buthaina?"
You couldn't find anyone other than Talal Elshamy to work for?
- What's wrong with Talal?
- He has a very bad reputation
What do you know about him?
Did you work for him?
"Listen, I know the whole area very well and I know the people, I was born and raised here"
"Anyway, he didn't do anything bad to me"
- He will
"- When he does, I'll deal with it but it's 250 pounds a month, and for us to live... we need 4 times that amount, my mother works as a maid for 300 a month and is exhausted, my father died while indebted"
"Some of the creditors waivered their rights, but others didn't and we have to pay off his debt or he won't go to heaven you're telling me Talal has a bad reputation, well, who doesn't?"
or do you just like to talk?
And listen here... you can have your silver engagement ring back
I won't let you police my life starting now
"Hey, Pasha..."
Zaki Pasha...
Pasha...
Are you tired?
Are you ill?
- Shall I call a doctor?
- No
What time is it?
"Get up, get up and tell me what happened"
"Come in, your father left me a burden more than I can handle"
Why'd you quit your job?
- The store owner grabs everything
- No one steals his money
"- No, he laid his hands on me"
- He hit you?
- No
- Well then...
- how did he lay his hand on you?
- He caressed
"You know what caress means, or don't you?"
I'm going to look for a new job tomorrow morning
A friend of mine will take me to clothes store owned by a Syrian... she says he's married to a beautiful woman and is satisfied
What?
I told you that Fifi the daughter of Salama the ironer...
- will take me to a good job
- What's the use... if you can't stay in one job for long?
- Should I lose my virginity?
- No body said that but you should think of your brothers and our tight situation
A smart girl knows how to protect her virginity... without upsetting anyone or quitting her job
I said that the guy I work for unzipped his pants
Everyone is free with his clothes as long as you keep yours on
God is the greatest
I testify that there is no God but Allah
I beg forgiveness of God the greatest
I testify that there is no God but Allah
I intend to purge myself of all sins

"Good morning, Dawlat"
What are you getting all dressed up for?
"How strange you are, sister, I've always been like this"
"This is a factory, not a circus"
"Now, come on, ladies, settle down"
I am the mayor of this town
I run a business of repute
(PANTING SOFTLY)
"Deal with this, Foreman."
Be as patient as you can.
"Yes, Monsieur Madeleine."
"Now, someone say how this began."
(SINGING) At the end of the day she's the one who began it!
There's a kid that she's hiding in some little town
There's a man she has to pay
You can guess how she picks up the extra
You can bet she's earning her keep sleeping around!
And the boss wouldn't like it
"Yes, it's true there's a child And the child is my daughter"
"And her father abandoned us, leaving us flat"
Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife
And I pay for the child What's the matter with that?
WOMEN:
At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble
And there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one
While we're earning our daily bread
She's the one with her hands in the butter
You must send the slut away or we're all going to end in the gutter
And it's us who'll have to pay At the end of the day!
I might have known the bitch could bite
I might have known the cat had claws
I might have guessed your little secret
"Ah, yes, the virtuous Fantine who keeps herself so pure and clean"
"You'd be the cause, I had no doubt of any trouble hereabout"
You play a virgin in the light
"Oh, no, run, I mean."
What are we supposed to do here?
"Oh, no!"
"Everett, you have to pick that up."
"Come on, Everett."
Keep up.
"Oh, he's missed the footman."
Nice action with the steering.
Oh!
Brilliant.
"No, they're going through it anyway."
Excellent race.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner."
"Mr. Everett and I wouldn't kind of go anywhere, and one of the reasons why I am so sure about that is because I've had the chance to meet Mr. Carrington."
"Being a 21st-century girl, I'm also frightened of being hurt"
So all I can do is be myself and try and spend time with him.
"Um, maybe, kind of using the purpose of the game, try to get my chaperone to engineer some time so we can genuinely spend time to getting to know each other, because at the end of the day"
we haven't spent that much time together.
On your marks... get ready...
Hypnotherapist Tom Fortes-Mayer arrives at the Regency House.
"Mesmerists, as they were then called, were doctors of the heart and mind."
Many were fashionable quacks;
others were motivated by genuine scientific inquiry.
Now you may soon find your mind begins to wander.
My words as a melody may move through your system.
"Leaving romance aside,"
"Mr. Carrington returns to his first love, music."
He's reliving an historic hypnotic experiment.
"And I want you imagine that whilst you play, actually you can see the energy, that magnetism, that movement moving from your soul through that instrument."
Mozart wrote the opera Così fan tutte while being hypnotized by the famous Anton Mesmer.
Mr. Fortes-Mayer will have equal success with him.
"and create some power, some change you could make"
"I was married to her seven or eight years ago, but she got a divorce."
[Mason] I see.
"Your Honor, I would like to request an adjournment until tomorrow morning."
"Why, Mr. Mason?"
"Well, it is approaching the hour of adjournment, and my examination of this witness may be rather lengthy."
I see.
Mr. Burger?
"Well, Your Honor,"
"If counselor really wants time to prepare for this hearing a little more fully,"
I think the prosecution might exercise tolerance.
"I think that's uncalled for, Mr. Burger."
Court stands adjourned till 10:00 tomorrow morning.
That certainly was a nasty crack Burger made when you asked for an adjournment.
Nasty but accurate.
"If Burger had a client as confused and frightened as Merle Telford, he'd be stalling every other minute."
She certainly hasn't been much help.
"After all the hours you've spent talking to her, for her to suddenly think of this Gina Gilbert."
"Apparently, Gina became acquainted with Merle while taking pictures of her house for a magazine."
Then she introduced her to Danny and subtly arranged for them to meet a number of times.
Sounds like a well worked out campaign.
"Yes, but not a campaign for Danny to marry Merle."
His wife had never filed for a divorce.
"Well, whatever it was between Danny and the Gilbert woman, it wasn't romance."
"I don't know who yet, but she's seeing somebody."
So perhaps Danny was a business arrangement.
It'll be hard to prove.
"And if Gina was anywhere near the party that night,"
"I didn't see her, and I can't find anybody who did."
"At a big party, that doesn't rule it out, Paul."
That's true.
"Look, if Mrs. Langley was unconscious during the theft, there'd be no reason for Danny to kill her-- that is, if Danny was the thief."
No.
Is it soup?
How about the cooking?

Even if he calls me an oilcake I don't mind
Is there a dad who doesn't admonish the children?
Even if he calls me a clod I don't mind
"After all my dad called me so, so what?"
"Even if dad's club criticizes, never mind"
You can react like U.N.
Kinship is always testing
Your dad would have been kicked by his dad
"If it is said to me, looking at my eyes"
If it is not my dad I will thrash him
Even if he calls me an oilcake I don't mind
Is there a dad who doesn't admonish the children?
Even if he calls me a clod I don't mind
"After all my dad called me so, so what?"
July-August wind will make even the grinding stone fly
If your dad becomes nutty his eyes will feel darkness
It's all the obvious stuff.
Blood was important in Philadelphia.
And I think Lou's blood had a yellow armband.
- Jewish?
- Yes.
I really think so.
"I think that was important, even though they might not even have known it was, maybe consciously, I felt it."
I felt it.
I felt it.
Frustration and failure are really the things that make you.
"Maybe he was made by being short and ugly and Jewish and having a bad voice and not wanting to be good with people, or whatever."
"Maybe he was made by that, because it made him go internal."
"So you can't just say,"
"""Oh, isn't it a shame he didn't build more buildings?"""
"""Isn't it a shame he wasn't this or that person?"""
We're made by those things.
"I think he had trouble, because he was a mystic, and he wouldn't be able to talk the lingo of the business world."
"You know, architecture is so passionless in the modern movement."
There was no sense of...
"I mean, it was all mechanical."
"And that's why the postmodern thing happened, because people couldn't handle it."
It was just so cold and formless.
"And Lou was kind of the breath of fresh air in that, I mean, in America."
And my first works came out of my reverence for him.
Good night.
"When Lou's ideas about architecture finally caught on, he had ten years left to live."
Maybe he knew time was running out.
"He never said no to a lecture invitation or a possible job, no matter how tired he was or how far he had to go."
"If they wanted him, he was there."
"One night when Lou came to visit, he made a little book with me:"
The Book of Crazy Boats.
"There was a boat made out of a spoon and one made out of a biscuit, and there was a sausage boat with toothpicks stuck in it to keep it upright in the water."
-Right.
Is there any prohibition against if you're just digging it out with a hand shovel?
"I mean, we just don't want"
"-to get afoul with the rules, you know."
-Right.
-I couldn't do it without a permit.
-Right.
"I think this is a disclosure deal, then."
We just tell whoever in the government.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
"We'regonnago ahead and disclose it to the authorities, so we have some permitting issues to work our way through before we dig over there."
"RickandMarty'sdecision toinvolve the Canadian government willcostthemtime, butwillbe beneficialto the process in the long run."

"All right, I think we've done what we need to do here."

-Right.
-Thank you very much.
"-All right, no problem at all."
Wegot the three engineers here.
"So, there are some logistical issues, I think, with... you know, boring down into the Money Pit."
"-You know, we have the targets, right?"
-Yeah.
"IntheWarRoom, Marty Lagina, his partner"
CraigTesterandMarty'sson Alex have gathered todiscussthenextphase in their exploration of theOakIslandMoneyPit.
"So, once we get close to the target zones, I mean, they're gonna be bringing up a lot of material that we're gonna have to get a... at least a real quick look at... right away."
"Yeah, I could calculate that."
Have you calculated
-how many yards per foot?
-I have not.
For all small farmers.
"The traditional farmers have very, very little possibilities"
Of using any of these soybeans.
This model is actually producing
Large-scale inequality.
What are you doing to support small farmers?
"The benefit to the small farmer, in every case I've ever seen,"
"Has been disproportionately greater than to the large farmer,"
Because they don't have as many alternatives to begin with.
So you're saying that your products are helping small farmers
As much as they're helping big agriculture?
"Actually, more."
"And if you give a small farmer a better seed, they'll grow a better crop."
Yeung:
But the seed's high cost
Makes it impossible for the small farmers
To turn a profit on the amount of land they own.
"In fact, taking paraguay as a case study, 80% of the farmable land is now owned"
By less than 2% of the farmers.
"And additionally, those who grow non-gmo crops"
Are now boxed in by more and more spraying.
This lady says a lot of these crops are damaged
"When they fumigate the fields right next to her,"
And the corn doesn't develop as it used to.
(speaking foreign language)
(speaking foreign language)
Yeung:
With fewer small farmers
"Growing crops that people eat directly,"
Paraguay has had to increase its food imports
By nearly 300% in just 10 years.
It used to be the case that most of this food that we're seeing sold here
That's all he said.

"Ms. Zumwalt, do your or anybody in the family own an hourglass?"
Police found this in your living room.
I've never seen that before in my life.
"What you got, baby girl?"
"What I've got is fail, fail, and more fail."
"Remember Thomas Alva Edison, Penelope."
"""I have not failed."
"I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."""
"Ok, let me rephrase what I just said."
I'm currently waist-deep in what is not working.
"Despite the distinctive craftsmanship,"
"I cannot figure out who made these hourglasses, and I haven't been able to find a single person who recently relocated from upstate New York to Wichita."
Something must connect our unsub to the Seneca River.
"All the sand in the world right here and this guy brings dirt from 1,500 miles away."
"Garcia, you confirmed that the hourglasses were handcrafted?"
"Oh, for sure."
"We're talking topnotch museum quality, but not by any artisan known in the high-end glass-blowing community, and yes, there is such a thing as the high-end glass-blowing community."
"All right, look for boys ages 8 to 12 who were sexually victimized and/or abducted in upstate New York in the mid-1990s, all right?"
Ok.
Hit you back if and when.
They're analyzing the sand from both hourglasses now to see if it matches what was put in the victims' eyes.
So far no prints or DNA.
The unsub's careful.
And precise.
I calculated the width of hourglass necks with the average grain of sand having a .2-millimeter
diameter and a volume of .0042
cubic millimeters.
"Given the weight of the sand, that's a gravity flow duration of 3,600 seconds."
"You know, obviously give or take a few."
"Skill level off the charts, yet his work is unknown."
- Yes.
Now I see.
I am The Gray Champion.
I've purified my home.
"- Bravo, Miss Porter."
- You... you look like...
"- Isabel, it's a curious thing, appearances, isn't it?"
People don't look closely at anybody ma'am.
- Gunther.
Why?
- I'm afraid that I have failed to properly introduce myself.
I'm one of the four heads of the Aconite Society.
"The inner circle, as those unimaginatively like to call us - those in gowns and tuxedoes who imagine that they wield power, but they are nothing more than mere pawns, no different than you or any of the other girls"

"Oh, if you could only know how long the wheels have been in motion to bring you to Rosewood."
I cannot tell you... the last time my compatriots and I have been genuinely surprised by... anything.
But you?
You have been a pleasant surprise to all of us.
"Because of you, the institute will emerge stronger than ever before."
"And I would hate to see the doctor's good work go to waste, so we'll find another role for you soon enough, and you'll wake from this dream into another."
But until that time the institute thanks you.
"Excuse me, Madam Porter?"
- Yes.
- They're ready for you.
- Thank you.
"Yoursister'sresponse isa typical consequenceofloss, numbnessthatfollows aperiodof intensegrief."

Rest is what she needs.
"At rosewood, she will have the benefit of time and privacy to recuperate."
"I don't see why if rest and recuperation is what you prescribe, we couldn't simply repair to the coast as usual?"
"Or if warmer weather is what she needs, we could go to Italy."
"The King was taken to a castle, to die, some thought."
"And then, magically, as spring came, the King recovered."
He returned to the slaughter.
"He came here, to Barra Hill, near Aberdeen."
"The Earl of Buchan had dug himself in at the summit, amidst the remnants of an Iron Age hill fort."
"It was, he thought, an impregnable location."
He was wrong.
By now the Bruce's reputation rode ahead of him.
The Earl of Buchan lost his cavalry to simple terror.
Then he lost the battle too.
"John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, last of the Comyn nobility, fled to England."
He was dead within the year.
There were still supporters of the Comyns to exterminate.
King Robert rode north.
He came to Duffus Castle and the Bruce laid waste.
"Then he sent his brother, Edward, eastward into Buchan, the heartland of Comyn power."
The Bruce did not forgive it.
"On his orders, such damage was done that the land was infertile for a generation."
But it was not the land he damaged.
He didn't just burn the crops.
That would have made the land fertile in the coming year.
"He ordered the slaughter of the livestock, and not only the animals, but those who tended them and who grew the crops - men, women and children."
Parts of Buchan were left barren for a generation because there was no-one left alive.
ROBERT THE BRUCE:
Ihave split the blood of innocent men...
NEIL OLIVER:
"ByMarch of 1309, the Bruce had crushed resistance almost everywhere in Scotland."
"In the July of the previous year, the Pope had lifted his ban of excommunication."
"So he was officially back in the fold, one of the saved, at least for the time being."
Now it was time to get on with the business of kingship.
"Here at St Andrews, in a cathedral nearing completion after 1 50 years, he called his first parliament."
"It was a funny sort of parliament, by modern standards."

We're already sending a submarine to Nampo Port.
I'll go over there and talk to the President.
Wait a moment.
"If we respond with force,"
"When the time comes, we must be included within the Han peninsula."
"The South Korea, USA and Japan defense system white paper is very thorough."
The attitude of the U.S is very tough.
The President is also hesitant because of the negative comments of the people towards the anti-communists.
So we must not use military force to oppose them.
"Then, what about the men we sent?"
Are we going to have them killed by our own people while they're on the other side of the border?
Just look at it from this perspective.
"For the country and its people, sacrificing them..."
- That's impossible!
We were all furious when they attacked us.
How can you forget all things so quickly?
We have the responsibility to bring them back here safely.
What are their problems?
"Honestly,"
For Mr. President who has to hear people say he was elected with support...
It's a great burden.
Can you all be honest?

What did you say?
Isn't what you said a little overboard?
Don't tell me you still want to sacrifice the lives of 21 people?
"If this plan was made public,"
We might have to make bigger sacrifices.
The four of us have discussed it already.

Faced with threats of boycotts and censorship MGM conformed to the stern Production Code.

The brief and ugly experiment was over.
The headless king had horrified everyone.
"No-one wanted anything to do with dictators, no-one wanted anything to do with the almost-democracy of the Covenant."
The way ahead was backwards.
The Parliaments of both England and Scotland began undoing things.
They remade the old world.
They remade the Union of the Crowns.
You could hardly see the join.
It was as though nothing had happened.
As though this Charles was that Charles.
His father's ghost was promoted.
He became King Charles the Martyr.
Cromwell's body was exhumed and its head cut off.
There was no Cromwell.
There had been no Civil War.
There was no Covenant.
There would be no Covenanters.
The English Parliament declared the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643 unlawful.
"Surviving copies were collected and burnt by the public hangman, executed as though they were people."
Charles was destroying the evidence of the new world that had killed his father.
Everyone knew there would be changes for the Presbyterian Church.
Perhaps it would be enough for Charles that the Protesters no longer ran it.
It wouldn't.
Charles appointed bishops and archbishops.
"He ordered Scotland's ministers to swear an Oath of Allegiance to him, and also required that every minister seek the nomination of a local member of the gentry."
"262 out of roughly 1,000 ministers failed to make the cut, couldn't or wouldn't take the oath, couldn't or wouldn't find a noble patron."
"So 262 ministers, mostly in the south west, were made redundant."
Alexander Peden was one of them.
"Until 1662, Peden was a minister in the parish of New Luce, in the deep south west."
Charles's Oath of Allegiance stuck in his craw.
"He couldn't say it, let alone swear it."
Thank you so much.
PRES.

Alright.
Good?

"I have realized that as a science community we have not done the best job, frankly, of communicating this threat to the public."
"But when you go up there and see it with your own eye, how thin the world's atmosphere is, tiny little onion skin around the earth."
"That's all the oxygen that we breathe, that's the CO2, everything we burn goes into it."

From busking because you had to four and a half years ago in Manchester to busking for fun with Grace Jones at 4:00 in the morning last night.
What a strange and wonderful journey you've had.
It's a nice couple of bookends that you...
A way of putting it.
Proof that good things do happen to good people.
"We're going to talk to you and find out where you were, where you're at and where you're going in the next half hour."
"So it's been about four and a half years since you've released ""EP1""."
"Can you remember a time before you were ""Badly Drawn Boy"" as such."
It crosses my mind a lot that kind of question because I remember reading something Bob Dylan said in an interview recently that he cannot remember being not famous.
- Not famous.
This is someone who's been famous since the '60s and I was born in the '60s.
I can sort of relate to it even though it's only been four years.
"It's a nice way of putting it, the way Dylan said it."
It made me think.
I sort of feel like that myself.
I didn't know whether I felt right about that.
I've often thought and looked back when I held that first EP in my hand and remembered the feelings that surrounded that time.
- Simple pleasures.
- Yeah.
"Do you allow much time for yourself to reflect, to romanticize those moments before you had the pressures of being an established record selling artist?"
"I can sort of do it, because I'm still close to obviously my family, parents and my brother, who I used to work with before this happened."
"So whenever I see them I'll talk to them, which is quite regularly at least a few times a week."
We should honour the traditional routines
Sit down

Last week my daughter joined your Marcel's class.
I'd like to see him.
"My daughter keeps saying how kind and agreeable he is, that they have made friends and he invited her to the cinema..."
"He showed her Nitra, just as a friend, nothing special..."
That does surprise me!
"She's glad someone is taking care of her, I think it was a friendly gesture, as one classmate to another..."
"That's nice, but a little surprising."
"At that age it's usually girls who make friends, I'm surprised that Marcel... I've never heard..."
"He's very shy, he keeps his distance from girls."
Our Katka isn't at all shy and she talks in a friendly way about him.
"I just wanted to say, we are going abroad for two years, and for that time we are leaving her with her grandparents."
"But yesterday grandma was worried, because their form was having a party, and our Katka came home around eleven."
"Grandma was anxious, so I wanted to know, whether Marcel came at that time, or the whole form so late, whether they had permission, or... lf you're home late from the cinema, do your parents make a fuss?"
"I don't go to the cinema, but when I stayed at that party... mum asked where l'd been, whether I wasn't drunk and..."
"My friend once came home late from the cinema, her parents kicked up a fuss, she wasn't allowed out for two weeks."
She was confined to the house.
They made such scenes.
I've got an aunt like that.
"She acts as if she's terribly moral, but she tells us, I saw that girl with that boy..."
but she wasn't doing anything.
- What's wrong with that?
- l don't know.
"Our parents want us to stay children, and they just don't realise, we're already fifteen."

He doesn't like dancing... I asked him what he did and he said he danced.

"In the beginning humans, lived in small groups ... that collected food by hunting and gathering..."
Taking only what they needed to survive.
"No, he was very angry."
Was he?
Yeah.
"I'd gone to see him live and obviously, he's this big rap pioneer, he practically invented early hip-hop with a few other people, so I was really excited."
"I was in the front row but I get very self-conscious at gigs, cos I never really know what to, sort of, do."
That'll do.
Yeah.
"""Hey, I blooming love hip-hop!"""
"But I was front row, centre, I couldn't wait and he came on, and the crowd went absolutely mental and people were going mad and I was,"
"""This is going to be really brilliant."""
"And he took the mic, he went, ""I'm a firm believer you got to know"
"""where you came from, know where you're going."
I'm going to play some
"""Parliament, some P-Funk,"
"""some George Clinton, some Bootsy Collins."""
"Everyone's like, ""Yay!"""
"and I was like, ""That sounds absolutely great!"""
"And then he started playing all these tunes, it was great and everyone was dancing and I was there with my Guinness or real ale or whatever it was, having a really great time and then he kept looking"
"into the crowd and looking angry and eventually he picked up the mic and it was sort of, it was electric, cos people are like, ""We're not"
"""expecting him to rap, he's going to freestyle."
"""He's freestyling for the people of Wales, this is amazing,"
"""no-one expected this."""
"So, everyone was really up for it."
"He took the mic and went, ""There's this white guy down the front, man,"
"""and this motherfucker ain't dancing for nobody, what is wrong with you?"
"""Your ass is stuck to the floor, your boots are made of lead!"
"""There must be glue on that dance floor!"
"Dance, motherfucker!"""
And I remember thinking...
"I remember thinking, ""He's giving this guy short shrift, isn't he?"
"""What an idiot."""
"And he was like, ""I'm talking to you, motherfucker,"
I have nothing to do with it.
We'll have to look into it more deeply.

The Democratic National Committee is located in the Watergate office building.
"I welcome this kind of examination, because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook."
"Well, I'm not a crook."
I've earned everything I've got.
I was the youngest person to go to the Watergate grand jury.
"During the Senate Watergate Committee hearings, this enormous chart was put up, in which everyone who received money from this secret fund was put on the wall."
"And it said, ""Gordon Liddy, McCord, Segretti."""
"And then way down at the bottom, it said ""Stone."""
I paid $100 to Mr. Roger Stone on one occasion.
My parents called me on the phone.
They were mortified.
I thought it was pretty cool.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
"But as president, I must put the interests of America first."
"Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow."
I was a Watergate figure at 19 years old.
"I mean, at the time, I was scared shitless."
It was very hard to find work.
"We used to have these buttons that said ""hire a Watergate vet."""
So this is the Batcave.
"This is ""the Factory,"" as we call it."
This is where I tape my Saturday radio shows.
It is also the repository of probably the world's largest collection of Nixon memorabilia.
The 1962 campaign for governor.
"Uh, a rally that I actually attended."
A head shot poster of the day.
This is protesting Nixon's historic trip to China.
Here you have the first and second generation Nixon bongs.
This is among my most prized possessions.
Roger Stone does occasional political chores for Nixon.
"One such chore, to organize dinners of journalists at Nixon's New Jersey home."
"I was the assigned liaison between the Reagan campaign and former President Nixon, transmitting memos back and forth."
"Private Wilson Brown, Company F."
"Private William Knight, Company E."
"Not any longer, gentlemen."
Forget that you've ever been soldiers.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Knight have been informed by their company commanders about our venture.
They know what they have to do.
We can't get along without them.
"All I can tell the rest of you is that while Mitchell moves toward Chattanooga, we must penetrate more than 100 miles behind the Confederate lines in Georgia to destroy the railroad."
"If we fail, every one of us may be hanged or torn in pieces by an angry mob."

Some of you are pretty young.

"Now then, you're to travel southeast through the Cumberland Mountains, cross the Tennessee River, and be ready to catch the 5:00 train south out of Chattanooga Thursday afternoon."
"Your destination is the Railroad Hotel at Marietta, Georgia."
"If anyone fails to meet me there before sun up Friday morning, the attempt will be made without him."
Any questions?
I'm Bill Campbell.
What'll we tell the Johnny Rebs about who we are and where we're from?
"Tell them you're Kentuckians, escaping Yankee rule to join a Southern regiment."
"If they press you, tell them you hail from Fleming County, Kentucky."
"I'm from Flemingsburg, and no man from that county ever joined the Southern army."
- What if they have us cornered?
- Don't hesitate to join their army.
You can escape back to your own lines some dark night on picket duty.
I'm Bob Buff um.
Would you care to tell us how you intend to reach Marietta?
"I'll travel on the same road, sometimes before you, sometimes behind."
- We allowed to talk to you?
"There's this wonderful scene where all these dignitaries from around the Universe are coming together, they're converging to see the death of planet Earth."
"And then, they wheel out a tarp of skin named Lady Cassandra, the last human to ever be alive."
The Lady Cassandra O'Brien.Delta17.
"Oh, now, don't stare."
"I know, I know, it's shocking, isn't it?"
"I've had my chin completely taken away, and look at the difference."
Look how thin I am.
Thin and dainty.
I don't look a day over 2000.
"Moisturize me, moisturize me."
"Truly,"
I am the last human.
My father was a Texan.
My mother was from --
"She has been stretched so far that she is literally like a pinned piece of leather, drying out."
You know what?
"They sometimes bring up the concept ""if you were the last woman on Earth."""
"Even if she was the last human on Earth,"
I don't know what I would be able to do with her.
No tears.
I'm sorry.
And she arrives with all these medical staff who have to spray her and keep her moist.
"If someone's not there to spray water on her, she dries up and cracks and explodes into, like, dust particles, which is disgusting."
Moisturize me.
"She's really, really proud of being the last human and sort of raises all these issues about what it actually means, to be human."
"There is something, a good science fiction quirk of like, you know, the last human in the Universe and she's just not human anymore, right?"
"And she's rendered inhuman physically, but also because she's a villain, she's a horrible thing."
"Lady Cassandra tries to basically destroy the platform and all the inhabitants in it and, because of her bad move, the Doctor just lets her dry out -- no Dove moisturizer for her -- and then she starts drying out so much"
that she just explodes.
"Pretty gruesomely, too."
"People have died, Cassandra."
You murdered them.
"Cutler had a ton of classified material on his hard drive, all related to"
Palek's various military projects.
STEVE:
Wait.
Cutler didn't have security clearance;
how'd he get the intel?
From his wife.
"He installed a pretty sophisticated piece of malware on Sandra Cutler's laptop, and so he was able to have access to all of her work files, e-mails, everything."
"So not only was this guy violating the marriage, but he was violating her privacy and stealing her security clearance."
Now here's where it get really interesting.
"It turns out, Cutler was routinely downloading classified data onto flash drives."
Sounds like he was spying for somebody.
That's what we were thinking.
CATHERINE:
"If you're right, that would explain where he's getting all that extra cash."
It would also explain why he got murdered.
"The type of people that would pay Cutler to spy for them probably wouldn't think twice about killing him if their relationship went south, right?"
"Okay, so if Cutler is selling classified info, who's the buyer?"
CHIN:
"I reached out to my friends over at FBI Counterintelligence, and they say the most likely suspects are this trio of private companies."
JOE:
Himmel Aerospace and Defense.
That's Palek's chief rival.
Check out one of the names of their subsidiaries.
Kahiku Management Company?
They rent out the cabin where Cutler was killed.
"Well, that can't be a coincidence."
"Up until now, we thought that that was a place that Cutler used just to bring Abby Maxwell, but what if it was also a dead drop for those flash drives?"
"All right, Chin, uh, who runs Himmel's operations on the island?"
CHIN:
That would be a Lee Benner.
Let's go say hello.
"Well, do you have any ideas?"
"Oh, man."
"Thousands of years ago, before time itself was measured, as we know it, there was Atlantis."
"It was a great city, dedicated to art and science."
"The people of Atlantis built their city at the foot of a volcano, which they used to make heat and power."
"They worshipped a mysterious object called the Torch of Truth, said to possess the light of universal wisdom."
"For centuries, Atlantis was the center of the world, and the world was at peace."
"Then, in an instant, the volcano that heated their homes and powered their machines erupted."
"Now fleeing the ruined city, a few survivors gathered the great wealth of Atlantis, and hid it in a place they called the Tower of Fear."
They wrote that story in a book made out of platinum pages.
"Heh, platinum, heh, heh."
Ahem-
- Yes.
Uh...
"Thousands of years passed, until 590 B.C., when a Greek scholar journeyed to Egypt."
His name was Solon.
There he is.
It was there he discovered two relics of Atlantis.
"Ah, one was the platinum book, and the other was the Torch of Truth itself."
"Solon gathered his disciples and presented them with an Ark, in which he'd locked the Torch of Truth."
"And taking the only key,"
Solon left with the platinum book to search for the Treasure of Atlantis.
And vanished... without a trace.
"That is... until five years ago, when I found this very same key in the ruins of Thera."
I am convinced that this is the key to the Ark of Solon.
And I propose to follow in his footsteps and find the Treasure of Atlantis.
I think we've heard quite enough.
"Mister Director, now that I have the medallion,"
I'm certain I can prove my theory.
"If the Academy will, eh, kindly, uh, fund my next expedition."
The Royal Academy of Archaeological Science finances the serious study of history.
We have no interest in your obsession with Atlantis.
These cars were born in the rough and tumble he-man world of rallying.
"With their turbo-charged engines and their four-wheel drive systems, they grip and they go and they stop so ferociously that you're just left breathless."
"In the real world with bumps and hedges,"
"Iow-nosed, wide-bottomed Ferraris and Porsches couldn't hope to keep up with either of them."
They are astonishing.
And yet they're both relatively inexpensive Japanese saloon cars.
"They've both got four doors, they've both got big boots, they're both as reliable as a Swiss bus driver's Austrian pacemaker."
What more could you possibly want?
Let's deal with the Subaru first.
The old model - the one with the silly headlamps - was a softy.
The new one has a more attractive face but don't be fooled.
The steering is quicker and the suspension is tougher.
"They've made it harder, edgier,"
"less of a car, more of a bar room brawler."
It's a different story with the Mitsubishi Evo VIII.
The old Evo VII was like a Mafia hit man - without the compassion.
At first glance it seems they've made the Evo VIII more hard-core.
It's lighter and its gearbox has six speeds rather than five.
"In actual fact though, they've made it softer and quieter."
They've even given it a fuel tank.
The old one had a zippo in the back.
"You'd go four inches, then run out of petrol."
So the Subaru's been beefed up and the Mitsubishi's been watered down.
It seems then that these two cars have met in the middle.
And that means I have to go out there into the bigness of Scotland and find out which one's best.
"Sometimes you know, this job is very, VERY good."
Nothing prepares you for the shock when you first take this thing round the corner.
Take a test drive.
You will not believe how much grip there is.
You just won't.
This Subaru is a hugely manly experience.
"The noise it makes, it's got a macho gearbox, macho steering."

"Alexander, Lord of the Isles, was then led away into captivity."
The rules of the game had changed.
The magnates had once carved up Scotland amongst them.
Not any more.
Now the king was in charge.
Or so the king wanted to believe.
"The Lord of the Isles might be behind bars, but his family openly defied Royal authority."
James sent an army to deal with them.
But Alexander's men weren't about to turn tail.
(MAN SPEAKS GAELIC)
"From every corner of his dispossessed territories,"
"Alexander's supporters gathered, moving to meet the Royal army at Inverlochy at the head of the Great Glen."
The Islesmen landed their birlinns a few miles down there where Fort William now is.
"They marched along the river towards where the Royal army was camped around Inverlochy Castle, just down there in the trees."
The commander of the Royal troops was in the middle of a card game when he got the report of the enemy approach.
He dismissed it.
He said he knew very well the doings of the big-bellied caries of the Isles.
"At that moment, a body of archers hidden on this hill shot a hail of arrows down onto the unprepared Royal troops."
"And taking that as their cue, the main body of the Islesmen charged."
It only took a few minutes.
Over 900 Royal troops lay dead.
Their injured commander fled over the mountains.
Inverlochy was a brutal lesson in the limits of Royal power.
James was forced to realise that it was as dangerous to keep Alexander behind bars as it was to have him on the loose.
"A month after Inverlochy, he set Alexander free."
"Alexander got just about everything back - his lands, his titles and, crucially, his prestige."
The MacDonalds were back on top.
"The Ste warts, mean while, were in trouble."
"To many of the magnates,"
James's release of Alexander seemed like weakness.
They scented blood.
Simmering resentments finally boiled over into conspiracy.
"He arranged for a chaplain in Buchan to say masses for his brother Neil, dead since 1 306, and made grants to Dunfermline Abbey, where his wife lay buried."
"The Bruce and his advisers judged the time was ripe to ask for something that every European monarchy of status possessed - an ampulla - a bottl e of sacred oil, blessed by the Pope himself."
Oil from such bottles was used to anoint kings at their coronations.
"Any attempt to conquer the lands of a king who, by virtue of this oil, had been anointed by God, was a mortal sin."
The English kings had an ampulla.
The French did too.
"But the Scottish kings didn't, and they wanted one."
It was more than any mere status symbol.
It was a bottle full of independence from the English King.
His illness grew worse.
"""The King is dying,"" people said."
Nobody knew what he was dying of.
But this time it was true.
"He had just three months to live, but he went on pilgrimage, struggled down the south-west coast of Scotland to the shrine of St Ninian in Whithorn Cathedral."
"Too sick to ride, the warrior King was carried on a litter."
The journey took a month.
"When he arrived, Robert the Bruce, mortally ill and on the edge of the abyss, did penance."
He fasted and did penance for five days.
"After all, the Church had got him his crown."
Surely now God would take him back.
God forgive me.
I have spilt the blood of many innocent men...
"On his return, he gathered his earls around him and he spoke to them."
"""My day is far gone,"" he said."
"""I thank God for giving me time to repent in this life."
"""Because of me and my wars, much blood has been spilt."
"""Many innocent men have died."
"""So I take this sickness and pain as proper penance for my sins."""
"And he let it be known that after his death, he wanted his heart to be removed and taken on crusade."
"Robert knew he would never live to go himself, but the Scots had been promising the Pope a crusade since 1 320."
Robert died on 7th June 1 329.
He was 55 years old.
"Unfortunately, she died before I could talk to her, so I have only this interview she did with an architecture scholar."
"In the terrible depression, when friends would come over, we couldn't afford to go anywhere."
"We would put a magazine up on the piano, and friends would stand around and say,"
"""Oh, Lou, play that like Bach, or play it like Mozart, or play it like Beethoven, or play it in jazz."""
And he would do that.
We would sing the notes in this magazine.
"And shortly before he died, he said to me, ""You know, Esther,"
"""I don't think I would have been a great pianist, but I might have been a great composer."""
There's a house Lou built outside Philadelphia.
I called up my half sisters and got them to meet me there.
"All these years, we've never talked about our three families."
"I always used to ask him,"
"""Why don't you design a house for us, Daddy?"""
"Right, right."
"And once, he explained to me that he had this idea of a house with many, many mullions."
"And you'd look through those windows, and you'd see a woman preparing a meal."
It was a very romantic idea of what home was.
And he could never build it for himself.
I think his vision was just so different from the way his personal life really was that there was no way he could...
Take the two and put them together at all.
"I had a scrapbook when I was a teenager, so I would get little..."
"like I'd save every card, every little thing, you know?"
"No, really, when he..."
"Oh, these things are two of his famous bow ties tied at the rakish angle very carefully."
"Fortunately, my mother saved some of his ties."
Nice ties.
"Well, I heard you guys talking about when Lou died."
Were you saying that that was when you first saw me?
That's right that's when I first saw you.
"I came in with my mother, and I saw Harriet."
"And I saw a toe-head, blond hair, very nicely decked out youth of 11... 10, 11."
And I figured that had to be you.
Have you finished?
Yes what is Er Mei's third commandment?
It prohibits fornication and promiscuity what about the sixth commandment?
Guard against rebels who turn against Er Mei what punishment do these rebels deserve?
Death
You now have a chance to make up for your wrong
That is to go to Yang Siu of the Summit Guang Ming and poison the food so as to kill them all and rid us of this evil
"Shiau Fu, your word now will determine your fate what wrong have Ming Cult done to deserve total annihilation?"
"If you must kill, just kill me"
You're looking for death?
Mother
Mother
I told you if you must kill kill me first
"And me, wang Nan Gou"
This bitch's skills are not bad
I think her title of Head of Er Mei has not been bought by money
"Doctor, please stop"
Even ten more of you won't be my teacher's match
Let me settle this affair today
Run while you can
Haven't you heard of the Scholar Chuang Zi's words?
Living mightn't mean happiness deathnotsuffering'
In death we might find we were fools while we lived
So don't place too much emphasis on life and death but you must have great regard for what you've said
"Doctor, how are you?"
we have done our best
Take care of yourself
Doctor wu...
Doctor wu...
"Teacher, why?"
why?
The evil cult is better than the hypocrites full of high sounding morals
Take it from me If your party men contest here
"I will kill him, whoever he may be"
"I swear on this dead child, go away"
I could have shot him the other day when he has hit me
"But my dependent invalid, 30 year old sister and.."
Another sister who refuses to get married
When elder sister is yet to be married have tied down me I am tolerating their atrocities
"If they are alive, no one can live peacefully"
You are doing what I could not do I am very happy about it
Whatever help you need I will do
What is it you are thinking so seriously?
"Nothing, 5000Rs is missing"
"-5000 missing, when?"
-Yesterday night
You claim you are a union leader for 5000 people
Can't you keep 5000Rs safely?
Don't you have common sense?
Have you found out who has taken it?
I have found out
"Then kick him and get the money He is a relative, so I am hesitant"
"Don't look for all this, when he is doing this"
Thrash him so you want me to hit him
"When you have said it, why should I hesitate?"
I have taken it why didn't you say this earlier?
"I was trying get away, but couldn't do it"
What have you done with that money?
I have purchased silver for Rs 5000
I landed in a small problem What is that?
How did you get this?
My brother in law has send it from Singapore
"I will give 50,000 Rs worth silver for Rs 5000"
"I don't want this will get trapped in police case, go"
"He collected a $100,000 advance from their New York office the day he bought Libena's freedom."
Explains the money.
"Ms. Jao also said that Tendu had the company wire $20,000 each to several people in his village in Maniitok, Canada."
He wanted the payments to continue for the life of his contract.
But he also wanted to make sure he could stop the payments if the recipients didn't fulfill certain conditions.
The payments were incentives.
He wanted to ensure certain prominent citizens in Maniitok did something that they already desperately wanted to do.
How could you already know that?
You tend to project when you speak Mandarin.
"I overheard enough to get the gist, so I contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Maniitok to see if any of their officers could provide any insight, and Officer Montcalm has been giving me an overview of a certain situation in Tendu's hometown."
"That, in combination with the names of Tendu's payees and their views regarding the future of Maniitok, allowed me to deduce the goal of the payments, not to mention why Owen Tuchman was murdered and Tendu framed."
I don't get it.
Are you saying all of this is because of local politics in an Inuit village?
The local politics are just a symptom.
O.G.'s murder was ultimately triggered by something far larger in scope.
He died because of global warming.
(car horns honking)
Any sign of the guy?
Not yet.
Our techs pinged his cell phone to a tower right around the corner.
He's definitely around here somewhere.
You sure he's our killer?
Kurt Godwyn is a fixer for Mather and Kline.
He does all the dirty work for an exceedingly dirty law firm.
"So, if they sent anyone to kill Tendu three nights ago,"
I'll bet it was him.
There he is.
Brown jacket.
That's him.
I think I see a parking spot--
What...

Now the Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo is driven to bay by that policeman from the lumberyard and the day after tomorrow on October 27th is the big sports day
"By then, all the Japanese in Wushe are going to gather in one place"
Is it time already?
"Father, there won't be a better chance"
And we have no other choice
We can't have the Japanese look down on us anymore
We need to show them what we're made of
"Let's fight them, Chief"
Yeah!
Let's fight them
Young men...
I hate the Japanese no less than you do
But do you realize that we're going to die after all this and all our people will be wiped out?
Our ancestors shed their blood in exchange for our lives
Now we're taking our children along to the battlefield to shed blood
"We're Seediq Bale, aren't we?"
"Temu, does your father know you're here?"
My father told me that
I should ask Chief Mouna to help us youngsters get our faces tattooed so that the ancestors' spirits guarding the rainbow bridge will recognize us as the true Seediqs
Father?
"If we want revenge, it'd be the business of Mehebu Clan alone"
But if we're offering a blood sacrifice to our ancestors it will be the business of all the 12 clans in Wushe
Keep it a secret before action
"We must tell none of the elders, children or women"
- in all these clans
- When did you...
I'm speaking here.
Are you listening?
Keep it a secret before action
I knew Chief Mouna had a plan already
What do you know?
It's your idea and your responsibility
How much opposition did you have to fight through to place Yi Soon-shin in command of the Left Cholla Naval Station?
"You can forsake a good man in a instant, but it will not be easy to find another good man."
"Your Majesty, offer your warm hands to them first."
And they will return your virtue by serving you with their lives.
There is not one naval commander in the three lower provinces that support you.
No one else has resisted my order to abolish the navy.
Why do you insist on walking the lonely path that no one else will go near?
It is to fight a victorious fight.
To fight a victorious fight...
You wouldn't be uttering empty words to the King.
Honor your word!
"If you suffer one single defeat, I will indeed abolish the navy!"
"What's more, I will take your life and the lives of your men as well!"
I will not commit the impiety of making Your Majesty take our lives.
"As long as I'm alive, I will fight the enemy and win, and if I must die."
I will die on the battlefield as an enemy of the enemy.
High Commander of Left Cholla Naval Station Yi Soon-shin?
"Yes, Your Highness."
Please serve my father well.
"I, Yi Soon-shin, will protect this country Chosun with my life."
You're looking at me with eyes of pity.
Your Majesty...
I've ceded to the stubborn subjects Yu Sung-ryong and Yi Soon-shin again.
Is that what you think?
"No, Your Majesty."
How could I when you've killed two birds with one stone?
Killed two birds?
"One, you've renewed the loyalty of High Commander Yi Soon-shin and Left"
"Minister Yu Sung-ryong, and two, you've stopped Yoon Du-su's influence from growing out of proportion since military leaders Shin Lip, Yi Il and Won Kyun are"
Westerners.
"In February of 1592 when the talks of abolishing the navy was casing a stir in Chosun, the Japanese fleet laid anchored in a harbor delaying the launching which was to take place on March 1st."
It was because Hideyoshi had suddenly taken ill.
-What is the matter?
"-Greetings, commissioner wants to meet you"
Inform I am coming
-Sit down
-No thanks
Did you threaten people's party Krishnamurthy?
I am an ordinary person Why should I threaten him?
- I have not even seen him
- So you have surely not threatened him
- No sir
- OK you may go
"Sir, so far I talked officially I want to talk with you unofficially"
Will you switch off the tape recorder?
"Are you wondering, how I know that you are recording?"
I know the strengths of officials and the weaknesses of politicians
"Sir, tell me honestly were you not unhappy over the atrocities.."
"Have you not felt, they should be put behind bars even once?"
"Even if you want, you can't do it Because you are a government official"
I am just fulfilling your helpless emotions
It might be wrong in the eyes of your department
"But deep in your heart, you will feel what I do is right"
"I don't want your support but be a silent spectator, that will do"
Take it from me
"From Sethupathy's party who ever contests, I will kill"
Bye
Ask that Krishnamurthy to come come
Arul says he has never threatened you file your nomination boldly
"Rest we will take care which one, my death?"
Will commissioner be with you for 24 hrs?
Do you sleep hugging him?
"Even then, if the ceiling fan falls on your head, what will you do?"
-lt will surely fall

What?
Tado Mouna became a hero before I did
Those Japanese are outrageous
I can't believe they beat up someone who offers them a drink
A while ago... three girls from Boarung Clan were asked to serve them drinks and they were raped
Why couldn't Tado be a real hero and kill Yoshimura right on the spot?
Kill him?
Don't you remember how my family died?
My father killed only one Japanese man and they burned my whole family alive
I was hiding in the woods watching without even blinking my eyes
So... that's why we can't kill only one Japanese man
We have to kill all of them to make a difference
Are you kidding me?
We wouldn't still be sitting here if we could kill them all
Orreries were mechanical models used to demonstrate the rotating orbits of the planets.
The next planet we get is...
Can we have Venus over here...
"Venus, the goddess of love?"

A round of applause to all of our volunteers who were planets.
There we are.
"It was a very nice note saying she was definitely one of the reasons for coming back, because she's just a great laugh... but that I just didn't feel comfortable pursuing anything."
There's kind of not really that much chemistry between Mr. Carrington and I.
I think maybe it was just the kind of excitement and I know that he's certainly not giving me any indication that it's reciprocated on his side.
"You know, we've got this really bizarre situation where Everett likes me and I don't like him, and I like Mr. Carrington and he doesn't like me."
"I've always said, you know, I know, when I meet somebody, I know."
"But actually, I've been wrong, and it's... and it's kind of quite hard to admit that to yourself, that that kind of gut instinct isn't always right, and sometimes I've really missed."
"And maybe in my past life, you know, in my past I've missed opportunities that maybe I should have taken advantage of."
"It's not all about that chemistry, that spark, because that doesn't last forever."
"For Miss Hopkins' chaperone, Lady Devonport,"
She's preparing for her secret rendezvous with Mr. Foxsmith.
I've spent the last ten years of my life trying very hard not to get attached to people.
"And it has made me think, I actually can open up and be passionate and I think it's not going to kill me; it is all right, and I'm really grateful for that."
"And if anybody sees you, you can say you're going midnight riding."
I would say I do love him.
I think he's a really lovely person and I really do mind about him.
Lady Devonport.
Foxy.
So soon.
Glass of wine.
Thank you.
Would you join me?
Here's to scientific research.
Absolutely.
"Next time, take your battle stations."
"Oops, sorry."
And maybe I have been wrong.

"Don't always listen to your heart, sometimes listen to your head."
Time has arrived to announce
Captain Glover's entry into the aristocracy.
A highly respected peer of the realm is invited to witness the event.
make two announcements:
"Firstly, welcome Lord Temple Morris here."
It's a great honor for you to come.
Thank you very much for coming.
And some rather good news is
"Captain Glover has, for his fantastic performances at sea and his capture of an enemy boat, has been awarded a large amount of money and a baronet."
So Captain Glover is departing and Sir Jeremy is arriving.
Lord Temple Morris explains the finer points of Captain Glover's new rank.
a very nice honor to have actually because you're free to go in the House of Commons.
"You don't have to go to the Lords, but you are a titled commoner, you know."
"Sir Jeremy, perhaps you'd like to read your letter out?"
"Yes, it's quite interesting, it's £50,000 has now matured."
I haven't spent all of it.
I put money towards a lighthouse fund.
I put some money into researching electricity.
I've put some money into sailors' widows and kept a considerable sum for myself... should you be interested in marrying now someone with not only title but a massive fortune.
My position in the house is now most senior gentleman.
I shall be sitting at the top of the table from now on.
"No, I won't, I won't, no, sir."
How would your wife be known as?
"""Lady,"" of course."
So I might get married in the next few days which might elevate one of the ladies.
"This is music to the ears of Braund's chaperone, Mrs. Hammond."
"Once Miss Braund did favor Mr. Everett, um, in her heart"
"She has grown increasingly fond of Captain Glover over the weeks that we've been here and we think that it's only right and natural,"
"Miss Braund and I, that because he has proved himself, even when he was a poor man, that he, um..."
And the Spanish one promptly lost his mind.
Elizabeth offered her own favourite.
"But eventually, Mary settled on something much closer to home - an English cousin."
"Like her, he's a good dancer."
A good huntsman.
"Tall, good-looking and young."
"His name was Henry, Lord Darnley, and he was the boy who would be king."
"After a whirlwind romance, Mary and Darnley married, and Scotland was poised to have a cocky 19-year-old, not just as its queen's husband, but as its out-and-out king."
All with Mary's blessing.
But then something strange happened.
"A clue lies here, in the National Museum of Scotland."
"So, what have we here, Nick?"
"Well, we have a coin which was struck to commemorate the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Henry, Lord Darnley, in July, 1565."
- And that's the happy couple?
"- Indeed, staring into each other's eyes."
And the inscription has Henry's name before Mary's.
So it's Henry and King before Mary and Queen.
That's right.
Yes.
"It was probably considered soon after this had gone into circulation that it was conveying an unfortunate message, and they were withdrawn from circulation very rapidly"
- and replaced with a different type!
- What replaced it?
"It was replaced by a different coin, the same size, but with different designs on."
Surely that's mysterious - that two coins should replace one another so quickly?
"Well, Mary, of course, was of higher status than Henry Darnley, and the coin seemed to convey that he was at least equal, if not, in fact, superior status."
"So the new issue was brought out which had Mary's name first, making sure that the correct hierarchy was maintained."
So he's been put in his place by the time the second coin comes out.
"- Yes, very much so."
"- So quite clearly, these two coins tell us what we need to know about that relationship."
"Well, yes."
"The fact this happened in Scotland so rapidly is an indication of something unusual going on, yes."
"Darnley roamed about Edinburgh drunk and debauched, mouthing off about not being king and making enemies in the process."
All that's dead and buried.
"No, this'll be some rear admiral in a lather because we've got the wind speed wrong for the day in question."
"Oh, and did I mention?"
It's at Whitehall.
The Ministry of War.
"""We few, we happy few, we band of brothers."
For he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.
"And gentlemen in England now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here, and hold their manhood cheap whilst any speak who fought with us upon Saint Crispin's Day."""
The power of the dramatic arts.
Ah...
America.
Firmly against any military involvement in a war they see as Europe's business.
I'm sure I need not tell you how many people attend the cinema every week in this country.
- Thirty--
- Thirty million.
And in America that figure is closer to 90.
"Mr. Churchill is persuaded that film, in particular your film, presents us with a unique opportunity to put our case to the American people."
They fear that we are already beaten.
You show that we fight on.
They believe this country to be dominated by an upper-class elite.
You present a vision of Britain in which ordinary working people are the heroes.
"But most crucially of all, your film concerns itself directly with the feminine experience, to show your American sisters that this is a war their sons and husbands and brothers should be fighting."
"Of course, if we want America to listen, we must give them someone to listen to, a character with whom they can really identify."
- You want us to put an American in it?
- Exactly so.
"Ideally, of course, one would cast a star with British connections, a Cary Grant or an Errol Flynn, but the war will not wait on the convenience of a Hollywood schedule."
"Besides, we rather think we've done one better."
Carl Lundbeck.
"American boy, Norwegian forefathers."
"Before the war, he flew crop dusters on his parents' farm in Michigan."
"When Germany invaded Norway,"
Carl made his way to England to join the RAF... where he's made himself very much at home.
"Star charts, 15x more accurate than before, saving money and lives."
Sheridan:
Flamsteed's a hero.
He changed the world irrevocably by creating these accurate measurements.
"It's like these sailors went from having a rough, you know, hand-drawn map to having a satellite, photograph, beautiful, GPS-inspired image."
Narrator:
"New measurements that, one day, will help guide men to the moon."
Meigs:
"So often, we think about the progress of science."
"We think about that a-ha moment, that flash of insight, we don't recognize that so much of science is dogged, hard work, and Flamsteed was the ultimate grinder."
Narrator:
Science opens a new age of exploration.
"Captain James Cook, mankind's greatest explorer."
Cook speaking:
"I had ambition, but only to go farther than anyone had been had before, but as far as it was possible for men to go."
Sheridan:
"Cook's journey depended upon the observations of Flamsteed, and he could have never done what he did without them."
Narrator:
A third of the world unmapped until now.
"On three journeys, Cook will reach some of the most remote corners of the planet, and open up a new continent."
Meigs:
Cook's voyages really showed us what the world looked like.
"No longer were there vast areas on the map, where you might just say, ""There be dragons."""
Narrator:
"Onboard the Endeavor, a crew of 74, living on decks less than four feet high, an era when half of all sailors die from disease, they cross an uncharted ocean that covers a third of the planet,"
the Pacific.
"Now, after 20 months at sea, Cook and his crew step onto a mysterious new continent,"
Australia.
"[water, waves]"
"Australia's Aboriginal people settled the continent 50,000 years ago, [waves] the oldest living culture in the world,"
250 languages 600 dialects.
"They invent sharpened axes 15,000 years before Europeans."

"I was like, ""Fine,"" and people are going to get up and do stuff."
"So, this one girl gets up and she reads a poem that she's written about the weekend."
"It's boring but it's fine, you know."
And then this guy gets up with a guitar and sings Morrissey songs.
"He brought the guitar like he knew that bit was going to happen, it really wound me up, I was like, ""It's fine, be positive,"
"""be positive,"" and it was all going fine, it was very relaxed until this guy, Geordie Dave, who's a lovely, lovely man, and he'd come on this retreat because he'd gone through"

"He felt like people didn't like him and he wanted to sort of rebuild his confidence and out of nowhere, he just ran to the front of the room and he was like,"
"GEORDIE ACCENT: ""Hello, my name's not on the list"
"""but I've had such an amazing weekend."""
"Sorry, excuse the accent, sorry."
"No, it's good."
"He was like, ""I just want to say, when I came,"

"And, he just starts, he's got no prep, nothing, and he was like - # It's a little bit funny... #"
"Silence, silence."
He's got no instruments.
# ..
This feeling inside. #
"Silence, silence."
"And I saw two things, in his face,"
I saw the moment he re-engaged with his legs.
"I saw him sort of think, ""Oh, we did this."""
"Like, genuinely, that was just a thought, and then I also saw that he didn't know all the words, he did not know the words to this song and he's about to have a death."

"and after six hours of this, absolutely freezing cold,"
"I mean, really freezing, you know, bones were rattling and the rain getting into every fibre of every stitch of clothing."

"And finally, because of bad light, we had to stop, they would have gone on forever and I just said, ""I cannot get into a car so wet and so cold."""
"I went up to the nearest house and I knocked at the door and I said,"
"""I'm really, really sorry but can I have a bath?"""
"I had no choice, I had no choice."
"And granted, I was dressed as a priest and it might have helped but they just kind of looked at me and went, ""OK""."
Did they recognise you from Father Ted?
No.
"It was the first series so no-one would have ever seen it, nobody would have even been aware there was filming going on."
"It was just this extremely wet, bedraggled priest... came to the door and asked for a bath and that was..."
"Yeah, fair enough."
"I like the fact you didn't even ask for a shower, you wanted a bath."
It had to be a bath.
You needed to properly unwind.
It had to be a bath.
"Out of interest, was there bubble bath?"
"No, it was just a plain bath."
A plain bath.
"Are you called, Roisin, ""Ro-sheen"", is that how you say it?"
Yeah.
You grew up in London...
Yes.
..but with this full-on Irish name.
Were people OK with it or did they get it wrong every time?
"Most people say it ""Roy-zin"", you know, it's ridiculous."
"And from your sacred vials, pour your graces upon my daughter's head"
"Tell me, mine own, where hast thou been preserved, where lived?"
There's time enough for that
"Go together, you precious winners all"
"I, an old turtle,"
Will wing me to some withered bough
And there my male that's never to be found again
Lament till I am lost.
"O peace, Paulina."
Thou shouldsl a husband take by my nsent as I bythine a wife.
"Come, Camille, and take her by the hand."
"Good Paulina, lead us from hen"

Here's to the beautiful ladies
Here's to those wonderful girls
This is the mixture to start the picture So bring on the beautiful girls
When Fred Astaire sang this song in the film Ziegfeld Follies the year was 1946 and MGM was at the height of its success in creating incredible fantasies and setting them to music.
"Here, Lucille Ball tames a pack of exotic cat-women."
"It was imaginative, outlandish imagery, and audiences loved it."
"It was a time before television and VCRs, when on the average 90 million Americans went to the movies each week and the MGM musical was king of the box office."
The most popular entertainment in the world.
This is the mixture to start the picture
So bring on the beautiful girls
"Once upon a time, there was a factory that created wonderful musical dreams."
It happened when a special group of talented artists came together to create some of the world's most enchanting movies.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was not the only studio that made musical motion pictures.
But it did make more than anyone else and somehow did it better.
To tell us more about those remarkable days here's one of MGM's best:
Mr. Gene Kelly.
The 44 acres behind me was where it all began.
"On 20th February 1437, James's enemies finally caught up with him."
It was after midnight when they broke into the Royal lodgings.
"With the assassins outside the door, James searched for a way out."
"There wasn't one, so he smashed a hole through the wooden floor and dropped into the sewer beneath."
But the exit to the drain had been blocked off.
James turned to face his pursuers.
He tried to make a fight of it.
"But there, in the darkness and the filth, he was stabbed to death."
Scotland held her breath.
"The killing of a king was a shocking, almost sacrilegious act."
"With the Stewart dynasty weak and exposed, the MacDonalds were unassailable."
"When Alexander, Lord of the Isles, eventually died in 1449, his dream of ruling an empire that stretched from coast to coast had been realised."
"He was buried not on Iona like his forefathers, but on the mainland in the rich soil of Ross."
"From beyond the grave, Alexander was not only reinforcing past claims, he was hinting at future ambitions."
The kingdom was at a turning point.
"With James I and Alexander, Lord of the Isles, gone it was up to a new generation to continue their legacies."
"On the Stewart side, James II assumed his father's throne."
"A bright red birthmark earned him the nickname, James the Fiery Face."
"On the MacDonald side, it was john who now became Lord of the Isles."
His inauguration followed a ritual that was centuries old.
"just like the ancient kings, john stepped into a carved rock footprint, joining him to the land he was to rule over."
(MAN SPEAKS GAELIC)
The bards heaped extravagant praise on john MacDonald.
But it only added to the weight of expectation on his shoulders.
"John's position was difficult, even precarious."
Should he try and expand his territory?
Or would it better to consolidate his already over-stretched empire?
"For the moment, he opted for the status quo."
"Meanwhile, James took decisive action."
"The new king would cement his family's fortunes, not through violence but at the altar."
"Here in Edinburgh in 1449, James II married Mary of Gueldres."
"She was the grandniece of the Duke of Burgundy, one of the most wealthy and powerful men on the continent."
Anyone who has my job has to know every little thing
- Rabab robbed me
- You asked for it
You cheated
"Pasha, you tricked me and the owner of the bar... and the customers"
"This place is respectable, we only offer drinks... nothing else, we are respectable people that's why I fired Rabab and you're fired, too and don't even let me see you pass in front of the bar"
"Do you want to leave on your feet or on a stretcher, lover boy?"
Get up before I beat you up in front of the bar trash

I came to borrow a book but whatever
but I didn't think you were there I'm surprised were you worried about me?
you came for that?
Didn't you once fall asleep during a gig or something?
Is that true?
"Yeah, that is absolutely true."
I might be asleep now.
"No, I did."
I genuinely...
"I was in Belfast, you would know the club, the Empire in Belfast."
You know it as well.
Paddy Kielty's place.
"Yeah, and it was a fantastic club in its day and really raucous, really, really lively and I remember, I had been up all night the night before and I was exhausted and I was on stage"
in front of a big crowd of people and I sort of drifted off and I remember hearing...
You drifted off?
"Yes, I did and I heard somebody in what I thought was a distant room... ..doing my material, word for word, doing it really well, better than I could do it."
"You were thinking, ""That guy's good."""
"And I sort of went towards that room and I was going, ""Who is this?"
"""Why are they doing my stuff?"""
"As I got closer, I realised it was actually me and that I was on stage doing it."
"It was sort of like an out-of-body experience and I remember just going,"
"I'd better wake up now and you know, address the situation,"
"And I kind of woke up then and I didn't know where I was in the set at that stage, I'd completely lost my way but the audience didn't seem to mind that much."
"They didn't know really, I didn't tell them either, you know, so then I was going on to Derry the next day, the city of Derry, so you'd do the two gigs together, Belfast and then Derry."
And then Galway and then Cork.
"Yes, that's right, it was a little loop of Ireland."
I did that with Barry.
Yeah.
"Friend of Ardal's, he's an Irish comedian, he's very funny."
He's funnier than Ardal but he was booked.
"So we went to Derry the next day, cos I was so shocked by this happening that I rang ahead - cos you used to stay in this lovely little place..."
"""Can I have a bed on stage, please?"""
"There's this lovely little BB in Derry we used to stay in and so I rang ahead to see, would the room be ready and could I have a little nap before the next gig so this wouldn't happen again."
"So I went along there and when I got there, there was a hot water bottle in my bed and I tried to go to sleep and the next thing, the man who owns the BB came into my room and he closed the curtains and then he tucked me in."
"I'd never experienced anything like that before, anywhere in any hostelry."
They didn't just appear and go they appeared over the capitol building
"Over the skies, over the White House."
Over the Washington Monument
NARRATOR:
Fighter jets are scrambled to intercept the strange objects.
"But as the jets close in, all seven suddenly disappear."
PITTMAN:
Some Air Force officers reported that airmen had tried to shoot down UFOs but had not been able to because the
UFOs were able to fly faster than our aircraft.
NARRATOR:
"Days after the breach of capital airspace,"
"Major General John Samford, Director of lntelligence for the"
"United States Air Force, addressed the issue at a"
Pentagon press conference.
SAMFORD:
"We have received and analyzed between 1,000 and 2,000 reports."
There have been a certain percentage that have been made by credible observers of relatively incredible things.
BIRNES:
Washington is capital of the United States.
So the point was to demonstrate at the height of of the Cold
"War, that they were a power greater than us."
CHILDRESS:
It's sometimes thought that during periods of political upheaval and turning points and history that these extraterrestrials suddenly show up
NARRATOR:
What were these strange lights that penetrated the airspace of the U.S. capital?
"Could they have been, as ancient astronaut theorists suggest, alien craft-- sent here to monitor this turning point in our history?"
"If so, even as far back as the founding of the United States of America?"
CHILDRESS:
"Just prior to the Revolutionary War, what a lot of the scientists would do at that time was meet once a month during the full moon, and they called themselves the Lunar Society."
And Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were part of all this.
"And they would meet to discuss new scientific ideas, life on other planets, and how they could create a United States that was different from other countries."
NARRATOR:
This is the realm of the bush pilot.
Tom Clayton is leaving behind his family and friends for a two-year adventure around the world.
The 28-year-old Radnor resident checks out his single engine plane for the last time before taking a solo flight from wings Airport in Norristown.
The purpose is to try and go to seven continents in different parts of the world and live and work with bush pilots.
As a bush pilot
Claytor will fly daredevil routes while delivering vital supplies to remote areas.
So before taking to the skies
Claytor got his hugs and kisses while cameras recorded all the action.
And there was even a special goodbye.
Then as the crowd looked on the pilot closed the cockpit door and took off.
"The day he left, he made the local TV news."
"If he makes it back, he'll make history."
Tom Claytor hopes to be the first to fly around the world
Stopping on all seven continents before returning home
I had this tremendous desire inside to look at other places to look in places like
Greenland and the Sahara Desert.
Things that I'd only seen on the map in high school.
So I think it's a desire to look at different parts of the world and to live with people on other parts of the world but maybe also it's a little challenge or test for myself as well.
Claytor is 31 years old.
When he was 12 he set foot in an airplane for the first time.
It was to be the start of an obsession
When he was just 18 he earned a pilot's license.
By his early 20s he had begun working as a bush pilot in Africa.
"Today, Claytor owns his own airplane named ""Timmissartok"""
after one of Lindbergh's planes.
Outrigged with a special reserve tank the Cessna 180 Taildragger can fly about 14 hours without refueling.
The struggle to keep his gas tank full has shaped
Claytor's journey from the very start.
"I left home with $20,000."
"And when I got to Greenland it cost me $1,000 to fill up my gas tank once."
So it became very obvious that I was going to have to find ways of getting money.
And my idea which was only an idea when I left was that I'd work the plane on the way.
When I first arrived here MGM's dream factory was in full swing.
And every week the studio released a new film and musicals were always a big part of the lineup.
But the success of the MGM musical did not happen overnight.
It all started when the movies learned to talk.
"At first, the studios were unsure of what to do with this new invention."
Then they hit on the idea of filming popular vaudeville acts.
My pet told me cutely That I'm set absolutely
"- So I pet with nobody else but my, my pet"
- Whose pet?
- I repeat that he's my pet
- Whose pet?
Ain't he sweet?
And I pet with nobody else
But my pet
"In The Hollywood Revue of 1929 one of the first all-talking, all-singing, all-dancing movies the studio gave its huge roster of stars a chance to get their feet wet in the newfangled talkies."
The finale introduced a brand-new song that did a lot for me much later.
But at the time it was so new that some of the performers had trouble remembering the lyrics.
Let the stormy clouds Chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain I've a smile on my face
I walk down the lane With a happy refrain
Just singin' Just singin' in the rain
Singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
"Suddenly, the musical became an overnight sensation delighting audiences with bigger casts lavish sets and costumes and even a new gimmick called Technicolor."
MGM began its most ambitious film of this kind in late 1930 and filmed all the big production numbers before the public lost interest in these plotless musicals and the project was abandoned.
One of the numbers featured The Dodge Twins performing...
What else?
"- ""The Lock Step"" from the unfinished March of Time."
Shake your stripes Beat your pipe
Start crooning the jailhouse wall
"Lock your cell Step light, hello, warden"
Join in and lock step It'll get you fizzin'
Make money in your sleep
"That's right, dearie Show him what you've got"
"That's right, dearie Let him have the lot"
PROSTITUTES:
"Old men, young men Take 'em as they come!"
Harbor rats and alley cats and every kind of scum
"Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land"
See them with their trousers off They're never quite as grand!
All it takes is money in your hand
Lovely ladies Going for a song
Got a lot of callers But they never stay for long
"Come on, Captain You can wear your shoes"
Don't it make a change to have a girl who can't refuse?
Easy money Lying on a bed
Just as well they never see The hate that's in your head
Don't they know they're making love to one already dead?
(MAN EXHALES)
(COINS CLINKING)
There was a time when men were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong
I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
"If Mary had once encouraged him to dream of being king, she now backtracked."
"And well she could, because Darnley had done his job by then - he'd made his wife pregnant."
"Guns fired across Scotland to salute to the future king when Mary gave birth to a son, James, on June the 19th, 1566."
"A few months later, a lavish party was thrown in the great hall of Stirling Castle to celebrate James's baptism."
And it was a major political event.
"Mary had ordered a huge round table be set up here - to remind the guests of King Arthur, the mythical king of Britain."
"And James was hailed as Little Arthur, the future king of a reunited Britain."
The visiting English ambassador was suitably offended at the Scottish royal family's claim to be the future rulers of the whole British Isles.
It was a very provocative gesture.
But it was realistic.
Time was running out for Elizabeth.
"She was already in her mid-3Os, and it was becoming less and less likely that she would ever produce her own heir."
"And if she didn't, or couldn't, where would that leave England?"
Answer - in Scotland's hands.
"Whether Elizabeth liked it or not, baby James would be the next in line."
"So the English queen now seemed poised to do some thing remarkable - bury the hatchet with Mary and name her son, James, as the successor to the English throne."
"Until, that is, Mary's poor choice in men came back to haunt her."
"The house where Darnley, Mary's husband, was staying was blown up with gunpowder packed into its basement."
But it wasn't the blast that killed him.
His body was found some distance away from the scene of the explosion.
"In all likelihood, he was strangled as he tried to flee for his life."
The Scottish nobles had finally run out of patience with Darnley.
But some said the blood on their hands was ordained by the queen herself.
And Mary's behaviour seemed to prove those suspicions.
She didn't rush into mourning clothes.
Nor did she give her husband a state funeral.
"Instead, Darnley's body was dumped at night somewhere in Holyrood Abbey."
You get a sense of Darnley's tragedy here.
"The story goes that he's buried alongside these other dead, but they have gravestones and he doesn't."
No-one knows for sure where he was buried and no-one really cares.
Yet he was practically a king of Scotland.
His sordid death changed everything for Mary.
Why did this group of 18th-century men who set out to build a nation based on principles of logic and reason attach such importance to pre-Christian symbols and ancient mysticism?
And who-- or what-- did they believe was watching over them?
God?
Or something else?
"According to ancient astronaut theorists, the answer can be found in an 1866 lithograph of George Washington that resides in the Library of Congress."
CHILDRESS:
There's a famous painting of George Washington as a Freemason.
And over his right shoulder is an unusual scene of Jacob's
Ladder ascending to Heaven and what seems to be some kind of spaceship there in the sky.
NARRATOR:
"In the biblical story of Jacob from Genesis 28th,"
Jacob witnesses angels ascending and descending a ladder from Heaven.
"But in this painting, the ladder comes not from Heaven, but out of a dark, round object emitting multi-colored lights."
"Although Jacob's Ladder is a popular symbol of Freemasonry, is it possible that this image is attempting to depict something else?"
Something of an extraterrestrial origin?
TSOUKALOS:
"According to the ancient astronaut ideas, Jacob's ladder was nothing else but a ramp or a device with which to reach the realm of the gods."
And the gods were extraterrestrials.
NARRATOR:
The square and compass...
the All-Seeing Eye...
Jacob's Ladder.
What do all these symbols reveal about the true origins of the
United States of America?
Ancient astronaut theorists don't only point to the presence of Masonic symbols and pre-Christian influences as evidence of the Founding Fathers' extraterrestrial connections.
They also find proof in the fact that even the very layout of Washington D.C. points to the stars.
"Alexandria, Virginia."
1791
"In a full Masonic ceremony on the edge of the Potomac River, George Washington lays the first cornerstone marking the southern boundary for what will become the District of Columbia."
ELIAS:

"Ri Innse Gall, The King of the Hebrides."
"Alexander's family, the MacDonalds, had played the game well."
"They had backed Bruce and the rewards had flowed - lands, wealth and power."
"The power of 10,000 armed men."
Power over the islands.
Power over the sea.
"This is called a ""birlinn"" or a West Highland galley."
She's really a descendant of a Viking long ship.
"What range, what territory could boats like these cover effectively?"
"In some cases up to 50, maybe 60 miles a day."
You could certainly go from Northern Ireland up to Cape Wrath in two or three days if you had good wind behind you.
NEIL:
How important would you say these craft were to the Lordship?
GORDON:
Vital.
Whoever controlled the roads of the sea had the power and that's what the MacDonalds had.
"If it wasn't for these, there would have been no Lordship of the Isles."
"With over 100 birlinns at his command,"
Alexander dominated Scotland's Atlantic seaboard.
No wonder they called him the King of the Hebrides.
"The nerve centre of his far-flung territories, Finlaggan on Islay."
"It was here Alexander summoned his chiefs to do deals, form alliances and, most importantly, keep the peace."
"As an archaeologist, one of the first things that strikes me about this place is the fact that it isn't fortified."
"But then, of course, it didn't need to be."
"By the time Alexander took over, the Lordship had already enjoyed a century of internal stability."
"And with that peace and with the patronage of the MacDonald Lords came a flourishing of the arts, sculpture, music and poetry."
It's often hard to get a sense of what places like Finlaggan were like in their heyday.
"But a few archaeological finds that have been recovered from the site over the years, give an idea of the day-to-day reality of life here."
"This is from a hunting dog's collar and you can tell from the careful decoration on it that the dog's owner was proud of the beast and wanted it to look its best and, of course, the Lords of the Isles were very big on hunting."
"These are gaming pieces carved from bone, the rules of the game long forgotten, but on this one you can clearly see the carved outline of a stag with its antlers and its mouth open and its tongue sticking out."
"And finally, this last piece is a pilgrim's badge or token."
It's made of lead and it's from Rome.
"""why ain't you dancing?"""
"I was thinking, ""Yeah, he's really giving this guy both barrels."
"""God, I wouldn't want to be in this guy's shoes""."
"He's like, ""There must be something wrong with you,"
"""there must be a wheelchair waiting for you cos you ain't dancing."""
"And I remember, I glanced behind me and I did this because the entire dance floor had emptied, the people were crying with laughter and pointing at me, and I looked at my friend and he was hugging his knees, he was laughing so much."
"And he said, ""You either have to leave or start dancing""."
So I left.
"Then I walked, I had to walk through the now empty dance floor with everyone going, ""Waaaay!"", and I was like, ""Yeah, very funny, very good""."
"So I sat at the back and the manager come up to me and he was like, he put his arm around me and he said, ""You don't have to dance"
"""if you don't want to""."
Were you 12 or something?
I was a bit tearful.
"He was like, ""Don't let him force you do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable"", and I was like, ""I know, thanks,"
"""cheers, mate""."
"So I was sat there waiting for the gig to end and then, obviously, we had to wait for everyone to leave because it was too embarrassing, cos people were coming up to me and taking the piss."
"The manager let us out round the back and as we went out, they were like putting away his decks and stuff and my friend was pissed and he went up to his roadie and went, ""Hey, mate, this is the guy, this is"
"""the idiot, that guy that Grandmaster Flash was taking the"
"""piss out of, look at him, he's there""."
"And the bloke went, ""Man,"
"""that's all part of the show, tomorrow night we'll do that to some"
"""other white dude in Exeter""."
I like the fact you didn't even ask for a shower.
You wanted a bath.

"I was in a sitcom, Father Ted, which you know and I remember, we were shooting this episode with a friend of ours called Michael Redmond, you know Michael Redmond."
Wonderful comedian.

NARRATOR:
"In the supermarket, we found a cafe... with friendly staff and pleasant, inexpensive food... but there was no sign of anyone writing poetry."
"At Ikea, the restaurant also seemed promising... though it had given up selling wine and beer... but the atmosphere was disappointing... tainted by the ill humour that so often accompanies questions of interior design."
We had hoped to visit the restaurant at Wembley Stadium... a design of Owen Williams... but we could not get in.
"In Ealing Road, Wembley, Robinson finally found... the city life he'd been looking for."
"And he spent the day there... working in the cafes, reading, and writing in his notebooks."
"The next day, we reached Hanger Lane... and the river left the North Circular, flowing west... alongside Western Avenue."
"At Perivale, the river left the road and we followed it."
As we moved away from the main thoroughfares... there were fewer people about.
We found ourselves on the edge of a large area of open space... much of it without specific use.

NARRATOR:
"At the golf course, one of several... he imagined a reform of the game to make it more artistic."

NARRATOR:
"Beyond Hanwell, the river is navigable... from the point at which it meets the Grand Union Canal... at the edge of the open land surrounding Osterley Park."
For all his talk about the city...
I had the idea that Robinson really felt at home here.
"At Boston Manor, we sat outside in the gardens."
And he recalled the days he used to spend wandering in the outskirts of the city... always longing to escape.
He told me the story of Baudelaire's journey to Mauritius... and of the lifelong impression three weeks there made on him.
He told me of his desire to be nomadic... and of his melancholy for all the people in the world... their ways of life and their inventions... swept away by violence and trade.
"In the evening, we reached Brentford Basin where we heard music in the distance."
[Men singing in the distance]
NARRATOR:
"It was our companions, Carlos and Aquiles... who were living in a houseboat there."
We stayed with them for several days which we spend walking by the river.

I had a fight with Dawlat
"That's not new, you always fight"
She kicked me out of the house
"She's crazy, but kind"
Did you make a big mistake this time?
"I lost her ring, I'm willing to get her a better ring"
"No, Zaki, that's shameful"
"A woman can forget her lover, her husband, her father but her jewelry, never"
What if I told you that she's been plotting to kick me out?
- To do what with the apartment?
- She'll take it for herself
- Then what'll she do with it?
"- She'll give it to her children but when I die, Dawlat will inherit everything"
- She's my only heiress
- She's older than you she can die first and you'll inherit her
"In that case, her kids will inherit her share"
I don't know why she's doing that?
I don't see things that way at all
"She's probably calmed down by now, I'll call her... and everything will be fine"
"Don't trouble yourself, I know her well"
"Shall we bet a bottle of ""Black Horse""?"
I'll talk to her
"You're at e.A. Laney high school?"""
"Sometimes, in the schoolyard, when you're playing,"
"Sometimes, in the schoolyard, when you're playing, you spin a pass, and I did that once, just taking it out, and he gave me one of those."
"""Mike, maybe in the schoolyard, at Jersey city you throw those passes, but not here."""
"So, I never did that again."
"""2:31, you're going to be doing this drill, and then at 2:33, you're going to do this drill."""
It was all about commitment to the oneness.

Dean Smith's journey to chapel hill began soon after north Carolina won its first college basketball national championship in 1957.
"That group of tar heels went through the season undefeated at 32-0 with a starting five made up entirely of yankee interlopers, new yorkers who had followed new yorkers who had followed the legendary coach frank mcguire from up north."
And I was enamored with coach mcguire.
I just thought the world revolved around him.
"He could walk in a room, you know, with a thousand people, and he would be the only person you noticed."
He just had that special quality about him.
"Mcguire spent nine seasons at Carolina, but by 1961, he wore out his welcome when the tar heels were found guilty when the tar heels were found guilty of multiple ncaa violations."
"The man chosen to replace him was a little-known mcguire assistant,"
30-year-old Dean Smith.
"Because of the basketball scandal, when Dean took over, we were limited to 16 games."
We were limited to where we could recruit.
"So, instead of being able to recruit nationally, it was just strictly in the acc area."
It was just strictly in the acc area.
"So, coach Smith was really handcuffed right from the beginning."
The first few years of Dean Smith's career at north Carolina did not go well.
"Despite having several all-American players including Larry brown and Billy Cunningham, the tar heels were just an average team in the acc, and by the middle of his fourth season, some of the impatient fans were getting angry."
Some of the impatient fans were getting angry.

This is Loch Leven in Perthshire.
"In 1567, it was at the centre of some of the most turbulent events"
Scotland had ever known.
"On a little island in the middle of the loch, kept as a prisoner, was a young woman."
"24-year-old Mary Stuart,"
Queen of Scots.
On their way to the island was a small group of powerful nobles intent on stripping the queen of her crown.
"When the nobles arrived here, they were brandishing documents they wanted Mary to sign and they were prepared to use force and threats to her life to get their way."
"They saw themselves as the saviours of Scotland, and she was the obstacle in their path."
"But Mary refused to co-operate, because she knew that with one scratch of the pen, she would cease to be queen."
Mary and the nobles held radically different visions of the nation's future.
And Scotland stood divided.
"From that moment, on this loch, an incredible transformation will take place that will not only see Scotland united, but a Scottish king ruling the entire British Isles."
The ambition of an unconquered nation and its royal family will be the driving force that unites two ancient enemies and sets them on the road towards the Great Britain we know today.
A Scottish takeover of England?
Who would dare dream of such a thing?
"In 1542, Scotland 's fate came to rest on the shoulders of a six-day-old girl, when its king, James V, died."
"His daughter, Mary Stuart, was the last of the great Scottish royal line - a child of glittering dynastic potential."
"And almost immediately, the coveted prize of an English king."
Infant Mary was the solution to a very English problem.
"Henry VIII had fallen out with other countries in Europe, over religion."
"He'd broken with the Catholic Church, and now England was vulnerable to invasion."
"Henry's worst fear was that a hostile army would be allowed to land in Scotland a no' from there, launch itself into northern England."
"England's king, Henry VIII, was an arch strategist and he came up with a remarkable course of action."
He would kill off the threat from the north by marrying the Queen of Scots to his own son.
"And by doing that, Scotland would become part of England."
A group of Scottish nobles were seduced by Henry's scheme and even signed a marriage treaty on Mary's behalf.
"But Mary's guardians backed out, which brought Scotland and England once again to the brink of war."
"Young Mary was forced to run from one castle to another, as Henry sent soldiers to hunt her down and bring her to him."
"When they couldn't find her, the English generals decided on a new tactic."
"Lo and behold, we drive up, and coach saw the same qualities I saw."
Dean Smith had made up his mind.
It was time to put the full-court press on racism.
"Coach Smith, the first thing he asked me was what did I want to be called, and I said ""well, my mother named me Charles."""
"That's what coach Smith always called me, ""Charles."""
"He never called me ""Charlie,"" he always called me ""Charles."""
"And also something that he did and also something that he did a little different than everybody else was that he had me go out with the freshmen on the team, who would be guys that I would be playing with"
"when I got to school there, and there was a friendliness there that I felt comfortable around."
"The real topper was that I visited Carolina, they had smokey Robinson and the miracles and the temptations, and I thought any school that had smokey Robinson and the miracles and the temptations was a school I can enjoy being at."
"The educational foundation, obviously, means a great deal to our basketball team, in particular."
"Means a great deal to our basketball team, in particular."
"Obviously, the scholarship money comes from this group of individuals, and we couldn't have fine players in the university without scholarships."
"In 1966, Smith used one of those scholarships on Charles Scott, the first African-American athlete to receive one at north Carolina."
"And, by his sophomore year, Scott was already a star."
"And, by his sophomore year, Scott was already a star."
"But, to Dean Smith, Charles was just another player."
His relationship was one that I felt comfortable with as someone that would take care of me and mentor me.
And not only that --
Never once did the conversation come up about me being black.
Coach Smith never talked to me about color.
"One day, I was late for practice."
"One day, I was late for practice."
He told me to go run the stairs.
"So, I was running the stairs, and I was running the stairs, and, about 25 minutes, I was still running the stairs."
I had to ask him -
"- I said, ""coach Smith, did you see me?"""
"He said, ""oh, I forgot you were running the stairs,"""
"and I said, ""how could you forget the only black guy you got on your team?"
"Didn't you not know that one black spot wasn't on the court anymore?"""
"With Scott and other all-Americans, like Larry Miller, north Carolina was in the middle of three straight final four appearances."
In the middle of three straight final four appearances.
"As for Smith, he was entering a three-decade period of sustained excellence where his unique, homespun basketball innovations were on full display."
The son of Chang Tsui San of wu Dong School why have you brought someone from wu Dong?
Don't you know I never help anyone from other schools?

The Freezing Palm?
Yes
I think you should let him go or you'll be in embarrassment what do you mean?

I have never seen you heal such a kind of injury
"If you should fail, it's better to let him go now"

How come you couldn't be healed?
"You've done your best, it's okay"
"The freezing poison has reached your heart and it's difficult to cure, also that Monk has forced it deep into your meridians"
You'll never rid yourself of the poisons in your life
Your condition will fluctuate between good and bad
I can only extend your life for a few years that's the best I can do
In that case...how many years do I still have?

This morning a band of four men armed with pistols and shotguns
Assaulted a Bancasa agency located in the Plaza del Campanar
The Bank's security guard opened fire
And was instantly killed by a point blank shot
From one of the assaulter's shotguns
"Well, they looked very young"
One of them had a moustache
And was wearing sunglasses
The others had their faces covered with ski masks
One of the was blue eyed
"For their voice, they seemed young"
Once the police was told and came to the place
A shooting started
"One of the shots reached Sebastian Ruiz 19 years old, usual delinquent who died instantly"
"A bystander, Consuelo Martinez, 52, was also reached by a shot and her condition is critical"
In spite of the fast reaction by the police
The robbers managed to escape with the money
Which sums several millions
"Horrendous, it was horrendous"
It's terrible not to know where to go
They were moving all around the place
I say that's enough terrorism We want to live in peace
This is unbereable this can't go on like that
This son of a bitch doesn't come back
What a wait!

"However, we need those two bubbles to keep the rope, the wire, the cable... whatever it is... in a fixed position."
"So, here is the crane's arm with a hook."
Let's attach it back to the cabin.
Congratulations again.
We have made the crane.
The crane will look much better and have much more use if we put the crane on a base.
"So, let's make a base."
Inflate a balloon
leaving about three inch flat tail.
Twist a chain of four about...two inch size bubbles.
Lock both ends of the chain of the first four bubbles in one lock twist.
The rest of the balloon we split aah...to make four about seven inch size bubbles.
Twist the fifth seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the fifth bubble between the first and the second bubbles.
Twist the sixth seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the sixth bubble between the second and the third bubble.
Twist the seventh seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh bubble between the third and the fourth bubble.
If you properly measured previous bubbles then the rest of the balloon is the eighth seven inch bubble.
It's OK if we make eighth bubble of different size.
Lock the free end of the eighth bubble between the fourth and the first bubble.
Congratulations.
We have made the base for the crane.
Our next step is obvious.
We attach the crane tower to the base.
There are four ends at the bottom of the tower.
We tie each end to the appropriate spot between bubbles of the base.
"Again, if you made a different size eighth bubble of the base, then you want to place the eighth bubble of the base on the front or on the back side of the crane."
"Congratulations, we have made the crane on the base."
Let's just fix all bubbles in proper positions.
The structure of crane base allowed us to convert the crane to sort of a mobile crane.
Simply adjust position of the sides of the base to make two wheels mobile crane.

So you believe that Emily had epilepsy... ...which developed into a form of violent psychosis... ...a condition that can be controlled with Gambutrol?
Yes.
"And it would've been, if she'd continued her treatment."
"In your opinion, if Emily had continued with her medication... ...would she be alive today?"
- Absolutely.
"If treated early, psychotic epileptic disorder is rarely fatal."
"I mean, this..."
This was a very sick girl.
The defendant should've realized that Emily was in need... ...of continued medical treatment.
"Thank you, doctor."
Your witness.
"Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol could've controlled Emily's condition."
How do you know that?
It's the inevitable result of taking the drug.
It would've controlled her seizures... ...which were the root cause of her psychosis.
But wasn't Emily still experiencing psychotic symptoms... ...even after she started taking the medication?
Yes.
Because Gambutrol has a cumulative effect.
It takes time to build up in the system.
"You assume that Gambutrol would've helped her, but you don't know."
"It's a reasonable assumption, but..."
"No, of course, I can't be certain."
"Doctor, is ""psychotic epileptic disorder"" a common medical term... ...or did you just make it up?"
"Well, I distinguished and named the..."
So psychotic epileptic disorder is really your own pet theory?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
- Sustained.
When Emily chose to stop her medical treatment... ...what do you think should've been done?
"Come on, you know, representing sets of integers, this is pretty dumb."
Suppose I want to have a set of characters.
How could I do that?
"Well the idea of a hash, in fact, what's called a hash function is to have some way of mapping any kind of data into integers."
"So let's look at the second example, all right, -- I keep doing that -- this piece of code from here to here gives me a way of now creating a hash table of size 256."
Ord as a built in python representation.
There is lots of them around that takes any character and gives you back an integer.
"In fact, just to show that to you, if I go down here and I type ord, sorry, I did that wrong."
Let me try again.
We'll get to exceptions in a second.
I give it some character.
It gives me back an integer representing.
It looks weird.
Why is three come back to some other thing?
That's the internal representation that python uses for this.
"If I give it some other character, yeah, it would help if I could type, give it some other character."
It gives me back a representation.
So now here's the idea.
"I build a list 256 elements long, and I fill it up with those special characters none."
That's what create is going to do right here.
"And then hash character takes in any string or character, single character, gives me back a number."
Notice what I do.
"If I want to create a set or a sequence representing these things, I simply insert into that list."
It goes through and puts ones in the right place.
"And then, if I want to find out if something's there,"
I do the same thing.
"But notice now, hash is converting the input into an integer."
"So, what's the idea?"
"If I know what my hash function does, it maps, in this case characters into a range zero to 256, which is zero to 255,"
"I create a list that long, and I simply mark things."
And my look up is still constant.
Characters are simple.
Which blueprint they follow depends on the weather.
"If their pond remains full... the harmless small heads dominate, feeding on plankton."
"But if the summer rains fail, a shrinking pond means more big heads."
"Armed with curved teeth and strong jaws, the big heads feast on the defenseless plankton eaters."
The big heads become so bloated they can barely swim.
But this is gluttony with a purpose.
"As the drought worsens, the pond shrinks."
And the explosive growth of the cannibals pays off.
Skin toughens.
Gills disappear.
Lungs grow.
The bigheads are air-breathing adults.

There are two layers of fur-- a soft undercoat; and guard hairs up to 6 inches long.
"The fur, coupled with a thick layer of fat, is such an efficient insulator that a bear loses little heat."
"Look through an infrared thermal imaging camera, and a polar bear is almost invisible, appearing little warmer than the frozen land."
"Wrapped in the ultimate survival suit, males spend their lives exposed to the elements."
Pregnant females use a different strategy.
"At the start of winter, they disappear--underground."
"Outside, a male wanders far in search of food."
"Inside, a female travels through time."
She slows her metabolism and sleeps.
"Oh, no."""
I'll happily trade off some FDP upload time for manage dependencies.
- OK.
Two comments on that.
"Most embedding framework,"
I would encourage you to embed a jar version of the frameworks.
"If you look at since 5.2, I think."
"You can actually jar your framework, and they would work just the same."
"You can just dump them in your application in content extensions, and they're going to get loaded exactly like any other framework."
"It's very compact, it works really well."
You cannot [indecipherable] jar.
You can have flat jars which are the same.
"The other comment that I would say on the size of the app, is that gziped your app, before you upload them, you will save more time."
"It's incredible, I have seen so many people trying to upload a .woa not zipped."
It takes forever because the protocol are usually very inefficient on starting and stopping files.
"You are going to upload hundreds of small, tiny files, which is crazy."
- Yes
"- gzip's them, you'll be surprised you can save one, if not two order of magnitude in the upload."
"- If I can continue with that, once you have zipped it and put it up once, use RSync to sync it after that, because then you only move differences."
- Don't do that.
The reason you should not do that is because you will have a running app on the old version.
"If you have multiple instances, you really should upload it into a different folder and do a version swap so you have..."
"- To be clear, you should shut down the production site prior..."
"- No, no."
You don't want to shut down the production site.
You want to keep it running.
"- You just Rsynching the zip file, not the app."
- Then you have to unzip it on the server.
"- No, you're proposing unzipping the WOA, I think."
"- I was Rsynching the WOA, right?"
But I shut down the site.
- If you don't want to shut down your production site and you don't want to be replacing your WOA in line.
Hypersensitives are born different from everyone else.
"They can have visions of the future, or see the dead... ...and sometimes be uniquely susceptible... ...to invasion by an entity that is alien to them."
Objection.
On what grounds?
"How about silliness, Your Honor?"
A young girl suffered terribly and died.
Do we have to subject her illness to this pseudoscientific analysis?
"Both counselors, please approach the bench."
"Your Honor, this testimony is beyond ridiculous."
Visions...
Supernatural belief systems are shared by millions of people.
We're in *The Twilight Zone* here.
Her expertise is relevant to the issues in this case.
Let's have a witch doctor sift through bones...
Stop.
We've heard a great deal of testimony... ...in support of a medical explanation for Emily's condition.
Now we have a witness who has spent her career... ...studying the defense's alternative explanation.
"An exorcism expert, if you will."
I think we'll hear what she has to say.
"Thank you, Your Honor."
"Dr. Adani, why do you think Emily's exorcism failed?"
The medical treatment.
"Specifically, the drug Gambutrol."
Please explain.
The exorcism ritual results in a specific brain activity... ...that cuts the person off from the possession experience.
But Emily's exorcism could not have achieved this... ...because the doctor gave her Gambutrol... ...which has an intoxicating effect on the brain.
The drug made her immune to the psycho-spiritual shock... ...that exorcism is intended to provide.
What do you believe was the result of treatment with this intoxicating drug?
Gambutrol locked Emily in the possessed state.
"This left her unable to respond to the exorcism... ...and therefore, it directly contributed to her death."
"Thank you, doctor."
No further questions.
Dr:
Yes.
S:
Fascinating.
"The people who are dying of heart disease, is it the cholesterol that's killing them or the inflammation?"
Dr:
I think it's a chicken-and-the-egg phenomenon where the inflammation allows the cholesterol to deposit; and they go together.
S:
"It's really the statins affect inflammation, which then reduces cancer by stopping the inflammation."
Dr:
Exactly.
One of the problems we have in Biology and Medicine is what you can measure.
"So, I can measure cholesterol."
I don't really know how to measure inflammation well.
"So while we can make these associations in big studies where we look back, if I had a metric, a blood test or something to look at for inflammation, I could optimize this."
S:
Can you not just measure the amount of cytokines or other inflammatory types of things?
Dr:
There are different types of inflammation.
"So, some inflammation can be good, some can be bad."
"Some can be really causal, some can be a little causal."
"So we're putting them all into one basket now, which is inflammation, the key is to start to tease them out, and be able to modulate them."
"You can develop a drug, but then you would have to optimize it for a particular purpose."
"So, these were optimized to lower cholesterol."
They do that very well.
"It also lowers inflammation, and they work beautifully in that regard."
But how do we optimize that going forward?
"It also means that when you look at your lifestyle and my lifestyle, we have to limit inflammation."
"So, what are the easy ways to do that?"
"One is, which I think should be mandatory, is things like the flu shot."
"So again, the flu shot will certainly delay you from having or prevent you from having a bad flu..."
S:
"Suppose you want to represent sets of strings, well you basically just generalize the hash function."
I think one of the classic ones for strings is called the
Rabin-Karp algorithm.
And it's simply the same idea that you have a mapping from your import into a set of integers.
"Wow, OK, maybe not so wow, but this is now constant."
This is constant time access.
So I can do searching in constant time which is great.
Where's the penalty?
What did I trade off here?
Well I'm going to suggest that what I did was I really traded space for time.
It makes me sound like an astro physicist somehow right?
What do I mean by that?
"I have constant time access which is great, but I paid a price, which is I had to use up some space."
In the case of integers it was easy.
"In the case of characters, so I have to give up a"
"list of 256, no big deal."
Imagine now you want to do faces.
"You've got a picture of somebody's face, it's a million pixels."
Each pixel has a range of values from zero to 256.
I want to hash a face with some function into an integer.
"I may not want to do the full range of this, but I may decide I have to use a lot of gigabytes of space in order to do a trade off."
"The reason I'm showing you this is it that this is a gain, a common trade off in computer science."
"That in many cases, I can gain efficiency if I'm willing to give up space."
"Having said that though, there may still be a problem, or there ought to be a problem that may be bugging you slightly, which is how do I guarantee that my hash function takes any input into exactly one spot in the storage space?"
She give any reason for discontinuing these appointments?
"Yes, she told me she was convinced that her condition was a spiritual one."
"It was the conviction of her priest, she said, and she shared his beliefs."
Was it your impression that Emily had placed her care... ...entirely..?
- Leading the witness.
Sustained.
After the end of October... ...did you ask Emily why she had stopped... ...filling her Gambutrol prescriptions?
Yes.
"It's a strong contingency to natural chemicals, more toxic chemicals are natural chemicals."
Which mother would give cancer to her child?
"When we are romanticizing nature, we are putting us down, because the mother is good, so the child is bad."
"So, there is no ""Mother Earth""."
"We can learn from nature; it's a partnership, it's learning, it's being proud of our own qualities as well."
Our natural lifetime expectancy is 30 years.
"When we get older, it's our creativity, it's our civilization, it's our science, it's our industry, it's our medicine."
"So, we don't need to talk about ""Mother Earth""."
"A mother would not have a girl losing her leg, just by biting."
No.
"So, there is no reason to romanticize nature, because when we romanticize nature, we always feel guilty."
"And out of guilt, we are not creative,"
"Out of guilt, you cannot develop new things."
"So, it's about becoming native to this planet."
Why do we delegate being native to the Yanomamis?
We are the native people of this planet.
Why do we delegate being in harmony with nature to Aborigines?
We are the aborigines of the planet.
We are the natives of this planet.
"If we don't learn to become natives to this planet, then, we will destroy each other."
"For example, we talk about overpopulation, you could see the curve of overpopulation."
The weight of ants; it's about to four times more than of all human beings.
"And because ants don't make waste; because ants live only three to six months, because ants never take elevators, they are equal to 30 billion people in their calories consumption."
"So, we are not too many, we are just stupid, we make waste."
"Even when we think about ""zero waste"", we think about waste."
"It's the same thing, when I tells you, ""Don't think about the pink crocodile!"""
We think about the pink crocodile.
But nature doesn't think about waste.
Nature only makes stuff for biological cycles.
So we can learn from nature.
But we do not just live.
"We like washing machines, we like computers."
"I have some trauma or an injury, but I might have to run away from a lion tomorrow."
"So fix-fix-fix Sal now or fix David up so he can run away from a lion tomorrow, but in the wild I might not have lived to 40 anyway."
So why even worry about whether that person might get cancer if they get to 40 or 50?
Once they're past the point of reproduction.
Dr:
"Right, the body has to choose priorities."
The priority is today rather than tomorrow.
"An amazing study was done where we gave patients what we call a ""statin""."
Statins are drugs that were developed to block the synthesis of cholesterol.
"We thought, you know, people with higher cholesterol--particularly the bad one, LDL--those people have a higher incidence of heart disease."
"So, if we block the synthesis, we're going to affect heart disease."
What do you know?
We did!
A dramatic effect:
We lowered the death from heart disease with these drugs.
S: so it seems like they worked!
Dr:
Right.
"Then a company, or a very clever group did a trial where they gave people with normal cholesterol these drugs."
"It also had a dramatic effect, in that it delayed heart attack and stroke by almost a dozen years,"
Wow and it reduced the incidence of cancer by about 40%.
S:
"So cancer, something we don't normally associate with cholesterol."
Dr:
"So it turns out these drugs, which are the biggest drugs in terms of sells we ever had, worked by lowering inflammation."
"So the affected heart disease wasn't by lowering cholesterol, it was predominantly by lowering inflammation."
And the affect on cancer was by lowering inflammation.
"In fact, remember when the swine flu came out a couple of years ago?"
"If you got the swine flu, the only thing that protected you from your lungs collapsing going on what we call a ventilator, a breathing machine, was being on one of these statins."
S:
Because it would stop the inflammation.
"Because with swine flu, people were dying from inflammation going nuts."
And let's say its mass is 500 grams.
And let's say that I can accelerate this vehicle at an acceleration of-- I don't know-- 3 centimeters per second squared.
What's the force that I need to apply to this mass to accelerate it at this speed?
And we want the answer in Newton's.
So what's the force?
So we're just going to use Newton's second law and
Newton's second law tells us force is equal to mass times acceleration.
"So you might want to, or you might be tempted just to multiply mass times acceleration and you'd get force is equal to-- let's see, 500 grams times 3 centimeters per second squared."
"And you would get force is equal to 1,500 gram centimeters per second squared."
"And if you did this, you would be right."
"Although your answer would not be in Newtons and now you would have to somehow, try to convert this set of units to Newtons."
And what are Newtons?
"Well we learned when we did Newton's laws that a Newton, so 1 Newton is equal to 1 kilogram meter per second squared."
So somehow we have to convert the gram to kilograms and we have to convert the centimeters to meters.
"We could do it after the fact here, or what I find it easier to do is actually to convert the mass and the acceleration units first and then just do the F equals ma."
So what's 500 grams in kilograms?
"Well 500 grams is half-- well, a kilogram as a thousand grams."
So 500 is going to be half a kilogram.
"1 kilogram is a thousand grams, so 0.5 kilograms is 500 grams."
"Similarly, 3 centimeters is how many meters?"
"Well, 1 meter is 300-- sorry."
I think I'm dehydrated.
"1 meter is a hundred centimeters, right?"
So 3 centimeters is 0.03 meters per second squared.
Hopefully this make sense to you.
3 centimeters is 0.03 meters.
And now we already.
We have our mass in kilograms and we have our acceleration in meters per second squared.
"And if this is confusing, you should watch the unit videos because this is all I'm doing; I'm just doing unit conversion."
So let's go back to force equals mass times acceleration.
"So the force was equal to 0.5 kilograms times the acceleration, which is 0.03 meters per second squared."
And this equals--
"We cannot make energy saving window without toxic materials in it, otherwise it doesn't work."
"So, this means to reinvent our materials to go into technical cycles."
"So, we now make washing machines where you can wash just 3000 times."
"We now make materials which can go into technical cycles, and biological cycles."
But this means reinventing  everything you see in front of you.
"We don't need to say, ""Oh, I'm so sorry to be here."""
"We can say, ""Hey, we are not good enough."
"Our design is not good enough  because it makes toxic waste."""
"Now, we try to minimize our footprint but we reach the opposite"
"We are making the wrong thing perfect, and by that, they are perfectly wrong."
"When we send these things to recycling, we only contaminate the biological system."
Because it was never designed for recycling.
"The design that you do is so important, but right now this design is amazingly primitive."
"Look, I became a designer."
"You can see when you look in the internet, you find I'm designing materials,"
"I'm designing materials like washing machines that only do five thousand loads of washing,"
But this is because the designers don't do their job.
I'm designing edible fabrics.
What we do see here?
"Stinking PVC, never designed for human beings."
Destroying fertility.
The whole system is very primitive.
That means that we need to reinvent all our materials again.
This is the amount of diapers which one baby makes in one year.
"In Europe, 20% of all waste stream in households are diapers."
"And, because they get older, the diapers get bigger."
There is some potential in it.
"A baby takes about 7,500 diapers."
"If we could make diapers for babies, which allow them to go into biological systems, if we change the soap absorbents and the plastics, we could grow with one baby,  150 trees, just with one baby."
So this baby could be carbon positive from the beginning.
"It's really carbon positive, not carbon neutral."
"With learning how to use the sun, we can reinvent everything to go back into technical systems and biological systems."
How did we do code review?
How did you earn your authority?
There was nothing quite like it before.
When we started the foundation we remade ourselves over again.
"We were, as I said, a small number of people, we made a bet on a new product that was Firefox."
We didn't have a product to ship at that time.
"And Asa with our community involvement continued to ship the Mozilla suite for fifteen months, as the only product we had in the marketplace until Firefox was ready."
"We made that bet, which is a scary bet."
"Imagine not to have a browser,"
I mean we didn't have a person working on the product we were shipping.
But we did that because we knew that Firefox was our opportunity to make a commercial product.
Our first five or six years of life taught us that technology alone will not change the industry the way we want to.
Technology alone does not change people's lives the way we want to do that.
Our opportunity with the browser is to have a product that touches people.
Yeah.
[Question]
Yeah.
So that's where I'm trying to get to.
"That technology alone is not enough, that raw power of technology is not enough, that if you really want to touch people, not us, not power users, not developers but if you want to touch consumers and change their lives, you have to be utterly committed to that."
You can't build the features that you want just because you want them.
You can't tell people:
"""Oh, you should behave this way, you should want to be this way."""
You have to build the product that is elegant and beautiful and powerful under the covers but that people love.
That was the first thing.
That is a big change.
Many open source projects never make that change.
I started calling it the tyranny of the product.
If you are serious about wanting to touch hundreds of millions of people you have to be committed to those hundreds of millions of people.
"You can't just think they're stupid, or they don't understand."
You have to really be committed to making their lives better.
So that's what Firefox do.
"So we didn't rewrite all these switches, and all the preferences the way our first product had."
"Now, the next thing we have to do is that we've got to relate this probability of backscattering."
We are going to have to relate it to the diameter of those nuclei.
How do we do that?
"Well, the probability of a particle backscattering is simply going to be the total area of this crystal, there's our crystal, the total area of this."
"Now, you've got to ignore these aluminum blocks here because this piece of equipment comes from my laboratory."
And I pressed it into service for this demonstration.
This has nothing to do with the demo that we're going to put here.
It's just structural because this is my manipulator puller-outer from our machine.
"So you've got to ignore those, but that whole area there is equal to 2,148 square inches."
And now the probability of that backscattering is this total area of the nuclei to the total area of the crystal.
"And the total area of the nuclei then is just the sum over all nuclei, and there are 119 of them here."
So i=1 to 119 of the area of each one of the nuclei.
"And so that is just 119 times the cross-sectional area of these nuclei actually, which is pi d squared over 4, and this is all over 2,148."
That's the probability.
This is the diameter of the nuclei.
And now I am going to rearrange that and solve for the diameter.
And when I do that I get 4.79 times P to the one half.
"If I measure the probability of backscattering by this, measuring the number of backscattered balls over the total number we throw at it, then I can calculate the diameter of the nuclei, the diameter of those Styrofoam balls."
That is the idea.
"Now, you're going to do this experiment."
And so now the TAs are going to give you all a ping-pong ball or two.
Come on.
We need to distribute the ping-pong balls.
Here's the deal.
What you have to do is you have to aim to hit this lattice.
That's all you've got to do.
"Then you have to watch your ball, and you have to see if it scatters back to you."
"Now, what doesn't count is if you hit these steel bars and it scatters back."
"That doesn't count, okay?"
It also doesn't count if the ball hits the Styrofoam but it continues going in that direction.
Your ping-pong ball has to actually scatter back at you to count.
"And then, when we get all done, I am going to ask whose ball backscattered."
"We're gonna start off by playing some kerbals space program then continue to outlast, so join the fun."

"Hello, my name is Maryanne."
And my name is Ashley.
We are seniors here at Western illinois University.
Majoring in Instructional Design and Technology.
"Also, known as IDT."
Something I really enjoy about our majors the opportunity to be working with the latest technology.
"As well as, experience such diverse and unique careers depending on what we want to do and where we want to go."
"In the IDT field you can focus your future working with government, business, health, military or the educational setting."
It really has no limit where you want to extend this career.
IDT involves learning to use technology to effectively design training and educational material.
Did you know that IDT department is just one of the few departments in the nation?
"In fact, we are the only school in the Midwest to offer a bachelors degree in IDT."
"Also, in the Chicago area alone there is 141 job offerings."
Let's talk about what this field can offer for your future career opportunities.
As Maryanne mentioned before the IDT department offers a variety of career opportunities that are diverse.
"You can pursue careers in government, heath, business, military and educational setting."
These are a few companies that our previous graduates had the opportunity to work with.
Our IDT department offers hands-on learning lesson and experiences from highly world dedicated professors.
"Why don't you take a moment to take a look at the IDT see all the different resources, as well as, the two options of study our department has to offer."
I choose the medium web base development option.
The section of study I love the formal based learning with focus of online course development.
And I choose the games and simulation option.
This option of study is a learn by doing approach.
"*The FBI with the help of local police agencies, systematically fed false accusations and fake news articles to the press *"
*accusing me and other activists of crimes we did not commit. *
"*Although in my case the charges were eventually dropped, or I was eventually acquitted, *"
"*the national and local police agencies created a situation where based on their false accusations against me, *"
*any police officer could shoot me on sight. *
*It was not until the Freedom of Information Act was passed in the mid-70's *
*that we began to see the scope of the United States governments' persecution of political activists.*
"*At this point, I think that it is important to make one thing very clear. *"
*I have advocated and I still advocate revolutionary changes in the structure and in the principles that govern the United States *
"*I advocate self determination for my people, and for all oppressed people inside the United States. *"
"*I advocate an end to capitalist exploitation, *"
"*the abolition of racist policies, *"
*the eradication of sexism and the elimination of political repression. *
"*If that is a crime, then I am totally guilty.*"
"*To make a long story short, I was captured in New Jersey in 1973, *"
"*after being shot with both arms held in the air, and then shot again from the back. *"
"*I was left on the ground to die and when I did not, *"
"*I was taken to a local hospital where I was threatened, beaten and tortured. *"
*In 1977 I was convicted in a trial that can only be described as a legal lynching.*
*In 1979 I was able to escape with the aid of some of my fellow comrades. *
"*I saw this as a necessary step, not only because I was innocent of the charges against me, *"
*but because I knew that in the racist legal system in the United States I would receive no justice. *
*I was also afraid that I would be murdered in prison. *
*I later arrived in Cuba where I am currently living in exile as a political refugee.*
"*The New Jersey State Police and other law enforcement officials say they want to see me brought to ""justice"". *"
"*But I would like to know what they mean by ""justice."" *"
*Is torture justice? *
"*I was kept in solitary confinement for more than two years, mostly in men's prisons. *"
*Is that justice? *
*My lawyers were threatened with imprisonment and imprisoned. *
*Is that justice? *
"*I was tried by an all-white jury, without even the pretext of impartiality, *"
That's why we try to reduce our footprint.
Maybe you know this joke;
"One planet meets another planet, and says, ""You really look terrible today""."
"And the other planet says, ""Yes, I have Homo sapiens""."
"The first planet answers,"
"""Don't worry, I had this before;  it will disappear somehow""."
"We feel so bad, we think it's better we are not here."
"With all these environmental disasters, we lost a whole generation of good scientists."
"We have lots of smart MBA's, we have brilliant lawyers, but we don't have enough engineers."
"We don't have enough good scientists because how can you study chemistry, when you see Bhopal?"
"How can you study physics, when you see Chernobyl?"
And the one who studies to be a scientist did with a bad conscience..
"So that's why they try to be ""less bad""."
He apologizes everyday for being here.
That's the reasons that we're trying to minimize our footprint.
"We walk, and when we are in Sweden, for example, your footprint means destruction, that's why people try to minimize their footprint."
"But, when you are here, your footprint means the water stays longer."
"So why do we want to minimize our footprint, when we can have a beneficial footprint?"
So we can make things completely differently.
But this is what we do.
"Here, it stinks, this is PVC."
Never designed to go in biological systems.
"This is our catalog, it stinks; never designed for toilet paper."
It's hazardous waste.
"We need to reinvent our products, and the products need to look different, completely different."
"Everything that gets consumed; food, detergents, backpacks, need to be designed to grow up into biological systems."
Everything that is just used as a service needs to go back to the technical system.
"You cannot consume a window, you don't consume a washing machine, you don't consume a TV set, you only use it."
"So, we need to distinguish between two different cycles."
"Things which get consumed, like shoe soles, need to be designed to go to biological systems."
"Things which are just used, like the washing machine, need to be designed for the technical cycle, but right now,  they are just hazardous waste."
"So, we need to reinvent our products, completely from the beginning."
Let's do one more.
I think that's all I have time for.
Let's do minus one ninth minus one over four.
Well the least common multiple of nine and four is thirty-six.
So that's equal to thirty-six.
So what's negative one ninth where we change the denominator from nine to thirty-six?
"Well, we multiply nine times four to get thirty-six."
We have to multiply the numerator times four as well.
"So we have negative one, so it becomes negative four."
Then minus one over thirty-six.
"Well to go from four to thirty-six, we have to multiply this fraction by nine, or we have to multiply the denominator by nine, so you also have to multiply the numerator by nine."
One times nine is nine.
"So this equals minus four minus nine over thirty-six, which equals minus thirteen over thirty-six."
I think that's all I have time for right now.
And I'll probably add a couple more modules.
But I think that right now that you might be ready to do the adding and subtracting module.
Have fun.
Now we are ready to begin talking about actual program optimizations and we begin with local optimizations.
"Local optimization is the simplest form of program optimization because it focuses on optimizing just a single basic block, so just one basic block and, in particular, there is no need worry about complicated control flow, we are not going to be looking at the entire method or procedure body."
Let's dive right in and take a look at a couple of simple local optimizations.
"If x is an integer valued variable And from here on, we'll assume that x has type-ins."
So let me just write that down.
We're going to assume that x has type-ins in all of our examples on this slide.
"Then the statement x=x+0, well that doesn't change the value of x."
Zero is the additive identity for +.
We're just going to assign x the value it currently has.
And so this statement is actually useless.
It can just be deleted from the program.
"Similarly, for x=x*1."
"Multiplying by one will not change the value of X, and so that statement can also be removed."
And in this case these are great optimizations because we actually save an entire instruction.
"Now, some statements can't be deleted, but they can be simplified."
He's going to drive down the price even more.
You can see it over here.
"If they increase quantity beyond this market quantity of 75, 37.5 each, if we go beyond that, the price that they would be selling at, at that quantity over there, is lower than the average total cost."
"You're going to be, the total economic, the average economic profit per unit is going to be negative."
There will be a total of negative economic profit.
Neither of them will want to produce more from this state either.
"All of a sudden in this topless state, holding others constant; if you hold A constant, B can't gain by changing his strategy, and if you hold B constant"
"A can't gain by changing his strategy, so we are, up here, in a Nash equilibrium."
This is a Nash equilibrium.
"Like the prisoner's dilemma, it was not the optimal state."
"The optimal state was here, but because they both wanted to cheat, they both wanted to do this one-upmanship, they both broke their contracts, they could end up in this state over here."
But this state is stable.
There's nothing holding the other party equal.
"There's nothing that they could do to change, to optimize."
"What they could do, and this is not what Nash applies to, they could say okay, we've been really ruining each others' business."
Let's go coordinate again and I'm going to decrease production if you decrease production.
"That is not, and they could maybe try to go back to this state, and that does not mean that this is not a Nash equilibrium because by coordinating again we're not holding the others constant."
We're saying I'm changing my strategy while you're changing your strategy.
Maybe only through another agreement they could go over here.
That still doesn't mean that this is not a Nash equilibrium.
This is a Nash equilibrium.
"If there's no coordination, if you hold one player constant, the other player cannot change their strategy, or change their production, for a gain."

We are from God and to him we return.
Put him on his back.
Cameraman:
These are the mercenaries.
"First man, out of shot:"
These are the people he is using to help him.
He's been shot in the chest.
Another man:
"They wanted to burn him, disfigure him."

"Hello, and welcome back to Introduction to Genetics and Evolution."
In the previous videos we looked at how to study the process of recombination.
And specifically how we can leverage recombination to actually map genes associated with diseases.
"And again, as I've said several times, we are looking for an association."
"Between alleles at markers, such as these hapmap SNP markers that we discussed, and a phenotype such as disease status."
That is essentially the what we're trying to do with genetic mapping.
"Now what we're gonna do in this video is, we're gonna actually try to map simple genetic traits."
So traits controlled by one gene that have a very large effect on that trait.
Relative to genetic markers [inaudible].
So.
We can actually use hat map markers just
like we use it for soft limitations in previous videos to map simple genetic [inaudible].
"So remember we did these problems using these three [inaudible] markers, a, b and c."
"And we did the case of the test cross with an individual that was heterozygous for all three, so it gave little a, big b, little b, big c, little c."
"Crossed to somebody who, who's homozygous."
"Little a, little a, little a, little b,"
"little c, little c, little c."
"Now we can imagine that A and B are snip markers with, you know, so they necessarily have two or more oleos, and that they have a known location in the genome."
Now what we can say now is maybe C is the disease gene.
"So what we're trying to actually do with a lot of genetic mapping, this isn't all of mapping but part of mapping, is to determine whether C, the diseased gene is between a certain pair of markers."
"And secondarily, about how far is it?"
"Like is it, for example, between A and B?"
"And if so, is it closer to A or is it closer to B?"
"Or is it off to one side, maybe out passed"
A and further away from B?
That is genetic mapping.
"So let's, let me illustrate this with an example."
I will be using concepts very much like what we did with [inaudible] mapping of genes.
Let's use cycle cell anemia.
"Now this disease is recessive, meaning you have to have two copies of the mutant type to exhibit the disease."
Go back over here to this side and I've got to make everything now consistent with what's going on there.
Okay.
"Let's start off with our constructor, which is a good place to make sure you get into a valid state."
"In this case, we're going to use the empty list so the head pointer points and tells us we have no cells whatsoever in the list."
"So we don't pre allocate anything, we don't get ready."
What's kind of nice with this linked list is to allocate on demand each individual cell that's asked to be added to the list.
The delete operation actually does show we need to do some work.
"I'm actually not going to implement it but I'm going to mention here that I would need to delete the entire list, which would involve, either iterates or recursion my way down to kind of do all the work."
And then I changed this from size to iterate.
I'd like to know if my list is empty.
"So I can just test for head is equal, equal to null."
If it's null we have no list.
Let me work on push before I work on pop.
I'll turn them around.
"The push operation is, make myself a new cell."
"All right, let's go through the steps for that."
New cell equals new cell
T. [Inaudible] the size to hold a value and an X link.
I'm going to set the new styles val to be the perimeter that came in.
"And now, I'm going to splice this guy onto the front of my list."
So the outgoing pointer I'm doing first to the new cell is allocated and
leads to what was previously the front row cell.
And then it is now updated to point to this one.
"We've got pointer wired, one value assigned, and we've got a new cell on the front."
"The inverse of that, taking something off my list, I'm going to need to kind of detach that front row cell, delete its memory, get its value, things like that."
So the error checking is still the same at the very beginning.
"Like, if I've got an empty staff I want to be sure I don't just kind of do reference no and get into some bad situations."
"So I report that error back using error, which will halt the program there."
"Otherwise, right, the element on top is the one that's in the value field of the head cell."
So knowing that head's null is a safety reference to do there.
And then I'm going to go ahead and get a hold of what that thing is and I'm going update the head to point to the cell after it.
So splicing it out and then deleting the old cell.
You can see that it actually doesn't technically take us to the error.
It takes us to the line after.
Sometimes these kinds of tools will get you close and then you'll have to figure it out from there.
"So, the problem is right here: you see that local user ID colon -1 doesn't have a comma after it, it just ends and since it was expecting a comma, well Javascript inserts a semicolon, and that causes issues."
So let's go ahead and fix that one.
Okay.
"So if we insert that comma there, and then reload the page, we get our next syntax error at line 103 and the error here is that functions expect parenthesis after them where the perameters are."
Even if it doesn't take any perameters it still expects parenthesis here.
Let's go ahead and add those in.
And again reload the page.
And we get to our next error.
And this one is way down on line 207.
"Now this is maybe a little bit harder to see, but the problem is right here, ""this:currentTick"" should have a dot, as see down here, rather than a colon, since we use dots to access member methods and variables."
"Okay, so now that we've fixed this here, and then reload, we get to another error on 318."
"And here we can see on line 318 that we have a comma here, where normally we would use a colon to specify a member method."
"So, if we fix that and then reload the page, we can see that we don't have any syntax errors left."
"And, those are the only ones that we put in."
"So, you can see that it was a lot easier to go through the developer tools and fix these things as necessary, as it pointed it out to us, rather than trying to walk through the code line-by-line manually."
"So, I hope that shows how useful it is to have the proper tools on hand."
...
"I've kept my eyes open and seen that a new time is coming and that something is happening to the people, that has never happened before."
And you see people walking around like you've never seen before.
"That's because all that was at the bottom, is now rising."
"And where there were one individual and another individual, there is now the mass, the mass- man."
"And one will stick together, and not go home to oneself any more."
"I can guarantee you that you'll get food while you're waiting, and that you'll get through this, safe and sound."
For now we are on the threshold of the land that belongs to us.
I don't fight anymore!
Take the chance!
"To the left, asshole!"
Get in behind Fatzer
Forwards!
YOU ARE NOT ALONE HERE you... you are not alone here
Then he thought:
"""The joy leaves us whihtout even getting to know us..."

This is an introduction to what we'll be doing in Week one in Physics twelve.
"Basically, we'll be looking at the characteristics of science."
This includes that science is divided into topics.
This you'll mostly read about in the textbook.
We'll also talk about how to be human activity.
"Again, this is mostly in the textbook."
"We will talk about the science of philosophy, this will show up in the"
"lectures but if you want to review the sections, these are all in chapter one."
The fact that it's practiced by a community. the institutional aspects.
"These are going to come a bit more later in the course, but I'll review briefly in the textbook."
"The fact that there is a specific method or process, we'll start that this week in the lectures but that will be the focus in the next two weeks."
"And the fact that it's constrained, this will be a key element of what is done in discussion this week."
"Or if this is a purely online version of course, we would be doing that in the forums."
"The philosophy of science, something that we will start looking at this week contains a few key parts."
The first being that the
laws of the universe are discoverable.
The universe is noble.
"The second is that science is repeatable, this is a key part in the online lectures but is covered in the book."
The laws are uniform and invariant.
"The laws are simple, and the"
laws are objective.
"These are ideas you definitely want to start becoming familiar with this week, but we will keep coming back to over the next couple of weeks."
The three things that set the groundwork is the scientific process.
"And those would be the scientific method, which is the advanced version of what you learned, probably in grade school."
This is how the individual scientist does his work.
Thought it would be useful to have a problem session.
Let's see if we can work the following problem.
"So our problem says, suppose we have a source, right here."
"And just one millimeter away, we have a sink, right there."
"What is the potential that results, form this source and sink?"
"At this point up here, A."
And what is the potential that results from this source and sink at this point b.
"If you notice this diagram is not to scale, it gives you the idea that the separation along the x axis between the source and sink is small only one unit."
And both the source and sync are a long ways a way from either field point a or field point b because field point a and b are ten units away on the z axis.
"So if we take these segments, in turn we can say look this problem is done readily enough but the fact that we have a equation that gives us the potential to a source and sink combination, We compute 5p as I0 over four pi sigma R etc."
And if we specialize that to our particular situation we'd say that means that pi over A is equal to I zero over four pi sigma.
"One over R, minus one over R prime."
"If we go over to our diagram and we say, how much is r and how much is r prime?"
"Well, r is the distance to the source."
"R is the distance from field point a, where we're computing the potential, to the source."
That's distance r.
R prime is the distance from the field point A to the sink.
"Now if you look at these, this problem you would say hm."
R and R prime are just about the same.
Cuz A is a long way from the source and a
long way from the sank.
"So surely the answer here is zero, or if not zero, inconsequential."
"It seems like that would be the case, but it's just not true."
"The difference between R and R-prime may be small, but there is a difference."
"And because there's a difference, this term, one over R, minus one over R-prime is definitely not equal to zero."
"I'll write that up here, too, just for emphasis."
That term is not equal to zero.
"And as a result, when you compute phi A."
"It will have, a definite number value."
I'll leave it up to you to complete the calculation.
"If we now move on and look at the second part, the b part of the, of the problem session question, it's the same question, except it just asks for a different field point."
Now we're asking for b rather than a.
"Just tell us whether you are her, or not.""*"
"*""We'll find out now.Vural, pass the bottle here.""*"
"*""Pour it on her."" *"
"*""I recognize this body.It's definitely her.""*"
You casted upon me the vilest violenceand the heaviest injustice.
You soiled my life with your own filth.
You brutally pillaged the life of someone you didn't even know.
Now look into my eyes and say your lies.
What the world wanted to see was how you would react.
And you all have reacted with joy and resolve.
"You've shown that your power will not be intimidated by any power that they have, and that's the most important thing that's happened here this week."
Because everything that went on inside that building tried to convince me that I was alone and that I was weak.
They tried to convince me that I was like a little finger out there on my own that could easily be broken.
"And all of you out here where the reminder for all of us that I wasn't just a finger all alone in there, but that I was connected to hand with many fingers that could be united as one fist, and that that fist could not be broken by the power that they have in there."
That fist is not a symbol of violence.
That fist is a symbol that we will not be mislead into thinking we are alone.
We will not be lied to and told that we are weak.
We will not be divided and we will not back down.
That fist is a symbol that we are connected and that we are powerful.
It's a symbol that we hold true to our vision of a healthy and just world and we are building the self empowering movement to make it happen.
"All those authorities in there wanted me to think like a finger, but our children are calling to us to think like a fist."
"And we know that now I'll have to go prison, we know that now that is the reality."
But that's just the job that I have to do.
That's the role that I face.
And many before me have gone to jail for justice and if we're gonna achieve our vision many after me will have to join me as well.
[People shouting:
"""I'll join you"" , cheering]"
Nobody ever told us that this battle would be easy.
Nobody ever told us that we wouldn't have to make sacrifices.
We knew that when we started this fight.
"Every wave on the ocean that has ever risen up and refused to lay back down has been dashed on the shore, but it is the very purpose of a wave to rise up, because once it rises above the horizon it finally has the perspective to see that it's not just a wave, that it's a part of a mighty ocean."
[Cheering]
And you can just do a little Math to get to xi+1 you take.
"Xi, we don't care about the first digit anymore, so you subtract it off."
Multiply by r and then add the new digit.
That's like one step of Horner's method.
"Now, then you have to take that computation and you can do mod q all the way through."
All you have to do is pre-compute r to the n+1 mod q And so here's the computation for one example.
"If we're at this position 41592 and we know 41592 mod q we can compute 15926 mod q by subtracting off 40,000."
"The TiR-1 and that gives us just the four digits, multiply by the radix add the new trailing digit and that's the new value."
And if we just keep that all mod q then we can with just a multiply and an add at each step we can keep a running total of the Modular hash value of the five digit thing.
"So, for example, this is the case that, that we just did 4152 on 997 is, is done by ex, exactly as we said we subtract and then add and then multiply by the radix mod 997."
"So, doing those calculations all the way through the search, we eventually get to a match."
That's again remarkably small amount of code.
We're going to keep a long random prime.
Just keep it a little smaller than the biggest long value to avoid overflow.
So we pre-compute r to the m - one mod q
'cause that's the little calculation that we have to do.
We compute the hash function.
And for the pattern.
"And then, with those pre-computations, the search is extremely straight forward."
So we take our current hash value.
"And this is just, add a q make sure it's positive."
And subtract off rm times the first character in then add in the next character mod q.
And that gives us the text hash for the current position.
And then we compare to see if that's equal to the pattern hash.
Now there's this is an introduction to the idea of randomized algorithms.
There's two ways to proceed from here.
One way called Monte Carlo version.
"Where we guaratee that the algorithm is gonna be quick but with low probability, it might get the answer wrong."
In that version we don't ever bother to check whether the go through and check all digits to see if there's actually a match.
"We take queue large enough so that we're confident the probability of the, to, two digit numbers or two m digit numbers having the same hash value."
"And so low that we're not gonna worry about it, that's called the Monte Carlo version."
The Las Vegas version is guarateed to get the right answer.
But if you spill it on yourself you should know that it is going to burn and it is going to be hot!
It is coffee.
As a matter of fact I bet you would be angry if your coffee wasn't hot!
"I don't know, I don't drink it."
I imagine you would be.
Haha.
"So, I am not talking about that kind of litigation, but I am talking about you deserve the product that you were promised."
And this chapter does a good job of giving you some information on that so make sure you read all about that.
"As I look at the end of the chapter, once again, make sure you go through the chapter summary."
"There are the Key Terms, make sure you understand those."
There is some self-test problems.
There are no formulas this week in here so that is good.
But the same end of chapter information as always.
"So, I hope that with major purchases in your future that this chapter has really helped you."
And I hope the next time you buy a car you will take into consideration some of the things I have shared with you and some of the things that you read in your book.
"So, happy shopping!"
Let's review a little bit of everything we learned so far and hopefully it'll make everything fit together a little bit better.
Then we'll do a bunch of calculations with real numbers and I think it'll really hit the point home.
"So, first of all if we're dealing with a-- let me actually write down, let me make some columns."
"So if we're dealing with-- let's see, we could call it the concept and then we'll call it whether we're dealing with a population or a sample."
So the first statistical concept we came up with was the notion of the mean or the central tendency and we learned of that was one way to measure the average or central tendency of a data set.
The other ways were the median and the mode.
"But the mean tends to show up a lot more, especially when we start talking about variances and, as we'll do in this video, the standard deviation."
But the mean of a population we learned-- we use the greek
letter Mu-- is equal to the sum of each of the data points in the population.
That's an i.
Let me make sure it looks like an I.
So you're going to sum up each of those data points.
You're going to start with the first one and you're going to go to the nth one.
We're assuming that there are n data points in the population.
And then you divide by the total number that you have.
So then let's look at the implementation side of this and I have an implementation in here I want to get rid of.
Sorry about this but I
left the old one in here.
That will do all the things that will need to get done.
Okay.
So let's deal with at the beginning.
"Starting off, right, we will set the cursor to zero."
"So that's the vector gets started, initialize empty, and nothing else I need to do with the vector."
"A character [inaudible] cursor position in that, and then moving the cursor position forward, it's mostly just doing this, right, cursor plus, plus, right."
It's just an easy index to move it down.
But
I do need to make sure that the cursor isn't already at the end.
So if the cursor is less than the size of the vector then I will let it advance.
But it never gets beyond the size itself.
So
like all of these are going to have same problems.
"Like, if I'm already at the end and somebody asks me to advance, I don't want to suddenly get my cursor in some lax stated that sort of back that."
"Similarly, on this one, if the cursor is greater than zero, all right, then we can back it up and move the cursor around."
Moving the cursor at the start is very easy.
"Moving the cursor to the end is, also, very easy, right."
We have a convention about what it is.
"And so then inserting a character is, also, pretty easy because all the hard work is done by the vector."
"When I say insert this new character at the cursor position, right, then this character advance the cursor to be kind of past it, and then deleting the character, also, pretty easy."
"Let me show you, before I go finishing the cursor, I just want to show you this little diagram of what's happening while I'm doing stuff."
So this is kind of a visualization of the things that are happening.
So this is showing the vector and its length.
And then the cursor position as we've done things.
"Inserted six characters, the cursor's currently sitting at the end, and for the length of the cursor, actually, the same value right now."
If
"I issue a back command, right, that deducts the cursor by one, it shows another one backs up by one, and then eventually the cursor gets to the position zero and subsequent backs don't do anything to it, it just kind of bounces off the edge."
"And moving forward, things are easier to deal with."
"It will advance until the gets to the length, the size of that text, and it won't go any further."
"But generally speaking it's the organisms in a particular place, plus the physical and chemical environment with which they're interacting."
And it's often a local example of some kind of biome.
Okay?
"So it could be a local chunk of tundra, a local chunk of rainforest, a pond."
It could be an upwelling area off Peru.
It could be an alpine forest.
It could be a lot of different things.
"And people study how energy flows, and so the paradigm basically, at least for things that are in the part of the planet that are driven by the primary productivity of plants, it starts with photosynthesis, and the annual production is usually determined by temperature and moisture; certainly for terrestrial ecosystems."
"Left out of this description is all of the chemosynthetic activity which occurs in deep, black, dark water at mid-ocean ridges, and which is occurring in the subterranean part of the biosphere that goes down- up to say five or ten kilometers, where there are bacteria that are living deep in the ground."
"And actually the pervasive influx of life, into the subterranean environment, is an important part in the biogeochemistry of the planet; that's not covered here."
"If we look around by, just by surface area, the planet's about 65% open ocean; it's about 5% continental shelf; desert's about 5%--that's extreme desert, okay, that's just about nothing on the surface; semidesert, so Sahel, that kind of area, about almost 3½, 4%; 3% tropical rainforest; and so forth."
"The idea here is you can take the planet and you can define different categories of the way things live on it, just by surface area, and break it down, and it looks like this."
"So here, if you were just to look at that, you would say, ""Well, open ocean, continental shelf, desert and rainforest are the main biomes on the planet."""
That's just by surface area.
"If you look at net primary production per square meter, you get a totally different view."
Okay?
"So this is just by surface area, and this is by primary production per square meter."
Look at how lousy the open oceans are.
Open oceans are deserts.
Why are open oceans deserts?
Student:
No fresh water.
Prof:
What?
Student:
No fresh water.
Prof:
"No, it's not that there's no fresh water."
What do you need if you're going to make an ecosystem productive?
Student:
Zooplankton &amp;gt;.
Prof:
"What I mean by that is that, a student can start here, do the first two years of university education, and then move on for the third and fourth year at the university, attain the bachelor's degree."
Most community colleges have articulation agreements with these institutions.
So it's a seamless process.
And it's the same degree in the end.
"The difference, however, is to the international students' advantage."
"Because you get the associate degree in the first two years, and you have a year of optional practical training available to you."
"You get the second degree, the bachelor's degree, and you have another year of optional practical training."
"So two work permits, you might say, for two whole years in the United States."
"That student, with that language ability and experience with the education, going back to their homeland for work has terrific opportunities that the student that stayed will never have."
So that's one of many.
"The other, of course, is the value proposition."
They are much less expensive.
"NOVA is 1/3 the price of the nearest university, which is a very good one."
And that's probably the least expensive of the universities around.
So already we're talking about one whole third of the tuition price.
"A community college has smaller classes, teachers that are not preoccupied with research."
"They are engaged with the student, one-on-one most of the time."
There are supportive student services that help the students adapt to the United States.
"And writing centers and tutors, all which are free here, are what the student can use to kind of help with their studies."
"So you've got student clubs, as well, associations, so forth, that the student can, here, become a better-prepared university student while they're at the community college, all for less expense."
So that's just part of the picture.
But I think it's an important part.
PATRlCIA GORDON:
We have international student counselors.
They're available for them throughout their two years or if they're here longer.
We have a career counselor.
And we have a transfer counselor.
"And all the faculty, really, are available."
That's the uniqueness of a community college.
The classrooms are small.
The faculty are available.
"Students writing essays to transfer to four-year schools, faculty, staff, counselors are all available to advise them, review their essays."
It's exciting because of scale.
"We can bring, and other companies can bring out products that can touch a billion people fairly quickly."
And these markets are
large.
"They're very, very large."
They touch a lot of people.
They touch humanity at it's--in the way it really is as opposed to the way we think--we think of it is.
"But it's terrifying because it's all about information, and ultimately, information is what people care a lot about."
"So we end up, we Google, end up in the middle of most of these debates, whether it's privacy or street view or numerous other issues which people here in the audience know about."
"And from my perspective, I think the debate is healthy."
These are new ideas.
These are new issues.
Society hasn't really decided what to do about some of these things.
"Having the sharing and the opinions of everybody really does help, at least, us inform how we make the decisions of how we go forward with these new products."
"And we encounter this--the scrutiny and we're prepared to participate, and of course, we accept it very much."
"This disruption, this benefit is going to continue."
"It's going to continue from companies like Google and others as well, and the future gets very interesting very quickly."
"This golden era--I talk about the golden era of--or the age of augmented humanity, you can imagine a golden era of breakthroughs."
"The computer science is now driving knowledge in human discipline in all sorts of new ways that can--that we can really solve the scientists' big problems; global warming, terrorism, financial transparency, because these are fundamentally information problems."
"So, imagine a future--this is a very near future that goes something like this: you don't forget anything."
Why?
Because the computer remembers.
You don't have to remember anymore.
The computer remembers.
It remembers the things that you should have remembered but you don't remember anymore because you have too much else going on in your life.
"Computers, in many ways, will become good at what we're not good at, making lists, remembering things, keeping memories and track of all the things going on in our lives."
Humans are just not very good at that.
Computers sort of excel with this sort of thing.
"You're never lost, right?"
"It's funny how, you know, you're always buying maps and worrying about things."
"Now you're never lost, right?"
Your smartphones certainly knows where you are.
"However, most system leaks are small."
"While they cannot be detected by the naked eye, small leaks are the"
leading cause of poor A/C performance.
"Fortunately, small leaks can be easily corrected using the Interdynamics R134a UV Leak Detector and"
Sealer Kit.
"The kit contains one can of direct charge leak detector dye, which is good for five applications, along with a can of direct charge"
leak sealer.
Also included in the kit is a UV pen
"light and pair of UV fluorescent safety glasses, allowing even the smallest leaks to be quickly detected."
"Before using the kit, identify the"
low-side service port in the A/C system.
"Depending on the vehicle, the low-side port will be located on the accumulator or mounted on the large diameter line between the compressor and the evaporator."
Remember to always wear safety glasses and a pair of mechanics' gloves before working on the system.
Now remove the service port cap and then start the engine and set the A/C controls to maximum cooling.
"Next, remove the cap from the can of leak detector dye and shake the can vigorously."
"While holding the can upside down, place the direct charge nozzle over the low-side port and hold for five seconds."
This will allow one application of dye to be injected.
Now replace the service port cap and allow the engine to run with the A/C on for at least ten minutes in a well ventilated area.
This will give the dye adequate time to circulate.
Driving the vehicle for at
least five miles is another acceptable method for circulating the dye.
"Before checking for leaks, turn the engine off."
"Now, with your UV safety glasses on, shine the pen light around fittings, along metal lines and hoses, and the connections at the rear of the compressor."
The presence of dye in any of these areas indicates that a leak exists.
"To seal the leak, add the leak sealer through the low-side service port with the engine running and the A/C controls set to maximum cooling."

So they're really critical for a Greywater System.
And you don't actually have to do anything; you just need to have healthy soil.
And I just want to show you my favorite one.
"This is, you know, sort of not an exactly realistic picture."
So microscopic organism; this one is called the Tardigrade.
Any of you heard of the Tardigrade?
"Now, this little bitty microscopic organism went into space and it survived space and it formed, turns itself into a cyst and can survive pretty much anything."
It came back to earth and reproduced.
"So these things are--you know, in the soil, there's really strong organisms that can do just about anything like survive space."
"So we don't--if we get our Greywater going into healthy soil, we don't have to worry so much about the nutrients in it and the gunky stuff. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
Thanks.
"So, the Tardigrades are going to save us."
"Okay, we're going to take a little bit of a deeper dive now and focus on one particular system, the laundry to landscape system."
And I think the value of taking a focus on this one is this is considered like the low-hanging fruit of Greywater Systems.
It's a great place to start.
And I'll just run you through at a very high level here how it's done.
"Firstly, obviously, as Laura had mentioned, we have to be careful about what detergents or soaps we use in the first place."
We have to use non-toxic ingredients.
"And then we can re-use that water that's coming out of the washing machine, divert it--and"
I'll show you some parts here in a minute--out to the landscape and grow food with it or shelter or a beautiful backyard oasis.
"Really, whatever we desire in terms of our backyard spaces or front yard landscapes, for that matter."
"Here's a little deeper dive; oops, excuse me."
This is a schematic of a laundry to landscape system.
It shows you how the plan would work in effect.
"Obviously, it's showing the collection plumbing here that distributes out to the landscape--thank you--out to the landscape and actually, emits the water directly into the soil."
And that connects with the mulch basins that we just heard Laura talk to.
"So, the beauty of this system is that, well, for one, it has a built-in pump."
It uses the pump of the washing machine.
"So if there are any distributions challenges, maybe you have a slight incline."
There are some ways to overcome those challenges because you have this built-in pump.
"Apart from that, no additional gadgetry is required."
"No filters to break down, which is wonderful."
There are like 2500 jobs that.
Can't even possibly do them.
"See them at project per, oops, per capital growth rate for Medicare spending, so, you're on your way controlling fro the number of people in Medicare."
"If the predicted growth rate exceeds the target, iPad will develop a set of proposal to reduce the Medicare spending."
"The HHS, that's Health and Human Service must implement the proposals unless [inaudible] adopts equally effective alternative."
"So basically, this going to affect unless Congress acts."
"So, no additional legislation needed."
To make these proposals go in and you have fifteen wise men and women giving you the best ideas.
"So, starting in January twenty-eighth, being the target is GDP per capita plus one%."
What have we been doing in terms of growth over the last 40 years?
Gdp plus two.
"This cuts back rate in half, remember that yellow, I think it was the yellow line we had right at the start."
That was cutting the rate in half.
"So, pretty effective."
Congress can overrule only if it's pact by both houses.
With the majority.
"The proposal include any recommendation to rush in health care raise revenues for medicare beneficiary premium, increase medicare beneficiary co-sharing including deductibles, co-shares and co-payments or otherwise restrict benefits to modi fy eligibility."
"So you can't say well, we cannot exclude certain procedures to get this target."
You basically have to get more efficient care to hit this target.
"And by the way, hospitals are excluded for the first period of time because they supposedly gave a lot of."
Of cross savings in that adjustment that we described earlier.
Just recently the [inaudible] committee approved [inaudible] that would eliminate the health force independent payment advisory board.
The bill could be considered by the full house as early as next week.
That's why it's in the news so Congress putting in the bill and actually the President insist that into bill because Peter convinced them it was as fail safe for cost control.
Congress hates the idea.
Why does Congress. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Take the idea about re-election.
"Yeah, why is Congress hate the idea of the iPad?"
"Of this independent [inaudible] and Advisory Board saying, here are changes and if you don't. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [inaudible]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Congress is giving up power, right?"
Some other boards doing it.
It's basically a vote of no confidence in Congress.
You guys can't do the right thing.
"So, we're going to have this independent board."
"Which is that when you stop the front end of the garage, of the ladder, you also stop the"
left end of the ladder.
"Remember, that at this point the right end of the ladder smashes into a wall, and it stops."
"Now, what is going to happen is the back end of the ladder just lik e our slinky, when I dropped it has not yet heard that the front end of the ladder has crashed into something."
The left end of the ladder continues to come at speed v until somebody tells it.
What tells it?
"Well, a sound wave, of course will be propagating down this ladder as the front end of it crumples, propagating back to tell the back end of the ladder, wait, there is an extra force, we need to stop."
How fast does the sound wave travel?
"Well that depends on what the ladder is made of, but I know a limit."
"The sound wave will not travel back to the ladder in it's own frame, or in any other frame that's happily an invariant faster then the speed of light."
"So at this event when the front end of the ladder crashes into the door, you can imagine a sound wave propagating back up the ladder to the left, trying to tell the left end to stop."
"So, how fast can this signal propagate?"
"Well, this is the fastest it can propagate."
"The fastest that the rear end of the ladder can hear, but the front has stopped, is the speed of"
light.
"So I've drawn a light speed, 45 degree propagation of the signal from the back of the ladder, from the front of the ladder to the back telling it to stop."
"And if this were the case. you notice that by the time this light being reaches the back end of the ladder, back end of the ladder is well within the garage because even in the ladder frame, we are now talking about a positive time."
Right?
"And so, time has"
"The, the, remember, the left end of the ladder entered the garage here."
"By now, the left end of the ladder is well in the garage."
If you stop the front end of the
"ladder, the back end would keep coming."
"You would not, be able to stop it until it was in the garage."
"Now, what happens at the moment."
To the actual ladder when the soundwave) propagates and reaches the back.
Well the energies involved are such that most ladders would probably blow themselves up to smithereenes or crumble to atoms.
But in any event by the time the rear end of the ladder appears that the front end has stopped.
And ma ybe we have a very powerful ladder and it's elastic and it springs back out and re-expands by the time all that and crashes into the garage door.
"But the time, by the time all of that, any of that happens the ladder is well within the garage."
And so the fact that you managed to close the doors.
"Is not an interruption when you close the doors. at this event, the ladder, had, the"
So the buildings will vary depending on the interests of the occupant.
"Other than that, there would be a very wide selection of what buildings people can live in."
"All the lines are curved, which makes the building much stronger."
And the boats and helicopter is there for your use.
In the future i don't think people will want to own anything anymore.
Everything is there for their use.
But you don't own anything.
You live in a building as long as you like.
You can travel any place you want to travel.
"And then if you come over here, this may be a model of an art center in the future, where artist materials, you have access to any material you want."
There is no fee anymore.
And so what you see here is different buildings and different mechanisms that serve a different purpose.
This represents a joint venture of all the world's people going out into space together and using it for the benefit of everyone.
"Now, if you come over here, you will see these are exhibition buildings."
Some of them we built for China originally.
And this represents a rooftop landing area.
And the rooftop gardens will be on all buildings in the future.
All of the larger buildings will have a rooftop gardens or solar generators as part of the roof.
"Jacque Fresco sees all repetitive tasks being performed by automated machinery in the future, enabling people to have more free time to explore their areas of interest and help advance society."
This is a way we produce buildings in the future.
This is a machine that has a die placed in this area and then it squeezes the buildings out like that.
And then a laser beam cuts them.
And this machine picks the building off and transfers it to this machine.
"And this machine, if i can change my position, if you can see this, this machine shoves the building onto that ramp."
It shoves on like that.
"And once it gets there, the memory metals lock and keep it in place."
"The buildings will be put up in dry dock, that means like ships are built."
Then a machine that looks like this will travel along putting in the windows and everything.
"And then when the buildings are finished, say you have got like 10 buildings finished in here, then we flood it with water and the buildings are built on a float, and we float the building to the location."
Then we use water jets under the building.
So we slip the building in place like that.
"Instead of bringing building material out there and cut it up and make it, we make them all in dry dock and we move them on water, because with water you can move heavy freight and it doesn't have to be fast."
You do it with scientific measurements.
"So, today what people do is they use heuristics."
And the heuristics in that space are terrible.
The second issue in display has to do with standardization of ad formats.
"So, again, here you are--you have a property, you have a place for display."
And there's not agreement at the level that it needs to be on the standardization of the delivery of the display.
And especially around interactive and video ads.
"If you think about it, the future of display ads is not a static picture, but rather an ad that brings you in--that tells you a narrative."
The best ads add real value to the consumer's experience.
We take the view that ads are valuable if they're targeted and are information-rich.
"And the most information-rich, by obvious argument, is something which involves video and a story, and a narrative, and more references."
And the technology will enable the creation of those.
"And then the third, in our case, is the construction of the business relationship with the large advertisers we're still working on. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"

"We did our best attempt at a deal with Yahoo, and as you know, we had to cancel it at the very last minute."
We wish them the best of luck.
And Carol is a fine and able CEO.
What do I really think will happen here?
I think that the problem has to do with Microsoft's ability to use its Windows monopoly to restrict consumer choice.
That's not a new subject.
It's been discussed at great length.
"So anything that Microsoft would do that would eliminate consumer choice with respect to search engines, Internet browsers, distribution-- for which it was previously found guilty--are of concern."
And there's a history of that.
So that's what we worry about.
"I think as long as the technologies are competing on a fair to fair basis,"
I think that's great. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;MARY:
"On that note, Eric, thank you very much. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"The solution for me, is back again to the government, because the people, most of the people here, already agree about the garbage separation or the recycle, all the slogans, like ""Reduce, reuse, recycle"" or ""Bali go clean and green""."
Everyone already agrees on those slogans.
"But what we're talking about now is after the slogan, or after the the idea, something that you wrote, the words you have to do the action right now, right?"
"So what we're waiting for now, we as the grassroots movement, or the people still doing what we believe it, what we're waiting for is the government law to support this action."
"To institute that change on such a massive scale, wow, I mean, the government needs to intervene, and it needs to intervene from the top all the way down to the village."
"Every level, you know, and the way, with regional autonomy in Indonesia, ya, the Governor can say it should be like this, but then the Bupatis need to follow suit."
They need to care; they need to really care.
"I think now the government still doesn't have any serious concern about the garbage but I do believe, especially the Balinese"
"local government, because government in Bali is quite unique, we have a formal government and an informal government, and they are both equally strong, 50-50."
"So if both these governments had a really serious concern about the garbage or waste issue, it would be socialized effectively in the public."
"We, people here, would support 100%."
So make it real.
"""Refuse plastic bags, refuse plastic bags, plastic, plastic, plastic, refuse plastic bags."

(Off camera) What is a social worker?A social worker is really what I call an Agent of Change
A change agent.
And that is so important to understand the distinction.
When you look at a patient.
The doctor sees the patient.
The doctor doesn't see anything else but the patient and inside the patient.
The social worker does not just see the patient.
The social worker sees family.
The community at large.
The resources within the community.
And deals with all of them.
That is your change agent.
Because we do not focus on one thing.
We focus on the entirety.
And you really can't cure anything without looking at at the entirety.
If you only work on the one individual someone with mental illness or the senior... what about what comes with the senior?
"Well there's finances, there's there's housing, there's family issues, there's all these other issues."
"But raising them, of course we should raise them."
The problem is that the current system of education was designed and conceived and structured for a different age.
It was conceived in the intellectual culture of the Enlightenment.
And in the economic circumstances of the Industrial Revolution.
"Before the middle  of the 19th century, there were no systems of public education."
Not really.
"I mean, you could get educated by Jesuits, you know, if you had the money, but public education,  paid for from taxation, compulsory to everybody and free at the point of delivery, that was a revolutionary idea."
And many people objected to it.
"They said it's not possible for many street kids, working class children, to benefit from public education."
"They're incapable of learning to read and write, and why are we spending time on this?"
"So, there's also built into it a whole series of assumptions about social structure and capacity."
"It was driven by an economic imperative of the time, but running right through it was an intellectual model of the mind."
Which was essentially the Enlightenment view of intelligence.
"That real intelligence consists in this capacity for a certain type of deductive reasoning, and the knowledge of the classics, originally."
What we've come to think of as academic ability.
"And this is deep in the gene pool of public education, that there are really two types of people: academic and non-academic; smart people and non-smart people."
"And the consequence of that is that many brilliant people think they're not, because they've been judged against this particular view of the mind."
"So, we have twin pillars, economic and intellectual."
And my view is that this model has caused chaos in many people's lives.
It's been great for some.
There have been people that have benefited wonderfully from it.
But most people have not.
Instead they suffer this.
"This is the modern epidemic, and it's as misplaced, and it's as fictitious."
This is the plague of ADHD.
"Now, this is a map of the instance of ADHD in America, or prescriptions for ADHD."
"Don't mistake me,"
I don't mean to say there is no such thing as Attention Deficit Disorder.
I'm not qualified to say if there is such a thing.
"I know that a great majority of psychologists, and pediatricians think there is such a thing."
But it's still a matter of debate.
"What I do know, for a fact, is it's not an epidemic."
It's right here...
To be precise:
"Right there, in Espalha Brasas, ..."
"Lisbon, of course."
"- I believe, wherever you are in Europe, you're at the centre."
- This is a restaurant that is based on simple and traditional Portuguese cuisine.
- We have had a tradition for centuries:
The codfish... ... dried in the sun with salt.
And some centuries ago that would be the way to keep it all year long.
And that would be the food for most Portuguese who could not afford something else.
- I think Lisbon is the centre of Europe... ...
"With the internet you have no boundaries, we have the weather and the nice people, so we can conquer the world."
"There is a challenge in terms of culture, because we don't have a very entrepreneurial culture."
- The centre of Europe is right where you are.
Our signature is:
'Ideas that happen'.
"So it's not only having the ideas, but also the possibility of making them happen."
I started a house of the entrepreneurs.
"It's a place where entrepreneurs can get the resources they need, the people they need, the support they need."
"- The centre of Europe is split between our heritage, common culture and our hearts."
"Especially with what I call the ""natural dances"","
"like Argentinian tango, salsa... , where you have actually true improvisation, you add another element to the mix."
"And that is that besides the interpretation of the music, you also have the combination with your partner, in a free way, where from simple mechanics you create all these things that you see."
- I think the centre of Europe is where the soul and heart of Europe is.
It took several years to convince Portugal that it was worthwhile to invest in artificial intelligence.
"And also because Portugal did not have a very good image in technology abroad, it was also very difficult for us to convince customers in other countries to go ahead with us."
"Of course it's also very difficult for a computer to have the intelligence to cope with complexity, and that's where artificial intelligence comes in:"
To take better advantage of the resources of the company.
"And that was the main goal for Siscog, our company that develops software for the transportation domain."
"- In internet, you should take advantage of when you have the attention of the customer, to make him perform an action."
"In offline, it's difficult because the media and the action are separate things."
"You see TV, and then you go to the shops."
"So his model is the Z electrons filled this volume, this sphere effectively of 10^-10 meters in diameter."
"The electrons filled that up, but somewhere in the center there is something that is very small and very massive that has a diameter of 10^-14 meters."
Because occasionally that alpha particle hit that massive part so most of the mass of the atom is in this nucleus.
"Now, isn't this a great UROP project for Mr. Marsden?"
What did he do?
He discovered the nucleus.
Fantastic.
I also want to tell you that this kind of Rutherford backscattering experiment here is also the basis of the experiment that was done to discover the quark.
"The quark which is the elementary particles that make up the proton, the neutron."
Same idea.
There is a high energy particle that comes into the proton and backscatters from the quark essentially.
"That is an experiment carried out by one of my colleagues in the Physics Department, Jerry Friedman and Henry"
Kendall.
Henry Kendall has since passed away.
But the same idea.
It's really the Rutherford backscattering experiment that was done.
All right.
"Well, now it is time for us to do our own Rutherford backscattering experiment."
"And the way we are going to do that is we're going to be scattering off of this lattice here, this lattice of these Styrofoam balls."
"These Styrofoam balls are gold atoms, gold nuclei, and then the space around them is where the electrons are."
So this is one monolayer of gold atoms.
"Now, this scale is a little wrong."
The real scale would be if we had a pinhead in the center of this room and then the rest of the room was the atom and then there would be another room 10-251 with a pinhead in the center of that.
"That's the real scale, but the fact that the scale isn't right, that's okay."
We are going to be able to understand the principle here.
And what we want to do is we want to be able to measure the diameter of these Styrofoam balls or the diameter of those gold nuclei.
And we're going to measure it by measuring the probability of backscattering.
"And the way we're going to measure the probability of backscattering, the way we are going to do that, is we're going to take these ping-pong balls, and they are going to be our alpha particles."
And we are going to aim them at the lattice.
"And we are going to have a total of 287 ping-pong balls, or 287 alpha particles."
"And so the probability of backscattering will be simply the number backscattered over the total number incident, which will be 287."
So this is what we are going to measure.
"When we see the beautiful in our Buddhist Society, you see the beauty in your partner, you see the beauty in yourself, you see the beauty in our wonderful Prime Minister Mr Howard [laughter]."
What are you
"laughing for, you cynical group?"
[laughter].
You can see the beauty in these things!
"And jee, I mean I wouldn't like to be a Prime Minister."
Would you?
It's a very difficult job.
"So when you start to see the positive parts in these people, you're actually generating the positive emotions such as respect."
"How many people actually have respect for their parents, for their partners, for the people in authority?"
Why do we disrespect our systems?
"Because we've been cultivating those fault-finding negative thoughts in our media, in our newspapers, in our conversations."
No wonder we have a lack of disrespect.
"You know if you ask people in other countries they look at Australia - ""This is a beautiful land."
It's pretty well governed.
"It could be better but could certainly be a lot worse!"" So why don't we have respect for our institutions, why are we so negative?"
"You know if we're so negative with our institutions, we get very negative towards our partners."
"Why is it that in our modern life people have such a hard time finding a life partner, keeping them, sticking with them?"
Because they always find fault with each other.
"And why do people always have lack of self-esteem, getting depression, because they start finding fault with themselves as well."
I'm not good enough.
They're not good enough.
Life's not good enough.
Be careful because that path leads to big depression.
We're actually building up those negative emotions and instead we can build up the positive emotions.
We deliberately look for something in our partner we can respect and love and care for.
"We deliberately look in something in ourselves which we can love and care, respect."
"We deliberately look for something in life which we care about, we love and got passion for."
"And that way, by focusing on that, we're building up, generating, the positive emotions of life."
"And when you start to learn how you can generate those positive emotions, the path becomes clear just how you can have a sort of control of this emotional world of yours."
"You're not just like a rudderless ship, always going through these storms and these calms of the ocean of your emotions, but you can actually have some guidance there, you can generate beautiful emotions."
That's basically just what our whole path of Buddhism is.
I have to give something to somebody this is also as much a need as I have to receive something.
"So there is a need, whatever kind of need."
"Needs may be diverse, accordingly relationships could be diverse."
"Now, the moment we form a relationship wanting to fulfill a certain need and if that need is not fulfilled then relationships will go bad."
"For whatever purpose for which we have formed a relationship, if those needs and those expectations are not fulfilled, relationships will go bad."
"We may claim many things, but when your expectations are not fulfilled it does go bad, isnt it?"
"So instead of doing too much wishy-washy about it, its best to look at it straight and see what is it and how we need to handle it?"
The needs within a human being have risen because of a certain sense of incompleteness.
People are forming relationships to experience a certain sense of completeness within themselves.
"When you have a good relationship with someone dear to you, you feel complete."
When you dont have that you feel incomplete.
Why is this so?
"Because this life, this piece of life is a complete entity by itself."
Why is it feeling incomplete?
"And, why is it trying to fulfill itself by making a partnership with another piece of life?"
Fundamental reason is that we have not explored this life in its full depth and dimension.
"Though that is the basis, there is a complex process of relationships as such."
"There are expectations, and expectations and expectations and expectations."
(Laughs)
The expectations that most people are creating are such that there is no human being on the planet who could ever fulfill those expectations.
"If you especially this man-woman relationship, the expectations are so much that even if you marry a god or a goddess, they will fail you."
(Laughs)
"Because the expectations are so unrealistic that nobody, no human being can ever fulfill that."
"And unable to understand the expectations or the source of expectations, nobody can fulfill the expectations."
"But if you understand what is the source of this expectation, you could form a very beautiful partnership."
"Are you ok for, you are getting very serious with relationships"
On a certain day
"Jack and Jill now let me use,"
I am trying to just culturally change the joke.
(Laughs)
"Jack and Jill were going up the hill,"
and
Is less.
"The time, the, the twin number, The twin on Earth aged during this segment is, indeed, less than the time that, the moving twin aged here."
And the same bi-symmetry is true up there.
"But when you add this extra segment from jumping ships, it's unambiguous the twin on Earth is older."
This is not a contradiction to relativity.
There is a difference between them.
You could measure the difference.
One of them accelerated.
Okay.
So we've cleared up the paradox We understand that the twin that accelerated remained younger and there is not a violation of relativity because you could measure the difference between the two.
"One was inertial, one accelerating."
"Okay, but there is an unsatisfactory feeling to this resolution because what I've essentially done is hidden all my ignorance in this instant of infinite acceleration where instantaneously as seen by the moving twin is."
"Suddenly aged all the difference that makes up the, the, the, for the, for the,"
"Lorentz, the time dilation that he otherwise would have seen."
This infinity doesn't make sense.
Can I do better?
Well of course I can do better.
"What I really wanna do, and in fact, the only physical thing to do, is you can't have infinite acceleration."
You could apply a finite acceleration and you could round off this corner a little bit.
And now I have a story without infinite acceleration.
"You can ask well what happens here? computing here is a little bit more difficult, because now the moving twin is not in an inertial frame."
"The way I cheated before was, that I, he jumped from one inertial frame to another inertial frame."
"And I ignored the acceleration that this implies, now I have to deal with this acceleration."
And that requires a little more calculation then we have.
"But we can get a sense for what this implies, by imagining here's a trick that will cause him to accelerate."
Remember I want him to be moving to the right and then accelerated to the left.
And the way I'm gonna do this is I'm gonna imagine that
"Somewhere out here, I don't know."
Little distance not exactly in the direction it is moving so it isn't crashing there.
But not far from there lies a star a heavy massive object.
"And what I am going to imagine is that as this twin approaches, the star is accelerated and then goes into hyperbolic orbit and is deflected by the star so that he comes back to the earth."
So basically I arrange the angles so that he overshoots the star.
"And since so many communities made this choice independently, it must have been a good choice."
Right?
Even though it meant less music and skoodlypooping.
Thanks Thought Bubble.
"All right, to answer that question,"
let's take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture.
Advantage: controllable food supply.
"You might have droughts or floods, but if you are growing the crops and breeding them to be heartier, you have a better chance of not starving."
"Disadvantage: in other to keep feeding people as the population grows, you have to radically change the environment of the planet."
"Advantage: specially if you grow grain, you can create a food surplus, which makes cities possible and also the specialization of labor."
"Like, in the days before agriculture, everybody's job was foraging."
And it took about a 1000 calories of work to create a 1000 calories of food.
And it was impossible to create large population centers.
"But if you have a surplus, agriculture can support people not directly involved in the production of food."
"Like for instance, trade's people, who can devote their lives to better farming equipment, which in turn makes it easier to produce more food more efficiently, which in time makes it possible for a corporation to turn profit on this 99 cent double cheeseburger."
"This is delicious, by the way."
"It's actually terrible, it's very cold."
"And I wish, I had not eaten it."
"I mean, can we just compare what I was promised to what I was delivered?"
"Yeah, thank you."
This is not that.
"Some would say that large and complex agricultural communities that can support cities and eventually inexpensive meat sandwiches are not necessarily beneficial to the planet, or even to its human inhabitants."
"Although, that it is a little of a bit tough argument to make, coming to you as a"
"I am, in a series of ones and zeros."
Advantage: agriculture can be practiced all over the world.
"Although, in some cases it takes extensive manipulation of the environment, like, you know, irrigation, controlled flooding, that kind of thing."
Disadvantage: farming is hard.
"So hard in fact that one is tempted to claim ownership over other humans and have to till the land on your behalf, which is the kind of non-ideal social order that tends to be associated with agricultural communities."
So why did agriculture happen?
Wait!
I haven't talked about herders.
"Herders, man!"
What about the people who eat it in their fish?
What are the public health costs?
"You know, all these costs."
"I mean, we're talking millions and millions and millions of dollars."
"So you want to make waste management, or you want to do waste reduction?"
"Which one is more cost efficient, cost effective?"
"For a government that's struggling, that can't even provide water to the residents in"
"Denpasar, there are so many other crises that are impending on this island, you know, plastic should be the easiest thing."
"Just put a bag tax, and then when people already realize, there's already public support, ""hey, bags are expensive,"" then you do a bag ban."
Ban it.
Ban the single use plastic bag.
Ireland?
92% reduction in 2 weeks!!!
"They just banned it outright, and it's possible in a place like Bali: it's an island."
You could just ban the bag.
And people would just have to learn to deal with it.
You learn.
"The first or second time you go to the store and you don't have a bag, and you're either forced to buy a bag or you've got to go home and get one, you won't forget again."
"You know, instant behavior shift."
Instant.
"And people will grumble, and [complain], but grow up!"
"We have to be adults about the environment we live in. / Students are the next leaders to come in the very near future, so they need to be able to have access to the kind of information and education to be made aware."
"And often times, not just in Indonesia, but in many countries, the school curriculum is outdated."
"It's not relevant to the current issues that we're facing in modern times, so to be able to infuse the perhaps outdated or ""has-room-to-grow"" curriculum, we feel that would be really effective, and get the kids excited."
"We started to select schools in different areas, many of them were in a little bit more remote areas, where they didn't really have any collection service, so typically the school would be burning the waste, or throwing it in the river at the back."
"We had very good discussions in a high school, in which, without wanting to say what was the solution, we were asking,"
"""What do you think should be done, what can you do to reduce waste in your daily situation?"""
"And without having to say anything, because we had refreshments around that were served by the school, students went straight away,"
"""This can take away, this we can reintroduce the banana leaf, don't use that and that."""
"So, I think actually the high schools should be a pretty good target. / A lot of programs, they don't need a lot of money, but they need some."
"And if you could help in the fundraising efforts for getting these programs off the ground or sustaining them, it would be a huge, huge help."
"When you think about it on that global scale, what will future communities do?"
It's just part of life.
"It's just your reality at this moment, don't take it personally, as an affront to your arrogant idea of who you think you are."
"When you accept it, you start to undermine it."
"It's a wonderful thing to know that when you're at peace with fear, fear dissipates."
"When you're not angry at anger, the anger just loses its power source, it just dissipates."
"When you're just at peace or accept the grief, the grief doesn't last very long."
It's when we try and control these things and get rid of them that we're actually feeding them.
So we let go of this controller.
"We're kind to our emotions, even our negative emotions."
"So when you have, you know a negative emotion, you're disappointed, you're fed up, look at those emotions like beings in this world, be compassionate to the beings which exist in your mental landscape."
"And we should never be cruel, we should be gentle to ourselves and allow these things to be.."
"Because too often we do violence to our emotional world, and because we do violence to our emotional world, it's against the gentleness of this second factor of the eightfold path."
"Because we do violence to that world - ""I shouldn't be afraid!"
I shouldn't be grieving!
"I shouldn't be angry!"" you can see that that makes more negative emotions for your future."
Basically we call this the Law of Kamma.
The emotions you have now have been generated by what you've done in the past.
But they're there - you can't undo the past.
"You're stuck with this, the results of your past kamma."
"I don't mean past life - I mean what you've been doing today, it's created this moment you're feeling now."
But now what are we going to do about this.
"It's the kamma we do in the moment which is most important and if we face this moment, maybe a moment of grief, it may be a moment of fear, it may be a moment of sadness, a moment of anger, we can face this moment and say ""This is a result of past kamma, what am I doing about this now?"
I'm going to make good kamma with this feeling.
I'm going to let go of trying to control it.
I'm going to be kind to it.
I'm going to be gentle with it.
I'm going to respect it.
Allowing it like every other being in this universe to be - they have a reason to be here.
"I'm going to allow them to be and accept them and be at peace with them."""
"When you can make peace and be kind to the emotions you're experiencing in the moment, a wonderful thing happens - the emotional pain loses its sting, and the tightness of that emotional knot starts to unravel."
"Whether it's a broken heart, or whether it's grief over the loss of a child, when you really let it be, we call it healing."
We call it sort-of fixing up the problem.
That's similar to the bilexical dependencies of our earlier lexicalized
PCFGs.
But we don't want to use that as our only source of information partly because lexical information is so sparse.
And there are several other good sources of information.
So let's just go through those.
"So one is the distance between the head and the dependent, And if you look at this picture, what you'll see is that most dependencies are short."
They're with nearby words.
There are a couple of exceptions.
"So, this dependency here is a pretty long one."
But most of them are pretty short.
"Other sources of information are, what is the intervening material?"
"So, in general, dependencies don't cross over verbs, and commonly they don't cross over punctuation."
"Some exceptions, commas are quite often crossed over."
"So, looking at the words in between can give information about whether a dependency is likely or not."
A final source of information is looking at the valency of heads.
"And that's saying, for a particular word, what kind of dependents does it typically take?"
"So a word like the typically takes no dependents on the left and no dependents on the right, as in this case here."
"On the other hand, if you have a word that is, say, a noun, it will take dependents like adjectives and articles on the left."
"But it won't take those kind of dependents on the right, though can take other kinds of words as dependents on the right."
"For example, take prepositional phrase modifiers or relative clauses as dependents on the right."
So you can develop a quite rich typology of what kind of dependents words take.
Okay that should give you a better sense of what dependency representations look like and it's the big picture of how we go about parsing with them.
In the next segment we'll introduce a concrete algorithm for dependency parsing.
[Chinese song]
"Happy Birthday, Hessian Theater academy,"
We wish you all the best for the next 10 years!
This is a ground plan of the building in which we are.
"We entered here, at number 15,"
"Then straight ahead through the corridor,"
"At the left, the foyer with the works from the design school,"
"Then in the corridor, the durational performance of María Fernández Aragón, ""Voice over"""
"And the door which you see here, this is the door through which you've just entered the room,"
"And it's the expected value of e, to the s transpose x."
"Okay, and this is equal to e to the s, transpose mu, plus a half s transpose sigma s."
"Now, you're probably familiar with this in the 1 dimensional case, we'll just recover here."
"Suppose x is really just a scale of random variable, then the moment generating function of x is equal to the expected value of e to the sx, and it's equal to e to the s mu plus the half sigma squared s squared."
And this is the case where x is normal with mean mu and variance sigma squared.
So this is the moment generating function of the scalar.
Normal random variable.
"This is, it's generalization to a multivariate normal random vector, x."
Okay.
"So, we call our partition we saw in an earlier module."
We can break x into two blocks of vectors x1 and x2 as such.
"We can extend this notation, notation naturally."
"So we can write Mu equals 1 2, and equals to This sigma 11, sigma 12, sigma 21, sigma 22 and they are the mean vector and covariance matrix of x1, x2."
So we have the following results on the marginal conditional distributions of x.
The marginal distribution of a multivariate normal random variable is itself normal.
In particular the marginal.
Distribution of Xi is multivariate normal with mean vector Ui and variance covariance matrix sigma Ii.
"So for example X1 is multivariate normal, in fact it's k components, mu 1, sigman 1, 1."
And similarly X2 is multivariate normal.
"Mu 2, sigma 2, 2, and this is n minus k components."
"And we have here an example of the bi-variance normal density function, where the correlation beween x1 and x2 is 80%."
If we rotate the service you can see the correlation of 80 percent the large values of X 1 are associated with values of x 2
like all values of x 1 are related to all values of x 2.
So we can also talk about the conditional distribution assuming sigma is positive definite.
The conditional distribution of the multivariate normal distribution is also multivariate normal.
"In particular x 2, given that x 1 equals little x 1 is multivariate normal with mean vector mu 2.1."
"In the variance, covariance matrix, sigma 2.1."
"Where mu 2 1, is given to us by this expression here, and sigma 2.1 is given to us by this expression here."
"And we can get some intuition for this result, by just imaging the following situation; so we've got X one down here."
"We have X two over here, and imagine we plot some points from X one and X two if you like, we generate X one and X two from some distribution, from the bivariate normal distribution, in particular."
"So the mean of X one is, let's say mew one and the mean of X two is mew two."
Okay.
"Arley, maybe set the stage with your own take on the budget."
The big picture.
"Where do you see this going in terms of a negotiation for Grand Bargain, the likelihood of that happening, the politics in the"
House especially?
"And then set the stage, if you will, for the challenges that CSBG is going to face which are going to be very, very big for FY ""14."
Arley:
I'll probably speak briefly about CSBG and then have the CSBG presentation and then speak a little bit more to that.
"In terms of the budget, and the key word is politics, the President is doing his best at this present time to try and get a Grand Bargain."
And the Grand Bargain was that he was trying to negotiate with the help of John Boehner last year prior to everything concerning sequestration.
There appear to be enough votes and some republican and democrat support in the House on what we would call a grand Bargain.
"And, of course, the issue there is whether you raise taxes a little bit more or whether you cut spending."
And what's been proven by the sequester is you cannot tax your way to prosperity and you cannot spend your way to prosperity either.
It's obvious the draconian cuts hinder and stifle the economy.
"And to cause money to grow in the economy, you've got to spend money."
After
"WWII and with the depression, FDR did it during the depression by spending money."
"When no one has money, when there's a low ebb and flow of money in the country, the government prints more money."
The government makes more money and the government puts people to work.
That's the reason why the President is concentrated on the stimulus programs.
"You hear him talking about the infrastructure, talking about roads and bridges, also talking about high speed rail and those types of things."
That's what the administration wants to do.
You have to juxtapose that against what some of the right wing of the
Republican Party want to do.
They want to cut everything.
You can't cut everything.
You've got to spend money in order to generate jobs.
In order to have jobs you've got to put some money into the industry and into different areas of the economy.
One good sign that's going on is it appears that the housing market is rebounding.
"As the housing market goes so goes construction, so goes long-term jobs."
The housing market is a good indicator that the economy is turning around.
"In terms of the unemployment rate, it is steadily coming down."
Even though there weren't that many jobs created in the last month overall the trend is still good.
"A mysterious, massive cluster of stars, that we'd now call a galaxy."
"And back then, what we could know about the universe was limited by the amount of data that we could collect, and things just aren't the same anymore."
"Modern astrophysics looks not like this, but like this."
A picture of a million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
"Each dot, an individual system of  hundreds of billions of suns."
"And if we want to understand the evolution of the universe, if we want to understand how we got this wonderful universe that we see around us, we need to study these galaxies."
But there's a problem.
The problem is that we don't really like the universe that we've ended up with.
We've got this 96% of the universe in a form that we don't understand.
In dark matter and dark energy.
And so we need to pay closer attention to each one of these millions and billions of galaxies.
"We need to treat them not as points of light, but as individual spirals or galaxies, because the shapes of the galaxies tell us about their history."
So you can tell that this spiral galaxy  has had a very different past from a big ball of stars that we call the elliptical.
That's what we set out to do.
We set out to try and identify the shapes of the galaxies.
And that's a task that humans are much better at than computers.
"We're very good at this sort of pattern recognition task, and computers are really rather poor."
"We tried getting a student to look at a million galaxies, and I can tell you that, after about  the first 50,000, they give up."
And so we needed a new solution.
We decided to call for help.
"We set up a web site called ""Galaxy Zoo""."
This is what it looks like today.
"And Galaxy Zoo asked everyone in the world to help us classify these galaxies, to say what shape they are."
"And on the first couple of days at Galaxy Zoo, we got this amazing response."
"We were doing 70,000 galaxy classifications every hour."
"And while we haven't continued at that speed, over time, we've done hundreds of millions of classifications from hundreds of thousands of people."
"And the even better news is that, taken together, those classifications are more accurate than those supplied by professional astronomers."
"The crowd does not make mistakes, and it has endless enthusiasm for this task of sorting through pictures of the universe."
But actually that's not the interesting part.
Something else very interesting happens when you invite hundreds of thousands of people  to take part in your research.
"What happens is that you have to remember that yes, there's a crowd, but the crowd is made up of individuals."
So here's one of our classifiers.
"We believe that secrecy is trumped by honesty, and corporate interest by community."
We believe that the web is more cared for than owned.
More of a resource to be tended to than a mere commodity to be sold.
And we strongly believe in innovation that puts users front and center and squarely in the driver seat.
"But most importantly, we believe in you."
"We believe that the world's best browser is made possible by engineers, programmers, designers, people just like you, who give their time, talents, energy and support to the cause."
"And we believe that together with this cause in mind we can continue to innovate for the benefit of the individual and the betterment of the web, so that it always and forever serves the greater good."
We are all Mozilla Firefox.
We are not just a different kind of browser.
We are a browser that's making a difference.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; We are now going to discuss the multivariate normal distribution.
The multivariate normal distribution is a very important distribution in finance.
"It crops up in many different applications including, for example, mean variance analysis and asset allocation, as well as geometric Brownian motion and the"
Black-Scholes[UNKNOWN].
"So we say an n-dimensional vector, X, is multivariate normal with mean vector Mu and covariance matrix Sigma; if the PDF of"
X is given to us by this quantity here.
"Okay, so the PDF is equal to 1 over 2 pi to the power of n over 2, times the terminant of the covarience matrix raised to the power of a half, times the exponential of this quantity up here."
"And be right that X is multivariate normal Mu, sigma."
"The little subscript n here, denotes the dimensionality of the vector x."
"The standard multivariate normal, has mean vector mu equal to 0, and variance covariance matrix equal to the n by n identity matrix."
"And in this case, the xi's are independent."
"We can actually see that, because in this case we can write, the joint PD f of x, as being equal to the product."
I equals one to in.
One over route to pie e to the minus a half x i squared.
"And that follows just from this line here because mu equals zero so this term disappears, and Sigma is just the identity."
"So, in fact, you just end up with a sum of xi squared divided by 2."
So as we saw in an earlier module on multivariant distributions.
"If the joint PDF factorizes into a product of marginal PDF's, then the random variables are independent."
Okay.
The moment generating function of x is given to us by this quantity here.
So phi subscript x of s is actually a function of s.
Okay this vector s.
"You may say, ""But the water is cold!"""
You need to understand that there is nothing that is not energy
"### and the water, no matter how fast it is occurring internally, is energy. ###"
"Put your hand into the cold water, then get some warm water and put your hand into the warm water, and try to feel."
"If you are somewhere that windy hard, try to learn with the wind, to feel the wind."
"There is one thing we don't pay much attention, but our chakras work with types of energy."
"For example, the sex chakra, what kind of energy does it work with?"
"It works with dense energies, it will work with pasty energies, right?"
"It will work with energies like the wind, it works with that energy."
Any energy that touches your body is identified by your sex chakra.
"So, these are the energies that sex chakra will deals with."
"For example, water is a liquid energy, but it can handle that energy, it responds to it."
This answer will be better defined according to the competence of your chakra.
"So if you take, for example, the coronary chakra, it does a very different reading than sex chakra."
"If you, for example, touch the water, the same water you are touching with your hands, to feel the sex chakra, pour a bit of this water over your head and try to feel."
Perhaps you'll be able to perceive the difference that exists in the perception of each chakra.
"You may say ""But I'm using my hands"""
"No, you can use the foot, you can use any part of the body."
"But when I'm talking about coronary chakra,"
"I'm certainly speaking about the farthest chakra of sex chakra, where perceptions are different."
"If you do something with the other chakras that are close to the sex chakra you'll not be able to fell, you'll not be able to perceive the difference."
"So, sex chakra and coronary chakra, will provide different perceptions."
You can also perceive this when the wind touch on your face.
"Feel the wind on your face and then feel the wind on your legs, check if there is a difference in perception."
"If you are very emotional, this difference hardly appears."
"If your consciousness is already at heart chakra, at the top or above, it becomes very clear."
"It's the same process for a person who is clairvoyant, when a person can see more images and distinguish better than someone else."
"So if you show someone a landscape, that landscape can be read in many ways."
"A person who is very advanced level, the reading of everything is much more acurated."
It's like you looking at a person.
"If you look at a person, the person is composed of many items."
Someone will look and not see anything and the other will see many details in that person.
"You didn't get that parking ticket that irked you so much... or you, unfortunately, never met your wife."
Anything that is physically possible actually does occur... in some other parallel universe.
"It means that in one universe, Elvis Presley is still alive."
In a different level-one universe...
George W. Bush is the baseball commissioner.
Or perhaps we don't exist at all in some of these universes.
The implications are staggering.
And if the universe is infinite... and there really are all these level-one universes... in the infinite multiverse... all those other possibilities did somewhere happen.
"Technically, there are a couple of ways mathematically... for the universe to be truly infinite... but, essentially, it must be shown to be flat."
The universe seems to be perfectly flat... which means either the universe is flat... or is curved so slightly that we can't see it.
"In this case, the universe would eventually curve back in on itself... and form a hypersphere."
It would then be finite in size and volume... and not flat and infinite.
Another way to look at this is that the universe... may have inflated so quickly and so enormously... that it only looks flat.
Think of a bug walking on a gigantic balloon.
"The larger the balloon, the flatter things get."
"The bug walks in any direction, and the bug says..."
"""Well, the universe seems perfectly flat to me."""
But from a distance... we see that the bug is walking on a gigantic balloon.
But now an amazing new tool... the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe or WMAP... is changing everything.
Some say the remarkable images reveal the true shape of the universe.
"What we have here are baby pictures of the universe... what it looked like when it was only 400,000 years old."
We're looking so far back in time... that the galaxies hadn't even formed yet.
"We just had this dead, diffuse gas which, gradually, overtime... clumped into galaxies, stars, planets."
The WMAP is catching the very earliest signs of creation.
"Officially, it is tasked with measuring radiation..."
left over from the Big Bang.
But now some scientists have devised an experiment... to calculate the overall shape of the universe.
"If I send light rays through space... and make a gigantic triangle, going from us here... out to the farthest edges of what we can see and then back... the angles of those- that triangle should add up to exactly 180 degrees."
If the universe is curved like a balloon... the angles of the giant triangle would add up... to more than 180 degrees.
To find out if the universe is flat or curved... they shot laser beams deep into space... and made a giant light triangle.
"Now we can tell, and the measurement is in... and the answer is, it works beautifully."
The angles add up to exactly 180 degrees.
"Essentially, we think that the slow diffusion of computers, which people were predicting should increase productivity as way back as the 1980s, suddenly in the 1990s it really happened."
And this IT revolution led to a big productivity increase.
"It's not clear if that's dying down now again, or if it's going to continue."
It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next 15 years.
"So we have this period of high productivity growth, slowed down from '73 to the early '90s and then picked up again."
"We're not quite clear if that year's coming to an end or not, but that's sort of where we are now in that time path."
"What's very interesting-- so that's what happens to productivity, that's all I'll talk about it for this course, it's more of a macro topic."
But I will mention an interesting micro spin on that.
"Which is, if society's more productive, that's like found money for society."
That's like saying with all our resources we suddenly get extra money.
Society then has to decide what to do with that.
The US and Europe have followed very different paths in what to do with that money.
"In the US, we've taken that money and bought a lot more stuff."
We have the highest standard of living in the world.
We buy the most stuff per capita of anyone the world.
"In Europe, they took a lot of that money and took more"
leisure with it.
"They decided we're not going to quite have as much stuff, but we're going to have six weeks a year of vacation instead of two weeks a year of vacation."
So if we go back to our discussion of what determines
"labor supply is the choice between leisure and consumption, and you think of the wage as the opportunity cost of leisure, well, what they've decided in Europe is to choose more along the leisure axis, and less along the consumption axis."
"In the US, we've chosen less among the leisure axis-- we work way harder than Europe-- but we have more stuff."
"And the question is, how do we feel about that choice?"
Has that been ultimately a welfare maximizing choice?
"Now an economist will say of course it's been, because it's a choice we made."
"Of course, it's been welfare maximizing."
"We talk about revealed preference, and people's choices reveal what they prefer."
"So our revealed preference, we just prefer stuff more and"
leisure less than Europe.
"But in fact, it's not clear that that is each individual's optimal choice."
"If a given individual says, look, I'd rather have less stuff and more time off, it may be hard to find the job that lets them do that."
"So while that may be the choice we've made as a society with our social institutions, that may not serve the interests of every individual in society."
And that's the kind of trade-off we need to think about.
"I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend to understand the genetics."
And that's why it's great to have collaboration.
"Whereas I'm a field person,"
I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on.
Take me away.
So we can work with geneticists who understand that.
"So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks, they found that the diversity was incredibly low."
"If you look at the first line, really, you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar."
I think this means they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry.
"But if you look at nucleotide diversity, which is more genetics that are passed on through the parents, you see that basking sharks, if you look at the first study, was order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species."
You can see this work was only done in 2006.
"Before 2006, we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks."
We had no idea:
Did they distinguish into different populations?
Were there subpopulations?
"And that's very important if you want to know what the population size is, and the status of the animals."
"So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable, really."
"So he did another study using microsatellites, which is much more expensive, much more time-consuming, and to his surprise, came up with almost identical results."
"So it does seem to be that basking sharks, for some reason, have incredibly low diversity."
"And it's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck, thought to have been 12,000 years ago, and this has caused a very low diversity."
"And yet, if you look at the whale shark, which is the other plankton-eating large shark, its diversity is much greater."
So it doesn't really make sense at all.
"They found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks: even though they're found throughout the world, you couldn't tell the difference, genetically, from one from the Pacific, Atlantic, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa."
They all basically seem the same.
"Which, again, is kind of surprising; you wouldn't expect that."
I don't understand or pretend to understand this;
"I suspect most geneticists don't either, but they produce the numbers."
So you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics.
And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size:
"8,200 animals."
"That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world."
"You're thinking, ""That's ridiculous."
"And that's called an affordance, and that's not just in the real world, but also in the physical world."
All these various widgets have these physical properties that are baked into their visual design.
"When you look at one of these, you can very quickly infer how you are going to interact with it because of those properties."
"The way that the circle's slightly larger makes it seem grabbable, the way that it's brighter on one side implies that it's been sort of filled so it feels like a track that you can grab this thing and move it on."
"Seeing a check box, a square in the presence of one that has a check box, is going to convey that that one could also have a check box."
"On and off, literally writing it on the switch is going more towards the direction of writing your manual on top of it, but the visual design conveys what it does, the same with the button."
So these are all affordances.
"Basically, an affordance is implied physics from the visual appearance."
"Moving on to the third one, natural mapping."
So let's run a quick experiment on the audience.
Say we're looking at a stove.
"So the second dial, which burner does it control?"
"And silence, you don't know, because there's no way to figure it out."
"We could literally write the glyphs on top of it, that would help."
"But the thing is, writing your manual directly on the product is cheating."
Then what if it wears off?
"That's definitely one way of doing it, but it's not a natural mapping."
"A better Ul, and this is something that Alan Cooper"
"likes to talk about, is if the dials were in that same configuration as four things, then it just naturally affords which burner they control."
This is also always true of light switches.
"So light switches only are frustrating when they don't actually map in order to the lights in the room, and if they do map in order, you usually just flip the right one without even thinking about it."
"If they don't, then you start randomly hitting them to try to figure it out and getting frustrated."
So this is a natural mapping.
"Another example, controls in a car."
"I love this one, because it's actually two natural mappings at the same time."
"The first is it's directly below the window, so it's a sort of natural orientation to where the window is, and also the four controls map to the four windows in the car."
"Sometimes, these are placed on the center console, which is really weird."
So that's in the physical world.
"In terms of the virtual world, we have things like this where the Full Screen control has a natural mapping to the window becoming larger."
It's placed on the edge.
It seems to afford expanding.
"In this case, the Account Selector has a mapping to the window, because the account controls the window as a whole, not an individual tab."
I think is a shame.
I would like this to be in the language -- or would have liked it to be in the language -- for two reasons.
One is the loop affordances it provides expect you're always going to exit either at the top or the bottom of the loop.
"I don't know if it's something weird about me, but I tend to exit out of the middle more often than"
I exit out of either end.
[laughter]
You can do that.
"Just say 'while true', which just looks stupid."
This is the more elemental thing.
The other is that it makes it easier to think about the language.
If this were the primitive loop statement and all of the others were simply variations on that then the language in its core would be smaller and easier to reason about.
"So when you're thinking about the language's security, you have less analysis to do."
I think that would be a useful thing.
"For example, we can take a while statement and de-sugar it into a simple loop statement."
You can see by the amount of de-sugaring it does that the while statement really isn't buying us very much.
We can do a similar thing with the do while statement.
"It's sort of interesting: while the 'do while' looks very different than the 'while' statement, what it does is actually almost identical."
The only difference is that it put the test on one end rather than on the other.
"Then when you look at what the 'for' statement actually does, it really doesn't do anything at all."
It just is complicated.
"Another way that you could think about doing iteration, another way of doing a loop, would be to use recursion."
"Another way that we could have transformed the while statement would be to turn it into a function which calls itself, and continues to call itself as long as the condition is true, with two restrictions."
"One is that because of the way functions work in JavaScript, you can't take any arbitrary code and put it inside of a body here."
"Arguments, this, break statements and return statements, the meanings of all of those change when you put them into a function, so you can't put them in the body here."
The other — more important — thing is that JavaScript does not implement tail recursion optimization
-- what people call proper tail calls.
"You can run for a while, and then it's going to start to slow down as it accumulates memory, and eventually it's going to fail."
You don't
like it when programs fail.
"I'm hoping that maybe someday in the distant future JavaScript would be enhanced to allow this, but it doesn't yet."
But that's not the kind of loop that I'm here to talk about tonight.
"I'm here to talk about event loops, because event loops are much more interesting."
Every night!
"Something is seriously askew, and we should really talk about it."
"Right now, half of the total global wheat harvest is used as livestock feed to support our meat and dairy consumption."
"Half of the entire harvest, while, at the same time, people in poor countries are starving."
And there doesn't seem to be an end to this.
We keep on consuming more and more and more.
"And, in the future, we will have to exploit other people's natural resources even more than we do now."
"And this will be at the expense of those people, clean water, clean air and also our environment."
"So, let me sum this up for you."
Scientists say that it simply takes far more land and energy to produce animal protein than plant-based ones.
To produce animal products you need up to ten times as much land as is needed to produce vegetable products.
And this is due to the fact that all this land is needed to produce feed for these billions of farm animals.
Films like An Inconvenient Truth have made a very important contribution to the debate on global warming.
Yet the only cow that I saw on-screen symbolised little Al's picture-perfect youth in Tennessee.
In the whole Inconvenient Truth not a single word was said about
"livestock farming, or the impact of this polluting industry."
"Dr. Steinfeld, how is it possible that livestock doesn't play a role in the discussion about global warming?"
"Well, I think that the fact is that in the climate change discussion much of the focus is on carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide emissions if you look at the livestock sector only make up about one third of the total greenhouse gas emissions."
"Nitrous oxides and methane don't come very strongly into the debate, but they are much more potent in terms of greenhouse gasses and carbon dioxide and they need to be factored in."
But Al Gore didn't say one single word about the livestock industry in his documentary.
What do you think?
Didn't you miss the aspect as well?
It is certainly missing; the entire aspect of food is missing.
And I think that everyone needs to know that food and agriculture contributes to climate change and has environmental impact.
"And that one needs to make choices, if one wants to be environmentally friendly, that are in line with the environmental impact of producing various types of food."
"Well, I think that he should have said something about it."
Have you ever tried to convince him?
"Well, I'm not someone who knows Al Gore personally."
"I think that at my level publishing results and talking at conferences, and talking to the media such as in this case is all I can do."
"Well, thank you."
He doesn't know it either.
"So, I went to the United States to find an answer to this question."
"I got 5,000 unknowns, I've got, 500 constraints, you know what?"
"Four and a half thousand of these are going to just be zero, I know that from the beginning."
Have to pick out which ones.
"But if you did a histogram, you could see this big spike, of information zero."
"Its going to try to set, four and a half thousand things to zero."
"Its not going to try, it will set, and its going to pick 500 things to be non-zero that satisfy this and give you this small L norm."
"Okay, Promotes sparsity and the fact is you know there's sparsity in the signal, okay."
In this section we're going to talk about celiac disease and the gluten free diet.
So what is celiac disease?
Celiac is an autoimmune disease.
"It's also called gluten sensitive enteropathy, or celiace sprue."
"In celiac disease, gluten, which is a component of food, leads to villus atrophy, in the small intestine."
"The only therapeutic approach that has been known to treat celiac disease effectively, is maintenance of and adherence to a gluten-free diet."
Here's a picture of what villus atrophy
looks like.
On the left-hand side you can see what a normal healthy small intestine looks like.
"You notice all of these finger-like projections, the villi, which is where the majority of nutrients are absorbed."
"In celiac disease, the presence of gluten in the foods cuts down the height of the intestinal villi, and you end up with this flattened surface, like you see here."
"A flattened surface like this, cannot effectively absorb nutrients."
And so the people who have celiac disease end up having a variety of deficiencies of micro nutrients.
"Not to mention, absorption problems that often times result in things like diarrhea."
How prevalent is celiac disease?
Well researchers go back and forth about just how many people we think have it.
"One of the problems is, many people who have celiac disease are not diagnosed."
"In the US, historically, we've said that the rates are 1 in 133, there's other statistics that suggest it might be more"
like 1 in 100.
"In Europe, it's somewhere between that amount, and it's even higher in individuals who have a first degree relative."
"So the likelihood is that you have a 1 in 22 chance, of having celiac, if you have a first degree relative with it."
"Again, one of the problems is, that very few people who have celiac disease are actually ever diagnosed."
"We're seeing increasing rates of diagnosis with celiac disease, not because more people are getting it, but because the testing mechanism is more sensitive and more specific."
"And to be honest, practitioners are looking for celiac more now than they did previously."

"If we treat an encryption function--as the one in GSM--as something that takes a message, produces an encrypted message, and it consumes a key to perform that."
There are different ways in which you can make this resistant against time-memory trails.
Three different mitigations.
"First, you can make the message unpredictable."
Sounds obvious.
Why would you encrypt something predictable?
"But a lot of systems do just encrypt a whole stream of data, some of which is encrypted."
Something is worth protecting.
GSM mixes the two.
[Dave]
All of these attacks you know some--because of the GSM protocol-- there are some messages that are very easy to guess. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [Carson]
Exactly.
[Dave]
And you know what they are and can you those in this attack.
"To exchange a text message, for instance, between the base station and your phone, somewhere between 20 and 40 messages are exchanged, only one of which has the actual text message content."
Another one may have some unpredictable set of information.
All the rest is just management information--encrypted though-- and that management information is usually--
[Dave]
Does it make sense as one solution to not encrypt the management information.
[Carson]
"Clear, yeah."
There's a standard extension that suggests exactly that.
But basically the whole ecosystem would have to change to accommodate for that.
"Currently, it's just the encryption is switched on at some point and everything thereafter is encrypted, be it predictable or not."
"There are measures, though, to make predictable messages more randomized to create some wiggle room for how you send a message."
"That's currently being deployed--not in all networks, though."
I've not seen--one of the two American networks I don't think has it.
You need to know the base station is understanding if you change the protocol like that.
"The base station would have to change to go all the way of making all messages unpredictable, but even changing the base station controllers, bigger installations that control dozens of base stations that control dozens of base stations would do the job, and those are usually software updateable, because they have to accommodate for usually faster connections all the time."
A good example of a house in a more rural part of Connecticut.
"So keep these things in mind as you're thinking about your own behavior, the way you grew up, and you try to consider how your lifestyle choices influenced your family's consumption level."
"Also, I want you to think about the idea of size, and how we are increasingly dependent upon many consumer products in our lives that are larger than they used to be."
And housing is no exception.
"So that the average house size in 2009 is grown to about 2,500 square feet, with about two point three on average people per house."
That's really pretty remarkable.
"So you know, roughly 1,000 square feet per person."
"Whereas back in 1950, the average number of people in a house was much closer to three, a little bit over three with the post-World War II baby boom, with a total size of 800 square feet."
So the house size has grown by three fold.
"In 1970, it grew to 1,500 feet."
So the energy demands of a larger house like that are actually quite difficult to predict if you try to take into account the diversity of building materials.
"Boy, I apologize for this."
"And, you know, one of you might go outside and"
let them know that there's a lecture going on in here.
That would be really nice.
The construction is creating also diesel fumes inside the building.
Many of the garages that you find in suburban areas also have grown in size.
So here's an example of a garage that is actually larger than the average house size was back in 1950.
"This is probably about a twenty-two, twenty-three by thirty foot house."
"So that's roughly 1,200 square feet, pretty interesting."
Now think about the way that space is laid out.
So here's a studio apartment on the right hand side.
"And you see a dining table, a kitchenette, walk-in closet and a bath on the upper level."
Whereas the base level is dominated by a garage.
So that we're allocating less space indoors to our bedrooms than we are to our auto storage areas.
"Also, many buildings are now constructed with much more glass in them than previously."
And the newer high-end buildings are using special glass that is designed to reflect radiation so that it's not absorbed.
But different glasses are really designed for different climatic regions so that some are more efficient at reflecting radiation that are used in southern climates that are warmer.
"And others are more efficient at providing insulation, so they've got a barrier in the interior that basically protects against heat loss."
"So that overall though, buildings' increased use of windows has created increased energy demands."
Also lighting.
And also the way that we have increasingly designed bathrooms to have more than one fixture.
"And you can see, in blue we have the three peaks, where the immediate release is up to three times a day."
The sustained release goes up to twice a day.
"So you can see that same coverage of spectrum, and the XL is once a day."
"You're going to get ultimately equivalent doses, and equivalent action throughout the day, with whatever agent you use."
"But the XL, actually, is I think a nice drug option in this population, if it's actually covered on the insurance."
"They're almost all generic now, so it is becoming not an issue."
"But the Buproprion XL is just a nice, clean agent that we can utilize so we don't have issues with"
late evening activation or anything like that.
Mirtazapine is probably one of the most confusing agents we have.
It's an Alpha-2 antagonist.
And we're going to try to walk through how the medication works.
This is not a reuptake inhibitor.
So it's a completely different shift of how we're doing antidepressants.
"It's that we're actually going to try to stimulate the manufacturing, so to speak, of the neurotransmitters."
"So, you can see that we have action on the alpha 2 antagonist's effects, to increase both serotonin and norepinephrine."
And we do this - inserting this drug - on different areas of the neurotransmitters.
"And then, these two neurons talk to each other with the end result of increasing norepinephrine, which is actually the triangles, and the serotonin, which is the little yellow tadpoles."
"So, you do get a dual-action, it's just not in the same way that we've done in the past, where we've kindof blocked that pump action, where the neurotransmitter can't get sucked back up."
This time we're actually trying to stimulate action.
"So, Mirtazapine has multiple formulations, again."
"Remeron, Remeron Sol Tab, Mirtazapine, and Mirtazapine Sol Tab."
The SoluTab does not have any absorption increase rate.
It's just a benefit in patients who have swallowing difficulties.
It's not absorbed in the mouth; it just dissolves.
"Which might be helpful in the elderly, for example."
"This is an Alpha 2 antagonist 5HT3, 2A, 2C antagonist."
"So, what we'll show you in the next slide is how we're kind of targeting where - directing, exactly which serotonin receptors we want the serotonin to go to once we've increased it, to help control some of the side effects."
The dosage is anywhere from 15 to 45 milligrams to be dosed at bedtime.
The side effects with this drug are kind of unique.
"We've got sedation, which is why it's just at bedtime."
"Interestingly, the lower end of the doses are more sedating than the higher end of the doses."
"So, 15 milligrams is actually more tiring than 45, but they should always all be dosed at bedtime."
"So because you can't control the people, you feel like well, I'll spend more attention on the things that I can control, the execution time, the amount of storage being used, if it's crashing or not, if it's reproducible."
"And it's not entirely true that people aren't controllable because really, what we're fundamentally dealing with is two information processing machines."
"And that's of course, the CPU and the brain."
"And in some ways, they're very similar, they're both doing computation, one parallel processing, the other one massively parallel."
"One's base2, the other one's based on action potential, so you have dramatically more computational power."
But where they start to be different is we know exactly how computers work.
"We can go back and talk to a lot of people that were kind of instrumental in the field, it hasn't been that long."
"So computer scientists, there's things they're still discovering about how to make things efficient, but it's not"
like there's any part of the machine we don't understand yet.
"Whereas if you talk to someone doing neuroscience or cognitive science, you say, how does the brain work?"
"They have to kind of shrug and say, we're still trying to figure that out."
And that's OK.
We don't have to have a complete knowledge of how the brain works to still have predictable results.
There's enough that we understand about it that we can rely on to get those predictable results.
"So for the purpose of this talk, it's really kind of dehumanizing where we're going to treat people like information processing machines."
"You might think, well no, I'm a special snowflake."
"And yes, you are."
"But you're also, for the purpose of this talk, a uniform snow processing machine."
So three aspects of a great interface.
"First, it needs to be self-describing."
"Secondly, you need to prevent errors, and then third, make users fast."
So we're going to dive into each of these.
"So starting out, self-describing."
"The first thing I want to talk about is this notion of mental model, and a mental model is basically a simulation of reality inside of your mind."
"So to pose a question, how many instances of this talk are happening right now?"
"And of course, the answer is one."
It's right there.
The photons are bouncing off the screen at you.
"And when you're in a big room, you've got the talk there, and that's reality."
"But then on another side, you have the fact that everyone is interpreting the talk in a simulation of the room inside their own head."
"So you have all these simulations going on, and these are the mental models they're building of the reality around them."
"So this is very sort of dystopian movie, maybe we're all in our little pods and we don't know it."
"Yeah, but this was not just any frog."
"Unlike a normal frog, which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well, this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs, swallowed them into the stomach, where it should be having food, didn't digest the eggs, and turned its stomach into a uterus."
"In the stomach, the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles, and in the stomach, the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs, and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart."
"It has a little cough and a hiccup, and out comes sprays of little frogs."
"Now, when biologists saw this, they were agog."
"They thought, this is incredible."
"No animal, let alone a frog, has been known to do this, to change one organ in the body into another."
And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well.
"If we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works, is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves?"
"Now, I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach, but I am suggesting it's possible we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut."
"And just as everybody got excited about it, bang!"
It was extinct.
"I called up my friend,"
Professor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide.
"He was the last person who had this frog, a colony of these things, in his lab."
"And I said, ""Mike, by any chance --"" This was 30 or 40 years ago."
"""By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog?"""
"And he thought about it, and he went to his deep freezer, minus 20 degrees centigrade, and he poured through everything in the freezer, and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs."
"This was very exciting, but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work, because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it, cryoprotectants, to look after it when it was frozen."
"And normally, when water freezes, as you know, it expands, and the same thing happens in a cell."
"If you freeze tissues, the water expands, damages or bursts the cell walls."
"Well, we looked at the tissue under the microscope."
It actually didn't look bad.
The cell walls looked intact.
"So we thought, let's give it a go."
What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation.
"We took the eggs of a related species, a living frog, and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg."
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that.
And then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that egg.
"Now, by rights, this is kind of like a cloning project,"
"like what produced Dolly, but it's actually very different, because Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells."
"That was a miracle, but it was workable."
"But it's green, we did teach them about traffic lights, and next to a lock, a metaphor."
"So even if they don't get it totally right, its sort of placement and the various things that it conveys, they might get close enough to say, well, it probably means that this is better somehow."
So they're able to bootstrap conceptually just up enough.
"Or another example, this one more visual."
"We bring them in and we say, what does this application do?"
"And they're going to say, it's very pretty."
"And then they're going to say, I don't know, because while this icon is pretty, also I think, did you work on this one?"
MALE SPEAKER:
No.
ALEX FAABORG:
All right.
"For the designer in the room who worked on this, I'm sorry."
"It's a great icon, but it does not convey to the user in this test chamber with access to no other knowledge, what it actually does."
"It is a great application, though."
"It's shipped on all the devices you guys have, you should check it out."
I use it everyday.
This is Currents.
So what does this app do?
They're not going to know.
"So I would argue that success in these situations, it doesn't have to do with their intelligence, it has to do with access to information."
Is that information embodied in the thing that they're using?
"So quickly you're thinking, all right, well, what if I don't have this underground testing facility?"
That sounds really expensive.
"And that's true, and this is controversial, it's especially controversial for any user researchers in the room, or user researchers watching later."
"But I would argue while it's really, really useful to have access to user researchers, you don't absolutely have to rely on them."
"You could just start running user tests in your own head, basically short-term amnesia."
"What you have to do is you have to kind of encapsulate your mind, you have to start thinking, forgetting the things that you know about your interface, try to look at it with fresh eyes, try to think, OK, I've never seen this thing before, which is hard because you have seen it before, really, really hard."
"But if you can do that, if you can look at it with fresh eyes and try to have all the assumptions fall away that you've already built up, then you're able to do that kind of user test just on yourself quickly right then."
"And if you're just regularly doing that, it's going to really improve your applications."
I think this is one of the most important things that I can convey.
"But obviously, you're going to be more familiar with the underlying implementation because you are literally building it."
"In the case of a clock, you are probably intimately familiar with each of the gears and how they fit together and all of these details, but you have to just"
[crowd laughing]
AYE.
It's approved.
[crowd cheers and claps]
"In this lesson, you learned about estimating population parameters with confidence intervals and then analyzing whether or not a search and treatment may have had an effect."
"So the examples we've used so far are the Bieber tweeter, we wanted to see it's influence on klout scores."
"And then the other treatment was the song about hypothesis testing for lesson nine, which I seriously might do."
"After all this talk about it, I'm really curious about whether or not this will work."
I guess we'll just have to wait and see the results of the poll where you rated your engagement and learning.
"Speaking of which, that's the dependent variable."
In the next lesson you'll learn how to formalize the procedure of deciding whether or not the sample receiving treatment had likely or unlikely statistics.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DOUGLAS CROCKFORD:
Thanks everybody for coming back for what turns out to be Scene 6:
Loopage [in the Crockford on JavaScript series].
"Before we begin, I recently read a white paper: some guys comparing two application platforms, one written in C++ and one written in Java."
"They went through the features, comparing them and deciding which of the platforms was better."
"When they got to garbage collection, they said garbage collection is a programmer convenience."
But then they evaluated the two systems based on how large a convenience it appeared to be.
"They measured the number of dispose instructions in the C++ code and found that there wasn't a lot of that, and then determined that it was more than a programmer convenience, which was completely wrong."
That's not what garbage collection is.
Garbage collection is a reliability mechanism.
Having garbage collection means you're not going to have dangling pointer errors and all these other hazards.
It also means there's a large class of wonderful algorithms that you can consider that are really too dangerous to consider if you don't have garbage collection.
So they completely screwed up their analysis.
"Basically their conclusion was: if you're into C++, you can feel good about not understanding Java."
That turns out to be a really bad way to think about things.
"You really should be making decisions based on good information and deep understanding, and very often that's not what we do."
But that's not what I'm going to be talking about tonight.
I'm going to be talking about loops.
Here's a loop statement.
"It says loop and you've got a block, and as you would expect, all of the statements within the block will get repeated over and over and over until something happens."
"JavaScript doesn't have a statement that looks quite like that, which"
"How do we enter that feeling of resonance, how do we enter another person's being?"
"I remember when I interacted with that 15-month-old, the thing that came to my mind was,"
"""How do you come into her world?"
Is she thinking about me?
"Is she thinking about others?"""
"Well, it's hard to do that, so we had to create the technologies."
We had to basically step inside a body.
We had to see the world through her eyes.
"And so in the past many years, we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking."
"We can see, moment by moment, what children are engaging with."
"This is my colleague, Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years."
"And you see there a happy five-month-old, a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world: his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare."
"What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory, but in order for us to do that, we had to create these very sophisticated measures, measures of how people, how little babies, how newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment."
What is important and what is not.
"Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention."
You're watching a video -- those frames are separated by about a second -- through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds.
"And we freeze one frame, and this is what the typical children are doing."
"In this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism."
"So on that frame, the children who are typical are watching this, the emotion of expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl."
What are the children with autism doing?
"They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting."
"Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment."
"It happens moment by moment in their real lives, and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers."
"Well, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends, the concept of growth charts -- you know, when you take a child to the pediatrician, and you have physical height and weight."
"Well, we decided we were going to create growth charts of social engagement."
We sought children from the time they're born.
"What you see here on the x-axis is two, three, four, five, six months and nine, until about the age of 24 months."
"This is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes, and this is their growth chart."
They start over here -- they love people's eyes -- and it remains quite stable.
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.
"Now, let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic."
It's something very different.
And this machine lowers this building over the canal.
"And the water evaporates by the sun and condenses on the inside, and you get drinking water, desalinization, without expenditure of energy, using the sun."
"After we have filled this with salt water, it's for irrigation and flood control."
So all this water is directed towards water storage basins so you don't have flooding.
"Mr. Fresco sees a future where computer systems will monitor the world's environment and provide timely, accurate information on events that needs our immediate attention."
This represents the government of the future.
It would be cybernated.
"That means that computers will monitor farm production, harvest the crop, plant the seeds and maintain their packaging and everything else."
Whereas these various image screens will give you an image of any part of the Earth.
This represents a hurricane.
So you can see on these screens any area on Earth.
From 3000 miles out in space you can photograph plant diseases.
They show up as red.
"If you photograph the Amazon jungle, you will see a dark red area, which means those plants are ill or sick."
And so you can maintain with the satellite as the Earth rotates under the satellite.
You will be able to show people everything on Earth and every airplane in the air and every ship at sea.
"When you ask the computer, how many planes are there in the air at this instant?"
It will tell you exactly.
"It will tell you 10,408, 9, 10."
And you would be in touch with every area of the Earth by these screens.
There is no government in the future
The government is maintained electronically.
"But it is programmed to monitor food transportation, monitor the Earth, hurricanes, tsunamis, and tell people warning them of any problems."
So everyone will have this which gives them information about the Earth until we learn to control the tsunamis and the weather which i believe man will eventually be able to do.
"Man will eventually be able to control hurricanes, the weather and most disasters."
"Supreme Master Ching Hai has also spoken about the potential for wondrous technology to be available on our planet in the future, as in this excerpt from a July 2008 videoconference with Supreme Master Television staff in Los Angeles, California, USA."
"The technology that we are having right now is nothing, nothing compared to what we will have if all the population of the planet turn to a loving kind compassionate vegetarian diet."
"Then you will see all kind of inventions that we have never imagined before, will surface."
"And all people will live in peace and love, even if they don't pray for it."
It will come.
"Our sincere thanks Jacque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows, for taking time to introduce The Venus Project and its underlying philosophy to us."
May a sustainable planet with everyone's needs met soon be a reality.
"And soon enough, they start building this body of meanings, but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction."
Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others.
"Well, this is a 15-month-old little girl, and she has autism."
"And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face, and she's quite oblivious to me."
"Imagine if I did that to you, came two inches from your face."
"You'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?"
You would recoil.
You would call the police.
(Laughter)
"You would do something, because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction."
"We do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly."
This is our body wisdom; it's not something mediated by our language.
Our body just knows that.
And we've known that for a long time.
And this is not something that happens to humans only.
"It happens to some of our phyletic cousins, because if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey, and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you, and that is considered to be a signal or threat, well, you are not going to be alive for long."
"So something that in other species are survival mechanisms, without which they wouldn't basically live, we bring into the context of human beings, and this is what we need to simply act, socially."
"Now, she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her, and you think, maybe she can see you, maybe she can hear you."
"Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;amp;M."
"So I could not attract her attention, but something -- a thing -- did."
"Now, most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people."
"Now, for this girl, that division line is not so clear, and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like."
"Now, remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences."
"What she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging, moment by moment, as she is isolating herself further and further."
"So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic, the brain determines who we're going to be."
"But, in fact, the brain also becomes who we are, and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction, this is what's happening with her mind, and this is what's happening with her brain."
"Well, autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders."
And it's a brain disorder.
It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born.
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted.
There are those individuals who don't talk at all; there are those individuals who talk too much.
In search of pastures and water sources they frequently cross the border with their cattle and goats.
"Cholima Logid, a father of nine used to cross the border to trade livestock. but he was confronted with different challenges."
Diseases cross the border with ease.
Pastoraslists can only rely on services offered at endpoints in either Uganda or Kenya.
Like here in Moroto Uganda where local organizations maintain routine checkups.
But there are differences in the quality and the prices of the veterinary services offered on both sides of the border.
And the lack of coordination makes it difficult to control disease outbreaks.
"With support from the European Union and ECHO this situation prompted IGAD, FAO and other organizations to initiate programs harmonized animal health care on both sides of the border."
April 2013 a Memorandum of Understanding between the government of Uganda and Kenya is signed.
The agreement commits both governments to develop programs for animal health care in the border regions.
The local NGO ACTED initiated the process.
ACTED's role began in August 2011. when we initiated a cross-border meeting ona very local level just among the district veterinary officers.
At that time it was to address and outbreak of Brucellosis.
We learned at that time that the dvos didn't have the freedom to work together without blessings from their ministries. and as a result we needed to move to ministry level.
Under the RlSPA initiative
"FAO liaised with the governments of Uganda and Kenya and animal health coordination was moved up the political agenda, resulting in the"
Memorandum of Understanding.
The next step is now to implement.
And the implementation entails development of a program program that is going to look up specifics on how to coordinate and share information.
Number two on how to have common activities.
For example in animal health.
How will they synchronize the vaccinations and treatment information.
The sharing and surveillance.
So that's a critical part of memorandum.
After the devastating drought that hit the Horn of African in 2011 governments in Eastern Africa spearheaded initiatives to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities
This new partnership is an important step.
One of the first issues to tackle is a frequenty reported lack of drugs to treat sick livestock.
Here Timothy Kelae is spraying a goat against tick.
But getting the spray and other treatments and medicines is a major issue.
The MoU will not necessarily provide the drugs  but the key thing is the implemenation of it which is going to be through the program.
The program now will go specifically to where the need is.
If there is a need of drugs
"So, not really legally trademark violation cos it's distinct enough but certainly perceived as unfriendly, awkward and difficult."
"That went on for a while, and Brendan and the rest of us posted something that said"
"""OK, you're right, we're gonna change the name we'll change it before we ship our next version."""
"That was a problem, because it meant that the version was ready to ship before we had a name for it."
"Shipping it with no name seemed like a loss of momentum,"
Brendan had made a commitment and we had a really intense emotional survival fight
"like a couple of weeks, I think it was a couple of weeks, to try to figure out what we were gonna call this thing."
"The developer, Ben,"
liked the idea of doing something with fire in the name.
So we went through a dictionary or a book
looking for all the words that started with fire that might make sense.
So we started going through them.
"On the side, we were doing a very professional process of thinking about ""oh, what does the browser mean?"
How do you develop a brand?
Is it navigation?
Is it freedom?
Is it these kinds of words?
What are the values you associate with it?
Is it trust or is it fun?
And there was this very professional process on the side.
"But the reality was the name was chosen when Ben had a list of words that started with fire, we started looking at the ones we liked, and then taking the ones we liked and looking to see which of them didn't have trademark problems."
And Firefox was the one.
It turned out it had a slight trademark issue but we were able to resolve that one.
"We also knew that it had a mascot, we could have an image that would be good and I think it might have been Asa who first found the Chinese red panda, that there really truly is an animal called the Firefox and it's adorable or whatever."
So there we were.
We picked the name and then were able to ship Firefox 0.8.
Seven!
Seven?
"Ok, seven."
So this would be in 2004.
"This is in the spring of 2004, we had the foundation for seven or eight months, we're burning through our money, we're trying to figure out how we're gonna support ourselves, we have a good size community, we have an office, a very funky sublet from some friends of the Mozilla project, who when the giant .com boom had gotten a lot more office space than they needed and so they'd given us this little funky sublet, there is one picture of it floating around if you've seen that picture of 10 or 12 of us at a table with the cables hanging down in the middle of it, it had no running water, you had to go back into the janitor's closet in the back of the building to get running water or to wash any dishes, we bought a portable dishwasher and we rolled it down to the janitor's closet to wash our margarine glasses, mostly."
"So we were finally able, in the midst of all of that, we have a name, we can ship our product."
"So the new path is just the SVW Path, okay?"
So [inaudible] we computed the shortest path from S to W in this graph.
So now we proceed to the final iteration of Dijkstra's algorithm.
We know what vertex we're going to bring into X. It's gonna be the vertex T. That's the only one left.
But we still have to compute by which edge we discover T and bring it into the set X. So we have to compute the [inaudible] score for each of the two crossing arcs...
VT and WT.
"And in this final iteration the score for the arc (V, T) is unchanged."
"So this is still gonna be the a value of its tail, one, plus the length of the arc, six."
So the score here is still seven.
"And now, for the first time, WT is a crossing edge of the frontier, and when we compute its score, it's the a value of its tail W, which is three, plus the length of this arc, which is three, so we get a rescore of six."
"So by Dijkstra's greedy criterion, we pick the edge wt instead of the edge VT, and of course, that doesn't matter who gets brought into X, but it does matter how we compute the A and B values for T."
So in the final iration.
"We compute AT to be the Dijkstra greedy score of the edge that we picked, which is the edge, WT and the score was six."
So we compute the shortest path distance from S to T to be six.
And then what is the path itself?
"Well, we inherit the shortest path from the tail of the arc that we used to discover T. So that's the shortest path to W, which we previously computes as being the path through V. And then we append the edge we used to discover T, so we append the edge, WT."
"So the shortest path from S to T, we're going to compute as the zig-zag path."
"S. Goes to V, goes to T, Sorry, Goes to W, goes to T. And then now indeed X is all the vertices."
We've computed it for everything.
This is our final output.
"The contents of the, especially the A array, this, the final output."
Shortest path distances from S to all of the four possible destinations.
"And if you go back and compare this to the example you went through to the quiz, you will see at least on this example, indeed."
"Dijkstra's algorithm corrects pa, the shortest path distances."
"Now, I've said it before and I'll say it again."
"If someone shows you their algorithm works just on some example, especia lly a pretty simple four note example, you should not jump to the conclusion that this algorithm always works."
"Sometimes the algorithms work fine on small examples, but break down once you go to more interesting complicated examples."
"So I definitely owe you a proof that Dijkstra's algorithm works not only in this network, but in any network."
"And actually, it doesn't work in any network."
It's only gonna work in any network with non-negative edge lengths.
"So to help you appreciate that, Let's conclude this video with a nonexample showing what goes wrong in Dijkstra's algorithm when you have networks with negative edge lengths."
"So before I actually give you a, a real non example let me just answer preliminary question which you might have and should be have very good question if it something that's occurred to you."
Not only with the poor but also with young people.
"Because in Davos, I saw that the owners of technology are mostly young."
"And so, the young people own the future."
"And so, and these are exciting times."
"I realize that that's also, you know, what innovation is about."
"Always have aspirations, always have hope so that - because aspiration drives innovation, invention and creation."
Thank you.
This course is mostly not going to be about this particular kind of fuzzing.
"Rather, the emphasis of the course is more on random testing in the original sense of fuzzing which is to say trying to find flaws in software rather than this very specific meaning of fuzzing for penetration testing purposes."
"And now one of the challenge problems for this unit is going to involve writing something with more like this kind of fuzzer, but basically mostly we're concerned with random testing sort of in the general software robustness."
Mainly we're concerned random testing as what would be applied to our own software or to software developed by other people in our own organization.
"On many an occasion I've been camping in the Adirondacks, and one of my favorite periods is right at dusk, when the lake becomes absolutely glass-like."
"The sun is setting but you can still see the silhouettes of trees - all these conical spires, beautiful reflection on the water with the last few bits of sunlight."
And then you hear the wail of a loon.
"You'll hear one individual of the pair give this long, mournful wail, which is essentially saying,"
"""I'm here."
"Where are you?"""
"Generally, moments later, you'll hear the response from the other member of the pair giving its wail, saying,"
"""I'm over here."""
Loons are active at night.
"You can be out in a beautiful Adirondack lake after dark, or a northern Minnesota lake, and this is one of the characteristic, evocative sounds you're going to hear from that area - something that'll stick with you for the rest of your life."
"It just punctuates the fall of night and really sets the mood for what follows: the solitude, the peacefulness."
It's all wrapped up in that one vocalization.
Thorotrast was a contrast medium used in Germany since 1890.
"It was used in Japan since 1930, but it was found that 25 to 30% of people developed liver cancer 20 to 30 years later."
Why does it take so long before cancer develops?
Thorotrast is an alpha-radiation nuclide.
"Alpha radiation injures nearby cells, and the DNA that is harmed most is a gene called ""P53""."
"We now know, thanks to genome science, the entire sequence of human DNA."
"However, there are 3 million locations on the DNA that are different from person to person."
"So today, it doesn't make sense at all to proceed as if all humans are the same."
"The basic principle should be the ""personalized medicine"" when we look at internal radiation - which DNA is damaged, and what kind of change is taking place."
The median here is five.
"Now, we'll add the numbers together and divide by the number of data points to get a mean of approximately five and three-tenths."
In this case both the median and the mean are good descriptors of the data.
"We could also find the mean, median,  and mode from tables of data."
"Here, a boy asked his five best friends how far they live from school, and they all gave their answers in blocks."
"One friend must live right across the street, but most friends live much further away."
"All of the distances got the same number of responses, and when every number could be the mode,  we say instead that there is no mode, and we use the word null."
The mode here is null.
"The median is easy to find with so few numbers, and it is seventeen."
When we add and divide to find the mean; we add them all up and get seventy. there are five responses so they have an average of fourteen.
"Once again, we have an outlier because the one  is so much less than any of the other data points."
"An outlier affects the mean, and here the mean of fourteen is less than the distance of four out of the five friends."
In this case the median is probably the best measure because it's closest to most of the responses.
"When an outlier is involved,  the median is often the best measure."
"In this lesson you have learned how to summarize the center of data with a single number by examining the mean, median, and mode."
This is a good time to pause and summarize what we've learned so far.
We've learned some theory and some practice.
"In theory, we've learned about patterns, which are grammars which describe languages, where a language is a set of strings."
"We've learned about interpreters over those languages, and about compilers, which can do the same thing only faster."
"In terms of practice, we've learned that regular expressions are useful for all sorts of things, and they're a concise language for getting work done."
"We've learned that interpreters, including compilers, can be valuable tools, and that they can be more expressive and more natural to describe a problem in terms of a native language that makes sense for the problem rather than in terms of Python code that doesn't necessarily make sense."
We learned functions are more composable than other things in Python.
"For example, in Python we have expressions, and we have statements."
They can only be composed by the Python programmer whereas functions can be composed dynamically.
We can take 2 functions and put them together.
We can take f and call g with that and then apply that to some x.
We can do that for any value of f and g.
We can pass those into a function and manipulate them and have different ones applying to x.
We can't do that with expressions and statements.
"We can do it with the values of expressions, but we can't do it with expressions themselves."
Functions provide a composability that we don't get elsewhere.
"Functions also provide control over time, so we can divide up the work that we want to do into do some now and do some later."
"""Let Googlebot decide."""
"The second parameter that I'd like to cover is the ""narrows"" parameter. ""narrows"" filters the content on the page by showing a subset of the total items."
So you probably see this on an e-commerce site.
"Where in the navigation, a user is able to select, if they only want to see items that are less than 25 dollars."
Or 25 dollars to 49.99. aAll of this is narrowing the content of the total items.
"Examples of the ""narrows"" parameter are ""size equals medium."" ""Less than equals 25."" Or"
"""Color equals blue."" If the ""narrows"" parameter shows less useful content."
"Shows content that's just a subset of the content from the more useful URL, which doesn't include the ""narrows"" parameter."
"Then you might be able to specify ""Crawl No URLs."" For example, a useful URL is ""category equals YouTube."" And the less useful URL is ""category equals YouTube and size equals medium."""
"Here, I might specify ""size"" as a ""narrows"" parameter."
"And then because it has less useful content, I can say ""crawl No URLs."" But before I specify ""Crawl No URLs"" it's good to verify a few things first."
"First, be sure that the ""narrows"" parameter won't also filter out useful pages that you'd like crawled and surfaced in search results."
"So if you have brand or category pages that you'd like to show to users, be sure that when you select ""Crawl"
"No URLs"" that those brand and category pages won't be affected."
"Second, verify that example"
URLs that might be displayed in Webmaster Tools are really URLs that provide non-useful content.
When compared to the parent URL.
"So again, you see content like ""Category equals"
"YouTube and size equals medium."" And you know that the ""size equals medium"" that narrows parameter just isn't' useful."
"If the behavior of ""Crawl No URLs"" just isn't optimal for your site because it affects too many important brand or category pages then perhaps let Googlebot decide."
"The next parameter is ""Specifies."" ""Specifies"" determines the content displayed on a page."
"For example, ""item id equals android t-shirt"" or ""sku equals 495."" The ""Specifies"" parameter is responsible for the actual content."
"So you'll likely select ""Crawl Every URL."" After"
"""specifies"" is ""translates."""
"Unless you want to exclude certain languages from being crawled and available in search results, like auto-generated translations."
"Unless that's the case, then it's likely you'll select ""Crawl Every URL."""
"As an aside, one best practice that I'd like to mention, and this is by no means a requirement, is to put your translated original content not in a URL parameter, but actually in a sub-folder or a sub-directory."
"The reason why is that in a sub-directory or sub-folder, it helps Google to better understand your site's structure."
And that this applies to translated or regional content.
"The last parameter is ""Paginates."" ""Paginates"" displays one component page of a multi-page sequence."
"Examples are ""page equals three."""
"""Viewitems equals ten through 30."" Or ""start-index is 20."" With paginates, because you want us to crawl every page to reach all of your items, it's nearly always ""Crawl Every URL."""
"We shipped Firefox 1 by February or March, there was a security issue that we didn't actually know how to fix right away."
Like a lot of times when a security issue is reported it turns out that figuring out the problem is the hard part and fixing it is the easier part.
"But this was one, it was a class of vulnerability that someone, somewhere, is this the guy in Japan?"
I think someone had figured out a new way of attacking products.
"So we had this immense focus, attention and user base growing and this phenomenally difficult product to try and deal with it, really giant."
"So, someday if you see Johnny Stenback and you wanna know what immense pressure is really like ask him about that period, the one that... 0.5 and 1.0.6..."
So success has its own issues.
That was one of things that we learned.
"That it is phenomenal to be at the centre and so we experienced that with Mozilla today, that success is phenomenal but it brings its own stresses and tensions, and if you're not careful and you just focus on the stress, it's easy to forget that is the sign of success."
"The sign of success in that era was that we had this product,"
like it was critical to fix this problem right away.
And you don't know how to do it.
"Everybody's looking at you, you really have to be more than you thought you could be."
"It's immensely stressful, that's success."
"So if you find yourself in those settings today, of course try to step back, take a deep breath, be healthy, get some exercise, do all of those things but remember that that level of stress and tension reflects the importance that we have, how critical we are to people's lives and is a measure of success."
"Not the best measure, there's more fun measures but when you're in the middle of those settings it is important to remember that if we didn't matter then that stress isn't gonna be the same."
Yes.
[Question]
Sure.
When we started as a foundation there was never any question about that.
"AOL knew that would be the case, all of us who wanted to work for it knew it would be the case."
"So we set it up that way, and then, as in December of 2004, became clear that we were gonna get significant amounts of money."
"I think December was probably a 3 million dollar check, as I remember, something like that."
So we had (...) that much in a year and suddenly we had it in a month.
"I know you're given a protocol, in other words you're given kind of a script for each week."
Each week there's a certain script you sort of work through.
But why don't we ask a current Speaking Partner how that works.
Well President Clark is exactly right.
"It's really wonderful, you and your Speaking Partner will both go online and you'll pull up the same script from which"
largely he or she leads you in the discussion.
"And they understand that's their responsibility and so you sort of follow along, it's like being the junior companion."
It's wonderful and it's a very well structured curriculum.
"There is I think, though, a difference between a fix-up, what I call a composite novel."
A composite novel takes these pieces and it puts them together in such a way that you actually have something more powerful or at least different than you would have if you had the separate pieces.
"For example, I, Robot by Isaac Asimov began as separate pieces."
The seperate pieces all obeyed what were called the Three Laws of Robotics that
"John W. Campbell, the second great editor of"
"Science Fiction after Hugo Gernsback, suggested to, to Aasimov."
Here are the three laws of robotics.
"A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm."
"Two, a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except in cases when the orders would conflict with the first law."
"So, robots are our slaves unless of course we ask them to do something that would harm us in which case they are suppose to resist us."
"Three, a robot must protect its own existence."
"As long as, such protection does not conflict with the first or second law."
"So, robots are pretty valuable."
"Entities, and they have a survival instinct but their survival instinct is subordinated to human beings' orders, and human beings' orders are subordinated to the survival of human beings."
Robots are clearly second class citizens.
"Now if you think about this for a while, you'll realize that these laws are impossible."
Alright.
"You know that saying about people who are exercising hard, they're training for one contest or another and they say, no pain, no gain."
"How is the robot to know that the pain that you are asking for is worth it to you, when the robot's law says it may not allow you to injure or harm yourself?"
"But, but I'm training for a marathon."
"One of the best stories in I, Robot is a story in which the two technicians who are, who occur in the stories in the in the collection, set up a robot to beam energy down to Earth."
This huge solar collector is not interfered with by the atmosphere that's why its up there and the microwave that they beam down to Earth are going to provide enormous power basically for free.
"It's terrific but if that solar collection station should wander a little bit, the beam would traverse the Earth and God knows what damage it would cause all that power."
"So, rather than relying on human beings to keep that beam on beam, they set up a robot, a very skilled robot."
"After they've got the robot up there, checking it out, making sure everything is working fine before they leave the station in the hands of the robot."
"And they get into a discussion you see, they congratulate each other on having gotten this robot put together and being able to leave."
"And the robot says huh, you didn't make me."
And they say ofcourse we made you [laugh].
And the robot says how could you make me?
I'm superior to you.
What do you mean you're superior?
Well if you aren't superior to me why do you want me to do this job.
Lots of things we collaborated in.
"They would call us to kind of interview us, but what they really wanted was for us to give them a chronicle."
"It's a typical trap: ""interview a journalist to get a free article"". that happened a lot."
And to tell you the truth we got the impression that it was all pretty well understood.
"A journalist from the New York Times came just after the local and regional elections, she called me so we could have breakfast together and I could bring her up to date because she didn't know how or what or who... and after she wrote a very sociological article without including any of the stereotypes or anything wierd."
It was all very correct.
"I think it was contextualised within the international economic crisis, that was the plot of the main international media companies with the 15M."
"There is a serious economic crisis, and a long time before the ""No nos representan"" came along, they aligned their editorials with the economic crisis and people protesting in the street because of the 4 million unemployed."
And I think that was the plot of the majority of the big international media corporations those days.
ST:
"To finish, if you want to add anything else, anything you consider important or you wish to reformulate."
Now's the time.
JL:
No [he thinks]
I think that...
I don't want it to be a sound byte or anything.
"What I mean is that if there's really a fervour amongst the citizens for there to be new spaces for public debate, new spaces for public debate, that these new spaces in the street and on the internet should be able to force the public and private powers that be into behaving a different way."
And we should be wary of the media.
Keep our eyes on those who keep their eyes on us.
"If we want everythingt to be like that, and I do 100%"
"I want it to be like that, and these new spaces for debate are created, people have to remember, we all have to remember that we need a different way to make money circulate."
Through speeches and debates we need there to be a new and different way for money to circulate.
"That's open source, creative commons, common benefit, which also needs financing obviously."
"It's about this film and projects that are being undertaken, it's about Periodismo Humano and projects that are yet to be created."
I think that's the lesson which I don't know if it's been absorbed.
"It's really necessary for there to be new spaces, but those spaces have to be sustainable in some way."
Maybe the best way is not to just put money into them.
I don't know how.
"But the lesson to be learnt here is how debate and enrichening can be made sustainable, regarding political participation, public life, demands, social life... so that it's posible to solve those things that we don't like about our society."
"That's the question, I think."
It's the question I don't know the answer to.
I have my own personal bets but I don't have the magic recipe.
"So what happens is that when the query shift shifted from, basically, mortgages, to mortgage help, to mortgage refinance help, to lawyers to help me prevent my house from being foreclosed."
"I don't know if that's a good story, or bad, but it's all obvious, it's all playing out in real time."
Another way of saying it is the things that you see on television are really true.
"That's another way to say it, because we see it."
[laughs] So the areas that have been most hit on the on line world are the same as the ones that you'd imagine in the off
"line world--things like travel, and automobiles, and financials, and so forth."
"And consumers are smart, so they use the Internet to, now, then,"
look for bargains in that space.
"So they do, in fact, look for discount trips if they're going to travel, although that volume is off, and so forth."
"We haven't seen anything unusual, and what's interesting about it is that, from our perspective, aside from running the business much more tightly; in other words, trying to actual make profits for a change in some of these businesses, we haven't fundamentally changed our strategic view, which is that the Internet is a part of everybody's life and that innovation in terms of new products will really enable people to do some amazing things."
"We've taken a position, for example, that the person should really be the search."
"It should really not just be a search that you do, but really about your viewpoint or history and, again, with your permission, we can store that kind of information. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
You mentioned you're trying to make profits from businesses that hadn't been profitable before.
"You have a new CFO; it seems like right guy, right time. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Very much so. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
If you could provide us any thoughts on the kind of changes he's been able to make to obvious observations on the financials; opex per employee went down 6% last quarter.
"It's still high, relative to a lot of other companies. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"But our profitability is, too. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Your profitability is still high.
So there.
Touche.
"And capex per, as a percent of revenue, was down dramatically."
How should we--and free cash flow was up 70% during your last quarter. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, for instance, we like cash--we like to generate cash."
"A good metric in any situation is if you can grow your profits at an absolute basis, and if you can generate pretty good free cash flow, you're going to get through this."
So we've taken that position internally.
"Patrick is--Patrick is our CFO--is particularly at doing business reviews, and so we've been going through systematically, business after business."
"And it won't surprise long term followers of Google that in our, sort of, hyper growth period, we did not have the necessary systems in place-- budgeting and the sort of estimation."
We're putting those in place today.
"And, in fact, they are in place."
"So, Google management spends most of its time doing business reviews today."
Looking at new products--how will this new product really change user behavior?
"It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down, square, rectangular, anything like that, that you'd see in a normal shape of a building."
"The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution, has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings, traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this."
What's interesting about it is not the shape.
What's interesting about it is how it's made.
How it's made.
"A brand-new way to put buildings together, something called mass customization."
"No, it is not an oxymoron."
"What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense, is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again."
That's why we all live in developer houses.
They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.
That's because it's cheaper.
"Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts."
"The computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice, because the computer is just a machine."
It doesn't care.
It's manufacturing the parts.
It doesn't see any excess cost.
It doesn't spend any extra time.
"It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe, so the parts can all be cut at the same time."
"Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,"
"like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, ""Bolt A to B, and C to D."""
"And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals."
"Just simple ""Bolt A to B"" and they will be able to put them together."
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that's what will happen in the end.
"You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura."
"Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance, these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York, as part of their young architects summer series."
"And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?"
"In the summer, you go to the beach."
"And when you go to the beach, what do you get?"
You get sand dunes.
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.
"They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program, and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into -- at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications -- a set of instructions for pieces of wood."
We just find those employees who are among the X employees and we sum up their salaries.
"So, let's take a look at the recursive definition here and again, it's taking the usual form of a base query, union and recursive query... and here's what we do."
"Well, obviously the manager of project X is one of the IDs involved in project"
"X. So here we find in the project, the project name text and we take the manager of that project and we put that person's ID into Xemps."
That's the first ID that's going to go in there.
That's going to seed the recursion.
That's again the base query.
Then we add in our recursive step any employee who is managed by anybody who's in the X employees.
"So, we'll take our manager relationship, our X employees relationship and if the employee's manager is an"
"X, then that employee is also involved in X. So we seed the recursion with the manager of project X and then we just recursively go down the tree adding all of the employees that are underneath one by one."
We don't have to know the depth of the tree because the recursion will continue until nobody else is added.
I guess I should have mentioned that earlier in my earlier examples.
"Again the recursion sort of adds a data over and over again until there's nothing new to add, and that's when it terminates."
So let's go ahead and run the query.
"Anti-climatic again, but we get the same answer 400 as the salary cost of Project"
X. Now we use the same form of query to find the total salary cost of two projects Y and Z.
And that will also demonstrate having two relations that are defined in the width recursive command.
"So I have added project Y and Z to our project table, and they're both managed by employees who are already in the database, so they're a little lower down the hierarchy."
We should expect those projects have lower total cost.
"That's for project X, whose manager was at the root of our hierarchy."
"So here's our query, it's a big one; we're going to define YM and ZM exactly as we defined X amps in the previous example."
"So Y amps is a table of a recursively defined relation, temporary, that's gonna contain a list of IDs of the people, the employees that are involved in Project Y. So we are going to put the manager of"
"Project Y as our base query, and then we're going to add to it in the recursion all of the employees who are managed by someone who's in the YMs."
And ZM's exactly the same.
We start the manager of project
"Z, and then we add to it, all of the people are managed transitively down the tree by someone who's in the ZM's relation."
And then our final query down here for the statement is a union of two queries.
The first one gets the total salary for Y and it labels it as Y total.
So it takes all the Ids that are in the Y table and from the employee table get their salaries and sums them up.
And similarly the Z total.
"So now we'll run this query, it will be slightly less is anti-climactic."
We do have now two tuples in our result.
So he's surrounded by drug addicts and drunks.
"And so, there are no village models."
We have
lost the fathers in our home and the heroes in our communities.
And the fourth is that he's in a survival mode.
And so the environment is quite predatory and mercenary.
And fifth is that it's a subsistence economy.
"We call it ""Isang kahig, Isang tuka""."
"One scratch, one peck."
And so we realize that a country that does not deserve to be poor is poor.
A country that has a tradition of very strong Christian values is one of the most corrupt.
"And so, this was the source of my midlife crisis."
And I realized too that I just follow the old patterns.
"You know, send your children to the most exclusive schools, become successful,"
live in an exclusive subdivision and just create your own artificial bubble of security and comfort in a sea of third world poverty.
And I realize that that's not the kind of legacy I wanted to pass on to my children.
They cannot wander in the - they cannot walk the streets in safety.
"And especially the most successful, they are also the most vulnerable to crime and to rebellion."
"At the same, in the countryside, the poor continued to be the most vulnerable to the calamities, to the typhoons and to the floods."
"So I realized too that at 35, I was at the prime of my life, I had so much energy, why was I so unhappy?"
And that's when I went to the biggest slum in the country called Bagong
"Silang, north of Manila, and started to really discover because I was in search of my soul, as a Filipino, as a Christian and as a human being."
And I did not find it in the artificial surroundings that I just boxed myself in.
"I lived in an exclusive subdivision with security guards, with high walls."
"And I was surrounded by squatters around me, my people, my family that I did not know."
And so I realized that I had to go beyond my own definition of family.
"I had to consider the poor, the orphans, the criminals, the rebels as my family."
"Otherwise, I will not invest my time, my talent, my treasure, I'll just - it's just convenient to write out a check and just perpetuate this whole tradition of charity."
"So anyway, I realized that it is really about connectivity that the brightest and the best, those with the greatest opportunities are disconnected from our people, are disconnected from the land, are disconnected from the rich natural resources and that's the reason why we're poor."
"You know, there are countries that do not have the fertile land that we have, do not have the biodiversity, the rich natural resources, do not even have our producer - our human resource and our market base, almost 100 million market base."
"And, you know, it's now very interesting for me just coming home from Davos where I was invited two weeks ago."
"And yesterday, it was very fascinating that finally what a - my own reflections about Davos was printed at the Huffington Post."
"So in the array format we prefer this, putting the top of the vector on the far end because then there is the only jostling of that."
But needing access to the top here in the front is actually going to be the better way to get the link
list strategy you work in.
Let me actually go through both the push and the pop to convince you why this is true.
"So if I have access in the 10, 20, 30 case I could actually keep a separate additional pointer, one to the front and one to the back."
So it could actually become maintaining at all times as pointing to the back.
"If I did that, right, then subsequent push up to a 40, it's pretty easy to tack on a 40."
So it turns out it would be that the adding it's the push operation that actually isn't really a problem on this
"Strategy A. We can still kind of easily, and over time, if we have that tail pointer just tack one on to the end."
"As for the pop operation, if I have to pop that 30,"
I need to adjust that tail pointer and move it back a cell.
And that's where we start to get into trouble.
If I have a pointer to the tail cell there is no mechanism in the singly linked list to back up.
"If I say it's time to pop 30, then I would actually need to delete the 30, get the value out, but then I need to update this tail pointer to point to 20, and 30 doesn't know where 20 is, 30's oblivious about these things."
"And so the only way to find 20 in singly linked list would be go back to the very beginning, walk your way down, and find the one that pointed to the cell you just took out of the list and that's going to be an operation we want to avoid."
"In the Strategy B case, right, adding a cell, this means putting a 40 in allocating a new cell and then attaching it, splicing it in, right between wiring in two pointers, and we can do these links in constant time, and then popping one is taking that front row cell off."
"Easy to get to, easy to update, and splice out so no traversal, no extra pointers needed."
"The idea that there are, you know, 100 or 1,000 elements following the one that's on top is irrelevant."
"It doesn't have any impact, whatsoever, on the running time to access the front, or stuff another front, or taking it on or off the front."
So it is Strategy B that gives us the best setup when it's in the back of the linked list.
So let me go ahead and do it.
I think it's kind of good to see.
"Oh, like, what is it like to just write code and make stuff work."
And so I'm kind of fond of this and you can tell me.
I make a cell C it has an L type value and it has a soft T next right there.
And then I have a pointer to the front linked list cell.
"So in addition, you know, it might that in order to make something like size operate efficiently,"
"I might also want to catch the number of cells that update, or added or renew."
I can also decide to just leave it out for now.
Maybe
"I'll actually even change this to be the easier function, right, which is empty form."
That way I don't even have to go down that road for now.
Returning to an idea I mentioned a couple of slides ago.
Let's say there is an assignment in a basic block.
Some registered W is assigned some value that's computed on the right hand side.
"Let's say that W, the registered name is not used anywhere else in the program."
"It doesn't appear anywhere, not only in this basic block but in any other part of the procedure in which this statement appears."
"Well then, the statement is dead and can be just deleted from the program And dead here means it does not contribute to the programs result."
"Since the value that we write into W is never referenced anywhere, W is never used, doing the computation, of"
"W in the first place was a waste of time, so we can just delete that computation."
Here's a simple example.
"Let's assume that the register a is not used any place else, in the program."
"And, the first thing we have to do, so here's our initial piece of code."
The first thing we do is we put it in single assignment form.
"And so I've renamed here, this register x, to be, register b."
"Okay, and once we do that, let me do that, so we'll say that B=Z+Y and A=B, and then we propagate this forward."
"Alright, so we've now replaced this use of A by B, so this takes us to this state where we have this piece of code."
Now we can see that we have an assignment to A. A is not used in the subsequent instruction.
"We already said that A is not used anywhere outside of the basic block, and so the assignment a=b can be deleted, and we wind up with this shorter basic block."
Now each local optimization actually does very little by itself.
"And some of these optim izations, some of these transformations that are presented actually don't make the program run faster at all."
They don't make it run slower either but by themselves they don't actually make any improvement to the program.
"But, Typically, the optimizations will interact."
So performing one optimization will enable another.
"And we saw this in the little example that I did, a few slides ago."
So the way to think about an optimizing compiler is that it has a big bag of tricks.
It has a lot of.
"Individual program transformations that it knows And what it is going to do when faced with a program's optimize, it's going to rummage around in its bag looking for an optimization, that applies to some part of the code."
"If it finds one, it will do the optimization, it will do the transformation and then it will repeat."
"It'll go back and look at the program again, and see if there's another optimization that reapplies."
Then it will just keep doing this until it reaches a point where none of the optimization's it knows about can be applied to the programming.
"Next, we'll take a look at a bigger example and try applying some of the optimizations that we've discussed, to it, and see how far we get."
"And of course this example has been constructed to illustrate, many of the optimizations that we discussed."
"So, the first thing we can do."
It's just that m happens residually.
"So, notice that once we have x star of p, the amount of the composite good that he consumes is just given by the budget constraint, basically by W minus p x star of p, is automatically followed from the nature of the problem."
"Now, what about the solution to the utility maximization problem?"
"So, recall that the problem looks like maximize over x greater or equal than zero, B(x) - xp."
"Now, we go also that we half assume that B prime is greater than zero, and B double prime is less than zero."
"Given the linearity of the cost function, this implies that the problem satisfies the concavity, concavity conditions are satisfied."
"And that, and in that case, we know a lot from unit one about the properties of the solution, and that's what I am going to do now is characterize them."
"In particular, we have to worry about three cases that I am going to draw for you."
"Case one is the most interesting one in some sense, which is that interior solution."
And this is a solution in particular where the demand at that price is equal or less than zero.
"Now, how do the first order conditions for this case, in general the, the, the characterization of the solution look?"
"So, we can do this first order condition maps or graphs that we were doing before."
"And, it's going to case, it's going to be a case that look like follows."
"We have a p, this is the x."
"A constant, what we were referring to before in the math section as a constant marginal cost."
We're going to have a marginal benefit function that somehow crosses from above.
"So, B prime of zero is above B and it eventually crosses."
And we're going to have that the optimal
"level to, of the man is this given by the cross, xP, star of p."
"So, in particular, xP star of p is given by the solution to B prime of x equals p."
That is the equation that determines into your solution.
"Now, there is a second case that we also look at length in Unit one, which is a corner solution with x star of p equals zero."
"I mean, if you remember that's a case of looks like this."
"We have the marginal, the price for example here which is the marginal cost."
"The marginal benefit function, B prime, crosses at zero below."
"So, in that particular case, it never paid off to take out the first unit and the optimal solution is to set equals to zero."
"Now, unfortunately, since there is nothing in the model that guarantees that the crossing conditions are satisfied, we need to worry about a third case that look like this. x star of p is equal to infinity."
"In some sense, the solution doesn't exist."
And that's a case that looks like this.
"You have x, you have p, and you have a marginal benefit function above but that somehow keeps going down but never crosses."
"It never crosses, okay?"
"So, in this particular case, it keeps, it is profitable, in terms of inclusion experidentry to keep doing the marginal, buying more and more of x on the margin all the way to infinity."
"It means you can't keep the information in the server, you've got to keep it somewhere else."
"One place people put it is on the wire, so you put it in the cookies or you put it in headers, or you put it in secrets fields or in URLs, so you're passing all that information back and forth all the time, which is really inefficient."
"Some people got tired of that and decided OK, let's just put it in the database."
That's an awful place to put it.
That's like the worst possible place in the universe to be putting your ephemeral state.
That's just not where you want to do it.
But you don't have anywhere else.
"Fortunately, there is an alternative."
There's a system called Elko that was developed by
"Chip Morningstar, which is all about maintaining session in these servers."
He's got a device called a session server.
You initially connect to the session server and the session server will determine:
"OK, we'll use one of these servers for your session."
"It'll tell you about it, and it'll tell the server about that, and from that point on, the browser and that particular server have a connection that they preserve through the life of the session."
"The wonderful thing about that is, where does the ephemeral state now go?"
It goes in JavaScript variables that are closed over the event handlers that are in the event queue in the server.
"They are in the best place in the universe, where there is absolutely no cost at getting that information and making it available to the application."
You add that to the node.js now and the amount of work you have to do in order to do a stepwise increment in the
"Ajax application starts to get really, really small."
So you've got some really wonderful stuff now happening in server architecture because of opportunities afforded to us by
JavaScript.
A final thought.
"A little while ago I was talking to a friend of mine — a really bright guy, one of the smartest programmers I know -- about what we should do next with JavaScript."
"I suggested to him that we should get the tail recursion thing going, we should get that fixed."
Why do we want to do that?
"Well, I said, among a lot of other things it would allow us to do continuation style passing."
"I think that would be a useful option for us to be able to provide within the language, and if we don't optimize the tail calls then we don't get that."
His answer was:
"I've never used continuation passing, so I really don't see the value of it, which I immediately recognized as a really stupid answer."
"The way I was able to recognize it so fast is that I have used that same argument myself, and I've been hearing that same argument throughout my entire career."
"Basically, the core of that argument is:"
"""I'm not qualified to make a decision about that."
I'm sorry--second question.
I apologize.
You asked a question about the venture arm and M&amp;amp;A strategy.
We have largely been waiting for prices to get better.
A lot of--the good news is we have lots of capital.
"And the bad news is we're still trying to get everybody into the model that we really want in terms of M&amp;amp;A. And I think it'll start soon, but it's pretty inactive right now."
"Sir, go ahead. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:"
"You mentioned in your, a few minutes ago here, that you were in strong support of the new increases in the government spending and the stimulus program."
"Could you explain a little bit, perhaps, how you expect to benefit from the new stimulus program?"
"And, what do you say to the argument that if government spending were the answer, the Soviet Union would have been the richest country in the world? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"I have a very long and strong answer to the last part of the question but, in the interest of time, I'll say that we benefit when our customers have jobs, because they buy stuff."
"So any solution that gets the middle class, if you will, to feel more confident, benefits Google--our advertising revenue, our customers, our partners, and our shareholders."
"So, we can debate the specifics."
"As you know, the current stimulus package is--no one has ever done it at this scale before--it's two-thirds as directed spending and one-third is tax credits of one kind or another, much of which goes to the state and local governments and for extended unemployment benefits, and then various things involving the AMT."
"With respect to how Google would specifically benefit beyond that, it's more a question of how does the Internet benefit?"
"And the stimulus package has on it on the order of 20 billion of essentially payment subsidies and credits that cause the build out of the fast internet, the Broadband Internet, to occur more quickly."
"It also has about $20 billion in increases in science funding, which we believe will go into universities that will then help with the lag."
They'll build some of the new and creative applications that we depend on. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
"In the past, you've talked about where you were in terms of monetization of existing properties and existing applications."
"I was wondering if you could, sort of, give us an update on where you think you are?"
"I mean, of the things you can control, monetization of your properties is one of them."
Where do you think you are at this point?
What this downturn means in terms of accelerating monetization?
Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"There's always a danger, when you have a web site, that you temporarily over monetize?"
"In other words, that you take your page and you fill it with ads."
"And that works for a quarter or two, and then your customers say, ""Well, heck, that's an ad page rather than a content page."""
And then they move somewhere else.
"So, we at Google are roughly at our monetization, or what we call coverage,"
"level, of about a year ago."
And that feels about right.
"It's, frankly, a judgment."
Event loops are the heart of the web browser.
Everything works in the web browser based on an event loop.
An event
"loop is driven off of an event queue which contains callback functions, and those callback functions get put onto the queue by the timer using setTimeOut or setlnterval or by UI events."
"So clicks and mouse overs and all that stuff get translated in and put into the queue — and network activity, so when a script gets loaded or a loading is complete, that information will be put onto the event queue."
Then the event queue takes turns.
"In each turn it takes one callback off of the event queue, runs it to completion, and then does the next one."
"It's a really simple loop, but it's a really powerful loop."
"The prime directive in an event driven system is never block, so you can't wait for IO, and you can't wait for network activity, you just run and run and when you can't run anymore you return."
"You can set up other things to run in the future, but you never block, you never wait, and you have to finish fast."
If you can do those three things you can run really well in event loop.
"That's how the browser runs, and the browser runs really well."
"The event loop is one of the best parts of the browser, but because it's a part of the browser we didn't get it completely right."
There are a couple of things in the browser
"API which block, and because they block you really shouldn't use them."
"Alert and its sisters are OK to use for debugging, but you should never put them in production code because they will block the main browser thread."
"Also, XML HTTP request has two modes: a synchronous mode and an asynchronous mode."
"The synchronous mode blocks, and because it blocks you should never use that."
"Fortunately, there is an asynchronous mode which does the right thing: it makes the request and then you can have it call back engaged when it finishes."
"In the browser, when UI events are generated it's possible to have multiple event handlers run as a result of bubbling."
"But in reality there's only one function that runs, and it's something that's similar to this where it'll be a little bit more complicated."
"But it will end up looping through the DOM, looking for the event handler that says OK, we're done processing this, and once it's finished then that's the end of the term."
So that's how we do event delegation in JavaScript.
Does anybody know who this lady is?
Show of hands -- who knows who this is?
Everybody should know who this is.
This is a really important lady.
This is Grace Murray Hopper.
"She was the first woman to get a PhD in Mathematics at Yale, then went on to teach Mathematics at Vassar."
"When the US entered World War Il, her husband signed up and joined the military, as did her brother and her cousins, and she decided that she would too."
So at the age of 36 she resigned her tenure position at Vassar and joined the Navy.
"Being a mathematician, she thought she'd probably be assigned to do cryptography or some other kind of code breaking business."
"There's a bit of a--there appears to be a bit of a freeze right now on action for a variety of reasons--but to your point because companies really do need customers, at some point this becomes unfrozen, theoretically, the on line medium becomes unfrozen faster--any thoughts on how that might play out when it plays out?"
"Let's say, the economy turns in quarter ""X."""
"When we come out of it, are the indications that you're seeing positive in the direction of on line gaining more share from off line than it has over this long period when it should have been gaining more share than it has? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"Well, in the first place, on line continues to gain share in many, many ways."
Share of mind--share of dollars--and so forth.
I don't think there's any new news there.
And there are more and more on line choices.
It's worth trying to figure out when this will occur.
"And for the next few quarters, things are going to be very, very tough."
"So we're talking about 2010, I think, in talking to CEOs or talking to customers, everybody is sort of assuming that 2009 is a tough, tough year."
"So the first question is, what can you do in 2009?"
"And our sales force goes in to the customer and says, ""You need revenue now; this is the quickest way to get revenue now."""
"In many cases, customers are struggling with contractual commitments to off line advertising, for example, where the overall advertising budget has been cut so dramatically that they really don't have a lot of room."
And so there's a political dynamic that goes within the customers.
Hopefully that'll resolve fairly quickly.
It's obviously in their interest that it does.
The other thing that's going on is that there's an increasing willingness to try new systems in the enterprise.
"We have a set of enterprise offerings which are around information, mail, applications, and documents; and we've been pleased with the willingness of customers to now accelerate their trials."
"Now, I'd like to think this is because our products are brilliant, clever, and wonderful,l and consistent with cloud computing."
"Another possible explanation is their budgets are very, very tight and our stuff is just a lot cheaper."
"Either one of those is acceptable from our perspective, because we'll earn the right of the customer over time."
"So the answer to your question is, what does 2010 look like?"
A lot of that depends on what the growth rate of the recovery will look like.
And nobody at this point knows what a global recovery is going to look like.
"But it's reasonable to expect that now that we've gotten off of the on line penetration, we'll get back to that."
Because the trends are still all in that direction. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"On that cheery note, let's talk about music videos. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"The You Tube, to me as a consumer, is sort of like MTV was 20 years ago--"
15 or 20 years ago.
You haven't monetized it yet the way you are starting to.
"There are initial signs, or I don't know how many instances you're doing this and where you're selling the music--either"
MP3s via Amazon or I-Tunes via Apple--with some of your most used videos.
How do you see both the artists using that venue over the next one to two years as they're dealing with their contracts with the industry?
"And how do you see the monetization for the artists and for You Tube play out, just as one example."
You may want to focus on another way that
You Tube is increasingly going to be monetized. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, You Tube is--You Tube is slowly getting the monetization right."
It's taken us much longer than we had hoped to get it right.
I've always been concerned that the aggregate monetization of on line does not replace the lost revenue for off line.
That's the fundamental conundrum of music industry.
"It's a potential conundrum for the video and movie industries, and everybody is very worried about this, so we're working hard on that."
The music industry as a whole has the following problem.
"In the 1980s, they believe--their self view--is that they helped create MTV, which is a very successful property, obviously, by giving them licenses to music videos ""too cheaply,"" according to their view."
"And so there's an ongoing battle, business discussion, whatever term you want to do, about how do you compensate the music industry for the use of the music in things which are promotional?"
I don't know how that's going to resolve itself.
"Apple, and I think you know, as you know, I'm on the Board of Apple-- successfully has worked that out with I-Tunes, after a lot of arguing."
And I think I-Tunes is a very positive example of this.
We need an analogous example of the way music videos will work on the Internet.
You Tube is very successful with music videos.
"It's also very successful with sports, comedy, and other sort of humor."
And we are working hard on longer form content and HD content.
"Because You Tube has so many viewers--literally this huge audience-- if we can get even small amounts of profit because of the scale, add the big numbers really quickly. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Some of the obstacles in the way with regards to getting more content on You Tube have been the Viacoms of the world, and then the major media companies. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
That would be a one billion dollar lawsuit. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
That would be a one billion dollar lawsuit.
"Anyway, I'm not going to go down that path."
"But if we look at the financial results for those media companies in the fourth quarter, using News Corp as an example, they're local TV review was down 30% plus."
"They may--They, meaning--and I mentioned this earlier today, but the trajectory that the local TV and broadcast TV is on is sort of similar."
"It's just that you look at a chart, to where newspapers were a year ago, is it possible that that group of players who have been stand-off to you and not wanting to participate, may change their view, simply given that their economic situation is different than it was before. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
I would hope so.
"And, you know, they see the same numbers that we do, and we understand their problem."
And we are critically dependent on the creation of this high quality content.
There's only so much user-generated video that everybody is going to want.
The bank that's holding toxic asset A.
And this is what I thought of after kind of thinking about it for about five or ten minutes.
You could imagine what the banks will come up with when they have billions of dollars and careers on the line.
"So if you have a scenario where you have this toxic asset A, and you economically want to do what I describe, but you don't want to be an affiliate and you don't want to give the appearance of self-dealing, what you do is you sell credit defaults on A that become supercheap, so you have essentially $7 exposure of credit defaults."
Let me do it this way.
So what you do is you sell credit default swaps.
So let's say you sell $7 of exposure.
"So your liability right here, is a seven-dollar CDS exposure, and I'll go over the economics of how this works in a second."
And you actually get some of the income stream.
It wouldn't even be accounted this way.
"You normally just have to-- if you're insuring $7 worth of credit default swaps, your liability isn't $7."
"You do the probability of default and all that, so your"
"liability will probably be-- I don't know, $1.00, whatever it is, and you get some income stream for it."
"But the general notion is that you sell credit default swaps on this toxic asset, on A, for really cheap."
"And just so you know what a credit default swap is, I've made a couple of videos on it, it is essentially an insurance policy on a loan or on a company, and if that company or this loan defaults, you say that you are going to pay up essentially the insurance amount."
So what you do is you sell $7 of credit defaults swaps on A.
"And just so you know, most of these toxic assets that these banks hold, these are assets that they were the originators for, and so, they're very particular to the individual banks."
"So a bank can definitely say I'm selling a credit default swap on A, and they know that, in the end, when I kind of outline this whole thing, they'll be the main beneficiary of it."
"So if you sell $7 of credit defaults swaps on A, what would I do?"
"Well, I'm a hedge fund."
What I do is I buy those credit defaults for really cheap.
"And then I invest in the TALF, right?"
"So let's say I'm a hedge fund, and I have two things."
"I have a $7 investment in the TALF-- sorry, in this Geithner"
"Plan, and then I also have this credit default swap, this insurance contract."
"And just so you know, depending on the price, you pay a certain amount every year."
"But the key here is that this bank could sell it, if they wanted to, for almost free."
They could essentially give away these credit default swaps.
"So if that bank did it, then the hedge fund's assets would have the $7 investment in this Geithner program, and then it'll have $7 of credit default swap protection."
Now what happens to this hedge fund?
"In the world where asset A is worth a lot, they get all of the upside through their investment in the Geithner Plan."
That $7 investment gets levered to $100.
Just take a look at these.
"Once we start doing pointers, right, there's just opportunities for error."
I feel kind of good about what I did here but I am going to just do a little bit of tracing to kind of confirm for myself that the most likely situations that get you in trouble with link list is you'll handle the mainstream case but somehow forget one of the edge cases.
"Such as, what if the list was totally empty or just had a single cell?"
Is there some special case handling that needs to be dealt with?
"So if I think about it in terms of the push case, you know, I might say, well, if there's an existing set of cells, so we're using Strategy B here, let me erase A so I know what I'm looking at, that its head is currently pointing to a set of cells, right, that my allocation of the new cell out here, right, assigning its value, assigning its next field to be where head points two, and then sending head to this new guy, it"
looks to be good.
If I also do that tracing on the - what if the list that we were looking at was just null to begin with.
So there were no cells in there.
This is the very first cell.
It isn't going to have any kind of trouble stumbling over this case.
"So I would allocate that new cell 40, assign its value."
"Set the next field to be what head is, so that just basically sets the trail coming out of 40 to be null and then updates the head there."
"So we've produced a single linked list, right, with one cell."
It looks like we're doing okay on the push behaviors.
"Now, the pop behavior, in this sort of case may be relevant to think about, if it's totally empty."
"All right, we come in and we've got an empty cell, then the empty test should cause it to error and get down to the rest of the code."
"Let's say that B points to some sequence of things, 30, 20, 10, that taking the head value off and kind of writing it down somewhere, saying, okay, 30 was the top value."
The old cell is currently the head so we're keeping a temporary on this thing.
"And then head equals head error next, which splices out the cell around so we no longer have a pointer into this 30."
"The only place we can get back to it is with this temporary variable we assigned right here of old and then we delete that old to reclaim that storage and then our list now is the values 20 and 10, which followed it later in the list."
"To, also, do a little check what if it was the very last cell in the list that we're trying to pop?"
Does that have any special handling that we have overlooked if we just have a ten here with a null after it?
I'll go through the process of writing down the ten.
"Assigning old to where head is, and assigning head-to-head error next, where head error of next cell is null but pointing to that, and then we set our list to null, and then we delete this cell."
"And so after we're done, right, we have the empty list again, the head pointer back to null."
So it seems like we're doing pretty good job.
Have a bunch of cells.
Have one cell.
No cells.
Different things kind of seem to be going through here doing the right thing.
Let's do it.
"Do people in their 40s and 50s, or my age, and I'm a grandparent at this age, do we tend to underestimate the passions and the almost affinity that young people, now coming of age with all this technology around them, have for using that technology and the expectation that they have for it?"
Sal:
"Yeah, it surprised me."
"I wouldn't have thought, when I started this up, I wouldn't have thought, that when I made videos on sine and cosine and l'Hopital's rule that they would become this 'main stream' thing but clearly there's this hunger for it."
"And the surprising thing is that it isn't just the younger generation we have 30 year olds, 40 year olds, 50 year olds..."
I got a letter from a grandmother that said it was her life dream to learn calculus - who knew?
"And she started working on it, so it is really across generations."
Tom:
Do you compliment what you do online with conventional text books or math books or offer references?
Sal:
"Well, it is an interesting..."
I think that there will always be a role for books.
"But textbooks right now do two things: the text tries to teach you something, it is sometimes hard to read."
And then the exercise try to give you practice.
"We think that on-demand video is often better than the text that you see in a lot of text books and that immediate feedback, self-paced learning with data and analytics and you get the steps of every problem, and it is kind of like a video game."
That that's better than every other answer in the back of the book.
So it will be interesting to see what happens to the textbook world.
Tom:
"What did you learn, if anything, at this point?"
"And I know it is empirical of it probably.. about whether some of us are hard-wired to do math and others of us, like me, are hard-wired to do other things."
I mean people ask me how I got to be a journalist and I say:
"""Algebra 2""."
(laughter)
Sal:
That's pretty good.
"No, the amazing thing that we've started seeing in these pilots in these classrooms is when you let every kid work at their own pace, right when you start off, you do see what we traditionally see: some of the kids race ahead and those are the kids that we all think will be nuclear physicists and whatever else."
"And some of the kids take a little bit longer on one concept to another and in a traditional model, you'd say: those kids are meant to be scientists or engineers."
These kids .. maybe they'll become journalists - which isn't so bad.
"But what we've seen is that if you let them work at their own pace, some of those kids who are spending a little extra time on negative numbers or exponents."
You give them that extra time and as soon at they get that some of them just race ahead.
"And so what we're seeing in our data in the classrooms is when we are not grouping kids based on early assessment, that every week there is a new leader."
"And some of the kids that two or three weeks ago you'd have said were slow or below average a week or two or a month later, they're the best kid in the class."
Their benefit as well will be reduced.
"For a couple, the surviving spouse will receive the larger of the two benefits that the couple is eligible to receive."
This dramatically changes the break even calculation for a potential higher benefit member.
"On average, benefits are going to be payed to one of them, approximately five years"
longer Then the benefit paid the lower benefit member.
This decreases the desirability of the higher wage earner to wait.
The flood of baby boomers currently reaching full retirement age has brought the interest in maximizing benefits to the forefront.
"When one spouse reaches full-retirement age, they can file suspend their benefit."
This allows the other spouse to claim a spousal benefit while the first spouse continues to work maximizing their benefit.
"Similarly a spouse can do restricted filings for spousal benefits which while allowing their own benefit to increase With many, with many baby boomers being two worker families, the combination of restricted filing, and file and suspended strategies, has yielded some interesting opportunities for couples."
There are various articles on the reading of this possibility.
No dogs or Captivas were harmed during this test.
Do not attempt.
Can a car's dexterity match up to a dog's?
Let's put it to the test.
Madrid | Spain �
Let's go through this one in parts.
"Any regular expression starts with r' or r""."
I'm going to use the single quotes this time so that I won't have to escape quite as many of these.
"Then we want to match the blue "" here at the beginning, and somewhere way at the end, we'll want to match the closing one, and that will be the end of our regular expression."
"So now we just have to think of what goes in here in the middle, and this may not be enough room."
I may have to erase it and write it again.
"Now whatever it is, it's going to be 0 or more of something, and as we're going across the string, there's sort of backslashes, which are important, and everything else, which is not so important."
"So if there's any character that's not a backslash, and here I'm escaping the backslash, we can just read right over it--that's no problem inside of our string-- or you could actually have an escape sequence, like this \""."
"That looks like a literal backslash, followed by anything, and then it's done."
So let me just diagram this a little more.
"Say this opening quote is 1, that matches things like this opening quote in the string."
"Then in here, we have anything that's not a backslash--that's 2."
"That's I-space-say-s-a-y-comma, but then eventually we do get to a backslash."
"Over here, we have a 2-character sequence that's a backslash followed by a dot."
"These 2 characters--the backslash, followed by the quote--they are 3, and then we're back to matching 2's--h, e, I, l, o, dot."
"Now we have another backslash and a quote, so these 2 together will be another 3, and then this part at the end is number 4."
"Is it finished?"""
Something made the whole thing actually plausible somehow.
We got away with it.
I remember coming offstage and being like:
"""I think that actually went alright."""

Prof:
"Okay everybody, let's start in."
"Today I want to talk about green building and the opportunity to also think about the laws that surround green building, and also the energy implications of green building standards."
"And I'd like to also address the history by having you think about the way that these standards have evolved over time, particularly the evolution of certification programs."
"So the idea of certification, I want you to think about it quite broadly at the outset."
Because it basically implies that certain standards are being applied to something.
"It might be a product, it could be a service."
"It could be a neighborhood, a city."
"So that the idea that there is an expert group that would review something, whether or not it's your academic preparation and performance, or whether or not it's a building's performance, and then certify it, give it a symbol."
It would rank it relative to others.
One obvious example would be looking at a GPA on a transcript.
"Well, what we'll see after today's lecture is that the green building programs that have evolved in Europe, in the United States, and Australia, they really are based on that same kind of concept."
So how would you rate the environmental and health responsibility and energy efficiency of new building standards?
How would they apply or how might they apply to renovation projects?
So I'm basically going to use the lecture today to share with you an overview of a paper that will be published in about two weeks that is a critique of the U.S.
Green Building Council's program known as LEED.
So I'd like you also think about the importance of the building sector in its demand for energy in the United States.
Buildings consume seventy-six percent of the U.S. electricity and emit almost half of the nation's greenhouse gases.
So that how we manage the future of building and development will very much influence the intensity of energy demand.
"Keep in mind also that the U.S. consumes more energy than any other country in the world, and U.S. consumers consume nearly twenty-five percent of the world's energy and only accounts for five percent of the world's population."
So that our energy demand is increasing at about two percent per year.
So why might that be?
"I mean, obviously, we're changing our behavior."
We're changing our technology and our dependence on technology.
"And also the environments that we shape around us have enormous implications for energy that often are not well understood, for a variety of reasons."
Martin:
How do you look at the whole scenario we are moving into now?
Ole:
"Now I also work a lot with economy, beeing employed at a business school and have done so for many years when I was young I was very interested in Marxist ideas and economic theories so as I see it unfortunately we are heading into some very horrible scenarios and it applies to both the economy as a whole and our relationship with nature and the terrible thing is that we only do something about it when it's too late"
It might as well lead to a cultural revival and it's actually from there I think it would arrive
Martin:
A cultural revival?
Ole:
"Yes, a cultural revival ... a spiritual awakening is perhaps a better word a spiritual awakening where you understand that you have to saddle completely and radically over again but the cost will be very high before this consciousness change occurs"
"Now they register 40,000 cars a day, in China and that just can't go on.."
"Thank God the Chinese don't use toilet paper, cause if they did, we wouldn't have any forests left and presumably, no oxygen"
Martin:
"No, but there would be a better smell in China anyway you see there is a catastrophe scenario, but you hope there will be a kultural revival?"
Ole:
In disaster scenarios there are always cultural revivals
Martin:
"Well, you see those things?"
What are the symptoms of those things?
Ole:
"I like many of the things going on in the culture where people start to deal with what is called ""the spiritual"" but it is a very complex concept and there is so much ""Boss word"" about it but I sense a much greater need for spirituality and the answers to problems in terms of being mortal and having a soul in a body .."
"""Soma Sema"" as Plato said, ""The body is the requirements of the soul"""
One tends to focus more on that and although the solutions are confusing and weird and often commercially mediated and very distant from those that religion gave because it was institutionalized yet I see an awareness of our spiritual sides that also appear in the way we discuss how to help each other so in that way it's not a bad society we have
Martin:
You have insider information from CBS .. it is also something that the future leaders are thinking of? ole:
Yes very much ... you are even judged on whether you do so by your employees so you can not do it differently
Martin:
"So, there's only been a short time from these rabbit killer courses where you have to develop a kind of cynicism and the way people lived in the 80s to what we see now?"
Ole:
"Yes that's completely ""out"", what we are trying to do now is to set the values ​​in the center and make leaders to people who relate to their own humanity to the community and to their own human edification, to tell the truth, and I really like that."
Martin:
"And there is something about it that you associate it with art, right?"
Ole:
Now certainly you go to certain parts of
"Greece or Italy, or any Mediterranean country for that matter, and see that maybe the diet doesn't exactly reflect this."
But in the period of 1960 this is what the Mediterranean diet traditio nally looked like.
"What do you notice, about this pyramid, that's different, than some of the other food guides, that you might have seen?"
"Well to start out with, if you look at the base, the base of this pyramid focuses on being physically active, and the notion of enjoying meals with one another."
"But there's certainly a pscyhological component, and the sharing of foods among family and friends, that's integral, to this lifestyle."
"The base of the pyramid, as it pertains to food, is focusing on fruits, grains, vegetables."
Mostly whole grains.
"And olive oil, beans, nuts, legumes, seeds, herbs, and spices."
There's a little bit of protein that comes from fish and seafood.
"And even less focus on poultry, eggs, cheese. and yogurt."
"At the top, in very limited amounts, you see meats and sweets."
"Notice over here, there's inclusion of wine and it says, in small print, but it's there, in moderation."
"There's also the encouragement to drink water, which is a nice way of saying don't drink sugary sweetened beverages."
One of the most interesting things about the Mediterranean Diet is that it's not a low-fat diet.
"Right, it's actually pretty moderate in fat intake, 25 to 35% of the total of the calories."
Saturated fat's comprises no more than seven to eight percent of the calories.
"So, it's pretty decent in fat, but the fat's don't come from butter and cheese and meat."
They come from monounsaturated fat.
"Things like olive oil, nuts, and seeds."
With just a tiny amount of animal foods included in a diet.
"These monounsaturated fats are not alone protective against cardiovascular disease, but in combination, the lifestyle factors plus the dietary components, are what researchers think is the primary reason why we see lower rates of heart disease in people who eat this way."
There also is inclusion in the Mediterranean diet on alcohol.
Alcohol may be cardio protective in two ways.
It helps to reduce clotting and it also slightly elevates your HDL
levels.
"Now if you don't drink alcohol, its not worth picking it up or starting to drink alcohol to get these benefits."
"But if you do drink alcohol, there is an incentive to drink in moderation."
"Moderation, in nutrition science, with regards to alcohol consumption is referred to as no more than one glass of wine per day for women, and one to two glasses of wine per day for men, or another alcoholic beverage."
"But the point is that it should be, limited to one glass or serving per day for females, and one to two per day for males."
"What does the research show about the Mediterranean diet and heart health outcomes, and how does the"
"Mediterranean diet which is not low in fat, compare to a low-fat diet?"
"What we do see appears to be a port, with some ships; we see water and a small coastline; and some trees; and the vast blue sky above."
Steven:
"That blue sky, of course, is framed by a window that does not open, that's just above her, with the thinnest wood framing."
"That creates a cross, and she's directly below it."
"You do have the sense of the way in which spirituality must enview her, but she does seem as if her world is inside this room and that her only access outside is through this window."
"You mentioned the harbor, but there is a second kind of symbolism here that I think is important, and that is the mast on the right that's close seems to be moving."
"You do get the sense that the ship is passing slowly, and it becomes such a perfect metaphor for her life, as she watches life pass before her."
Beth:
"And the ships that she looks at will move on, and she will remain where she is, within this domestic environment."
"We wonder if she's feeling a sense of yearning for more, or that perhaps she's expressing a more generalized sense of yearning and desire for meaning that we see in so many other paintings by Friedrich."
Steven:
There's clearly that sense of the quiet and the contemplative in this painting.
All the things that we're saying are borne out in this painting through the subtlest means.
The sense of restriction that we're talking about is not because the room in which she is placed is small.
"It's in fact a very large space, it seems, with a very high ceiling, and of course these"
large windows that must let lots of light in.
It's not that.
It's the strictness of the geometry with which the painting is rendered.
"Friedrich grew up in Greifswald, which was then part of Sweden, and was schooled on Copenhagen, initially, before he went to Dusseldorf to finish his education."
That Northern tradition of the strictness of the geometric is really felt here.
"The woman, in contrast, though, is curvilinear, and so she doesn't fit easily into this geometry, into the rectilinear in which she's placed."
The ship that seems to be passing also breaks with the purely rectilinear.
"That mast is tilting ever so slightly to the right, as if it's moving forward."
"And so, all of this feels in contrast to the perfect verticals and the perfect horizontals."
Beth:
"As that mast moves slightly to the right, her body lists slightly to the left, breaking that rigid geometry."
"And, like so many other paintings by Friedrich, there's a real sense of symmetry and order, so that we immediately feel that the artist is saying something more in these scenes that otherwise we could classify as genre scenes or landscapes."
Friedrich is trying to imbue them with greater meaning.
Steve:
Friedrich's technique here is just spectacular.
"I mean, you've got this very soft rendering of the poplars beyond, and the beautiful sky that seems so translucent, is if it really does go on forever."
It makes the longing of the woman seem even more potent.
"The Minecraft community went bananas over this project, and Ben became an instant media celebrity."
"And indeed, for quite a few people, taking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will, has turned into a life-changing experience."
"For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music and math major from East Lansing, Michigan."
"A few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post on our website, and I'd like to read it to you."
So here's what Dan said.
"""I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy, and I made it through."
"I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree."
"But given what I now feel capable of doing,"
I would certainly do it again.
"To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed."""
"So Dan demonstrates the many self-learners who take this course off the Web, on their own traction, on their own initiative, and it's quite amazing because these people cannot care less about grades."
They are doing it because of one motivation only.
They have a tremendous passion to learn.
"And with that in mind,"
I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.
I'm sick of it.
"We are obsessed with grades because we are obsessed with data, and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing, and a huge part of education is about failing."
"Courage, according to Churchill, is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm."
(Laughter)
And [Joyce] said that mistakes are the portals of discovery.
"And yet we don't tolerate mistakes, and we worship grades."
"So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4, which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are."
"Well, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense, and grading became degrading."
"So with that, I'd like to say a few words about upgrading, and share with you a glimpse from my current project, which is different from the previous one, but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self-learning, learning by doing, self-exploration and community-building, and this project deals with K-12 math education, beginning with early age math, and we do it on tablets because we believe that math, like anything else, should be taught hands on."
So here's what we do.
"Basically, we developed numerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining a particular concept in math."
"So for example, let's take area."
"When you deal with a concept like area -- well, we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn."
"So if area is what interests us, then one thing which is natural to do is to tile the area of this particular shape and simply count how many tiles it takes to cover it completely."
And this little exercise here gives you a first good insight of the notion of area.
"Moving along, what about the area of this figure?"
"Well, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it."
"So, one of the things I just want to start out with--there's been a lot of chatter in the media and other places lately that the search market is settled and done."
What's your view on that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, there's obviously a lot of innovation ahead of us."
"If you look at what happened, we had a bug where we put a malware statement out for users, and in that time Yahoo searches gained very, very quickly."
"It looks like people will move very quickly from one search engine to another, for any one of reasons."
We've looked at this pretty carefully.
"A majority of people actually say they use more than one search engine, and of course Microsoft is working very hard to build a competitive search engine, and of course recently leaked more details about what they're doing."
"So, we have all of that activity, and then of course we have other activity as well, including a new entrance we're trying to combine search with other things."
"So I think search as it's defined right, as"
"Google has historically defined it, or defined by Google, is not settled at all."
It's interesting to note that people said the same thing 10 years ago about search with a different company. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Yep.
"And they've said it about operating systems today, and we had an interesting panel a moment ago."
"It leads to a question that, you worked at"
Sun where the network was the computer.
"You competed and partnered with Oracle, which believed the network computer was the future."
Netbooks are getting a lot of traction.
What's your view of how that market plays out? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
This is all part of cloud computing--whatever term you want to use--
let's use cloud computing.
Cloud computing is one of those changes that is going to happen regardless of whether the companies that are participating in the ecosystem allow.
Because the technology will make it happen.
I think everybody here knows what cloud computing represents.
"You can think about it in all the obvious ways, right?"
"So, for example, rather than buying a piece of software for a client, the Java Script and Ajax Code comes over to your browser and makes it very powerful."
All of that technology is getting much more mature.
But it is a fact that we live on very high performance wireless broadband networks.
"And that's not going to go away any time soon, because networks are getting much, much stronger."
"To me, the more interesting question is, what can you do, as a consequence of cloud computing, that you couldn't do before?"
A way of thinking about that is that IT systems today are so-- and excuse the broad overstatement--are so slow in the way in which they evolve.
"They're so stuck in the systems and parameters and architecture that they were built, that you have an opportunity to build a whole new generation of applications which cycle much faster for IT that integrate information in ways that could never been done before."
"In the same way that you can do this for the web, we're now, because everybody's on line, you have a lot of information that you can get about user behavior, that you can either mine or build products for, or do new interesting things for. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Once it's digitized, then it's available for the next thousand years in whatever formats will occur."
"We've done this very successfully with historic books, and we've done that with a set of partnerships here in Europe as well."
Some more questions? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MORGAN:
Jerry Morgan from IFA International.
"What would you define as the main business sort of strategic benefits to Google of Android, this free operating system which is use to cross different tablet, smartphone devices?"
What would you define as the key business benefits to Google of this?
And the second question is will this--could this possibly lead to commercial conflict with other organizations which you haven't had in the past? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Well, I'm sure that there will be commercial conflict with other people that we've not competed in the past because this is so new and we accept that."
Google takes an unusual view of these business questions.
We try to solve the problem from the end-user perspective and then we try to figure out a way to make money later.
"So in the Android's case, we think it's just interesting technology."
It enables a whole generation of new applications.
We demoed some of them.
These are things which we would never even conceive of a few years ago.
"And more importantly there are many, many people who are built--who do not work at Google, who are building powerful applications on top of the Android platform."
"So, from our perspective, the end-user benefit is obvious."
"If there are many, many, many millions of users of Android, I am sure that Google can figure out some ways to make money from that, but it will not be from charging for Android, it would be an insularly things."
I'll give you an example.
People who use Android search more.
"Well, we--as they search more with a powerful browser, they click on more ads."
So we estimated that Android already pays for itself so we're very happy with Android.
You could imagine there are many other things that we could do if we really cared about growing that business.
"For us, Android is precisely strategic because it allows us to create the complete system that we just showed you, the smartphone to the network to the super computer, and strategic because with that system you could do these amazing things that we saw in our demos."
"And by the way, Android is part of the Google television platform as well. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I've got to say, I appreciate your--right next to him--your vision of a bright future."
I would think that we would all like to share that.
There are some very large players your vision has to navigate around.
Players you don't and can't control whether it'd be autocratic governments.
"I know Google has had some issues in China recently, there's issues regarding network availability, whether or not the 3G network can--or the mobile network can handle, this new traffic data farms, et cetera, et cetera."
What are some of these issues that you can't control you are concerned about that we should be looking towards? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Well, it's worth saying right now that Google is not a country."
We are not a sovereign government and we are subject to the laws of the countries that we operate in.
And I want to make that very explicit because people get sort of confused about all of this.
Rising food prices limits people's access to food.
"And years of intensive chemical farming has destroyed lands, affecting the viability of future harvests."
What can we do to GROW?
Let's GROW our own movement here in Southeast Asia.
We can help women empower themselves so that they can have better access to produce food ... for their families and communities.
The FAO estimates that if women had the same access to productive resources as men ... yields can increase by 20 to 30%.
We can do this by supporting communities and peoples affected by land grabbing ... especially those who are pushed off by giant corporations.
We should call on government and companies to put a stop to land grabbing.
As individuals and groups ... we can push for regulation to help ensure that investments also benefit and do not harm communities.
We can also push for a global climate deal that demand huge emission cuts from developed countries.
Developed countries should also provide technology and finance ... to support adaptation projects of communities in the region.
We can call on governments in the region to invest in sustainable agricultural production using the communities local knowledge.
"We can buy and consume locally produced food ... to also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, normally produced in shipping food."
We can plant and GROW our-own seed now.
"For food, livelihood, community and the planet."
"Dear Athletes, I am glad to welcome you here at the capital city of lower Austria"
Lots of you have been here in the last years the know the awsome track the organizators have done their best - and they invented some new goodies the ironkids and the expo is now situated in the city center
"I hope, that beside the ironman event you will find some time to visit the town center and the whole region"
"I wish all the best, an awsome Im 70.3 and a good time in St. Pölten"
Dear Athletes of the IM 70.3 in St. Pölten
The orga welcomes you we wish a pleasant time and all the best for the race we hope to see you again next year
"Honestly, I didn't expect there will be so many of you, and I don't mean here particularly, I mean here altogether."
"I've been living thinking that there are 6 billion of us on this planet, it turns out there are more than 7 billion of us here already."
"Yet, you know, many surveys and popular sentiment suggest people feel more and more isolated, more and more lonely, more and more depressed, or just bored."
"Which made me wonder: how many people, out of those 7 billion, can one actually have meaningful relationships with?"
"I'm not talking here about the illusion created by Facebook or Twitter,"
I mean like real friendships.
If I can just ask you to think and count: how many real friends do you think you have?
How many people can you have a long and interesting conversation with?
"Or, how many people would you invite and would like to see for your birthday?"
"Or, how many people in unfortunate circumstances would show up in the hospital?"
It turns out there is a number
"And, and they've got a bunch of partnerships with retailers to redeem the rewards."
Standard straightforward kind of gamified system which they've been able to use in a large number of communities to encourage recycling behavior.
"Again this is a, this is a perfect example that this basic structure could be about anything, could be about something that's commercial, but it's using those techniques to help improve recycling and create all those sorts of benefits."
Education is in many ways ripe for gamification.
"Student motivation is a huge challenge, and we already have scoring systems, and reward systems, and credentialing systems, and so forth."
The challenge is for gamification to make the system better and not worse.
"Because to the extent that the game elements push students to just focus on those rewards, and just on what it takes to optimize on the game, and that's different from the true, authentic, intrinsically motivating learning that they should be engaged in."
"The gamification system, like a lot of educational reform effort might actually."
"Harm the educational process rather then help, so that's an important caveat."
"But there still are ways that gamification, if designed right, can be used in many positive ways in education."
And there are a range of different experiments and initiatives going on.
One interesting one is called Quest to
"Learn, which is an entire school."
There is now one in New York and in
Chicago built around games and games structures as the entire foundation of the curriculum.
"It's being led by Katie Sahlen, who is a noted game designer and game theorist and games educator."
"So, the number that are open at the end of one millisecond will be 100, because we started with 100 plus delta N zero is computed, as computed by the calculation we have just completed."
"So, if you would work that out please and find out what the actual number is at the end of one millisecond."
"Now, let's go on and do the question for ten milliseconds."
"Now, we can't just do this like we did part A because there is too much of an extrapolation."
"So, I'd say there's just too much, too long, ten milliseconds."
Too long to do in one step.
"I mean, for that matter, one millisecond might have been too long to do it in one step."
"We did it that way, but if we had done it in say, ten short steps, each 100 micro seconds, our answer might have been a little bit different and it would have been better."
"Ten milliseconds is definitely too long, so we have to do it some other way."
"Well, there are a couple of alternatives."
One alternative is to write a computer program and to do it as a whole bunch of short steps.
"But a better alternative, a better alternative is to look at our equation, dN0 / dt equals whatever it is, and then to solve that equation, solve."
"And when we solve the equation, we'll get"
N0 as a function of time equal to whatever it is over here on the right hand side.
Maybe you can solve it.
"And if you do, then, you'll be able to"
So I have 0 or more copies of my string body.
The elements of my string body are either normal characters or 2-character escape sequences.
All of this looks like 3 characters.
It's really just 2.
I have to escape the backslash.
"As a minor aside, after the Beatles and Sound of Music examples from above, you may not be surprised to know that a number of English songs of enduring popularity--ABC 123, BlNGO--seem to have a regular expression sort of feel."
"Repetition is very common in songs, and you get the same thing out of it that you get out of a regular expression, a concise notation versus in choruses, but then when you expand it out, it takes a long time to sing."
"However, there is 1 song that is actually too complicated for regular expressions-- the dreaded 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
If you actually want the counting to work out correctly-- 99 to 98 to 97--we can't fit it in a regular expression framework.
"We'll have to return to that later, and eventually we'll be smart enough to sing this song."
"For more info on this, Don Knuth, the computer scientist has written an essay on the complexity of songs."
Let's take a look at the first step of customer discovery.
You're going to be living this for the next couple of weeks if you're doing this for real.
Phase 1 is you state your hypotheses and you draw the business model canvas.
"And again, you put the canvas on the wall, you and your team get around and put up yellow stickies."
But the next step is you get out of the building.
You're going to test the problem.
"You're going to test your understanding of the customer's problem or need, and you're going to figure out how to build the prototype."
"The next thing is you're going to test the solution, and you're going to test the solution if you're on the Web by building a low fidelity and then a high fidelity prototype, and you're going to again test your understanding of the customers' needs and whether your solution matches this."
"And this match, again, is called product market fit."
That's the holy grail for entrepreneurs.
Am I building something that people can't get enough of or are just willing to open up their wallets and empty it in front of you to get their hands on?
And the fourth phase in customer discovery is you verify your pivot.
"Do people agree that you're solving a high value problem or need, and do you understand your business model enough to start test selling, which is the next step in customer validation."
"Now, what's really depressing to most entrepreneurs is the answer most often the first time you go through this is, ""Heck no."""
"And what's worse is, ""Well, they kind of, sort of like..."""
"Well, kind of, sort of is not a startup."
"Kind of, sort of is people have been nice to you."
"The only time you know that you have something that's worth investing your time and money in is if people are literally trying to force their money on you or can't use your product even in its buggy, uninitialized form enough."
This is what you're looking for.
"And if you haven't found it yet, that's why the customer development process is an iterative circle."
It assumes you will be going through this multiple times.
Keep your hands off our barbecues!
"But ... once it becomes clear that all this meat is making a major contribution to the destruction of our earth, shouldn't we think again?"
"And yes, I hear some of you thinking:"
"""Here we go again, yet another vegetarian fanatic."""
But I'm certainly not the only one who is worried about this issue.
"I'm Huw McConachie, I'm farm manager of a farm with 1000 hectares of land in Mid-Wales."
"We have around 800 head of cattle, including 550 dairy cows."
We have 3000 herd of sheep and we grow some arable crops.
"You can't deny as farmers, as agriculturalists, that methane produced by cows contributes to global warming."
"I'm David Davies, I work at the Institute of Biological,"
Environmental and Rural Sciences at Aberystwyth University.
"Cows have a very complex digestive tract, more complex than humans."
"Within their stomach, they are able to digest plant fibre and humans cannot."
"To do that, they need a very complex mix of bacteria and fungi and protozoa within their digestive system."
"Now these micro organisms do not have access to oxygen, and the food that we eat as people gets converted into carbon dioxide and water."
"Because ruminants in the rumen don't have access to oxygen, they need to produce a different range of end products."
And one of the key ones from the rumen is methane.
"When you compare with carbon dioxide, methane is twenty-one times more potent."
"The cow eats the feed in front of it and it goes into its stomach and, as a result of that, the cow burps a lot."
"And this gas, which is produced when the animal burps, is one of the gasses linked to warming and the greenhouse gas effect."
Every cow and every ruminant regurgitates its food into the mouth to chew and this enables the micro organisms in the stomach to actually get better access to that feed.
"And whilst they are regurgitating it, they are actually releasing methane."
"So every time the cud, as it is called, comes into the mouth, a small amount of gas will also be released and this will contain a large proportion of methane."
"Well we don't notice anything about it, because it is just a natural process, which occurs in all ruminants."
The dairy cow that's producing 8.000 to 10.000 litres of milk every year will produce around 500 to 700 litres of methane every day.
So your average cow will produce around 700 litres of methane per day.
This is equivalent to the amount of greenhouse gas CO2 emissions produced by a big 4x4 vehicle travelling around 35 miles per day.
The human population within the world is probably growing and it has to grow in line with the growth in population in order to feed that population.
I think that it should concern everybody.
"In 2006, the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN, the FAO, published an important report, which first brought the link between livestock farming and climate change to light."
"I am now going to speak to Dr. Henning Steinfeld, the chief author of this report."
"Dr. Steinfeld, you have calculated that livestock farming is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions."
ALEX FAABORG:
So I really like Fireworks.
"It has more direct manipulation of the objects, you can actually do nine slice symbols in it."
A lot of people use OmniGraffe or Keynote.
"For OmniGraffe and Fireworks, we have stencils."
We also have a Photoshop stencil for Android design.
"Really, the granularity of your mock-ups has a lot to do with how final you want people to think they are."
"So if you show someone a full-fidelity mock-up and ask their opinions, they're going to start commenting on the colors and those types of aspects."
"If you show them a wire frame, they're going to start commenting on the organization of the information, how you flow through the application."
So it's important to create the mock-up at the level of fidelity of the feedback that you want.
"Otherwise, really just sketching stuff on paper is a very quick, fast way of conveying ideas."
"Early in the process, it's about how many different designs you can come up with as opposed to creating a perfect one, so that's also important to consider."
AUDlENCE:
"A little bit taboo, but a lot of us have apps that are on multiple platforms, like iOS as well."
I just wanted to see what comments you might have on
"like where I work, there's like a-- to try to get it completely the same on both, and there's a lot of directions that designers want to go to consistency versus [INAUDlBLE] for the platforms?"
So I just kind of wanted to see what your comments are there.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
This is one that comes up quite a bit for designers in this industry.
"And the way that I think about it is, from the product to designer's point of view, what we're dealing with is all of these products across the different platforms."
"And so the first instinct is to design everything exactly the same because, and yes, it works the same across all the different platforms."
"But from the user's point of view, there are some users that have three different phone platforms in their pocket at all times, that's uncommon."
"More often, users will have one platform, and they're using all of these different parts of the platform."
"And so when they're looking for something to hang onto from a consistency standpoint, they're expecting things to work like the platform."
"So when you create an app that's consistent for you but not consistent for your user, then it's maybe not making the right choice."
"So designing for the specific platforms and designing for those conventions, it's a challenge to find a way to express your brand across all those platforms, but--"
ALEX FAABORG:
"Also, your brand should be stronger than just the Ul."
It's kind of silly if the UI is your brand.
"Your brand is about the emotional connection people have to your application, and your colors, and watermark, and things like that."
"And then also, Christian concluded his talk with showing users that you care, and also talking about how a poorly-designed icon, does that application crash more?"
"Your application, you could care a lot about it, but if it's identical to the other platforms, it kind of looks"
"I mean, outside schools that's called collaboration, you know."
"But inside schools and this isn't because teachers want it this way, it's just because it happens that way."
It's because it's in the gene pool of education.
We have to think differently about human capacity.
"We have to get over this old conception of academic, non-academic, abstract, theoretical, vocational, and see it for what it is a myth."
"Secondly, we have to recognize that most great learning happens in groups."
That collaboration is the stuff of growth.
"If we atomize people and separate them and judge them separately, we form a kind of disjunction between them and their natural learning environment."
"And thirdly, it's crucially about the culture of our institutions, the habits of the institution, and the habitats that they occupy."
"Today, we talk about innovation and tradition."
But I am more innovation than tradition especially in a country like the
Philippines where we don't really know who we are because we are just in the process of defining ourselves.
"Three hundred years in the convent as people say and 50 years in Hollywood, we are the most confused people in the planet."
"And now, we're seeing that together with other emerging countries in the world, we're starting to define ourselves."
And I find it most interesting at this point in my life that I work more with young people than those who are my age.
"I guess my journey began when I was 35 years old, when I had my midlife crisis."
"Just like many of the people in this country, you know, we were taught to study hard, to become successful, get rich and give to charity."
And I realize that I did all that.
"But at 35, I discovered that you can achieve your ambition but doesn't necessarily make you a happy person."
"And oftentimes, when we are just ambition-driven, we get something that we realize later on is an empty bag."
"And so, at 35, I had a wife, I had three children but I was not happy because I realize that the more that I was driven by a desire for personal success, I was living in a country where there was deepening poverty and there was growing corruption."
"And I also realize that the tradition drives us - development is driven by charity when we need to realize that as a Christian country, we have to also talk about Christian stewardship."
"And, and so, three things that was very clear to me - that I needed to address."
"One was that we had become a mendicant society, we were migratory and we were also mercenary."
"And I often wondered, people talk about sustainable development but what I saw was sustainable poverty."
"And I tried to understand our situation, the Five S's of sustainable poverty that the Filipino was living as a squatter."
"And a squatter does not have any dignity, does not have any security."
And a country of squatters cannot be globally competitive.
So the second thing was that the Filipino had lowered their standards.
"In his subhuman conditions, he was living in a shanty, that's the second S. And so, he could not come up with the best quality products because he himself is born and raised in a shanty, in a pile of garbage."
"And the third, he is raised in a village called a slum."
It takes a village to raise a child.
And that's everywhere.
"It's not just the fish, though, that are disappearing."
"Industrial fishing uses big stuff, big machinery."
We use nets that are 20 miles long.
We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks.
"And we trawl, which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds, put it on a big chain, and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish."
"Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest, because it clears it away."
And the habitat destruction is unbelievable.
"This is a photograph, a typical photograph, of what the continental shelves of the world look like."
"You can see the rows in the bottom, the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn."
"What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral, which is a critical habitat for the development of fish."
"What it is now is mud, and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud, to parking lot, is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity."
We've managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years.
We tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days.
"And all of that stuff is really disgusting, but what's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems."
And I'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution: one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients.
So this is the infamous
"Caulerpa taxifolia, the so-called killer algae."
A book was written about it.
It's a bit of an embarrassment.
"It was accidentally released from the aquarium in Monaco, it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria."
"It's very pretty, and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean."
I don't know how many of you remember the movie
"""The Little Shop of Horrors,"" but this is the plant of ""The Little Shop of Horrors."""
"But, instead of devouring the people in the shop, what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern"
Mediterranean Sea.
"We don't know anything that eats it, we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done, but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell, about which nobody knows what to do."
Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients.
"The green revolution, all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it."
"It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it."
"It runs down the rivers, and it feeds the plankton, the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water."
"But since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton, there's nothing to eat the plankton and there's more and more of it, so it dies of old age, which is unheard of for plankton."
"They make it a, a force that pervades the entire ship and that force of course centers on Captain Stone who's mad, but then infects everybody else, even our hero."
So this is how sound more or less works in
Ghost Ship it underscores the surface emotions.
That's how sound generally works in Hollywood.
"The, the idea Orchestral score tells us how to feel."
"But in this film, sound also gives us access to subjectivity."
"It tells us what's going on in character's minds, even when they don't want to show it to other characters."
"And for Lewton and Robson, the one thing it gives us that's new is that tension between sound and image."
And the entire film is about that.
The tension between what we see and what we hear.
"And that's going to be in the tension, attention that informs the entire horror film for Val Luten."
The difference between the surface that seems happy and the darkness which is always beneath.
So sound in this film creates a foreboding atmosphere.
It's the sound of the wind and the sound of the fog horn and the sound of the engine room.
The sound of Billy Radd singing that cannot ever be taken out of the ship and that always points forward to the darkness and doom.
If there is a ghost in the film it's I think the ghost of being a professional.
"This is a film about the horrors of being middle aged and having a job where you have to have authority over others, and you loose your sense of right and wrong and your ability to touch and understand the world at the very dark look at middle aged."
"And then the film has these great set pieces, theses scenes of terror, or suggested terror that loved, and we looked at the hook in which sound creates a monster out of."
"Of this, this object of the hook and makes it much bigger than just a piece of equipment on the ship and I recommend you look at the chain sequence and think about how sound works there because it does even more to turn that chain into, into a beast that is the monster of the film."
Began this class with two silent masterpieces really the last gasp of silent film made right when sound was coming in.
"And in those films we saw transcendent images, images that were lifted out of time and space and were emotionally charged speaking directly to the audience and an abstract way."
"Sound then, changes things because it makes the world more solid, more concrete, more mundane."
And we saw a different artists struggle with different ways of using sound.
"If sound limits abstraction one way to deal with it is to try to still go after silent abstraction, while having dialogue."
And that's what Rouben Mamoulian did in applause.
"He really, kind of, split the difference between the inflexibility of the new technology."
And its desire to have a more transcendent style.
"And in the end, the film works, but when it reaches after the silent, style it fails, because it can never become as fluid or dynamic as something like Street Angel, or Docks of New York."
"Vaudeville comedians like the Marx Brothers, took the concreteness and the solidity of the sound world and ran with it."
They brought iwth them an ability to manipulate oral space.
And enliven the soundtrack.
"And at the same time, the in congruence between their anarchy and the solidity of the world made things all the more funny."
And even
local community action agencies are looking into their work.
"They do a community needs assessment to determine what within the social strata, what within the entrepreneurial makeup and philanthropic community, what is missing in my community that would make a person's success from poverty to self- sufficiency, what is lacking."
So each if the programs within the CSBG dollars take on a different aspect of poverty.
Some are dealing with child care.
Some are dealing with education.
"Some are dealing with training, depending on what's already in the community."
And so it doesn't make it easy to use a wide brush or barometer to measure that success.
"We know the IS report that so many of you so dutifully prepared and worked on in your local agencies and also the state comes to us, we compiled that data as best we can along the 6 national goals to determine the success of this program."
"The problem of that is since some programs are so different and some of the measures aren't quite the same from one region to another, it's hard to get a true scientific look at those numbers and projections which is what a group"
like urban institute would do.
It may require some stream lining of CSBG.
In some instances we are measuring the same item in order to get a true national sense of where the program is.
Locally and state-by-state we can show you successful agencies and successful programs.
"We can show you successful states, but it's not always easy to do on a national sense because of the way these things are recorded and judged."
"Mark, you may want to add something to that, but I think that is a problem for"
CSBG.
"The strength of CSBG is also now, 50 years later, probably the weakness of CSBG because of the modern conveniences, technology, and the way things are measured now, things are recorded and things are judged."
CSBG is not conducive to that with such a myriad of programs from one state to another.
Mark:
Thanks Arley.
The one thing I wanted to add to that is as you read through the President's budget request and you look at our current ROMA and MPI systems you can see how it's a system that's set up to measure performance.
It is not a system around performance based programing and performance based funding.
I think that's a distinct difference between what they're looking to do with CSBG and what we currently have.
This is just in the request.
"This is not something we're pushing for, but this is something that they're looking for."
It's how they can make the programing and the funding performance based.
"They recognize the performance measurement system that we have, and they understand it."
"They just think it's not quite what they need, or what they wanted to see for the CSBG."
"And I understand too that to do that you're looking at drastic changes to the program, to the way fund are distributed, to the way formulas are run, really a major reform."
Brad:
Let me ask one additional question here on CSBG and then we're going to talk to Bob Scott just a concluding comment on weatherization.
"Now, the way you use it, you take this little cord here, put it on the paint, and it tells me there's 894 microns of paint on this car."
"Now, if you get to a lower and a lower and a lower number, at some point it'll tell me that I can't buff the car and I can't restore it."
"So on occasion, I'll come to a customer and say, hey, your paint is really trashed, but there's nothing I can do because I don't want to take away the UV protection or the clear coat on the car."
This machine will tell you that.
"And normally, you can't see it just by looking at it."
You need one of these.
"They are a bit pricey, but they're worth every penny."
"All right, the geekiest tool I have and probably the most fun, is the Dino-Lite microscope."
"Now, the way you use it is you put it on the paint just like this, and it gives me an image on the Mac here of all the scratches in the paint."
It helps me determine whether I've actually repaired the paint or filled it in.
"Now, this here, is really, really high tech."
"Now, as you can see here, we've isolated a very big scratch."
"All these will come out, but this may give us a little bit of trouble, so I'll keep an eye on that."
"Now, that we stripped the car, clayed the car, and taken a microscope and seeing all the little scratches so we get a better idea of how to approach the car, the next thing you want to do is you want to create a test panel."
"Now, what I like to do is pull my masking tape out just like this, break a little piece off, and the trick is to"
lightly tap it on your thigh.
What that does is it removes the extra glue that's on there.
"So when you put it on just like this, when you go to pull it off, there isn't that line that's really annoying that you've got to rub it a little bit extra."
And so I'm going to mask off the rest of this and test this panel right now.
Using tape allows me to see a before and after shot when determining what products and procedures are working and when it's not.
Be sure to keep test areas to one panel only and in the
least conspicuous part of the car.
"Before we can repair the clear coat, it's important to understand what makes up the different layers of paint, how scratches affect your clear coat, and more importantly, how they're removed."
"Brand new paint, or what we call perfect paint, has a flat, glass-like surface that reflects 100% of the light back to your eye, much like a mirror."
"However, over time, with poor cleaning habits, the clear coat will develop minor and sometimes major scratches that reduce the amount of reflection causing it to appear dull."
"Once wax is applied, it acts as a filler to flatten the surface of the clear coat once again making your car look shiny."
"Although the paint looks repaired, it's actually only a temporary or cosmetic solution to the dullness."
"After a few washes, the wax or filler will degrade and the once-covered scratch will be exposed again putting you right back in the same situation."
So what are we to do?
"In this case, since we decided to permanently repair the paint, we need to know a little bit more about abrasives and how they work."
Compounds and polishes work in almost the same way as sandpaper.
"In fact, they are sometimes referred to as liquid sandpaper, because they're delivered and applied to the paint in a fluid instead of the traditional paper."
And initially X is going to be just the source vertex itself.
So now we enter them in while loop.
"And so remember, in the while loop, we say, well, let's scan all of the edges whose tail is in the vertices we've already looked at."
"Whose tail is in X, and whose head is outside of X. Now in this first iteration, there are two such edges."
"There's the edge SV, and the edge SW."
So how do we know which of these two to use.
Well we evaluate Dijkstra's greedy criterion.
You guys remember what that is.
"Dijkstra's greedy score for a given edge VW That's crossing the frontier, is just the previously computed shortest path distance for the A tail of the arc plus the length of the arc itself."
"So at this point SV has a greedy score of zero plus one, which is one, and the arc S comma W has a greedy score of zero plus four, which is four."
"So obviously SV is going to be the shorter of those two, so we use the edge SV, this is playing the role of V star W star on the previous slide, and the algorithm them suggests we should add V to our set X, so we suck in V, and our new X consists of S and V. [sound]."
"And it also tells us how to compute the shortest path distance and the shortest path from S to V, namely in the A array, we just write down what was the greedy, the Dijkstra's greedy score for this particular edge, and that was zero plus one, or one."
"It also tells us how to compute the shortest path for v, namely we just inherit the shortest path to the tail of the arc, which, in this case, was the empty path from S to itself, and then we tack on the end, we append the arc we used to get here, the arc S to V."
So now we go to the next iteration of the while loop.
So with our new set [inaudible] consisting of S and v. Now again we wanna look at all edges which are crossing the fr ontier.
Edges that have tail in X and head outside x.
And know we see there is three such crossing edges.
"There is SW there is VW and there is VT all of those have the tail in X and the head outside of X, so we need to compute"
"Dijkstra's greedy score for each of those three and then pick the minimum, so let's go from bottom to top, so first of all we can look at the arc SVSW, excuse me."
"And the greedy score here is the shortest path distance for the tail, so it's zero, plus the length of the arc, which is four."
So here we get a four in this iteration.
"Then, if we do this crossbar edge, this VW edge, the Dijkstra greedy score is the a value, or the shortest path distance value of the tail, and we computed that last iteration."
The a of V value is one.
"We add to that the length of the arc, which in this case is two."
"So this edge three, [inaudible] this edge VW has a score of three."
"Finally there's the arc VT, and here, we're gonna add one, which is the shortest path distance of the tail of the arc, plus the edge length which is six."
So that has the worst score.
"So since the edge VW has the smallest score, that's the one that guides how we supplement X, and how we compute the shortest path distances in the shortest path for the newly acquired vertex W. So the changes are, first of all, we enlarge X. So X is now everything but T. And then how do we compute things for W?"
"Well the shortest path, so our entry in A array is just going to be Dijkstra's [inaudible] greedy score in the previous set of rations so that was one plus two so that's going to be equal to three."
"And then what is the shortest path, how do we fill up the array B?"
Well we inherit the shortest path to the tail of the arc.
Which in this case is the arc SV and then we append the arc that we used to choose this new vertex W so that's the arc VW.
Around that you'll see the
Performance Management and how we use all our vast scores of information and data to frame and demonstrate our valuable outcomes in ways that meet both our network's and external audience's needs.
It's important to note that it goes from the federal level to state to local levels and then back up to the state and federal levels as well.
There is complete accountability at all levels in the network.
"That's all that I had for the Community Services Block Grant presentation, but there's a number of questions that have come in that I will be running through, and the first thing to note is that these slides will be sent out as an addition to the webinar."
These slides will be sent out after the presentation.
So the first question refers to the chart about the Community Services Block Grant figures and whether there could also be a chart that compares the House numbers and the Senate numbers.
We communicate through the StateOfPoverty.org.
That's our NASCSP online blog.
As soon as we have those exact figures from the Senate and the House we'll be posting those on our blog to run through the comparisons of the different numbers.
"In addition, when we get the final fiscal year 2013 numbers we'll also be sure to share those with you as well so that you can see how they match up to previous years and any potential future proposals."
Another question that we had was about open competition on the President's budget.
The competition specifically in regards to those core federal standards.
It speaks to how the states will be required to implement immediate open competition to serve the affected communities.
I think that language is important to note.
It also describes how the current distribution of funds to states and territories and tribes will be maintained.
So it
looks as though the system that they're proposing would include competition within the states but not competition among the states.
"However, I want to put a caveat on that as I say it to say that this is simply a proposal in the budget request in that this language could change and could be shaped differently once it gets put into legislative language and it goes through Congress as well."
There's another question about states that receive the minimum allocation of Community Services Block Grant funds.
That formula is really put together by the office of Community Services.
They could tell you why each state is receiving the amount that they're proposed to receive.
I don't have specific information on that formula but I will certainly be looking into it and will get back to you with more information on that.
Brad:
"You have a question, Mark."
Todd Richardson asks if you can tell us why the President dislikes Community Action Network.
When did he begin to want to end our work?
Mark:
Well that's a very interesting question.
It was two years ago that the President mentioned in the
"State of the Union Address that he was going to propose cuts in his budget to things that were, ""near and dear to his heart"", like Community Action."
I can't speak to the President and whether he likes or dislikes the program.
"Maybe you want to do the initial page load on the server side so you can send HTML over the first view, so views are going to be looking at that while you're sending the rest of the scripts over."
You can do that now trivially.
"It used to be you had to write the program twice in order to have the two views, but now you only have to do that once."
"If you wanted to have a web service which provides a portion of that view so that it can be included in other programs, that web service can be created with the same program."
"We've got other advantages, too."
We can take advantage of YUl's connection manager to go off to several services simultaneously and get additional material that we want to put onto the page.
"That all happens asynchronously, so the time cost we spend on that is the max of all of the services that we go out and read."
"Whereas if you're doing it in PHP, you pay for the sum of the time of all of those services, which can be significantly bigger."
"In PHP you can do it asynchronously, but it's hard, and nobody wants to do hard in PHP."
That's madness.
[laughter]
That's not what it's for.
"But in JavaScript, on YUl, in node, it's easy and it's wonderful, so it's a huge advantage."
"Also we're running on V8, which is Google's JavaScript engine, which is a very nice engine."
"It comes out of the Self tradition, which is really smart stuff."
"It observes the program as it's interpreting it, and if it sees patterns of recurrence then it goes OK, I think I know what's going on, I will compile it and make that little bit of code faster."
"So it starts finding sequences in the code it can make fast, and eventually your program's going really, really fast."
"V8 is also available in the Chrome browser, and it's not as effective there because you tend not to spend that much time on running a program on any page."
"But in the server, you're running there all day, so there's a good opportunity for it to learn about your program and speed it up."
So this is really wonderful configuration.
"If you look at the stack of protocols that we have to work with, we've got the wonderful"
"IP, which can move a packet pretty much from anyplace in the world to any other place."
It's a wonderful thing.
"We've got TCP that runs on top of it, which makes it reliable and provides for sequencing."
That's a really good thing.
"Then we've got HTTP, which is just completely wrong."
"It was designed for a time when the web was a static document retrieval system, and it's fine for that, but that's not what we do now."
"We're not retrieving static documents, we've got highly interactive applications going over this channel, so the fact that HTTP is stateless becomes a real problem."
"We spend a lot of time in working our Ajax stuff, trying to put the state back in, and it's hard."
"It'd be nice if we could just get rid of HTTP completely and run Ajax on top of TCP, which would be really clean and elegant and performant and wonderful."
"I don't think that'll ever happen because there's so much arthritis that's found its way into the internet now; all these nodes out in the network that will only allow HTTP through, so that really the only value in HTTP now is for funnelling, because that's the only thing that can get through the firewalls and the proxy servers."
"Stupid, but that's the world we live in."
I'm going to argue that it's a pretty reasonable one.
We tried limiting our recursion to only add new routes that were cheaper than existing routes to and from the same place.
We weren't allowed to do that syntactically the recursive with statement didn't allow the sub query with the recursively defined relation in it.
"So we're going to do a different change here where we're not going to add new roots to our flight when the length of the root, in other words the number of flights contributing to that root, is greater than or equal to ten."
So how do we do that?
"We're going to add to our recursively defined relation route the origin, destination and total cost of that."
And then we are going to add the length.
"And so that's going to put in each root tupple, how many flights were involved in the root."
So let's see how we do that with our recursion.
We still have the base case here and the recursively defined union.
"In our base case, we're going to be adding to our route the non-stop flights, so we'll have exactly what thought we had before, and then we'll have the constant one to say that this non-stop flight is just one flight."
"Then when we do our recursion, we're joining our route relation that we're building up by extending it with an additional flight exactly as before, but there is two changes here."
One of them is that we're going to compute our new length by adding one to the existing length of the root for our new root because we're adding one flight.
And then we're only going to add tupples to the root relation when the length of the route that we're adding is
less than ten.
So now let's see what happens.
I'm going to start again by
looking at all of the costs of getting from point
A to point B and then we'll take to look at finding the least.
"So, we'll go ahead and execute the query and we see that we have, one, two, three, four, five ways of getting from A to B, where the length of the number of flights involved is less than or equal to 10."
We see our friends here.
This was the nonstop flight.
This was the one through Boston.
Here's our favorite one and there's a few more so these are going to go through that cycle a couple of times.
"But once we get to the length of ten, we're not going to add any more, so we've got termination and if we want to change it to find the minimum cost flight, then it's just the min total as before, and we'll find good old 175."
"Now what 's unaesthetic about this, is that we're actually limiting the amount of recursion."
"So, the whole point of writing recursive queries is when we don't know the minimum number of computations that we need to do to get our answer."
"So maybe it would so happen to turn out that more than ten flights were required to get the cheapest and, if that was the case, then we wouldn't get our right answer."
"Of course, we could change it to a hundred and we'd still get the one seventy five."
"And, you know, honestly we could change it to 10,000 and you can't see it happening here but it is actually recomputing that 175 even when I put in 10,000."
"I can even do a 100,000 and still going to work for me."
"So, if we presume that nobody wants to take more than a 100,000 flights in order to get from Point A to Point B in the cheapest fashion then, this would be a reasonable way to bound the recursion and get the answer that we want."
"Similar to Ebbinghaus's original forgetting curve, though, most of your forgetting will occur within the first few years of disuse."
"After that point, your forgetting will pretty much level off."
The interesting thing about decay and forgetting is that just because you can't retrieve something doesn't mean it's completely gone from your long-term memory.
"Other than outright retrieval, one way we can tell if people have learned something before is by how quickly they re-learn that information or skill."
So remember Ebbinghaus?
"In addition to forgetting, he studied re-learning with those same three-letter nonsense syilables."
"He found that even if he couldn't produce all the syilables from his list, it took him less time to learn the list the second time around than the first time, indicating that some foundation of the memory still existed, even though he couldn't produce it at the time."
"This foundation is called savings, because it's what saved in your memory, whether you realize it or not Re-learning works with procedural skills, too."
"For example, imagine that you learned how to play particular song on the piano a few months ago, but you can't play any of it today."
Now I give you the music to that song and ask you to learn it again.
"If the inability to retrieve something meant that it was completely gone from your long term memory, then it would take you the same amount of time to learn the song the second time around."
However it probably would take you
less time to re-learn it than it did for you to learn it originally.
This faster rate of re-learning tells us that you still have some information about that song stored in your long-term memory.
"Sometimes decay isn't the problem, though."
It's that something else seems to be blocking our ability to get to the information we want.
"This experience is called interference, and there are two main types-- retroactive and proactive."
"Retroactive interference is interference that goes backwards, that is, some new piece of learning seems to reach back and impair your ability to retrieve something you used to know."
"For example, when you move to a new place, you get used to writing your new address on all the different forms and documents and stuff."
"And after a while of using this new address, you may find it difficult to recall your old one."
"In this case, your new address would be running some retroactive interference on your old address"
"Proactive interference, on the other hand, is interference acting forward."
Something you learned in the past gets in the way of your ability to learn and retrieve something correctly in the future.
So I'll give you an example of something that happened to me a few months ago.
I used one password for my email for a really long time.
But then I had to change it.
"Sometimes when I log in, it's still hard for me to remember what my new password is, because all I can come up with is my old one."
"In this case, the prior learning up my old password is impeding my ability to remember the new one."
So let's just see how it works on the same example we traced here earlier.
So we sorta have just by initializing things in the obvious way.
"So, the shortest path distance from S to itself is zero."
And the shortest path from S to itself is just the empty path.
"left end of the ladder was already in the garage, this door stopped the front end but the left hand kept, as seen by the ladder this left hand kept coming."
"So, there is no contradiction, there is a lot of kinetic energy to be lost and there might be a great explosion."
"And, of course, if the latter doesn't blow itself to smitherines, then of course there will be an elastic rebound."
"It will, this, the back end of the latter will now pop back to the right at high speed."
Whoops.
"High speed but less than the speed of light crashing to the garage door and then whatever happens will happen but you can indeed enclose the ladder in the garage, at least in the instant."
And the error that we were making when we were trying to compare the two frames and say you stock the ladder at the front was the assumption was that the ladder is a rigid object.
One of the things we learned here is that the objects with a given shape and size.
Do not make relativistic sense.An object whose pen has a size and the shape in a sense that when I move this side of it.
"And I drop it, the other side moves as well."
"This could not realistically be true, in fact, if you look very closely, it's not true."
"When I move this side, actually the pen bends a little."
"A sound wave goes travelling down the pen, and if it were a slinky with a slower sound wave, you'd be able to see it."
"And when the sound wave reaches here, then and only then, does the other end start rising. when you're dealing in realistic speeds, this little time delay makes all the difference."
So thinking of an object as having a given size in realistic terms is a really bad idea.
"So hopefully we've learned some resul ts of some of the ways to think about relativistic kinematics and hopefully you understand the resolution of the ladder diagram though as I said, it takes seeing the solution and then thinking about it a lot and arguing and I hope the forums will be lively."
A perhaps even more famous paradox of special relativity is the twin paradox.
And the twin paradox I'm going to demonstrate graphically.
"We won't do too many calculations there's not much to compute, so what's the story with the twin paradox?"
We have two twin brothers or sisters and they live until some age on Earth.
"And then, at some point, one of them gets into a spaceship traveling at high speed in some direction. close to relativistic speed, or traveling for a long time."
And for a long time this twin travels off into space.
"So, he's going moving to the right."
"And then after have achieving, achieved a certain distance, he hops on another spaceship moving at the same speed but in the opposite direction."
"And, after a while returns to Earth and gets reunited with his twin."
"Now of course, when they left they were the same age."
"So the question is when twin number two returns from his voyage, who is younger?"
Are they the same age and the answer is no.
They are not the same age and it's easy to make that calculation but then its puzzling to understand.
"Wait a minute, so let's first start with the question who is younger."
Well.
"We have here the usual two events, event number zero and event number one and the Coordinates of these events, again I have my usual axis x prime, t prime t double prime here is the a new time axis which is the world line of the twin number two on his return but I'm gonna start by dealing with this segment, it is sort of clear by symmetry that everything that happens along this segment happens symmetrically along this segment."
"These are, by no means all of the potential applications."
"And I'm only going to give you, an example or two in each category."
"As a way to get you thinking about, the potential in these areas and the different kinds of approaches that might be involved."
The first example is something called Zamzee that comes from an organization called Hope Labs and Hope Labs is a non-profit that uses games and game-like systems for better health outcomes.
"So they do some wonderful work around using serious games for cancer patient recovery, but what I'm gonna focus on now is something that they make called the Zamzee."
And the Zamzee is a little device.
"That, is, an accelerometer that keeps track of how active you are."
How many steps you take when you walk up steps and so forth.
And so it measures your physical fitness activity.
"So therefore, it's similar to the Nike plus system that I mentioned earlier."
And also to the Fit Bit system that some of you may be familiar with but Zamzee is interesting.
Because it's targeted at low income teenagers.
There's a terrible problem in the United States about obesity and sedentary
lifestyles among low income communities and especially young people.
So Zamzee is an attempt to focus in on that problem using this device.
And it works the way you might expect.
"You get your activity level tracked, and based on that you earn points, and you can unlock badges for various kinds of achievements, you can level up and you can win various kinds of rewards or, or earn various kinds of rewards based on your points and so forth."
Standard kind of set of game mechanics that we've seen throughout the class.
"But what HopeLabs has been able to show is that this device, which is designed in a way that's focused in again on these particular communities, actually produces real results."
So they did a randomized study of 350 teenagers in this community and found a 30 percent increase in activity levels with the Zamzee.
"So that's an example of something which the, again the same basic device, the same basic mechanics get used in commercial applications but it can be targeted and focus in on achieving a social benefit."
We've seen several other health and wellness applications already in the course.
The Kia system for wellness activities by people in enterprises.
Fitocracy to get people to work out and go to the gym more.
"Here is another one, though, that's a"
little bit different.
"This is something caller Superbetter which is, a, a product of Jane McGonigal's company which is also called Super Better."
And Superbetter is about improving people's life.
Allowing people to overcome illnesses and to motivate themselves around these kinds of health challenges using gamification.
"So she developed it after she had a concussion that's why her character you see here is Jane the concussion slayer and she created her own little game for motivating her to engage with family and friends, and to go through the various kinds of steps that she needed for recovery."
"And Superbetter is an attempt to generalize that for all kinds of situations where people have health problems that they are trying to overcome, or otherwise trying to improve their situation."
And it uses things like quests.
"Back in about 1955 or so, a forward thinking atmospheric scientist started measuring the carbon dioxide in the world's atmosphere right here at 11,000 feet on Mauna Loa on the big island of Hawaii."
And he chose that because there you're about 2500 miles out from any continent.
"The atmosphere has been well mixed by the trade winds, and you're going to get a very, very well mixed sort of standard signal that's not contaminated by any local industry or anything like that."
This is what it looks like.
"This is the Mauna Loa direct measurement signal over here, and these are inferences of past levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere."
"This is parts per million by volume in the atmosphere, over here."
And you can see that there's a signal that human industrial activity has been increasing carbon dioxide level arguably since the late nineteenth century-- okay?--and it's accelerating upward.
These are from ice core measurements that are done mostly in Greenland by Danes and Swiss who go to Greenland and bore down through the icecap.
"Now let's put that in perspective, okay?"
"So this is today and this is 500 million years ago, and these are all different kinds of measurements of carbon dioxide through the last 550 million years."
"And the 30 million year filter is--this is a moving average, a 30 million year moving average--and basically what it shows is that most of the time the earth has had a lot more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than it currently has; much more than anything that has been contributed by human activity and industry in the last 150 years."
"This is estimated by various different methods, and it has a couple of striking features."
Look what happens to carbon dioxide between the Ordovician and the Carboniferous.
It is sucked out of the atmosphere.
Where do you think it went?
Student:
Over there.
Prof:
Some.
Some went into reefs.
It went into your gas tank.
That's when oil and coal were made.
"So when land plants first evolved--and that was when- that was the first big forest, planet covering forest, and it was warm and moist-- in those carboniferous swamps, you know, generation after generation, for thousands of generations of plants, built up."
"Then there's an interesting re-injection of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in the Permian, and it happens particularly at the end-Permian crisis, and this re-injection then does have the oceanic element."
Okay?
"So some of that stuff did get stored,"
"like in the Black Sea, right here, and then with the end-Permian extinction and the breakup of Pangaea and the re-ordering of the oceanic circulation patterns it got re-injected."
Then throughout the Mesozoic--so throughout the time that the earth was dominated by dinosaurs and their other relatives-- it was pretty warm and plants could really grow.
"They were getting--by the way, carbon dioxide is a fairly good fertilizer; so plants do grow more rapidly when they have more of it, if they aren't being limited by some other nutrient."
"And then when we get into the last 65 million years, here, carbon dioxide is going down, down, down, until we get to what we perceive as the normal concentration-- right?--the normal concentration being down here."
"Well it was a lot higher, for a long period of time."
I think there's an important message in that.
This question made me think of it.
"You talked about the stimulus package, and as consumers on Wall Street, we don't see a lot of the impact of the stimulus package with any immediacy, but that's not the point."
"The point, or that's not the question."
"On the academic side, the institutions that are going to get some of the spending now--have a good sense of when they're going to get it."
But who's going to get it?
They're prioritizing--they're really excited.
You grew up in your business career in Silicon Valley.
"You grew up in an industry and with a company son that might not have existed but for government funding and AT&amp;amp;T support, and I'm stretching the facts here a little bit to make a different point."
"Are you confident, given what you've heard, given where you've been over the course of the last several weeks, that the American economy will see some good things come out of that directed spending that is going into academic institutions, as unlike what we have seen in a very long time? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"I am, and I think there's a lot of reasons to be very optimistic."
"I know everybody is sort of depressed when you read the headlines and watch the television, and so forth."
"But, the American story is a story of innovation."
"And the system of universities that we have, the young founders that come out of universities that form great companies, the ability to do quickly the capital formation and the venture industry, and so forth, is unparalleled."
"If you look at where jobs come from, they come from the private sector."
"And high-paying jobs come from people who work in knowledge-intensive industries that are sophisticated, or very high in manufacturing jobs."
"So it seems obvious to me that part of the way to get this fixed for the longer term, and I'm not talking about the regulatory failures, which is another separate and long conversation."
"It's to make sure that the necessary pre-conditions are present for entrepreneurs and existing businesses to either re-use existing capital plants to build, for example, the classic example here is batteries for hybrid cars in the United States, as opposed to in Korea and in Germany."
"And, basically, get those jobs in the United States."
"That's ultimately the answer to all of the incessant criticism that you hear about jobs moving to India and China, and service wages, and so forth and so on."
"It's ultimately about the extraordinary asset that we have in our universities and our research labs to, essentially, create the next Google."
And not just in our industry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
We have time for one more question.
"Yeah, go ahead."
Eric will repeat it. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;OFF MlKE SPEAKER:
Getting around to the [inaudible] that you talked about.
What are the three things that need to happen for it to become
a material part of your business? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
The question was what are the three things that needs to get done to become a material part of our business?
"Let me answer your question without the word â€˜material' in the middle of it, because â€˜material' has a very specific meaning."
"The first problem, if you're a display--if you have essentially a display property-- you know, you want to sort of show ads, it's very difficult to figure out which ad to show."
Because there are multiple vendors who show you these ads.
"And we're in the process of building the equivalent of an ad exchange, which will allow you to do that automatically."
"Anyways, this is the time to the top of the trajectory but we know the full time is twice that so I'll just put a 2 here."
"Once we know the time, how do we find the range?"
We'll we used this equation and now I've plugged in for the initial velocity the initial x velocity V₀ cosine of 45.
I've multiplied by the time that we just calculated because remember in the x direction the acceleration is always zero.
"Okay, let's simplify--well, I've multiplied the V₀ together to get this V₀² and actually if I carry out cosine of 45 times 945, I find it's just equal to one half."
"This part the one half cancelled with the 2, I've find that my maximum range is equal to my initial V²/a."
"Now, I do not really care about V₀²."
I want to know how range scales with a and it turns out well it's proportional to 1/a or R is proportional to a⁻¹.
"Well so what, how do I use that--just like we did early in the unit, we found out using a lot of ratio and the ratio of the range on earth to the range of this unknown planet is going to be equal to the ratios of the accelerations taken to the -1 power."
A -1 power just means flip what you have inside.
I can solve this for the unknown acceleration and I get this equation.
The acceleration on our unknown planet is equal to the ratios of the ranges times the acceleration on earth.
"When I found what we know, I find that the acceleration on our unknown planet must be 1.6 m/s², which is exactly the acceleration on the moon and we've figured out where we are."
Amazing work--there were other ways to solve this--equally valid-- but this is one tool that you should try to familiarize yourself with.
I'm Peter Du Bois.
I live at Speakers Court.
The situation at the moment is as near perfect as it can be in sheltered accommodation
Staff at Speakers Court are very understanding and they've come to know us all very well
I think Scope has given me the opportunity to become as independent as I can be
"Assuming that we have an accurate voter registration database, we know who the proper voters are."
The next procedural question is how are we going to authenticate those voters when they arrive at the polling place.
"In many countries, there are national IDs and most countries that have these, just use these for voting as well."
"You present your national ID card, they check your picture, and you're allowed to vote."
"In the US, however, we don't have a national ID card."
We have drivers licenses issued by each state and we have passports issued by the
"Federal Government, but it's really a patchwork rather than just one single standardized system."
"This greatly complicates election procedures in the US and results in a variety of, of different solutions."
Many states require only a signature to verify that the voter is who they claim to be.
The voter registration database is printed with into a list at each polling place of the people who live in that area and each voter who's eligible to vote at that polling station has a space on this list.
"And for a long time, this was done entirely on paper like this."
"So, the way it would work is the voter would arrive at the polling place they'd announce themselves to the to the poll workers."
"The poll workers would look them up on both the registration list, and then they'd sign their name into the poll book."
We can also get to
Las Vegas and this mysterious
CMH I wish I remembered what it were.
So now if we're interested in finding the cheapest way to get from A to B then We'll add where the destination equals
B on here and we'll add the minimum total cost and hopefully that will be our good old 175 and indeed it is.
By the way we can do the same basic idea but backwards.
Instead of finding all the places that we can get from city A how about if we find all the places from which we can get to city
B. So here's the query that does that.
"To B is going to be our recursively define relation that's going to give us the origin, the place from which we can get to B and the total cost of getting to B from that place."
"So again, the structure is exactly parallel."
We start out with our base query saying if we have a direct flight to B then we can get from the origin of that direct flight at the cost of the flight to
B and we then recursively add flights on that you can think of if your going from left to right adding flights from the left.
So if we know we can get from a place to B and then we can go from...take a direct flight from somewhere else to that place And we can get from that somewhere else to be.
"Anyway so we do that again by joining so we're going to take our origin from which we can get to B we're going to find flight that take us to that origin, we're going to add the cost of that flight and that gives us a new way to get to B. And then let me start by just writing the query that all of the places from which we can get to B and the cost of getting there."
We'll run the query.
And we can see that we can get to B from point
A in 3 different ways and from our other cities in our database as well.
"Similarly, to what we did previously, if we're particularly interested in getting from A to B, whoops, let's make that our origin then we add where origin equals a and if we want the minimum it would be our minimum total again paralleling exactly what we did before."
We run it and good old 175 comes out.
"Now we're going to have some real fun because I added another flight to our database, and this flight takes us from Columbus, I now know its Columbus, to Phoenix and creates a loop in our flights."
So that means that we can fly from A to
"B next to Las Vegas, to"
"Columbus, back to Phoenix and then to Las Vegas and Columbus again."
"So, we're going to have arbitrarily, actually unbounded, actually infinite, length routes that we can take now."
"Now, obviously those routes aren't going to ever be the cheapest way because as we take those roots it's going to get more and more expensive, none of them are negative costs paying us to take flights."
But if we just do our naive recursion where we generate all of our roots before we take a
look at our final query then we're going to be generating an infinite number of roots.
"So here's our original enquiry, the first one we wrote, where we were just finding all of the costs of getting from A to B by computing all of the roots in the entire database and then looking at those from"
A to B. Now with our additional flight that creates a loop we run this command and nothing happens.
Actually if we wait long enough we're going to get an error.
"Well, okay we waited for a while. appears that the user interface we're using isn't going to show us the error."
"But if you try running this in post risk command line interface,"
"In his view, the family and associates of anyone who..."
"Sorry, I've used that word ""commit""... who suicides..."
We have to have a verb in there somewhere;
"I don't like turning nouns into verbs, I'm sorry..."
"So, commits suicide suffer enough grief without having it played out in the news media."
So where I stray from the media party line on reporting suicide is that I think he was right.
I haven't had any personal family brushes with suicide that inform that stance.
It's just my view as a human being who happens to be a journalist.
"They are human beings, believe me."
And as a teacher and media commentator.
"I found it interesting, by the way, that very few people have considered what this does to journalists, yeah, but I think, in Australia, there's the Dart Institute, is doing a lot of work about the trauma that journalists face."
"I mean, we are seen to be inhuman, possibly because of the things that we do, but..."
"So I won't, for what I'm saying today,"
I won't get any thanks from the Commonwealth Press Union
"News Media Freedom Committee, because we're all aware that the Committee, which acts on behalf of newspapers, radio, TV, magazines, has been campaigning for a relaxation of the suicide reporting rules."
"And people like me are expected to sort of fall into line with that, because it does seem on the surface to be a reasonable case for an extension of freedom of expression."
"But I break the rules, partly for the reason given above, and I'll explain the other reasons."
But I'd first like to look at what led to this stand-off between the Ministry of Health and the news media industry.
"It's obviously a lot more relaxed today because of the work that people like SPlNZ are doing, but there is a stand-off situation there, believe me."
"Prior to 1998, the matter of suicide coverage by the media was settled and little debated within the industry, as far as I'm aware."
"The informal, self-regulating benchmark was set in the late '70s by a couple of Press Council decisions against, oddly enough, Sunday News."
The Council upheld complaints about the paper's lurid suicide stories.
"To the best of my knowledge and experience, these became the convention for any subsequent coverage by any kind of media, and we've used them ever since in journalism school when we teach this to students."
"Basically, it's report the name and that death was self-inflicted and nothing more, if you're allowed to do that by your local coroner."
"What happened in '98 was, unfortunately, typical of the way some government bureaucrats regard the news media."
"My wife is one, and I know this personally."
She regards me with great suspicion.
The Ministry of Health issued a report which set out the way journalists should thenceforth report suicide.
"Its mistake, unfortunately, was not consulting the news media itself, which is tantamount to standing on a melting ice floe and poking a starving polar bear with a small stick."
"At that time, the Newspaper Publishers' Association"
"Chief Executive, Phil O'Reilly, he's the man who now pops up for Business New Zealand ubiquitously, a man, I will tell you, who's not far short of a polar bear in stature, and probably equal in terms of reaction time."
"He headed up what could only really be called a retaliatory campaign that not only attacked the Ministry for its discourtesy, but set about refuting its case for tighter media controls, which is what they were seen as."
"And now it has this cash, and then it could use this cash to invest in essentially the Legacy Loans Program, the public-private investor Legacy Loans Program that Geithner talks about."
"And if they did this, they could take this-- let's say this was $7."
"They could take this $7, contribute it to the equity in the program."
The Treasury would contribute another $7.
"The Fed would contribute $84, and then they would have $100, and I know this is kind of messy, but they would have $100 that they can then use to go buy these assets."
"And the net effect of this is that this bank went from having 100% exposure to this toxic asset to having only $7 exposure through this loan to this hedge fund, or this special-purpose entity, or whatever you want to call it."
"And I got a couple of emails, even from some colleagues, to say, well, can this really be done?"
"And my kind of knee-jerk reaction was, well, if this can't be done, they'll figure out a way to do it, because there's billions of dollars at stake, and really, the incentive here is structured to do it."
"And frankly, the Government probably wants them to do it, because on some level, even though this would be a massive transfer of exposure and wealth from the taxpayers to the banks, it would on some level solve the problem."
"And if people really aren't aware of it, everyone will be happy about it, because all of these banks, Citibank and Bank of America, will just survive, and they can just kind of say that all's well."
"So what I wanted to do, just to answer those questions, is get a little bit particular about the wording."
And I got an email.
"Leigh Logan actually emailed me, and she highlighted one clause in the Legacy Loans term sheet that seems to address what I talk about in that second video there."
And this is from the Legacy Loans terms sheet.
It says:
"""Private investors may not participate in any"
"PPlF""-- so this is that Private-Public Investment"
"Fund-- ""that purchases assets from sellers that are affiliates of such investors or that represent 10% or more of the aggregate private capital in the PPlF."""
So the question is what's an affiliate?
"And I looked it up in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and there are multiple definitions."
But this is probably the best one.
It says:
"""The term affiliate means any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company."" And that's an area that I just outlined."
"This bank really doesn't control this hedge fund, right?"
"They just essentially gave them a loan with very little stipulations on it, and then the hedge fund can go do it."
"But, you could say, oh, well, you know, there's nothing that this bank could do to force this hedge fund to buy these assets, so maybe this plan won't work."
And another thing is what's the definition of the private capital?
You also can't represent 10% more of the aggregate private capital.
"Frankly, when I think of private capital, I think more in terms of equity investments, but maybe the definition of private capital also includes debt investments, although, I doubt it."
"So in this video I want to lay out a scenario that, essentially, it can do the same thing economically, and in fact, the exact behavior that they want in other parties without being in any way an affiliate of the counterparty and in no way giving capital directly to them."
So what Bank A could do instead-- let me redraw it.
"Actually, not Bank A."
"So ""this too will pass""."
"The other part of that story, which is very valuable to consider, is that that emperor wore that ring not just in difficult times but also in the happy times as well."
"Because it's in the prosperous, happy, good times that we should always remember, ""this too will pass""."
"Because he knew that the happy prosperous times were also fragile, he had a few celebrations but not many, because he knew he had to work hard to make sure those prosperous happy good times lasted as long as they possibly can."
And they did.
He became a very successful and well-loved emperor because the bad times were very short and the happy long times were longer than anybody could ever remember.
And of course you know who that emperor really is - it's you.
"And your empire is your life, your body, your family, your environment."
"When we have these negative emotions what we're actually saying, we're sulking, we're forgetting, ""this too will pass""."
"But also when you have the positive emotions, when you have happiness and joy and inspiration, please never take them for granted."
"They also need to be guarded, and cherished and nurtured, otherwise they go too quickly."
"So when we have our positive emotions, when things are going well, be careful, don't get heedless and think ""Oh my life is going well now, I'm healthy therefore I don't need to exercise anymore, I have a wonderful relationship now so I don't need to put effort into caring for my partner, I have a wonderful Buddhist Society now, so I don't need to put donations in the donations box anymore [laughter]""."
"You've got to keep caring, otherwise the whole thing sort-of falls apart!"
"""I'm happy, therefore"
"I don't need to put effort into my happiness anymore."" Be careful there because all these positive emotions, they're fragile, you know where they're caused from."
"If you have the happy emotions well done, if you feel well, you're happy, you have these beautiful inspirations of kindness and generosity, now how does that feel?"
The positive emotions are great.
They need to be cultivated.
Where do they come from?
"Just like the negative emotions, when you're happy, where does it come from?"
"You can actually see the positive thoughts get more and more and more, like in the movies, when they have a romance."
"In a romance movie, it's years seen I've seen these movies, but I'm sure they haven't changed, they don't fall in love at the very beginning and get married."
That happens at the very end of the movie.
It all builds up to this.
So the whole movie is building up to the suggestion that these two people are going to meet and be happy and all their problems are going to be solved.
"And that thought is been on your mind again and again and again for about an hour, an hour and a half, so when they do meet, ""oh at last they've met!"", you get emotional, you start crying, ""oh isn't it wonderful"", because that emotion has been built over the whole course of the movie."
"And once you understand where these positive emotions come from, you can actually start building them up inside of you."
"One of the things which I teach my monks, teach nuns, teach yourself as well - negative emotions they come basically from what we call the fault-finding mind."
"You always see what's wrong in other people, you see what's wrong in yourself, what's wrong in the monks, what's wrong in the Buddhist Society, what's wrong in the government, what's wrong in the whole world!"
And that gives a lot of negative emotions.
Why don't we look at the other side
"- not the fault-finding mind, but what we call the gratitude mind."
"I assure you if you wait long enough, eventually it will tell you that the recursion effectively overflowed."
So it is trying to compute this unbounded number of routes in the recursive part of the with statement and never even gets to the query that we want to execute.
"OK, here's my first attempt at fixing the problem."
We know that we're never going to want to take a arbitrarily long route.
We're never going to want to go around a cycle lots of times as our cheapest way to get from point A to point
"B so what I've done here, and I'm not going to go into this in great detail, but I have added a condition in the recursion that says ""I'm only going to add a new route, a new route into my recursively defined route table when the total cost of that route, and that's defined as the cost plus total here when we added, is less then all of the ways we can already get from that place, to that origin to that destination."
"So in other words, I'm only going to add cheaper routes than the ones that are already there."
"And by the way, if there are no routes already from the origin to the destination then this will be satisfied and we will add that first route, then after that only adding cheaper ones."
So let's try running this query and see what happens.
"Well, we got an error."
Now this is not a runtime execution error.
This is actually an error that says we're not allowed to refer to our recursively defined relation in a sub query within our recursion.
"The SQL standard actually might allow this particular use, but"
I don't know that any implementation actually handles it.
It can be fairly difficult to handle a case where you have the recursively defined relation in a subquery as well as in the outer query here.
So that's obviously not going to solve our problem.
Now there's actually a feature of
Basic SQL that can help us here with our problem.
There's something called Limit.
"We actually didn't discuss this in the SQL videos, but that says just give us this number of results."
"So let's say that we're going to have our recursion here for the roots, but down here we're going to say I only need up to 20 results for how"
I get from point A to point B. And the posary system actually makes use of the limit command in the final query to restrict the recursion.
"It's a nice feature, and it was added specifically for this problem of possibly infinite recursions where we actually don't want it to be infinite because we only need a finite number of answers."
"Okay, so, let's go with that here and we'll see that Ah, great."
Everything worked well.
"We got our roots from A to B. And I do have 20 roots, I mean, so they're getting very expensive."
Down here I'm going to go around and around the mid west while lots and lots of times but that did the limit the recursion it did stop unlike our query where we didn't have the limit and it just went on indefinitely.
"So that looks pretty good, with one unfortunate problem, which is if we still want the minimum, we're going to again get a infinite execution."
"So the old result is still sitting here but now the system is chunking on because the limit here is applied to this min to the number of tupimit the recursion, we're always going to get only one tuple in our result."
"So even if we said limit one here, we'd still get the infinite behavior, so we haven't quite solved our problem."
"Okay, so, here's what we're going to do."
"Aesthetically, maybe it's not the absolutely best solution but"
"Now clean on clean, we place our second pair of gloves."
"One side-note though, just from experience, is the more sweaty your hands get, the harder it is to put on secondary pairs of gloves, so if you're purchasing gloves, a light powdered glove is not a bad idea, or a powder free that's just a good quality glove."
"Now we can take our disinfecting solution, spray down the contaminate."
"Be careful not to spray it hard, because if you do, it can glance off and shoot the contaminates off the surface that you're working on, and now we've got another cross-contamination issue, and we're gonna continue to have to clean up."
Make sure that you spray in a circumference enough that you're really decontaminating the greater part of this surface.
"Now we're gonna take another disposable wipe, and now we're going to clean the second phase, and get the rest of the existing contaminate off the surface."
And we're going to dispose of that in a bio-haz bag.
"Again, keeping dirty-dirty and clean-clean, we're gonna dispose of those in the bio-haz bag, and this should be our last time that we actually have to put on gloves, even though they're clean, and ideally the disinfecting bottle is clean, we really want to break this chain of infection through putting a personal protective equipment piece between us and the potential pathogen."
Now we're going to mist-spray a saturation of the disinfecting solution.
"If it is made out of bleach solution, be careful it doesn't get on other products that have color, it will bleach those products."
"Maybe it's a carpet, or other things."
"And now we're going to put this stuff away properly, but we're going to let this wet surface literally dry on its' own, which is the prescribed amount of time for the chemical to be in contact with the hazard, or potential hazard, the bio-hazard, in order for it to completely have its' kill time."
Hey!
"Welcome back to 20 Minutes Or Less, my name is Elliot Morgan,"
I'm Trisha Hershberger.
So 17 year old Savannah Dietrich was sexually assaulted in 2011 by 2 boys after she passed out from drinking at a party.
Months after the party she learned that those 2 boys had taken pictures and shared them with people.
Then news of the assault spread around her Louisville high school.
Last month the boys who attacked her struck a plea deal.
They plead guilty and were charged with felony sexual abuse and misdemeanor voyeurism.
"Dietrich felt this was not an appropriate punishment and that it amounted to a ""slap on the wrist""."
"Then the court added an order for the victim herself: don't talk about it, or go to freakin' jail."
Because nothing sends a better message to victims of sexual assault than telling them not to talk about it.
"When Savannah heard this, she cried, logged onto Twitter and tweeted:"
"""There you go, lock me up."""
"And then proceeded to give the names of the little worthless pieces of trash, and then finished the tweet up with:"
"""I'm not protecting anyone that made my life a living hell."""
She immediately violated the stipulation that she not say anything.
The attacker's attorneys then asked a Jefferson District court judge to hold Dietrich in contempt for lashing out on Twitter.
She could face up to 100 days in jail and a $500 fine if convicted.
So to summarize: the boys who violated this girl got to have it both ways.
"They were able to make what they did public to whoever they wanted to know, and then they were able to tell a court to keep it quiet."
I want to say 1 more positive thing about the core.
"And to do that, I'm going to illustrate, another coalitional game example."
So this is called the airport game.
"In this example, there are several different cities in the same geographical area that need access to airports and the different cities are different sizes and so they need to be able to accommodate different sized airplanes."
They have to decide between each building their own airport or building a regional Airport and sharing the cost of building the regional airport amongst all the cities.
If they build the regional airport it's cost is going to depend on the largest plane that has to be accomondated.
"So, whichever city in the coalition that builds a regional airport Needs the biggest aircraft is going to set the size of the airport for everybody."
"Otherwise, everyone just builds their own airport."
"So we'll model this as a coalitional game as follows, and, as of course, the set of cities And the value of each coalition is ba sically the amount of work that was avoided as compared to having all of the airports built individually for each city."
"So, more specifically, the value of a coalition is the sum of the cost of building runways for every city in S Minus the cost of the biggest runway which is the one that actually has to be built for the regional airport."
"Well I'll define a convex game as follows, a game is convex If, for all, coalitions that are strict subsets of n, the value of the union of those subsets, of those two different coalitions, is at"
least as big As the value that the first can achieve by itself plus the amount the second could achieve by itself minus the amount that the coalition in common between these two can achieve for itself.
"So notice that we, we already talked about superadditivity. this is a stronger assumption because superadditivity assumed that s and t had an empty intersection."
"Whereas here we're allowing them to have an intersection and we're, we're just subtracting the value of its intersection."
"So, so this speaks about also cases in which s and t."
Do have 1 or more agents in common.
"Nevertheless, convex games are, are relatively common and the Airport games is an example of a convex game."
So the reason I mentioned convex games is to say some nice things about the core.
"And here are, are 2 kind of positive theorems about the core."
"First of all, in the case of convex games, the core always is nonempty."
"So, there's always at least some way of dividing payments between all of the agents to support the grand coalition and in a way where no subset of the agents would be willing to deviate in order to, to benefit themselves Secondly, even better, the Shopley value is in the core for convex games and so that means that for these particular games, dividing the value of the grand coalitoin in a way that is stable and dividing the value of the grand coalition in a way that is fair are not goals that are at odds with each other."
"So in these games, it's possible to do both."
"Hey guys, this is Heather from healthyveganrecipes.net."
"Today, I'm going to share my garlic herb sauce recipe."
I'm coming to you from our new kitchen in Ottawa.
Phil and I have moved to Canada's capital.
I grew in a suburb just outside of the city called Kanaka and its been exciting for me to start getting to know downtown a little bit.
"I didn't get out here very often, so we are right downtown and right near the - we're having lot of fun."
"This is my kitchen, a little bit smaller than what I had in Victoria but it works."
What
"I'm going to show you today is this garlic herb sauce recipe - a bean sauce, which"
I haven't done in a while and it's one of my favorite things to make.
"If we train our system and try to improve our linguistic model based on that, we're going to get something better."
Then we can basically do the same thing with the language model using a weakened acoustic model and then improve our language models.
The result is that we end up with a better system hopefully that become a gold standard and we can iterate from there.
"So, the message there is that there are ways to do iterative development without having human support."
"Unsupervised learning is not new, and has been done for a very long time, having a completely into a pipeline where you can do training, evaluation, tuning, entirely unsupervised without involving any human."
At least in speech-recognition that's very new and very exciting.
That's really the kind of thing that we are excited about because it really enables us to scale- models of scaling that we were not able to reach before.
"And so, while we're not yet at super-human performance"
"It's possible that, by removing that ceiling of human performance, maybe that will enable us to get to that faster, that ascent towards the actual human performance that we see."
So that was my bit of wisdom that we've been working on recently and. . . it's been a very exciting development for us and there's a little bit more in the paper that I quoted in the previous slide.
"Now, the next choice we have in agent design revolves around how adventurous he wants to be."
"One possibility is what's called the passive reinforcement learning agent-- and that can be any of these agent designs, but what passive means is that the agent has a fixed policy and executes that policy."
"But it learns about the reward function, R, and maybe the transition function, P, if it didn't already know that."
It learns that while executing the fixed policy.
So let me give you an example.
Imagine that you're on a ship in uncharted waters and the captain has a policy for piloting the ship.
You can't change the captain's policy.
"He or she is going to execute that, no matter what."
But it's your job to learn all you can about the uncharted waters.
"In other words, learn the reward function, given the actions and the state transitions that the ship is going through."
"You learn, and remember what you've learned, but that doesn't change the captain's policy-- and that's passive learning."
"Now, the alternative is called active reinforcement learning-- and that's where we change the policy as we go."
"So let's say, eventually, you've done such a great job of learning about the uncharted water that the captain says to you,"
"""Okay--I'm going to hand over control and as you learn, I'm going to allow you to change the policy for this ship."
"You can make decisions of where we're going to go next."""
"And that's good, because you can start to cash in early on your learning and it's also good because it gives you a possibility to explore."
Rather than just say:
What's the best action I can do right now?-- you can say:
What's the action that might allow me to learn something-- to allow me to do better in the future?
"how good you brought the kids of course, I didn't have heart to leave them because my family is the most important thing I have and in a year, when we come back I want us to still be together"
Yes!
"Today ouch oh where's your dad, something's happened to him! stop worrying mum, he's only been gone half an hour yes but in half an hour there's loads of things that could have happened to him what if he's been eaten by a beast or if he's fallen over a ranco or.. or what if a plant's got him -oh mum, there aren't any plants or ranchas on this island a man-eating plant or or maybe some cannibals go to him ye, those massive black ones ye, ye, one of those massive black strong muscular ones with their massive grabbing you and feeling you and... take me! leave him and take me!"
"You must have a much higher goals than simply ""for profit""."
"A failed Ministry is a Ministry that exists just for the pastor, his ego, his vainglory, that can also seem blessed, popular, well-known, but if does not serve God ..."
"If one day you do not odranno the words ""well done, faithful servant"" then you realize that his entire life was a failure."
"If you have a pastor, mask and pretend to walk with God, an empty religiosity and bereft of intimacy with God, although you can succeed to darla to drink that God is with you when in reality God is far from what he wants from you ..."
"Failure is just that: no fear of the Lord, having attracted rather by success."
"The Ministry failed, therefore, is what happens outside the standards of God's Word, and although it may seem ""blessed"":"
"Because the Church is full, many people follow the Shepherd, it becomes economically ..."
"God knows our hearts, and he knows what motivates people"
"Therefore, although the world is to be a success, for God is a failure!"
"Paul says in 1Corinthians, cap 2 that on judgment day, God's fire ministries will progress, and what was built with second-rate material, like wood, hay and"
"Straw, will be consumed by God's judgment."
You are referring to the leaders who will be judged by God and set out the substantiating hearts.
There will be many surprises that day.
"Sometimes the opposite happens: a faithful person, but his Church is not large, neither popular nor famous, in fact if the leader is faithful to the Lord, the worst can happen, as persecution, hatred, the beatings ..."
"For this reason we cannot judge whether the Ministry is blessed or not through external results, but we have to await judgment day"
When God will reveal what lurks in the hearts of everyone.
A failed Ministry is a Ministry indicating the Church to follow a conceited man who does not align to the Biblical parameters.
"Therefore, a person can also be very popular, reaching up to television, but if the Ministry is centered in one person and in his thoughts and desires, has failed."
"Everything that is not aligned with the word of God, humbly before Christ, is a failure and this will be revealed sooner or later."
"When the pastor is attracted by other interests, and not by mere proclamation of the word of God."
"When the focus of the Ministry is anything other than this, when a Conference despite deploying several books, he idolizes the preacher ..."
"When presiding over a very charismatic, who knows how to stir audiences but has a goal dismissed from Gospel,"
This Ministry has failed.
"It can be whatever you want, but not a home."
"Despite many times people who do these things are genuine, are genuinely deceived, and if they fail to understand what really makes a home blessed, as fidelity then everything they do will be failed."
The Ministry failed is that Minister who thinks only for himself.
"His mind is occupied by profit from money, in promoting its glory!"
"When its priority is to first floor, appearing as much as possible in the radio, tv, is a failed."
"GAP missions (Group of adoration of the father) began with a meeting, where the servants of God, decided to share their faith to build other people through the testimony."
"With the passage of time, many lives were built, and the Ministry was born."
"I could divide our history into two parts the first was that of his birth, and the second that it is this that we are experiencing is the discovery and confirmation of vocation from God."
To heal lives and ...
"Or do they fundamentally involve to have storage, revocation, identity, and all the other aspects that traditional email systems have?"
"Or, do email systems themselves broaden what they do to take on some of that characteristic?"
I think the innovation is great.
"In Google's case, we have a very successful instant messaging product."
And that's what most people end up using.
"And having said that I think it's wonderful, Twitter's success is wonderful, and I think it shows you that there are many, many new ways to reach and communicate, especially if you are willing to do so publicly. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;MARY:"

Yep?
"We're moving to the fourth row, third row. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:"
"Another big picture question, if you don't mind."
"You said the economy is dire, and that you don't see a sign of a current bottom."
"But, as you look around the world, do you see many regional differences in how badly areas are affected, and then in general, just as a world-wide view, how do you feel about broadband penetration rates, especially in Latin America, but elsewhere around the world, and whether the economic slowdown is going to dampen that move toward broadband penetration in other countries aside from the U.S.? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
What's interesting is Latin America is doing so well.
I was joking with my friend who lives in Mexico that maybe Mexico should bail out the United States.
The fact of the matter is that Latin American economies are now in a position of having higher growth than many of the other countries world-wide.
"I don't think we see anything different than what's been publicly reported, which goes something like this."
"The United States, because of our economic structure, is likely to both have a quicker descent and a quicker recovery than Europe."
"That Europe is offset by some number of quarters, and we believe that all of that is true, based on the data that we've seen."
"We also believe that India and China are being affected, but to a lesser degree, for all the reasons that have been said publicly."
"What we don't know is, what does this do to the long term capital structure of these economies?"
"I don't think anybody knows, when all of the government stimulus is done, and remember that the government stimulus in crisis here is not as bad as, for example, as what we're seeing in Britain or, for heavens sakes, Iceland."
"We don't really know what the extent of that will be in terms of both the nationalization questions of the institutions of those industries, and consumer confidence in savings rate."
"There's sort of negative examples if you look at Japan, which is, after 13 years of recession, Japan went from essentially a culture that was at least interested in brands and at least interested in real consumer behavior as defined by America, to a country that was sufficiently traumatized that they are now very, very heavy net savers, because their economic structure and labor markets also changed to also favor much more at risk employment."
Those are big changes if you're Japanese.
And I don't think anybody knows to what degree that will affect the United States.
"My personal view, and I've said this very strongly, is that Americans love their credit cards."
"And that if you think about what we have to do in our country, we basically have to solve the credit problem, we have to get the job situation at least stable so people are not afraid of losing their jobs, and we have to do something about the housing crisis."
All of those issues are being worked on now.
"When those things are done, it's a reasonable bet that Americans will go back to what we do best, which is to spend money."
[laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"Just one non-Google question, Eric."
"It communicates perfectly, don't even think about going in me backwards."
I will hurt you and mess you up.
So Alex started out talking about users and how we can't blame users because it's not the stupid users.
"I'm going to argue that users, in fact, are very smart."
It's actually a hard problem to design a system that people can't figure out.
"Even think about things like cryptography, or DRM, or even code obfuscation, where it's difficult to create something that people can't reverse engineer."
"So if this is also true of Uls, then why are we here talking about making things easier?"
The reality is that people just don't care that much.
"If they care enough, they can figure things out."
"But in reality, they have a lot of things competing for their attention, whether it's all of the other apps in the"
"App store, all of the other sites that are going on, all the TV shows, they're watching Game of Thrones, The"
"Bachelorette, both, and comparing, I don't know."
"So if something is really easy to use and people don't care, then it doesn't matter."
"So my argument is, if we do things to help people to care more, move over to the right, then even things that are very difficult, like learning how to drive a car, people are going to do it."
"Things that are really difficult like riding a unicycle, and I know that some people care a lot about this, but in my case, I haven't cared enough to learn how to use it yet, or something that's both easy and care a"
"lot about, like eating a sandwich, that's going to happen all the time."
"So the tricky part about this is that a good portion of these decisions that we make as what we're going to care about, what we don't care about, actually happen a lot below the conscious level, and this plays out in the kind of research that we do."
"It's actually pretty hard to find out what people care about, and if you ask them questions like, why do you"
"like that, or even, what do you like, people are really bad at giving answers."
You get kind of garbage data back because we're not very good at even introspecting and knowing these things.
"So as designers, our job is to understand this and help people to make choices."
"Now, there's a lot that happens in this process from when something hits our eyeballs for the small percentage that it reaches the top of our brains."
"So you may have had this experience in elementary school where the teacher told you that the eyes are not, in fact, at the top of the head, that the eyes are in the center of the head, and there's probably people in your class that argued."
"Or in my case, I remember being the artist in the class, thinking that my eyes had betrayed me, or how could I have not seen this?"
"It's so clear, once you get the ruler out."
"And as it works out, there's a special unit of processing in our brain for facial recognition, and this is speculation on my part, but I think it's probably less important, the information from the eyebrows to the top of the head, and so our brain just kind of squishes it, and what we think we're seeing isn't really what we're seeing."
This idea that design and these ideas of perception happen below consciousness aren't new.
"In fact, there are many people that have made this made this point that sometimes the best design is invisible design."
"A very famous essay on typography-- famous for those of us who are really into typography, so famous for a small subset-- where Beatrice Warde makes the case that good typography should be like a crystal goblet."
"It's transparent, that you can't see it."
"You see the content inside, but the glass is doing its job best when it's almost not there."
So a bunch of psychologists at the beginning of the last century--
But needing to have those experiences to reflect on.
"And again asking it in a genuine way not just like we're trying to motivate you so we want to ask you, but its like as someone creating this learning space, I'm interested to know what you thought and in that process it gets them thinking."
Mitch:
"Another set of questions here that I thought were interesting, its already come up in the discussion that its not one size fits all, that motivation is complex."
It varies from one part of the trajectory to another whether you're a beginner or expert as Avi mentioned.
But also it could vary by personality style or learning style.
Like here's a specific question about motivating introverts versus extroverts and strategies for facilitating a diverse group where different people seem to thrive on different approaches.
So how does one deal with the diversity?
When you work with a group of people and different people might respond in different ways.
What are ways of facilitating?
Avi:
"So it goes back to that idea of having environments that are supportive, you want actually to challenge people to engage in an activity that they may not feel completely comfortable engaging it start with but then you do it in a safe environment, then reflect on it, how did you feel, what did you learn about yourself in doing this."
How would you motivate yourself in the future if you find yourself in such a situation?
"The principles of belonging and sense of safety and the fact that your voice is heard and is taken into consideration, I think is our principles for promoting motivation among a diverse group of people with the addition of choice."
Like what
"Natalie said about the dimension of authority in the target, providing variety of ways by which people can perform the task and people will find it more comfortable to do this, or to do that based on their personal tendencies."
Mitch:
"Actually any experiences either from Scratch online community or from local things like Clubhouses, experiences where clearly there always are diverse backgrounds, interests, styles about ways of managing that."
Natalie:
"I do think that there are different roles, I do think like sometimes the presentation at the end, some people really want to show their stuff."
"But then also like smaller along the way you notice something, someone who might not want to speak out showing what they've been doing."
And actually online people were talking about having times where people get to work on their own who are more introverted but then having sharing times.
So i do think it is some kind of a balance.
"Like in the Scratch online community, we have multiple interests that we are supporting and there are ways of getting recognition."
"And we've just been asking, and I've posted, why do you use Scratch, we're trying to get at some of the motivations and its really interesting because some of the examples so far, young people are saying like I want to work with my friends and I like collaborating and I want my name to be known and I strive to do the best possible thing."
And its an interesting mix of learning and performance principles all in the same thing.
So I think having a variety of ways that people can get recognition and be sharing and taking on different types of roles too that you've been working on seems like one way to do it.
Which again in certain environments is easier than others.
Mitch:
Its probably something we need to think about especially in online spaces.
I think in physical spaces we have a lot more experience of how to allow different ways for people to play different roles.
"And I think in some online spaces, the way to get, theres a certain way that people are seeking visibility."
"Well we can actually, by looking the Amazon rainforest, we can get a pretty clear idea of what was going on in the periphery of the Mediterranean."
"So the transpiration from the trees, in the Amazon, is taking a huge amount of water out of the soil and putting it up into the atmosphere every day."
"So wherever you are in the Amazon Basin, usually by noon or about 2:00 in the afternoon, you've got a cloud sitting over your head, and that's the water that came out of the ground that day."
"And there's also moisture, of course, that's coming in from the Atlantic, and it's blown west, up towards the Andes, in the clouds."
"And because of this transpiration, if you look at a molecule of water that's coming in off the"
"South Atlantic, by the time it hits the Andes it's gone in and out four times; it's rained four times by the time it gets to the Andes."
So having the forest there is making very efficient use of that water.
It is a positive feedback loop whereby the presence of the forest is maintaining the presence of the forest.
"And if you cut down the forest, the rainfall will decrease and the total plant growth will diminish, and that will accelerate the conversion of forest into savanna."
So this is an extreme case of that process.
In the Amazon there's enough stuff coming in off of the South
"Atlantic, and it's at--remember if you"
"look at your Hadley cells, it's in a region of the world near the equator where you have warm moist air rising."
"So you're going to have planetary forces generating rainfall, whether there are trees there or not, but you move just 30 degrees north, to the Mediterranean, and you don't have that."
"Here, at the Mediterranean, you have got, in your Hadley cell circulation, you have got cold, dry air falling, and you don't get the planetary forces regenerating and replenishing the rainfall and the forests that had been there had been an important local source of transpiration into the atmosphere."
"So at the equator this is what you get, and boy is this stuff efficient at getting water up into the atmosphere."
One that a lot of you have read a lot about I know is atmospheric carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses and global warming.
"And it is the immediate source of carbon for terrestrial organisms, but it's really only a tiny part of the global carbon cycle."
"So if we look at the carbon cycle, and we look at storage in gigatons of carbon-- the storage here is in black and the flux in gigatons of carbon is in purple."
So there's about 750 gigatons of carbon in the atmosphere.
In the surface of the ocean there's about 1000 gigatons.
"In the deep ocean there's 38,000 gigatons of carbon, and so forth."
Okay?
"So vegetation has got a bit less; all the vegetation of the globe has got a bit less carbon in it than there is in the atmosphere, and only about 1/50^(th) as much as there is in the deep ocean."
And there is carbon which is moving between all these compartments.
"The fossil fuel and cement production of the world has got about 4000 gigatons stored, and it's putting about 5 gigatons per year into the atmosphere."
"So if we look at that flux, overall there's a big exchange between the oceans and the atmosphere."
There's a pretty big impact of photosynthesis.
Plant respiration is putting just about everything back into the atmosphere that it's taking out.
So this is pretty much a wash right here.
The increment from fossil fuel and land use looks pretty small compared to the overall process.
"But the critical thing is whether or not at equilibrium you're just pushing that equilibrium a little bit, because these are rates, and rates accumulate."
The most important thing that you have to remember when holding a baby especially a newborn is to cradle them holding their head and neck up to make sure that the head does not fall too back or too forward.
"There are few different holds that people prefer when holding a baby you can hold the baby chest to chest, you can hold the baby stomach to stomach on an angel, you can cradle the baby, you can hold the baby in what's call the football hold where you put your hand underneath their chin flip over the baby and pull them out stretch this way sometimes when people are walking around and need another free hand this may be helpful."
Some parents have the head lean back against the baby and hold them this way where they put their hands supporting underneath between their legs and hold them this way really as long as the baby is comfortable and you are comfortable and its safe it is important for you to do what ever is the most comfortable so you can do it often.
There is nothing that prompts bonding as much as holding and being close to your infant.
"A lot of parents when their arms get tired like to even put the baby in their lap so you can look right into their eyes this was my most favorite hold with my three daughters because they can grow up and fit right here as they grow and you can look into their eyes you can talk to them, you can hold their hands, you can play with their feet its a wonderful way to be close to the baby and but also see your baby because sometimes in certain holds like this one its hard to really see their whole face."
"So remember keep their head up and try to hold your baby as much as possible its really crucial for bonding during those first couple months that the baby feel very safe, very secure, and very much attach to mom or day."

JON GRUBER:
"At the beginning of the lecture, we're going to actually talk about productivity, one of the most important topics in economics."
"And really one of the most famous applications-- or, more generally, misapplications-- of the principles of diminishing marginal product in the history of economics."
Many of you may have heard of a guy named Thomas Malthus.
"He was a famous philosopher who, in 1798, posited the theory that we're all in big trouble."
And he did so following the basic tenets that I've taught you so far.
"Malthus pointed out look, we've got-- he said, think about production of food."
"He said, with the production of food you've got, as with any other production process-- he didn't put it in these terms, but basically he was appealing to what we"
learned last time.
"He said, like any other production process you've got two inputs, labor and capital."
"But with food, the capital is land."
"And unlike other kinds of capital, it's fixed even in the long-run."
"That is, we talked about the long-run being defined as the period of time over which all inputs are variable."
"Well, land is never variable."
"There's a certain amount of land on earth, that's not variable."
"And at the end of the day, production of food is essentially just short-run, there is no long-run."
"At the end of the day, production of food, capital's fixed, it's only labor."
"Moreover, in that situation labor has diminishing marginal product with a given amount of land."
"It doesn't matter how many workers you have, there's only so much you can grow on it."
"Obviously, as you increase workers you can grow more originally."
"But eventually, you'll run out of useful use for those workers, yet the demand for food will not stop growing."
"So insert A, B, C, D, E, F, G."
"And so, the operation of inserting a new character into this form of the buffer is pushing something on the before stack."
"So if I want to move the cursor, let's say I want to move it back one, then I pop the top off of the before push it on the after."
"I keep doing that and it transfers the G to the H, you know, the E and so on, as I back up."
Moving forward does that same operation in the inverse.
If I want to move forward I take something off the top of the after and push it on before.
So it's kind of shuffling it from one side to the other.
"Given that these push and pop operations are constant on both implementations of the stack we saw, then that means that our cursor movement is also of one so I can do this."
And if I do deletes it's actually just popping from the after stack and throwing it away.
"So also easy to do edits because I'm talking about adding things to the before and deleting things from after, both of which can be done very efficiently."
The one operation that this guy has trouble with is big cursor movement.
"If I want to go all the way to the beginning or all the way to the end, then everything's got to go."
"No matter how many things I have to empty out the entire after stack to position the cursor at the end, or empty out the entire before stack to get it all the way over here."
"So I could of sort of talk you though this code, and actually, I won't type it just because I actually want to talk about its analysis more than I want to see its code."
Each of these actually becomes a one liner.
Insert is push on the before stack.
Delete is pop from the after stack.
"The cursor movement is popping from one and pushing on the other depending on the direction and then that same code just for the Y loop, like wild or something on the one stack, just keep pushing and popping from one empty to the other."
"So very little code to write, right, depending a lot on the stacks abstractions coming through for us and then making this ultra fit that we've managed to get editing suddenly,"
"like, a lot more efficient but the cost of sacrificing one of our other operations."
Let's take a look at what that
"look like, right."
"Suddenly I can do all this insert and delete at the insertion point with very little trouble, and I suddenly made this other operation, oddly enough, slow."
"All a sudden it's like if you go back to the beginning of your document you're in the middle of editing, you're at the bottom."
"You say, oh, I want to go back to the beginning and you can imagine how that would feel if you were typing it would actually be the act of going up and clicking up in the top right by where you made the insertion and all a sudden you'd see the white cursor and you'd be like, why is that taking so long."
"How could that possibly be, you know, that it's doing this kind of rearrangement, but yet it made editing even on a million character document fast."
But that movement
"long distances, you know, jumping a couple of pages or front to back, suddenly, having to do this big transfer behind the scenes, so different, right."
"So now I had six operations, I had four fast, two slow, now I have four fast, two slow."
"It still might be that, actually, this is an interesting improvement, though, because we have decided those are operations that we're willing to tolerate, being slower, especially, if it means some operation that we're more interested in, if performance being faster."
"And that likely seems like it's moving in the right direction because editing, right, being the whole purpose, right, behind what we're trying to do is a text setter, that seems like that might be a good call."
"What I'm going to start looking at and it's going to be something I want to talk about next time, is what can a link list do for us?"
You know it's very worrisome if you disconnect for a while and think 'oh my friends are saying something and I don't hear it or there's new information about something I'm interested in'
"So I think the net, just as in someways I suppose the abundance of calories, and cheap calories encourages overeating, I think our natural instinct to overvalue the new, is fed by the technology."
"And, unfortunately, the expense of overvaluing the new, is sometimes we don't spend enough time looking at what's really important."
"If you have a new piece of information, but you know something new and trivial is coming, you often shift your eyes, shift your glance to consume the new stuff."
PETER NORVlG:
"Yeah I don't know if it's the net that contributes to that,"
I know it certainly makes the new available.
"I think its a pervasive problems in humans and not just humans, but in all mammals, that they value the short term over the long term."
"And Georgia Ansley in the Great Down of Will, says that the roots of addiction is that people say 'yes I see the benefit of taking this alcohol or drugs right now, and I can kind of discount the long term negative effects' and you need to be able to have some discipline to get past that and say 'I'm going to think about the long term, in a rational way and not just go for the short term effects.'"
And so we need those kinds of societal rules.
We need the parents saying 'you can only watch TV or you can only use video games or whatever for so much time.' We need the teachers saying 'you're not allowed to do this in the bathroom'.
"And even for adults, the need their ways to limit their own usage and make good use of technology."
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"Unfortunately, we're going in the other direction, however."
We're giving ever younger kids cell phones with unlimited texting plans.
We are putting TV's and computers in their rooms and we are not supervising them.
"I mean anything we can do to counter those trends I'm all for, but we still have to pay attention to what's really going on, and the fact that it's becoming more and more socially accepted to be distracted all the time."
To talk to your spouse while glancing at your stream of email on your iPhone or something.
"I mean these things, to do it at a restaurant, I mean these things are becoming accepted in society."
"We seem, we're not imposing that kind of discipline and you know, maybe we will, but I don't see any signs that that's happening."
It seems to be going in the other direction.
PETER NORVlG:
"Again, it seems like every generation has its complaints about that., that we're all going to hell in a hand-basket , and we have been for every generation."
Let's see.
"I wanted to, I guess in a few minutes, we are going to do the question and answer."
"We talked about the information overload, we talked about the sort of addiction and irrational behavior and so on, and we talked about reading and deep reading."
"I guess one thing I wanted to say about that is, it seems like sometimes you're trying to have it two ways, that you're saying the experience you're really aiming for is this deep reading where we're contemplative and reflective and engaging in a deep way, but you're complaining about the web technology saying that it's changing our brains."
"And it seems to me that it can only change our brains, if it's engaging us deeply."
Is that a contradiction?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"It is kind of a contradiction, but I think there's, as I write in the book that one of the, probably one of the most profound characteristic of the net is that it seizes our attention only to shatter it."
"So, we become, we are immersed in the medium itself, very deeply immersed, but what we are immersed in is constant distractions and constant shifts of our attention and shifts of our focus"
So this is where the nutrient-rich waters are coming to the surface.
"And in a place like the coast of Peru, you have millions and billions of seabirds, that are eating billions and trillions of anchovies and sardines, that are feasting on trillions and quadrillions of shrimp, that are eating algae, coming up there."
Okay?
"So you have the cold Humboldt current coming up and bending offshore here, heading out for the Galapagos, and as it's moving out towards the west-- in the Southern Hemisphere, remember, it is coming up towards the equator; the equator has a greater angular velocity than the southern part of South America, and the water is getting kind of left behind by the planet, as the planet pulls out this way."
"And because you have a continent here, there's no water that's left there to flow over and replace it."
"So the only place it can come up from is the bottom, and it comes up from the bottom and fertilizes this zone off the"
West Coast of South America.
"Well over the course of hundreds of millions of years the seabirds that nest on islands offshore, so that they can get away from the predators that would their eggs on a continent, have built up a huge deposit of guano on the Chilean Islands."
"And this was a matter of international significance, prior to the First World War, because nitrogen was so critical in the manufacture of arms."
"You remember the Oklahoma City bombing, when Timothy McVeigh simply took nitrogen fertilizer and mixed it with diesel fuel, and put it into a truck and blew up a building."
"A lot of energy in nitrogen; okay, nitrate, powerful stuff."
And this is where the world supply was.
"And, by the way, that repeats at many other upwelling areas around the globe."
"And just prior to World War One, Haber and Bosch figured out a way of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere, as ammonia and urea--they did it at high temperature and pressure-- and that was actually what kept"
Germany in the war between 1916 and 1918.
Okay?
So the reason I am mentioning this is that I'm trying to use a vivid example that shows you how the flow of materials between different compartments and ecosystems has actually influenced world history for human culture.
And in this case it was basically the seabirds taking it out of the ocean and putting it on land; and putting it on in huge quantities.
So now there's about 100 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer produced every year.
"It's about 1% of global industrial energy, and it sustains 40% of the global human population."
"So these kinds of processes actually are part of the substructure of our modern and post-modern culture, and it gives you some feel for an ecosystem service."
"Prior to the Haber-Bosch process, this fixing of nitrogen out of the atmosphere could only be done by biological organisms, and this is an estimate really of how big that ecosystem function was."
"Okay, so let's run through some of these cycles."
Almost all the nitrogen that's on the surface of the planet is biologically inaccessible; it's in the form of
N_2.
N_2 is a molecule that is extremely difficult to react with.
"And there are--it can be converted into something that's biologically accessible, primarily by bacteria and by cyanobacteria and by lightening."
"So if you go out and simply have a lightening storm pass overhead, and you compare the rain that you get out of it, with and without lightening, in the five minutes or so after a lightening strike directly overhead, if you're holding a cup out there, you're going to be getting nitrogen fertilizer."
"It'll be fairly dilute, but it's over a huge area."
Much more important are the bacteria and cyanobacteria that can convert nitrogen into nitrate.
"And most of that's going on in the soil, okay?"
So this is biological fixation.
The only real difference here is that we're also accumulating these costs as we do the recursion.
"So once we've done this recursion then we have a complete specification of all the roots within our flights database, all of the way's we can get from"
A to B and the total cost.
Now one thing I should say is this is not actually giving us the ways of getting from one place to another.
"If we wanted to accumulate the actual route that we take so the flights and the costs and the airlines and so on, we have to kind of use a structured structure inside our data base to accumulate those."
There are ways of doing that but I'm not going to demonstrate that here.
I'm just going to demonstrate the is accused of recursion and computing the total cost.
"OK, so let's go ahead and run this query so we've computed all of the routes, and then we're just gonna start by finding the routes from A to B and what the total cost of those are."
So we'll run the query and we'll find out that there are three ways of getting from A to B. The first one happens to be that direct Jet Blue flight for 195.
The second was the flight through Chicago for a total cost of 300.
You can go back and look at the data and verify these.
"And the third one was that complicated routing where we stopped several times, but we save a lot of money, well twenty dollars over the direct flight, by going through those cities because the total sub-cost is 175."
I'll leave it up to you whether it's worth twenty dollars to stop several times versus the direct flight.
So now since my actual specification of what I wanted to know was the cheapest way to go then
I just say min total instead of in my final query and I run that and my answer is that 175 is the cheapest way to get from A to B. Now here is an alternative formulation of the same query That essentially parallels the alternative that we looked at with our project cross where we built in project X into our recursion that simplified the recursion in that case.
"In this case it's not simpler, but it could potentially be more efficient."
We're going to build in the fact that we're starting from origin
A so instead of finding all roots from any point to any other point in our recursion and then finding the roots from A to
"B, let's create a relation recursively that says,"
"""Starting from point A,"
I can get to a particular destination for a particular total cost.
"So this is going to build up roots starting from A the base query is going to, of course, start by looking at direct flights where the origin is A and is going to put the destination and the cost into our relation called from A. So that starts with that first gives us direct start from A where we can get on the direct, where we can get to, and how much it will cost us, and then our recursion is going to add flights to that one."
"Again, it really parallels what we did with the Project X."
"Our recursion is going to say, ok we know we can get a, from particular, we can get to a particular place from point A for a certain cost and that's our destination."
If we add 1 more flight so the origin of that flight is the destination of where we can get then that will also be a destination that we can get to from point
A and we'll just add the cost of the additional flight on.
One more time a strong suggestion that you download and try these things for yourself.
Once we found all the places we can get from A then we'll use that to figure out the cheapest way to get to Point B. But let's just start by running the
With statement where all we do is see the places we can get to from A and the total cost of getting there.
So here we go.
"And we can get to Chicago,"
"Phoenix or we can get to B a couple of different ways, three different ways actually as we already know."
"I mean, it's like the easy one to handle. / If you're talking about garbage problem in Bali, from my perspective, you can debate about it, but actually the original culture of people in Bali here, they're really clean, in their house."
"They wake up in the morning, like 5:00 early, and already clean their house, clean their yard, and before sunset also they're doing the same thing they clean it, and they throw all the garbage into the area in the household it's called ""tegalang"", it means the area that you plant or grow anything, or you grow a pig there or something."
There is a special area to put this garbage.
"But a long long time ago, let's say 25 or 30 years ago, most of this garbage was organic and the Balinese, most of the Balinese, are still doing this culture, only the material of the garbage has changed."
Now it's plastic. / Waste is a man-made concept.
"It didn't really exist, and it especially didn't exist before the 50s and 60s."
"Everything was organic; we didn't have all this man-made material. / Mostly things would have been packaged in banana leaves, so if you look at the offerings, your daily offerings which can be bought at the market, they are now being packaged in plastic bags, single use very thin, high density plastic that is used once and then thrown away because it's so thin you can't really reuse it."
That would have all been packaged in banana leaves.
But I also think that probably what's happened is the change in lifestyle - food also would have been packaged in banana leaves - a change of lifestyle so that now there's a lot more things available on the market.
"In the past, I don't think, offerings for instance as an example, would have been so widely sold as they are nowadays."
"But so many people are working, directly or indirectly, in the tourist industry, so that, you know, increasingly people are having to buy things which in the past they wouldn't have had to buy. / There really wasn't the culture of obsolescence that exists today."
"Traditionally in Indonesia, and also Bali of course, most people don't want to pay for waste disposal."
They never had it.
"What they did with their waste was just throw it in the back, or burn it, or throw it in the river, and those habits spill over into businesses."
"People have a restaurant, or they have their hotel, and they take the same approach."
"They're just like ""get it away, get it away"", and they've never thought about having to pay for this."
"It's always, you can just throw it on the open lot or throw it in the river, and it's taken care of."
"And it's further complicated now in that you have a lot of large hotels that produce a huge amount of waste, and there's actually a lot of valuable stuff in that waste."
"And you have an informal scavenging sector that approach the hotels and businesses and say, ""We will provide waste services for you for free, and we'll buy the waste."""
"And what they're really interested in, they're actually buying the waste, they're buying access to the recyclables."
"So they're taking the stuff of value, but the stuff that has not value, guess where it goes: in the river, on the side of the road, wherever."
"You really get what you pay for and if you're selling you're waste or paying very little, you're going to have a dirty island."
"And for the tourism sector, obviously it's in their interest not to have a dirty island."
"So they have to make that leap and start realizing that if they want to have this thing taken care of, the stuff that doesn't have value, you're going to have to pay for it."
Also another problem that we have in Bali is that plastic waste is often burned. and this can create all sorts of problems.
Respiratory illnesses are the number one reported illness in Bali.
"And if you're breathing in plastic waste that's being burned, particularly at the speed that it's being burned, because it's not a high heat burning, which is less toxic, but it's usually a smoldering slow burning heap, so this can create all sorts of problems for human health and air quality."
I mean think of all these things we have that are really pointless.
"A plastic bag, you use for 15 minutes, and then it's around for your grand kids and their grand kids."
It's just insane.
"And it's not just plastic bags, there are some things you"
"look around, from plastic straws to plastic bottles..."
The problems began not so much in the actual indulgences but in the perception of the selling of indulgences and here's what happened.
Leo X granted indulgences to his representatives to raise money for the building of Saint Peter's.
But this was misunderstood to mean that one could simply pay money and then gain access to heaven directly.
But keep in mind that money was for the rebuilding of...
Saint Peter's and so you were doing a good work and according to the catholic church doing a good work is one of the ways you can assist in the process of gaining yourself a place in heaven.
And it does make sense that even a monetary donation to doing good christian work would be itself a kind of holy act.
But it did come to be seen as a money exchange for getting to Heaven.
"And the one example that really got under Martin Luther's cross, so to speak, was a man named Tetzel who was selling indulgences not far from Wittenberg where Luther was Professor of Theology."
"Tetzel said,"
"""as soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs."""
So you can see right there money is going in and the soul is going up to Heaven.
It sounds so crass and you're absolutely right
Martin Luther who was a monk and was a very devout professor of theology was really rubbed the wrong way by people saying they had bought these indulgences and therefore they were freed of their sins.
"And as a monk, Luther felt oppressed by the sinfulness of human nature of his own nature and so the idea that you can pay money to erase those sins and get quicker entry to Heaven was really an issue for him he took these issues very seriously and really struggled with them and then he did what any good doctor of theology would do."
He wrote out a series of arguments.
But in his case he posted them at least according to tradition to the doors of the castle church in wittenberg ninety-five theses ninety-five arguments that took issue primarily with the selling of indulgences
Luther sent them to the local archbishop and they made their way around and so we have the beginnings of the protestant reformation in fact if you think about those words protestant reformation for just a moment i think it's interesting to note that the word protestant is formed out of the word protest and reformation out of the word reform so this was a kind of protest against the church and it was an attempt to reform it
We know that three points define a triangle.
So if I were to take three random points here
"So let's call that point A, point B, and then point C right over here."
If we say that these three points are the vertices of a triangle they define a unique triangle
So this would be triangle ABC.
Now we've also learned in the last few videos
That triangle ABC has a unique circumcenter and that is a point that is equidistant to these three vertices it's equidistant to these three points
So the way we can find it is to draw the perpendicular bisector of each of these sides and where the three perpendicular bisectors intersect and we've shown that they always intersect at a unique point that is that circumcenter.
And I'll do that really quick over here.
"So let's say that this is the perpendicular bisector of that side, this is the perpendicular bisector of that side, and this is the perpendicular bisector of that side"
"So these are all perpendicular and they each bisect the side, so B to this point is going to be equal to this point to A."
A to this point is going to be equal to that point to C.
C to this point is going to be equal to that point to B.
"And this point right over here, we've already talked about that, we'll call that point O"
We call that the circumcenter.
Awkward.
"I am so tried of hearing this bullsh*t, Venus and Mars,"
"Men and women are just wired differently, ""logic"","
"The reason that there are fewer female comedians in the popular imagination than there are male ones, is because the comedy scene is really misogynistic."
Most popular male comedians taking cheap shots at women all the frigging time in their sets.
"Sure, we're talked a lot about in comedy, like we're the long and suffering house-wives, or we're the sluts,"
"Or we're the victims of rape jokes, or we are the , you know, ohh, women are just so crazy, like, I'll never understand their silly little brains,"
"And our experiences, no matter how varied and vast, are always marginalised into this really horrible little category, of niche, or women's comedy,"
"The moment that you don't make a fart joke, which, coincidently, a lot of women are kind of shamed out of at a very young age,"
"And instead want to talk about what you're going to do with your old wedding dress, post divorce,"
Is the moment that you're going to be quite ruthlessly heckled by the audience.
"The patriarchy is rigged so that we would believe that the universal experiences, white, able-bodied, cis, straight, middle-aged, are unquestionably logical."
Man:
"And don't try trying to prove us wrong ladies,"
"And of course, male."
"And you only have to look at the panel of many comedy shows on the telly,"
"Like, 'Mock the Week', or 'Ql', just to see this demographic reflected back onto us,"
"Hours and hours of prime-time telly, just dedicated to lines of white, middle-class men, just telling us about, well, their own experiences of the world,"
It's a social status thing.
"People with the most power will promote the comedy that most reflects their own, personal experience,"
"And ignore the things that they don't identify with,"
"And so any comedy that deviates from that very narrow experience of life is going to be put in a kind of, neatly labelled box,"
With it's appropriate viewing hours and it's sanctions.
"And so women comedians are entering an arena where if the talk about their own personal experiences that don't match up with this kind of,"
"Hierarchical, masculine, view of the world, then they're going to be dismissed as 'women's' comedy, and will be used in a degrading way,"
"And it's really cisexist to boot, because often, you know, men dismiss female comedians saying like,"
"""Oh, well, you know, it's all just period jokes and diets."
"Ergh!"""
"And ultimately if a woman f*cks up her comedy on the stage, then her entire gender is smeared."
"You're not just a woman who isn't funny, believe me, there are plenty of us, like, just ask me what my favourite joke is sometime, it's pretty dire,"
"And no, you serve us this, lazy, short-hand kind of 'proof', that all women aren't funny,"
"And this is only something that can be changed through socialisation, by encouraging children of all genders,"
Let me actually draw that again.
"So that $7 investment is here, $7 capital, $7 from the Treasury."
"You have $86 from the Fed, and they use this to give the cash here, and then that goes back here, and you're holding toxic asset A."
"Now if toxic asset A ends up being worth a lot of money, then this is worth a lot, and this is worth nothing, And that's OK, because the hedge fund essentially paid nothing for it or paid next to nothing for it, in which case, everyone kind of works out well in that scenario."
"On the other hand, let's say that this thing is worth zero."
Let's say that this thing defaults.
"If that thing defaults, then this investment is worth zero."
But guess what?
"The hedge fund had an insurance policy, where this guy was a counterparty."
"So he says, hey, this thing here defaulted."
"I'm going to claim my insurance policy, so this guy's going to have to send him $7."
"So it's economically the exact same thing that I outlined in the Geithner Two video, but in this situation, these guys, it's almost an arms-length transaction."
"But this bank can make that behavior happen by essentially going into the market and selling credit default swaps for this exact asset for really, really cheap."
And this is just the first way I thought about it.
There's other ways you could do it.
"If you're just a separate hedge fund and you own enough of the shares in a bank, let's say you owned all of the shares of the bank or a good percentage of the shares of the bank, then you would also have an incentive to go out there and use the Geithner Plan and lever up and buy these assets."
"Another thing is-- I don't want to get too technical --if you kind of hold one of the fulcrum pieces of debt, the pieces of debt that are trading at a discount, because you're afraid that this bank is going to fail, if you hold a bunch of those assets, you still would want to participate in the Geithner Plan and funnel money and use the Government money to essentially buy this asset A."
"I mean, the general theme here is, if you have two people, if this is the private world and you have a scenario where person A, if a transaction can make $100 or he gets rid of $100 exposure, and person B essentially has a potential"
"loss of minus $7 of exposure, there's a net transfer of wealth here."
You went from $100 of exposure to $7 exposure for this guy.
"So someone is offloading the $93 of exposure to this stuff, and that's the Government."
The Government's only taking the down side.
"So this is a huge subsidy of exposure, and it depends what these are really worth, if this thing is really worth $30 and it's a $63 exposure, but any time you have this, the private sector is going to figure out a way to make this subsidy happen."
"And everything I've outlined so far is if A is the bank that has 100% exposure, all they have to do is, through whatever back-door scheme or financial product or insurance or whatever they want to do, or loans that have very little stipulations on it, they just have to give this guy essentially $7 of compensation somehow that gets around the"
"Government rules, and then this transaction will occur."
"And I hope it doesn't occur, and it's very possible it won't, because maybe I'm missing something here, but"
"I'm just saying that everything I understand about the Geithner Plan is that there's a huge incentive for this to occur, and this is frankly the only reason why the plan would work."
"Because, as I outlined in the other videos, for a private investor who's not incentivized in this way, the put option that the Government is giving them still is not enough of a rationale to go from paying $30 for an asset to going to pay $60 an asset."
So it won't work if this behavior doesn't occur.
The only way that the plan quote unquote will work and people will overpay for the assets is if you have this type of action going on.
A viewer of One Minute Medical School asks:
"""Dr. Rob, what is 'herd immunity?'"""
"These 8 kids I mentioned aren't children who lived in the streets directly, but they spent a lot of time, begging in the streets, some of their parents currently work in the streets, recycling, and others were stealing bread to be able to eat, before they came to live with us, even being so young"
"Others of the kids we work with have family histories or generations of family members who don't have an education, who have experienced a lot of sexual abuse, or psychological/verbal abuse."
Many of their parents are illiterate or haven't had hope for another lifestyle
These are traditions that are repeating the same sad story through generations.
"But we hope that we can be part of the difference, part of the change that God is going to do in their lives in this generation and also in their future generations that's why we want to work, not only with these kids, but also with their families that's a lot more complicated, but we want to be part of a deep change in their lives"
"When a lot of us arrived to Formando Vidas, especially me, we arrived with the expecation that God called us to be part of the transformation of these kids' lives, part of the radical change in them and it's true, God is using us as an instrument but it's not just for their lives, it's also for our own lives"
"God uses them to teach us about his love, to deal with and heal wounds in us that only He can do, and He works through these little ones"
"One of the things that has impacted me here is that we teach the kids to pray to God as ""Daddy"" but many of us are not so clear on being his sons and daughters and God has used these children to teach me that I am his daughter too and he is concerned about me and he takes special care of me"
So everything that we can sow here I think that God is going to return it to us out of love
"So thank you for everything that you do, that you're thinking about doing, thank you for your support i through prayer, finances, in whatever way that God calls you to support, get to know and be part of this ministry."
Thank you.
Your contribution and support is being part of the change for these lives.

We started Universal Subtitles because we believe every video on the web should be subtitle-able.
Millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers require subtitles to access video.
Videomakers and websites should really care about this stuff too.
Subtitles give them access to a wider audience and they also get better search rankings.
Universal Subtitles makes it incredibly easy to add subtitles to almost any video.
"Take an existing video on the web, submit the URL to our website and then type along with the dialog to create the subtitles"
"After that, tap on your keyboard to sync them with the video."
"Then you're doneâ€"" we give you an embed code for the video that you can put on any website at that point, viewers are able to use the subtitles and can also contribute to translations."
"We support videos on YouTube, Blip.TV, Ustream, and many more."
Plus we're adding more services all the time
"Universal Subtitles works with many popular video formats, such as MP4, theora, webM and over HTML 5."
Our goal is for every video on the web to be subtitlable so that anyone who cares about the video can help make it more accessible.
"Art lovers from across the world are coming together in Maastricht, the Netherlands, these days... ...for what is acknowledged globally as the world's leading art and antiques fair."
Tefaf Maastricht features an impressive selection of genuine masterpieces from 260... ...of the world's prestigious art and antiques dealers from 16 countries.
More than 30 thousand items are on display.
All of them are for sale.
Among them this dark bronze buste of the French Baron de Bastard... ...created by realist Gustave Courbet in 1875.
This work of art has been missing for years and was recently discovered again in Algeria.
"""This was missing when they did the big Courbet exhibition in Paris. ...and now it's turned up."
The first one being Core Federal
Standards an open competition for agencies that are not meeting those standards.
This is an ongoing effort by the Office of Community Services currently working with the Community Action Partnership to get some organizational standards.
That project is outlined in the budget as a way to get these things moving in the direction of performance based and targeting of resources that they want.
There is also a piece in the budget request about creating a deeper play space infrastructure.
"There is a real interest in the President's administration to integrate CSBG, the Community Services Block Grant, the agencies that are receiving those funds and the work that they're doing with other administration play space programs."
One of those that you're probably very familiar with is neighborhoods thinking of how they can strengthen that infrastructure that they're hoping to build across government.
"This is an entire effort across government, not just focus specific on CSBG, but they want CSBG to be involved in this effort."
OMB has sent out memos about how they want all of government to be looking at how they can improve and strengthen the play space policies and focus that they have.
Then there is a number of
CSBG specific reforms for improving program integrity that you can see on the slide in front of you allowing states to suspend and redistribute funds when there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing as well as guidance for determination of income eligibility and requiring eligible entities to include in their community action plans performance measures responding to community needs.
That's an overview of what's included as far as the specific numbers and reforms that are in the proposed budget that came out this past week.
I also wanted to talk about some of the things that are ongoing in the network today.
Similar language and similar numbers have been included in the budget for the last two years.
So the office of Community Services and the Department of Health and Human Services have been looking at efforts to respond to these pushes by the administration.
"There is a national training and technical assistance effort going on right now, and that consists of three key pieces in this effort to move forward with these reforms."
And I wanted to briefly describe these thee to you to make you aware of what's going on in the network.
The first is the ROMA Next Generation Center of Excellence.
"This one is headed up by NASCSP, that's us."
And I'm going to get more into detail as far as what the activity of that Center of Excellence is and the purpose of that center of excellence in the coming slides.
But the next effort is the Organizational
Standards Center of Excellence.
This is being run by the Community Action Partnership.
They're putting together those core federal standards that were described previously.
"There is CSBG working group that's made up of members of national partners, State Administrators, State Associations, as well as"
local agencies are working together on these organizational standards in this effort.
This week they'll soon be releasing those standards to the network for public comment and feedback.
I'm sure there are a number of questions about timing of these things and especially of the few reforms that were proposed at the Office of Community Services is already working on.
They have requested that they receive items back from the Centers of Excellence and the Performance Management Task Force by July of this year.
So that's when the Office of Community Services will be receiving things from the network.
"However, their timing for implementation has not been announced yet."
"They will be receiving things this summer and the Community Action Partnership and NASCSP as we provide them with resources and provide them with the deliverables of the centers of excellence, we will provide guidance and suggestions on implementation but really it will be up to them as far as how quickly and how soon those are implemented."
The first is to tell you in a very personal why I'm so committed to this.
"Francis mentioned that I'm a neurologist, and the turning point for me was when I was a resident at Mass General and was taking care of a number of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, otherwise known as Lou Gehrig's disease, which, as you know, is a quite horrible neurodegenerative disease that kills its patients within about 3 years."
"I spent the evening, all of one night, sitting by the bedside of an ALS patient together with his family as he died in front of me."
"He had lost the ability to breathe, and I was there to turn off the monitors when he died and intervene if there was anything that needed intervention while this happened."
"As I sat there, a sense of rage overcame me that this was, as you've heard others say, this is simply unacceptable."
We have got to do better.
"I went back to the lab and, like a lot of people, did genetics, and genetics has taught us an enormous amount about the underlying cause of these diseases."
"Then, my time at Merck taught me that there's a lot that we know about how to do that translation but actually a lot more that we don't know."
"Then, coming to NlH, I realized that ALS is not the exception, it's the rule."
"We've heard a lot of numbers tonight, but there are 6,000 diseases that affect the human family, and of those, there are treatments available for only about 500 of them all together."
"What that means is that if you were one of those people who has one of those thousands of diseases with no treatment, you get a doctor like I was who says,"
"""I'm sorry."
"There's nothing I can do for you, but please stay in touch."""
"I should say that back when I was in training, and it was only about 25 years ago, the research enterprise really hadn't gotten to the point where this kind of translation was really possible."
That has changed due in
"large part to the efforts of a lot of the people in this room, and there are some epical efforts like the Genome Project that we all recognize as some time points that were particularly important in that development."
"I guess the way I would say it is that the basic research enterprise has delivered on its covenant to tell us how to make new therapeutics, interventions, diagnostics, devices, and what we're now struck with is a system which needs to be changed in order to make that happen."
"The system we have has delivered on what it was supposed to do, but the system we have was designed to do something else."
"It was not designed to do this, and that's one of the reasons that NCATS was formed."
"One of the principles of NCATS, and you've heard this over and over and over again, is one of teamwork."
"Well, why is that?"
"Well, one of my favorite quotations was from a"
German pathologist named Werner Kollath
"-- some of you may know this -- who said in the last century that ""much is known but unfortunately in different heads,"" and that's particularly true in the translational spectrum."
"One of the challenges for us is to figure out how to make these team efforts because translation is a team sport; it has to be approached that way, how to make that work better."
"It's the last thing that the NCATS is really focused on, is the fact that science and medicine is not really organized the way"
Mother Nature organized it.
"Mother Nature designed a holistic organism where all the pieces are connected, but for a variety of reasons, science and medicine is done in a quite reductionist way, where we have heart doctors and lung doctors and eye doctors and nose doctors, and similarly we have heart researchers and lung researchers and cancer researchers and eye researchers and nose researchers."
But guess what?
"There is a lot of commonality among those systems, but those commonalities which can allow us to move forward remarkably fast at times, and you just heard Lou describe one."
A drug for rheumatoid arthritis that is now usable for leukemia?
"That kind of thing happens all the time once you set up a system to allow it to happen, and that's one of the things that"
Some backbenchers focus entirely on Parliament.
"Tthey see their role as being elected by their constituents in order to represent them in Parliament and they focus on holding the government to account, scrutinising legislation, and spend a lot of time therefore in Parliament."
At the other end of the spectrum you get MPs who are backbenchers who see their role as being
"local community campaigners, who are what we call good constituency MPs."
"And they spend a lot of time in their constituencies, raising local issues and dealing with them locally."
I think a good backbencher actually combines those two roles and uses Parliament in order to raise the issues that really matter to their constituents locally.
Constituents seek to influence MPs by writing to their Members of Parliament on issues of importance to them.
"They could be policy issues, not just about domestic policy but concerns, for example, about what is happening in other parts of the world like the Middle East."
They can ring up MPs offices and pass on their comments to a Member of Parliament before a crucial vote in the Commons.
"Or they could see Members of Parliament in their surgeries, the weekly opportunity that we have to talk to our constituents if they want to raise with us individual cases or matters of policy."
These are answers to oral questions that have been sent to me by Ministers.
"Every MP can submit an oral or a written question and the Minister has to reply, either in the chamber or in writing."
And these are examples of answers that ministers have given back to me.
I submit lots of questions.
It is one way that a MP can hold the government to account and really get to the bottom of certain issues that you cannot always raise in the chamber.
"Arrangements for the House of Lords are very different, as the House of Lords is the unelected revising chamber."
"While a small number are made up of hereditary or religious representatives, the majority of Peers are appointed to the House of Lords for their expertise in one or more areas."
"The usual role of the second chamber is to revise laws and to scrutinise them in some detail, and also, to some extent, to hold the Government to account."
And the House of Lords is a chamber which does precisely that.
It does it through various means.
"It asks questions of the Government on a daily basis, and something like in the past year for which we have figures, something like 7,500 questions were asked of Ministers in the Government."
We have debates in the House of Lords which are on topics of general interest.
"We have committee work which means that every single law is looked at in enormous detail; every line, every comma is looked at."
"The important thing perhaps to remember in the House of Lords, unlike in the House of Commons, is that there is time to do this because we have no time limit on our debates."
"And I think too that it is important to point out that the House of Lords fulfils an enormously important function of bringing to bear expertise on laws which, very often, are highly technical."
Any Member of our House can bring forward an issue that they wish to have discussed or debated.
"They can ask a question; they can put that question either in written form, in which case the Government has to answer it, or they can put it in oral form, in which case it can be debated."
They can bring forward a Private Member's Bill; they can ask for issues to be discussed by way of an amendment.
"So if a bill is coming through and something is not agreed to by that Member, they can bring forward the amendment and have it considered by the House and then there will be a vote at the end of the debate where the House can determine whether they agree with that position or disagree."
The big power that we have in the House of Lords is really to make the government think again.
"Either to just stop and give us more time to look at legislation or occasionally, particularly if we are coming up to the end of the Parliamentary year or coming up to the end of the Parliament when there is going to be a general election, in those circumstances the House of Lords can say; hang on, we do not think you have got this quite right, we want you to think again."
"Particularly if it is at the end of the Parliament or at the end of the Parliamentary year time is against the government, so we can use that time to pressurise the Ministers to think very carefully about what they are doing."
For some of you it may seem strange to talk about soil in a conference about food.
And the reason for that is because food for most of us - we've created a food culture that essentially sees food as a commodity.
"For many of us, we don't even know why it has anything to do with food."
"And I want you to know, I'm not a soil scientist; as you've heard, I'm a farmer."
"But I have the privilege and the honor of having an association of colleagues and friends who have helped a lot with this, and so I want you to recognize the credits that I want to give for all the people that have helped in helping me talk about both soil and food."
"In this food culture in which food is essentially a commodity, most of us, I think, in our culture today, simply think about soil as dirt."
It's simply that black stuff that's out there.
"And even some of our soil scientists have occasionally talked about soil as simply a material to hold a plant in place, and the way we grow food is everything else that we do - all the synthetic fertilizers that we put in, the pesticides that we use, that's what we use to raise food, and soil is just sort of there."
"But in point of fact, soil is critical."
And what I want to do this afternoon is to help you understand some of that.
"And in the first place, the first thing to understand, is that soil is not dirt."
"Soil is, in fact, a very vibrant, living community."
"In fact, soil scientists, some of the things they tell us now, is there are more living organisms beneath the surface of the soil than there are above the surface of the soil."
"And it isn't just all of the things that we can see, the earthworms and the beetles and the ants, but it is those microorganisms which dominate all of our soil culture."
"In fact, as near as I can tell, soil scientists can't even come to an agreement about how many microorganisms there are in soil."
"I've seen some soil scientists refer to that as 50 million microorganisms in a single teaspoonful of soil, and others have said it could be as much as two and four billion."
"So this is a community of life, and if we're going to have not only good food but any food at all, we have to sustain that community of life in the soil."
"So this is one of the things that I want to help us understand today,"
"And so, if it wasn't for that community of life, we wouldn't have any food, we wouldn't have any water, we wouldn't have any of us."
"And so I love the way Wes Jackson puts this because not only are we so dependent on all of that life for our life, but as we all know, eventually, we return to soil, right?"
So the way Wes has put this is that we are simply stopovers between soil and soil.
(Laughter)
And I think it's important for us to try to appreciate that as we try to come to understand changing the way we eat because we're not going to change the way we eat unless we recognize what we have to do in supporting our soil.
"Now, there are a couple of problems with this, and one of those problems is that currently, in the way in which we are producing our food, we are losing our soil at unprecedented rates."
"Just in the last half century, we've lost about half of our topsoil in this country."
"And not only have we lost it, but we also have degraded it."
A recent study just came out by the United Nations which has indicated that 25% of the remaining soil on our planet is now degraded.
"In other words, it no longer has the vitality to produce the kind of food that we've all heard today that we need."
"The other thing is that soil is essentially not a renewable material, it's not a renewable resource, because it has taken the earth millions of years to accumulate this soil."
"So unless you want to hang around for a million years, it's going to be very difficult to see this soil that we've lost and are losing, restored."
"So I want to share with you just about a minute and a half from a wonderful documentary which Deborah Koons Garcia has spent the last four years putting together, and it's going to be released to the public in March of this year called ""Symphonies of Soil,"" and I hope all of you get a chance to see it when it comes out, but John Reganold who is a soil scientist at Washington State University, in the beginning of this film, tells us how nature developed and accumulated this soil in the various landscapes."
"Well, let's take just a moment and listen to John tell his story."
"And so quite often the government whips will say ""no, we are voting against this; have a look at it again and come back."""
"I took the Energy bill through the House of Lords, and a number of amendments I proposed were not accepted by the Government."
But they thought about it and come back later and changed their own bill.
"So one way is on the floor of the chamber of both Houses to propose amendments, but a good way also to get changes is to try to get hold of the Minister, talk to the Minister in detail, and to also talk to the Minister's civil servants and propose changes then."
Working behind the scenes can often achieve changes more than on the floor of the House.
"Parliament on the whole holds government to account by the party system, by having an opposition in the House of Commons, by objecting to certain aspects of legislation and voting on that legislation."
"And then again in the House of Commons, which would be said by all MPs, that they are elected and so have the mandate to represent the wishes, to some extent, of their constituents."
"The House of Lords holds the government to account because it has various mechanisms of asking the government to think again, whether that be through amendments to bills, whether it be through committee work, whether it be by way of oral or written questions to the Government or in debates."
The Government has always to defend its policies in any of those different contexts.
When the House sits we start with question time.
And everybody knows of Prime Ministers Question Time which happens on a Wednesday.
"Every single government department, and its normally about once a month, has to answer questions in the House."
It is very much like Prime Ministers Questions where the Secretary of State and all the Ministers have to come before the House and to answer questions.
And that has proved to be the best way of holding Government to account.
There are also written questions and you can write letters to Ministers and they are obliged to respond.
"You can also have Freedom of Information requests when if you do not think that a Minister is really giving you the kind of detail that you want, you can make a Freedom of Information request to find out specific details."
So these are very important ways of holding Government to account.
"But actually it is through having parties which are not the Government looking at legislation in detail in committees, normally public bill committees or in select committees, looking in detail at the legislation that Government is bringing forward, and making objections or asking the government to clarify exactly why it is that they want to introduce something and not something else."
What is the job of the opposition?
It is to constructively oppose.
"The opposition, after all, has lost the election."
"The Government has been elected and its manifesto has therefore been preferred to that of any the other party, and there is an unwritten rule in Parliament that a Government is entitled to get its business."
"But that does not mean that opposition should not do everything they can to point out the flaws and the fallacies contained within the legislation placed before Parliament, or the mistakes made by government in its conduct of foreign policy, because not all business is legislative."
"The role of the opposition, of course, is not always to oppose."
It would be foolish to think that the opposition were there to simply oppose what the Government wants to do.
"The opposition is there to look carefully at what the government does want to do, and if it finds that the policy is reasonable and they can support it, and it fits in with their policies and their philosophy at least give it that support."
"And if not, of course to oppose it, to speak out and to say that it cannot go along with it but to do it, of course, in a democratic manner."
Always remember the phrase:
"""Opposition must have its say but government must have its way."""
The invaluable scrutiny that Parliamentarians perform would be impossible without an effective staff.
They ensure the smooth running of operations and support the work of Parliamentarians.
"All MPs in the British Parliament are provided with an office in the Parliament; are provided with computers, telephones and copying facilities within the Parliament; we are given research facilities; we are given a library, available to us with library specialists able to assist us in more complex research of information."
Steve is a Presidential Management Fellow for Energy Efficiency detailed right now on the Council on Environmental Quality.
"He's been with the Department of Energy, and he's also the Senior Research and Program Manager for a number of years at the Alliance to Save Energy where we were colleagues."
"Steve is a graduate of the John's Hopkins Graduate School of advanced international studies, and he is a Suma Cum Laude Graduate of the University of Pittsburgh."
"Steve, I know you're very, very busy but we appreciate you taking the time to join us this afternoon."
Could you tell us a bit about the Race to the Top Initiative and specifically how deployment programs might enter into the challenge?
Steve:
Thank you for that very nice introduction.
"I'm impressed that you know my CV as well as you do, but I guess we do have some history together."
"As Brad said, the Race to the Top is its own line item in the Department of Energy's FY ""14 budget request."
It's a $200 million request and is modeled on the
Department of Education's successful Race to the Top Initiative in schools.
It's going to contribute to the
President's goal that he announced at the State of the Union to double energy productivity from 2010
levels by 2030.
"And the goal is to challenge states to come up with policies and programs that will increase energy productivity through energy efficiency, and that can include power and demand response programs as well as clean energy deployment and grid modernization at large."
"The goal is to get states, tribes, and local governments with solar power authority and other cooperatives to align the incentives of their organization and the regulated utilities with the customer interests and also in the national interests for clean energy with an efficient grid."
The goal is really to have the states come up with policies that will achieve these goals and five different qualifying criteria.
"Those qualifying criteria are energy efficiency which includes customer access to data, resiliency in cyber security, and then grid transparency."
"In the first part those will be the qualifying criteria and states can identify and have access to DOE technical assistance, and some technical assistance money may be available to them depending on the merit of their proposal."
Those proposals can include deployment programs as those deployment programs are set up to meet the specific goals of the initiative.
The second phase will be larger awards that will be given based on demonstrative performance towards improving energy productivity in the first part.
"Basically those will be the Race to the Top winners, and it will be based on the success of the program and policies that they've implemented during the first phase."
I think that's a good general overview.
I'm happy to answer any questions.
Brad:
That's an excellent introduction.
I think what we'd like to explore with you for just a few minutes is where deployment programs may come into this like CSBG or Weatherization.
I was in a meeting with where deployment programs may come into this like CSBG or Weatherization.
"I was in a meeting with you on the Council of Environmental quality a couple of weeks ago, and two ideas that came to mind were: one, elsewhere in the budget, Steve, as you know, the President called upon Congress to enact something like the Home Star Initiative from two Congresses ago."
And that's something that we here at
"NASCSP are very interested in in terms of a gradual evolution of the weatherization program once we have the funding stabilized and restored to pre recovery act levels into one universal retrofit program which would include incentives, rebates, that kind of thing for middle-class homeowners to do energy- efficiency retrofits."
"Do you see a state under the Race to the Top possibly doing a pilot program, or another option, the tremendous problem in this country with foreclosed properties which are vacant, abandoned, they're not really habitable, and taking some of the weatherization training centers, $1 billion of the recovery act for weatherization was devoted to training, trying to redeem that tax payer investment, provide a market for those workers to do energy-efficiency retrofits on those foreclosed properties, could you address that in the context of the Race to the Top?"
This I can tell you about ...
I asked thequestion the wrong way..
"We have a consciousness that is beyond time and space that can't die, as it hasn't been born yet and it's also the one we feel when we dream and the one we get all our ideas and thoughts from at a deeper level and it's the one manifesting itself in the individual structures"
"These individual structure will die ... or dissolves and become new individual structures .. and it is as such not a talk about death in it... but in the individual structures time and space is designed because it is used to measure the experience and when you have measured the level of experience as the individual structures is to be used for it will dissolve and go back in the common consciousness again so yes, there is an eternal life if you can talk about life beond time and space and such things I am allowed to explain because it is something that penetrates the collective consciousness somewhere in the individual structure, anyway."
Ole:
Konfutse and Thao also thought also had such a formulation and actually the Greeks too cause thay didn't believe in an individual god most of them they thought we were sucked into the collective ... the common soul
"I'm glad you use the word ""collective consciousness"" and that you know what you are talking about when you use it cause I am actually one of those who believe that we have a collective consciousness and I can feel it ...."
"I think that if you write and think as you use those skills as long as you use it cleverly ... or you have to just go a layer deeper than where it is deformed... just that bit further down... and thas is what it's all about, so when you ask whether there will be a paradigm change then the issue is of the layer below it and the superficial collective consciousness as the Latins called ""Sensus communis"" and the Greeks called ""Koiné aisthêsis"" the common perception a precise common thought, historians called it if we just get underneath there and things begins to happen because we know, of course, much more than we know we know and I am glad that you confirm the idea with me and since I am only an ordinary person and not an alien"
"I only get that feeling now and then, but sometimes I feel that there is a completely different dimensions of knowledge that we can get in touch with"
Martin:
"Now, I just add that roughly there are three ways to be alien here at eath"
That you reincarnate you that you incarnate you as someone who does not belong to earth but still grow up as a normal human being even if you feel that you do not belong and then you can be engineered as a very young so your genetic material is a mixture of the two and it can also be combined with the first so you are incarnated and manipulated and the last is where we need to be a little careful because it is decidedly aliens who disguise themselves as humans to achieve and affect the power structure
"I do not belong to the last group but you could easily belong to one of the first groups so it is not certain you are human .. it's just a matter of whether you have stepped into character with the part of you that is alien and that I could easily sense that you might want to one day cause you probably have the alien quality, you going around getting all the thoughts that you do"
Ole:
That would in any case explain a lot of things that I have difficultys understanding regarding myself
Martin:
You would feel at peace with yourself?
Ole:
"I would have come home, in a way"
Martin:
I belive you would..
I would like to ask you about another word
"You mentioned ""νίκη"", ""to win"" or ""Trepo"", but there is also another Greek word which means ""to win"" named ""Strepho"" and that is what we have in ""catastrophe"" .. do you see catastrophe option?"
Ole:
"No, because we see it somewhere else ... in John's Gospel in one of the last chapters"
"Maria goes down to the grave and sees that the cave is empty the stone has fallen and then she cries she think there has been graverobbers even though there is nothing to rob... and the guy is gone and as she stands there and cries in the garden, she hear someone behind her and think it's the gardener, but it is not the gardener and in the Greek text it says... the word used when she turns and sees him and her soul and body are turned around that is ""Strepho""..""EpiStrepho"".."
"""Epi"" is an amplification and this ""Augustin"" translates into ""conventio"" ""to convert"" and in that moment her whole mind design changed.. her whole mental structure"
"So it's the positive side of the word ""strophe"" in ""catastrophe"""
Martin:
"It's perfect that you mentions this, because it might just be that what looks like a catastrophe scenario ... gets turned into something divine"
Ole:
It could well be ..
Let's take an example to illustrate it.
"Suppose Bob has the plague, and the plague cloud around him can make you sick if you don't have immunity."
"He meets the butcher and the baker, and then the banker, but the banker hasn't got immunity, and so the banker gets the plague."
"Now, before the banker gets sick he can pass the disease on."
"And he meets the barista, who just got immunized, but she's not immune yet, and so she gets the plague, and she passes it on to her baby, who gets very sick."
How could we have prevented this?
"Well, what if the banker had been immunized?"
"Next, Bob can't pass it on to the banker, who can't pass it on to the barista."
The chain is broken.
The baby stays happy.
This raises two important points:
"First, the more contagious the disease is, the higher the level of immunity in the population we need."
"Second, vaccines are password protection for your immune system, the body's firewall that keeps bad things out, and keeps you from spreading bad stuff around."
so this is the first video in a short series introducing some of the major ideas of the protestant reformation And in this video we just want to lay the groundwork what was it like to live in europe before the protestant reformation
That is before fifteen seventeen when martin luther a german monk and professor of theology nailed his ninety-five theses to the door of the catholic church in Wittenberg and we'll get back to that
I was driving around my neighborhood about a week ago and I took photographs of some of the churches that were there and within only fifteen or twenty minutes I had photographed the signs in front of six different kinds of churches and this is a really good place to start because it's at the time of reformation that we get this explosion of different kinds of christianity so tell us what you took pictures of.
I took pictures of a lutheran church of the baptist church of the united methodist church there was a catholic church there there was a congregational church there's a presbyterian church and so five of those six churches were created as a result of the protestant reformation so let's go back to a time when it was only one kind of christianity in western europe and that's religion we today call roman catholicism no we didn't need to use that phrase roman catholicism because there was nothing to differentiate it from the term catholic really means universal and so that makes the point that this was the universal church or that was their ambition to be the universal church and we use the term roman catholic because the head of the church is in Rome and that's the pope
That man was enormously important because he would lead the way to salvation and to heaven according to the catholic tradition that is one found one's way to salvation which was tremendously important because the alternative was hell and it's important to remember I think that back then the concern for most people was salvation was how to get to heaven and the path was one path
It was through the teachings of the church through the sacraments
"In a way it was a simpler time to live because you get one choice you don't have to say what religion should I be except for those very few people in Europe, for instance, very few jews and even if you are Muslims."
So the church really infused everybody's life it was the vehicle to salvation and just for the average person in a small town the church's would tower over the other buildings.
The bells in the tower would ring on the hour.
"The church would celebrate the saint's feast days what we call holidays that is holy days and it was in a sense the church that marked the days of your life and the major events in your life as well and through the sacraments you helped to earn God's grace you have to secure yourself a place in heaven and the sacraments included baptism, confirmation, communion, which you might know as the Eucharist penance, also known as confession, marriage,"
"last rites, and ordination for priests. so it's good reminder of how important the church was in the lives of every day people and those everyday people although they might look to their local priest would look to the pope in rome as the ultimate authority on earth and the pope at this point in fifteen seventeen was Pope Leo X (the tenth) so Pope Leo X (the tenth) was intent on rebuilding the church of Saint Peter's and the plans for Saint Peter's were very ambitious."
"In fact, Pope Julius II who commissioned the rebuilding of Saint Peter's (the pope before Pope Leo X) said he wanted to create the most grandiose church in all of christendom and they did the church itself Saint Peter's Basilica was tremendously important to the authority of the pope by tradition Saint Peter is buried under that church and Saint Peter was charged by Christ himself to lead the church so Saint Peter is understood to be the first pope and so every succeeding pope is taking on the job of Saint Peter from Christ himself and so the very authority of this office is vested in this building."
The problem is the building was really expensive to construct and the question was where were they going to get the money.
Well there was a pretty common way to get money and that was selling indulgences.
Now an indulgence was a piece of paperwork that made it possible for you to get to Heaven more quickly. most people when they died you had throughout your life confessed your sins you had atoned for your sins but it would probably be something that you hadn't quite atoned for and so for most people you wouldn't go straight to Heaven you would go instead to this place in the betveen the way station before you get to
Heaven a place called purgatory and it was indulgences that bought you time off from purgatory.
"So this is a little tricky because indulgences were actually a very old tradition where if you did a good work you could, in fact, receive an indulgence that is a kind of certificate that would speed your soul out of purgatory to Heaven."
Even in certain extraordinary cases it might allow you to circumvent purgatory entirely and go directly to
Heaven.
"Now the problem was even though I had 4 billion words from which I trained by probabilistic model,"
"I had never seen the word ""ginormous""--not once in those 4 billion."
"Yet, I should be able to deal with it even if I haven't seen the word before."
"So having more data might mean that I would've seen ""ginormous"" and I could have some probability for it rather than just making the Laplace smoothing assumption."
"And having better smoothing could also help-- maybe something more sophisticated than Laplace, maybe something that looks more carefully at the content of the word."
"So it might have a letter model to say these letters look common, ending in ""ous""--that's a common ending in English--so this looks more like a word, even if I haven't seen it before, than some other combination of letters."
"Even if this period wouldn't leave behind anything, it gave people the feeling of living in peace, living brotherly, the feeling of solidarity."
Most simply it lifted the feeling of laziness and tore down the fear empire
"The people who come here, including myself eventhough we would watch tv, read newspapers and be interested in politics to some extent our culture of action has developed here."
"How can one take action, how can one help each other... you sit there, someone comes and sits next to you and you chat for the whole day, discuss Turkish politics... where else can you do this?"
"This feeling of trusts was absent from the Turkish people for a long time and now there is hope for all.. and if Gezi Park wouldn't leave behind anything, it left behind this."
"The youth possesses a historical enlightening, progressive, independent, liberal and egalitarian historical vein, so long the youth does not represent these, it cannot be called ""youth"" no matter the age bracket."
"Here, as the Idea Clubs Federation, we refuse the society and youth profile that Tayyip Erdogan has imposed upon the Turkish society and we set off with the slogan of a new country, a new university, a new future and we are taking our place in this resistance."
"Here you have all the folks, no political party, it is wholly formed of the public, everything is free and the people here understand each other with an incredible tolerance... it is incredible that there is such tolerance in a metropole like Istanbul... we've been here for 10 days and there has been no rape, no theft not even a slight harassment towards anyone."
"Here we friends that are covered and not, from all stands and political views but there is an incredible apprehension and for this reason, to those that still don't understand us"
"I just want them to read our news too, not only of the partisan media to read all the news so that they can think...we only ask them to think"
"There is even an infirmary, you can even find needle and thread, all your needs..."
"I mean even the hotels around let people to use their toilets and so on ... there is incredible solidarity here you can find all the services that a government should freely give to its citizens like health, like a library this really is a breath of fresh air"
"People voluntarily bring books here, there is no pressure, no force we feel responsible to make sure that those books reach the people if I'm an individual of the society, it is my responsibility, my role to make sure that the society reads and sees this is why we are and we are going to be here until we succeed in our resistance"
"[Announcement] please make no payments in the park, all your needs can be met for free"
"This something we haven't seen for a long time, since the 60s, 70s and now people stood up for their own requests because they restricted us from so many different angles they even started interfering with what people should eat, drink and therefore people said enough to this at some point"
"As Gezi Parki TV we've been here since yesterday we have a camera and a microphone, the mic is open to all our aim is to form a speaking platform here, to enable people to come and to tell their ideas, their views as they wish, without any censorship."
We broadcast these at geziparkitv.wordpress.com
"Here we have resist arm-in-arm with friends of different sexual preferences, with those who have views completely different than ours our main aim here is to win back our rights along with those wishes voiced for Gezi Parki we don't want to displace anyone, we don't want to bring down anyone we only want back those rights we had before in this environment there is an incredible amount of love, don't let anyone spoil that."
"Media may deceive you, they only present you things that they like please put forward citizen journalism, get your phones out, have a look at what happened here record and distribute it because you are the best person to explain yourself to others tell your moms and dads: this is definitely not an environment of terror, of chaos anymore."
"We are really peaceful here, get out and come here, let your parents leave behind the trauma of 80s behind make them let us live the beauties of the generation of 68"
"I love all of you in a true way because there is so much love here, it is enough for us all."
"All those who don't feel close to a political organisation or party and can't decide where to be, finally found a place to speak and for this reason everyone is here finally..."
"I was also apolitical, or maybe not apolitical but not organised because I never felt close to anywhere and the public is here really"
"I am grateful to the youth, they taught us something"
Previously I was irritated by the new generation because they were constantly in front of their screens
"I told them to get out, to contact people...I used to tell this to my daughter, to my nephews but they taught us they really taught us... they led us old people and I'm really happy because they taught us something.."

What I would like to do is describe an imaginary or fictitious bitcoin transaction and then talk about how somebody might try to game or defraud this system and why it's mathematically hard to do but why there is actually an economic incentive in the Bitcoin system for different people to behave honestly.
Let's suppose that there is someone out there named Dan.
Dan wants to order a cheese pizza from Pete's Pizza Shop.
Let's say that Pete's Pizza Shop accepts bitcoins as payment and that it costs 1 BTC for a pizza pie.
Imagine that Dan previously received 5 BTC from his cousin Carol.
"So, Carol, laballed by ""C"", gave to Dan 5 BTC, which we can label as a ""B"" with a circle around it."
He wants to use one of these 5 bitcoins to buy a pizza from Pete.
What Dan's bitcoin client will do is it will create a transaction record that includes information about how Dan got these bitcoins.
"So, in this case it includes information about this transaction between Carol, who we've marked by ""C"" and Dan for 5 bitcoins."
Then it specifies that Dan wants to give one of these bitcoins to Pete...
"We will label Pere by ""P"". ...and also that Dan is going to take the remaining 4 bitcoins and that will be basically change to himself."
The way that bitcoin is built is that you have to actually specify the change.
Whatever goes into the bitcoin system has to come out at the other end.
"So, you can't have a transaction with the numbers on and up."
Whatever is remaining is either change or part of it can be used a a transaction fee and so on.
"For this example, to keep things simple,"
I'll assume that there is no transaction fee in place.
The transaction fee is just zero.
We'll focus only on the situation in which everything is being accounted for in the transaction.
This transaction record is going to be boradcast out to the entire Bitcoin world.
"In particular, Pete is going to receive a copy of this transaction."
"But in addition to Pete receiving it, so too will the other people on the Bitcoin system."
"If you recall, there are these special nodes, these special entities or people in Bitcoin that are known as bitcoin miners."
These bitcoin miners are going to be responsible for making sure that everything checks out in the transaction from a global perspective.
"What they do is they look at the full record of transaction and this transaction record is public, it's known as the transaction block chain..."
Chess databases.
"Chess databases do not actually play. They give access to the recorded history of master chess. There are two components. First, there is the software, which lets one search and organise the database material. Then there is the actual database, typically one to four million games."
"In practice, databases are used for two purposes. First, for a player to train his/her ability at specific openings. Second, to look up specific opponents to see what they play, and prepare against them beforehand."
The existence of chess databases is one way that young players can achieve mastery at an early age.
ChessBase.
"ChessBase is the biggest database, and widely used by masters. Although it can be used online, most users download the software and data onto their laptop. Then they take the laptop to tournaments, to help prepare for games. Players may not use computers or any other aid during games, but much preparation goes on behind the scenes. ChessBase has to be purchased, and it is not cheap."
New in Chess.
"This is a Dutch magazine for advanced players, which runs an on-line database called NicBase as part of its services. NicBase is free, and has over a million games."
Chessgames.
"Chessgames.com runs an on-line database of games. It is partly free, but requires registration. Full access to all its facilities is by a fairly modest subscription. It has over half a million games on its database."
On-line playing sites.
"There are websites which a player can join (for a fee) and play on line. In this case, the subscriber will play against other subscribers, not a computer. All standards of players are amongst the members, and various events are on offer at different rates of play. The two leaders in this market are:"

A prime number is a natural number which has only two divisors: 1 and itself.
Highly composite numbers.
"A highly composite number is a natural number that has more divisors than any smaller natural number. They are used a lot in geometry, grouping, and time measurement."
The first 20 highly composite numbers are:
"1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, 7560"
Perfect numbers.
A perfect number is an integer that is the sum of its positive divisors (all divisors except itself).
The first 10 perfect numbers:
Integers.
"Integers are a set of numbers. They usually are in arithmetic and number theory. There are many subsets of integers. These can cover natural numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, etc."
Popular integers are −1 and 0.
Orders of magnitude.
"Integers can be written in orders of magnitude. This can be written as 10""k"", where ""k"" is an integer. If ""k"" = 0, 1, 2, 3, then the powers of ten for them are 1, 10, 100 and 1000. This is used in scientific notation."
"Each number has its own prefix. Each prefix has its own symbol. For example, ""kilo-"" may be added to the beginning of ""gram."" This changes the meaning of ""gram"" to mean that the gram is 1000 times more than a gram: one kilogram is the same as 1000 grams."
Rational numbers.
"A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction with two integers. The numerator is written as and the denominator(which cannot be zero) is written as . Every integer is a rational number. This is because in integers, 1 is always the denominator of a fraction."
"Rational numbers can be written in infinitely many ways. For example, 0.12 can be written as ""three twenty-fifths"" (), ""nine seventy-fifths"" (), etc."
Irrational numbers.
Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. These are written as algebraic numbers or transcendental numbers.
Real numbers.
The real numbers are a superset(or category) of numbers. They cover algebraic and transcendental numbers.
Hypercomplex numbers.
A hypercomplex number is a word for an element of a unital algebra over the field of real numbers.
Transfinite numbers.
"Transfinite numbers are numbers that are ""infinite"". They are larger than any finite number. They are, however, not absolutely infinite."
Physical Constants.
Physical constants are constants that can be used in the universe to figure out information.

Beriberi
Beriberi (also called vitamin B1 deficiency) is a disease of the nervous system. It happens when a person does not get enough thiamine (vitamin B1) in their diet.
"Thiamine helps the body turn food into energy. People need thiamine for good brain function and a healthy liver, skin, hair, and eyes. It also helps the nervous system work properly."
"Without enough thiamine, a person’s body cannot create all the energy the person needs. As a result, people with beriberi have severe lethargy and feel exhausted. Beriberi can also cause muscles to get weaker. These symptoms can make it hard for a person to do simple things."
Some people with beriberi have heart problems or even die. Beriberi can also cause problems with the gastrointestinal system.
"Most people get enough vitamin B1 in their regular diet. However, some groups are more likely to get beriberi. These include people who drink a lot of alcohol and people who eat an unhealthy or unbalanced diet, like a diet of mostly white rice."
There are two kinds of beriberi: wet and dry. Wet beriberi mainly affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi affects the nervous system. There is also a rare type of genetic beriberi.
"Most of the time, dry beriberi and wet beriberi happen at the same time in the same person. When this takes place, the victim is likely to only get the symptoms of one beriberi."
Île-de-Bréhat
Île-de-Bréhat is an island and a commune. It is found in the region Bretagne in the Côtes-d'Armor department in the west of France.

"IGN also features a popular message board, with a lot of members."
Sock
"Socks are often worn on a person's feet. They absorb sweat and help to keep the foot dry. Socks also give comfort to people's feet and keep them warm in cold weather. They are usually made of cotton or wool. Some socks can cover only the foot and ankle, and others may be long enough to cover the entire lower leg up to the knee. Toe socks are socks that wrap each toe separate from the others. Socks can be worn on the feet. Socks come in an array of different colors. Generally, white socks are worn for everyday or athletic use, and dark socks (black, brown, gray, or navy blue) are worn with business or formal wears. Some dress socks have patterns on them; these are called ""argyles""."
Phone socks.
"People often refer to sleeves that cover phones as 'socks'. These come in many different forms, colourful or plain. They help to protect the mobile phone whilst also being a stylish addition. Not many people use phone socks anymore because they seem to be old and out of use however some people still prefer to use them"
Everybody Loves Raymond
Everybody Loves Raymond is an American television series. It stars Ray Romano. The series was a popular sitcom on the CBS network.
Overview.
"Ray Romano plays Ray Barone, a sports writer in Lynbrook, New York. Patricia Heaton plays his wife, Debra. Ray and Deborah have a fun set of neighbors: Ray's parents. Robert, Ray's ""loser"" brother, is a police officer, and is very unlucky in love. By the end of season seven, however, he marries a woman named Amy. The show aired from September 13, 1996 to May 16, 2005."
Lighthouse
"A lighthouse is a tall building that sends out light for use in navigation. Lighthouses are built on the coast of an ocean or lake. The lighthouse protects ships from crashing into shore, by sending the light out towards the sea. When sailors see the light, they know to avoid hitting the shore. The light usually turns in a circle so that ships see a flashing light. The light is usually covered by a Fresnel lens. This lens enables the light to travel a far distance."
"One of the most famous lighthouses was the Lighthouse of Alexandria. It was on an island near the coast. That island was called ""Pharos"". Even today, in many languages, the word for ""lighthouse"" comes from the name of the island."
Almost all lighthouses are automatic now.
Joan of Arcadia
"Joan of Arcadia was a CBS drama television series. It starred Amber Tamblyn. Tamblyn's character was Joan Girardi, a teenager with the ability to talk to God."
"In its second season, the show had 8.5 million viewers per episode. However, after declining ratings the show was canceled. A third season was never made."
Lunchbox
A lunchbox is used to carry a person's lunch. They can come in many shapes and sizes and by a number of manufacturers. They can also be in the form of a brown paper bag.
The first aluminium lunch box was created in 1954 by a man by the name of Leo May when he happened to crush his tin lunch box.
The Game of Life
"The Game of Life is a popular board game. Players spin a spinner, which tells them where to go next. They then go through an imaginary ""life,"" getting married and having kids. The object of the game is to have more money than the other players by the end of the game."

Petroleum coke
"Petroleum coke is a solid that is mainly made of carbon. It is similar to coke, but it is gotten from petroleum (coke is made from coal). Petroleum coke can be used as an industrial fuel, but there are very toxic by-products based on nickel and vanadium which make this a problem. Petroleum coke is also used in the aluminum industry, and in the heat treatment of steel and iron. Petroleum coke may be kept in a pile near an oil refinery ready for sale."
Types.
"There are four types of petroleum coke. They are: needle coke, honeycomb coke, sponge coke and shot coke. Different types of petroleum coke have different properties and microstructures."
Needle coke is a crystalline petroleum coke. It is also called acicular coke. It is used in making electrodes for the steel and aluminium industries. Needle coke is made only from either fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) decant oil or coal tar pitch.
"Honeycomb coke is an intermediate coke. Compared to needle coke, honeycomb coke has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion and a lower electrical conductivity."
Composition.
"The chemicals inside petroleum coke depends on the petroleum feed stock used. It is mainly always made of carbon. It is also sometimes made up of hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and so on."
"Dalton Philips is the current head. The old CEO was Marc Bolland, who left to become CEO of Marks &amp; Spencer."
"As of September 2009, Morrisons has 455 shops in the United Kingdom."
"On 15 March 2007, Morrisons said that it would stop its old branding and go for a more modern brand image. Their lower price brand, ""Bettabuy"", was also changed to a more modern brand called the ""Morrisons Value"". This brand was then changed again in 2012 as Morrisons started their low price option brand called ""M Savers""."
In 2005 Morrisons bought part of the old Rathbones Bakeries for £15.5 million which make Rathbones and Morrisons bread.
"In 2011, Morrisons opened a new 767,500 square/foot centre in Bridgwater for a £11 million redevelopment project. This project also made 200 new jobs."
Dermal bone
"A dermal bone (membrane bone) is a bony structure that is part of the intramembranous ossification (the bone that helps fetus development in mammals). It is part of the vertebrate skeleton. These include the skull, jaws, gills, fins and exoskeleton."
Orange-thighed frog
"The orange-thighed frog, northern orange-eyed frog or lime tree frog (""Litoria xanthomera"") is a species of tree frogs. They live in tropical places in Queensland, Australia. They are green with orange eyes. They also look like the red-eyed tree frog. The orange-thighed frog is a medium-sized tree frog. They can reach up to 5.5 centimeters in length. It is a skinny frog with a thin body, flat head and large orange eyes."
"This frog lives in rainforests where the trees are close together. It spends almost all its time high in the trees. It only comes down from the tree to look for mates and lay eggs. Male orange-thighed frogs gather in groups in ponds. They call for a mate from branches or on the edge of the water. Their call is a long ""aaa-rk"". They mate with females after a heavy rainfall. Their eggs are brown and the female can lay from 800 to 1600 eggs. The orange-thighed frog's tadpole are similar to the red-eyed tree frogs."
"This frog was in danger because human beings would cut down its forests to take the wood to build things. Now, people visiting their forests for fun is a larger problem."
Discoglossidae
Discoglossidae is a family of frogs. They are commonly known as the Disc-Tongued Frogs. They live in Europe but some species have been found in Northeastern Africa. An extinct species of the Discoglossidae family used to live in Israel.
"The family has two genus. They include the ""Alytes"" and ""Discoglossus"". The ""Discoglossus"" frogs looks very alike to toads and can be found on land. The ""Alytes"" are more smoother and look more like frogs. They are seen in the water. All of the species of the Discoglossidae will lay their eggs in ponds and will turn into tadpoles."
Species.
"The genus ""Bombina"" and ""Barbourula"" also used to be under this family but have now been moved to the Bombinatoridae family,"
Family Discoglossidae
Enneabatrachus hechti
"Enneabatrachus hechti is an extinct species of an extinct genus of prehistoric frogs. They lived during the late Jurassic period. There has been many fossils found of them. There was one found in Como Bluff, Wyoming. They are part of the family Discoglossidae. The specimen found in Wyoming was only a few millimeters long."
Bufonidae
"Bufonidae is a family of the ""true toads"". The family has 35 genus. The Bufonidae toads are found almost everywhere and are well known. True toads can be found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. They can be found in rain forest. They lay their eggs in strings. They will hatch and become tadpoles. However, the genus ""Nectophrynoides"", their young will not develop from a tadpole stage."
True toads do not have any tooth. Their skin looks like warts. They have a pair of parotoid glands on the back of their heads. These glands has alkaloid poison. They get this type of poison from stress. They have also other toxins such as Bufotoxin. Male toads has a Bidder's organ. The organ will become an active ovary if conditions are right. They will then become a female.
Taxonomy.
Bufonidae has about 500 species among 37 genus.
Sirenidae
Sirenidae or sirens is a family of aquatic salamanders. They have very small front legs and do not have back legs. They have gills for breathing. Sirens are found only in the southeastern United States and northern Mexico.
"The parotoid gland is a skin gland on the back, neck and shoulder of toads and some frogs and salamanders. It's secretes has a substance that predators can smell. This smell will tell them that they are toxic animals. The substance, bufotoxin, acts as a nuerotoxin."
"Parotoid glands looks like warts on an amphibian skin. However, warts are grown by viral infections. Parotoid glands are normal and healthy parts of the animals that have them. Many people believe that touching a toad may cause warts. However, this is not true."
Mole salamander
"Mole salamanders are member of the genus ""Ambystoma"". They are a group of animals that live in North America. They are the only genus in the family Ambystomatidae. The Axolotl (""Ambystoma mexicanum"") is a popular exotic pet. They are also used in research. The Tiger Salamander (""Ambystoma tigrinum"") is an official amphibian of many US states. They are also sold as pets."
Rib
"A rib is a bone that forms a structure around the thorax of vertebrates. This is known as the rib cage. Humans have 24 ribs, 12 on each side."
"It is a common urban legend that male humans have one fewer pair of ribs than female humans. However, this is not true. This came from the Christian bible explaining the creation of Eve from the rib of Adam."
Taricha
"Taricha is a genus of newts. There are only three species and four subspecies. They are called western newts and Pacific newts. All newts are part of the family Salamandridae. The three species in this genus are California newt, the rough-skinned newt and the red bellied newt. They are all found on the west coast of the United States."
Species.
"Genus ""Taricha"" (Western Newts / Pacific Newts) - 3 species"
Lungless salamander
"The Plethodontidae is a family of lungless salamanders. They are the largest groups of salamanders. They probably evolved in North America, where there are 14 genera and about 150 species. Only one species is in Europe: it is ""Speleomantes"", the cave salamander."
"Most of them are terrestrial and are active in daytime. Lungless salamanders may communicate with their nose.p168 Slender salamanders are found in the Pacific Coast. They are sometimes called ""worm salamanders"". This is because they have slimmer (skinny) bodies than most salamanders.p182 If touched, slender salamanders will bounce on the ground and then run away."
Irritation
Irritation in biology is a state of inflammation or painful reaction to allergy or cell damage. The skin and the eyes may turn red.

Sexual assault charges.
"As of December 30, 2015, numerous civil lawsuits are active against Cosby, and he faces one felony charge of aggravated indecent assault in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania; a warrant was issued for his arrest. This charge is based on the 2005 allegations of a January 2004 incident. He was released on a $1 million dollar bail later that day."
"In 2014, Cosby was set to release his new standup special ""Bill Cosby 77"" on Netflix. The release of the film was canceled due to allegations of sexual assault against Cosby."
"Cosby's trial started on June 5, 2017. He was found guilty of three counts of assault on April 26, 2018, and was sentenced to 3–10 years in prison in late September 2018. He used lawyer Thomas Mesereau."
"Cosby got out of prison on 30 June 2021, because the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found that the justice system had made a mistake in the process of convicting him. In 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States decided to not hear the case about Cosby getting out of prison."
Awards and honors.
Honorary degrees.
Cosby has been awarded at least 57 honorary degrees since 1985. Several of these honorary degrees have been rescinded due to allegations of sexual assault and/or immoral behavior:
Ham
Ham is pork that comes from a leg of a pig.
Ham can be dry-cured or wet-cured. Dry-cured ham is made by rubbing the meat with salt. Wet-cured ham is made with brine.
Types of dry-cured ham:
Ham is used in SPAM.
Spam (food)
"Spam is a canned meat food made by the Hormel Foods Corporation. It is made from pork shoulder meat and ham. Spam Lite, a newer kind of Spam, is made with pork and chicken."
"There have been many ideas about what the word ""Spam"" means. The Hormel Foods Corporation once said that it means ""Shoulder of Pork and Ham"", but in some dictionaries ""Spam"" means ""spiced ham""."
Members of staff at the SPAM museum say it stands for Specially Produced American Meat.
"In 2019, Spam began making advertisements containing the definition “Sizzle Pork And Mmmm”."
"Spam was used a lot in World War II, as there wasn't proper meat. Because of that, spam was used as a rationed item."
Mushroom
"A mushroom (also called a toadstool) is the part of a fungus that is comparable to the fruit of a plant. Unlike plants, mushrooms do not use sunlight to generate energy for themselves. Some mushrooms are edible, and are used for cooking in many countries, such as China, Korea and Europe. Other mushrooms, however, are poisonous, and can cause severe illness or death if eaten. People who search for edible mushrooms are called ""mycophagists"", meaning ""mushroom eater"", while the act itself is called ""mushrooming"". Mushrooms have been known to support bone health and to regulate blood sugar in diabetics. It is available in Different colours and Shapes."
Structure of mushrooms.
"Most mushrooms have a stem and a cap. The bottom of the cap sometimes has gills to hold spores, and sometimes holds the spores themselves."
Factorization
Factorization (also called factorisation and factoring) is taking a composite number apart into numbers that multiply together to get the original number. These smaller numbers are called factors or divisors. 1 is a factor of all numbers.
"Prime factorization is breaking apart a composite numbers into prime numbers that can be multiplied to give the larger number. Note that since 1 is not prime, it is not included in the prime factorization."
"For example, 12 can be factored as 4 × 3. Since 4 is not a prime number, that is not its prime factorization. 12's prime factorization is in fact 3 × 2 × 2."
"The numbers which are obtained from the factorization are usually ordered, for example, starting with the smallest number. For example, 72=2^3*3^2. The factorization of every number is unique. This generalizes to:"
Personal life.
"Married three times, his last wife was a former fan, who met him when she made a documentary about his life and career. One of his later supporters was radio talk show host Howard Stern. Tiny Tim died in 1996, after suffering a heart attack during a performance."
Kelvin
"The Kelvin scale (symbol: K) is the SI unit of temperature. It is named in honour of the physicist William Thomson, the first Lord Kelvin (1824–1907)."
0 degree Celsius = 273 kelvin
Definition.
"The Kelvin scale is defined by a specific relationship between the pressure of a gas and the temperature. This says that ""the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to the temperature in Kelvin"". This means that Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, and scientists use this scale more than any other."
"The kelvin is a base SI unit of measurement, since 2018 defined by setting the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant ""k"" to 1.380649×10−23 J⋅K−1."
"The temperature of the triple point of water is a hundredth of a degree Celsius above the freezing point, or 0.01 °C. The coldest possible temperature is called absolute zero and is equal to -273.15 degrees Celsius, or zero kelvin (0 K). By writing temperatures in kelvins one does not need to use negative numbers."
The absolute temperature scale was designed so that a change in temperature of 1 kelvin is equal to a change of 1 degree Celsius. This means that it is easy to convert a temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvin.
"It is important to notice that the name of this unit is simply ""kelvin"" (with a lowercase initial), not ""degree Kelvin"". In English, it undergoes normal plural inflection as ""kelvins"". For example, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen is 77 kelvins."
"In everyday use, the kelvin is most commonly used to measure very low or very high temperatures, such as the temperature of liquid nitrogen or the temperature of a light bulb filament."
Tourism
"Tourism means people traveling for fun and adventure . It includes activities such as sightseeing and camping. People who travel for fun are called ""tourists"". Places where many tourists stay are sometimes called ""resorts"". Places that people go to for tourism are called tourist destinations."
There are many reasons why people travel for fun:
The tourism industry.
The tourism industry has different parts. Some of these are:
Package tour operators can offer all these services to a group who will go together. This can be cheaper than paying for them separately.
Damage tourism can bring.
"Tourism can bring damage to the local area, and/or the tourists. Litter, scuba-diving and deforestation are problems for popular places such as St. Lucia, Hawaii and others. Scuba-diving can damage coral reefs which are home to hundreds of species of sea animals. Tourism can change culture when people learn each other's ways, and certain local traditions are being put aside for tourists."
Berkshire
"Berkshire is a county in southeast England. It is west of London. Its county town is Reading. In the past, a town named Abingdon was the county town, but this town is not in Berkshire any more."
Berkshire is also known as the Royal County of Berkshire.
"Cities, towns and villages."
"The towns below are not part of Berkshire now, but were in the past."
Buckinghamshire
"Buckinghamshire (abbreviated Bucks) is a county in central England, near the south and London. The county town is named Aylesbury."
"Cities, towns and villages."

Chess notation
"Chess notation is a method for writing down chess moves: after a player makes a move, both players write it down. This is compulsory in all organized chess events"
"The system must have these elements: the move number, the piece moved, the square it starts from (optional), the square it goes to, and other relevant information such as captures, and castles.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;p275 There are other notations for recording positions."
"There have been ways of describing moves from quite early on. Manuscripts with move descriptions are known in Arabic (9th century) and from Europe (13th century).p275 These early notations are usually quite cumbersome; ""The pawn of the king forward two houses"".p229; 469; 848 This kind of notation is called ""descriptive"". In a descriptive notation each player describes squares from his own point of view, e.g. 1 P–K4 P–K4. A notation which uses labels for the ranks and files is called ""algebraic"". In this notation a square has only one label, e.g. 1 e4 e5."
Algebraic notation.
"The moves of a chess game are written down by using a special notation.Article 8 and Appendix E Usually algebraic chess notation is used. In algebraic notation, each square has one and only one name (whether you are looking from White's side of the board or Black's). Here, moves are written in the format of: abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved. For example, Qg5 means ""queen moves to the g-file and 5th rank"" (that is, to the square g5). If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is added to show the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. Ngf3 means ""knight from the g-file moves to the square f3"". The letter P showing a pawn is not used, so that e4 means ""pawn moves to the square ""e4""""."
"If the piece makes a capture, ""x"" is written before the square in which the capturing piece lands on. Example: ""Bxf3"" means ""bishop captures on f3"". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the Pawn left is used in place of a piece initial. For example: exd5 means ""pawn captures on d5."""
"If a pawn moves to its eighth rank, getting a promotion, the piece chosen is written after the move, for example e1Q or e1=Q. Castling is written by the special notations 0–0 for kingside castling and 0–0–0 for queenside. A move which places the opponent's king in check normally has the notation ""+"" added. Checkmate can be written as # or ++. At the end of the game, 1–0 means ""White won"", 0–1 means ""Black won"" and ½-½ is a draw."
"Chess moves can also be shown with punctuation marks and other annotation symbols. For example: ! means a good move, !! means a very good move, ? means a bad move, ?? a very bad move (sometimes called a ""blunder""), !? a creative move that may be good, and ?! a doubtful move. For example, one kind of a simple ""trap"" known as the Scholar's mate, as in the diagram to the right, may be recorded in full notation:"
Problem signs.
"Unintentional weight loss is when a person loses weight without trying. It can be a symptom of some types of cancer. Stress can cause unintentional weight loss. Stress can come from divorce, changing jobs or over the loss of a loved one. Once the stress is removed and the person feels happier again, the weight may return to normal. Depression may also cause weight loss. Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia can cause significant weight loss. These disorders usually require the help of health care professionals."
Sleeping.
"Getting enough sleep helps to avoid gaining excess weight. Over time, getting more sleep can help a person to lose weight. The main reason is not getting enough sleep leaves a person tired during the day and prone to eating more food. Getting enough sleep helps in maintaining healthy eating habits."
With every breath.
"Without going to the bathroom, a person naturally loses over while they sleep at night. One reason is humans breathe in oxygen but breathes out carbon dioxide. That is breathing in one molecule of Oxygen for every two molecules of carbon each time they breathe out. A molecule of carbon does not weigh much by itself, but given that with each breath twenty billion-trillion molecules are expelled, over a 7-8 hour period that adds up to over a pound of carbon. Normal perspiration occurs while sleeping but usually only causes a small amount of water weight loss."
Your body also burns calories while you sleep.
Diet vs exercise.
"It is well known that lean mass (muscle and bone) burn more energy than fat. Even at rest, a body with more muscle tissue will burn more calories."
Exercise alone can be effective in weight loss. Several studies found similar results. The comparison between dieting and exercising found both resulted in weight loss. The conclusion was that using both diet and exercise together was the most effective method of weight loss and in maintaining a healthy body.
Shere Bangla National Stadium
"Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium or Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium (SBNS)' is a cricket stadium in Bangladesh. Some times it is called Mirpur Stadium. It is in Mirpur of Dhaka. It can hold 26.000 people at a time. It was built in 2006. It was named after Sher-e-Bangla A. K. Fazlul Huq ""The tiger of Bangla""."
"The stadium has hosted Bangladesh's first class, test, ODI, twenty20 and women's cricket matches. It also hosted international matches like ICC World Cup, Asia Cup etc."
Facilities.
The ground is a state of the art stadium. It is considered one of the best grounds in the subcontinent. Its most striking and interesting part is its modern drainage. The ground was originally built for football and athletics. For this reason it was built in rectangular shape. But when it was shifted for cricket it was fixed to oval for cricket. The ground was fitted with floodlights on 2009. it is able to host Day/night cricket matches.
First test and ODI.
"he ground hosted its first Test match on 25 May 2007. It was a test match between Bangladesh and India. It hosted it's first ODI on December 8, 2006. The match was played by Bangladesh and Zimbabwe."
2011 Cricket World Cup.
The stadium hosted 4 group matches and 2 quarter finals during the 2011 Cricket World Cup.
"Asia Cup, 2012."
Bangladesh hosted the 12th edition of the Asia Cup. Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium hosted those matches.
Sportsbook
"In the United States of America a sportsbook is a place where a player can bet money on many different sports, for example basketball, golf, football, hockey, baseball, soccer, horse racing, boxing and many more."
"A bet is when a person thinks that a particular team/contestant will win a competition and gives some money. If he wins the bet - he will receive his money back with some monetary prize. If his team/contestant loses, he will not get his money back."
"The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 allows only Nevada, Oregon, Montana, and Delaware to legally bet on sports."
"There are more Sportbooks that allow betting online or through mobile. With better availability and lower minimum bets, the whole industry is rapidly growing."
Before placing a bet a person should read the terms and conditions of the sportsbook to avoid any problems.

A paid or incentivized survey is a type of survey where person for filling out the details will get some reward.
Description.
The house sparrow is small bird. It is between 14–18 centimeters (5.5–7.1 in) long. It weighs between 24–39.5 grams (0.85–1.4 oz). Females are smaller than males.
"Male and female house sparrows are different colors. The male is brown, gray and white. It has a black throat. The female and young house sparrows are brown and dark yellow or cream. They have streaks (stripes) on their heads and wings."
Habitat.
"The house sparrow lives close to humans, often near human houses in towns or cities. It also lives near farms and makes a nest in a bush or small tree. It can have two or three broods per year. This means it has two or three sets of eggs and chicks each year."
"Nest sites are varied, though cavities are preferred. Nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used.p52–57 A sparrow sometimes digs out its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches. More often it uses the nests of other birds, such swallows' nests in banks and cliffs, and old tree nest holes. It often uses deserted nests. Sometimes it takes over active nests by driving away or killing the occupants. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe. This puts the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters so the native bird population declines."
Conservation.
"The number of house sparrows in the United Kingdom has gone down, perhaps because their hedgerow habitat has shrunk. They are now 'endangered' in the United Kingdom. However, in other countries, the bird is still very common. Hedges are necessary to the bird because predators cannot usually get at their nests. They would have no defence against magpies (for example) if face-to-face."
Sparrows in Mao's China.
"Sparrows eat some grain. So Mao decided that sparrows should be eliminated in China. The result was a disastrous famine, with grain yields a fraction of what went before. Apparently no-one knew enough about sparrows. They are major predators of locusts. With few sparrows, locusts thrived and ate much of the wheat. It is difficult in an autocracy to tell leaders they are wrong."
Couch
"A couch, sofa or settee is a kind of furniture that is designed to seat more than one person. It usually has a place to rest your arm on each side. Couches are normally found in the living room or in front of the TV."
"In the 17th and 18th centuries, a couch was thought as a long, upward seat for resting on. One end would slope up high enough to provide a place for the head to rest."
"Some late 18th-century kinds of couches had an arm running partly down one side, and this type continued to be made in England. In Greek places, there were flowing designs with all kind of elegant colors. Many of them had scrolled ends and short legs. The couch was later taken over by the overstuffed sofa during the Victorian age."
Expression.
"Because the couch is usually set in front of the TV, it is the main place where people usually sit and watch it. Lazy people would eventually seem to be stuck to it all the time. This person, a person who does not do a lot of physical activity, was called a ""couch potato"". This was also because potatoes do not move at all, and does not do anything but just sits there. This may also be considered as slang. Couch came from the word ""couche"", which means, ""a bed, lair,"" or from the word ""coucher"", which means ""to lie down."""
Types.
"The most common types of couches in homes are the ""love seats"" for two, or the ""sofa"" for more than two. Other couches include the ""divan"" or the ""fainting couch"", which usually does not have a back. Couches are usually bought in a set together with cushions, which give them a bouncey and decorative comfortable touch."
Jena Lee
"Jena Lee (born 29 July, 1987 in Chile) is a French singer."
"She was adopted by a French family at the age of nine months. In 2007, Jena Lee met Sulee B Wax, who was interested in her work. At this point in time Lee wrote the song ""Some Share"". The song was used in an album by Sherifa Luna. Jena Lee wrote six out of the thirteen songs that are on Sherifa Luna's album."
"In 2008, Jena Lee won the Urban Music Nation contest by Skyrock. Her first single ""J'aimerais Tellement"" was released in April 2009 along with a music video. It was at the top of the French single charts for eleven weeks. It had the highest number of downloads in November 2009."
Sinik
Sinik (real name Thomas Gerard Idir; born on 26 June 1980) is a famous French rapper. His parents are Algerian. Thomas was four years old when his parents moved to Bergères in France.
Porridge
"Porridge is a food which is made with a cereal, usually oats. The oats are boiled in water or milk, or both. It is usually served hot in a bowl or dish. Some people add things to their porridge such as sugar or syrup. In Scotland salt is often added."
"Porridge is a traditional food in many countries in Northern Europe. It is usually eaten for breakfast. In some countries barley or other grains may be used. Porridge is cooked in saucepans or in a microwave. Traditionally, it was cooked in large metal kettles over hot coals. Porridge was often served as food for prisoners in prisons. This is why in English there is a slang expression ""doing porridge"" which means ""being in prison"". Porridge is also given to people who are ill because it is healthy and easy to eat and digest."
"Semolina and gruel are foods which are quite similar to porridge. Semolina is usually served as a pudding. Gruel is a thinner version of porridge that may be also drunk and may not need to be cooked. Oliver Twist, in the famous book by Charles Dickens, was given gruel to eat."
"In 2008, Lee ran for a seat in the National Assembly. She was the first North Korean defector to do this."
"In 2009, Lee started the Hana Defector Women's Organization. The NGO helps North Korean women who live in South Korea. The women receive job training, childcare, help with education, and human rights training."
Lee became the head of the North Korean Traditional Food Institute in 2012. The institute tries to bring North and South Korea closer together. It gives vocational training to North Korean defectors. It also teaches about the food traditions of Pyongyang.
"Also in 2012, Lee led an 18-day hunger strike in front of the Chinese embassy. Lee protested against China, because they wanted to send North Korean refugees back to North Korea."
Awards.
Lee received a 2010 International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. Department of State.
Wasted username
A wasted username or wasted account is a user account on a website that was not used very much (or at all) after it was made. A person who makes an account like this is called a namewaster or a name waster.
"This word came from YouTube, where many people would post both funny and hateful comments on namewasters' YouTube channels. This was an Internet phenomenon until 2012, when YouTube deleted a lot of these wasted accounts."
Chain mail
"Mail, or chain mail, is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour. Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest."
Etymology.
"The origins* of the word ""mail"" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word ""macula"", meaning ""spot"" or ""opacity"". Another theory relates the word to the Old French ""maillier"", meaning “to hammer” (related to the modern English word ""malleable""). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders."
History.
"Many scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC. At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe. The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead. Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time-consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship. Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century."
Modern uses.
Mail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters. Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks. But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular with history reenactors. It is also popular in live action role playing.
Afar Triangle
The Afar Triangle (or Afar Depression) is a low area bordering on the Red Sea. It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.
"The area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia."
Human fossils.
Important fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans.
"Many important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna."
Geography.
"The Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509 ft) below sea level."
"The Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth."
"The Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map."
Plate tectonics.
"The Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt."

Scuttled by PBS.
"The movie was approved for national broadcast in 1985, but that decision was rejected a year later. Many people believe that was censorship. B.J.Bullert commented that the PBS/KQED decision ""robbed a national public television audience"" . He extrapolates this critical remark to the media across the board and its failure to focus public attention on the putative biological hazard of nuclear power."
Critics.
"B.J. Bullert, in his book ""Public Television: Politics and the Battle over Documentary Film"" protested what he viewed as censorship. He stated that Dark Circle was outside of the mainstream at that time but now the viewpoint in the movie is widely accepted. Nat Katzman, former KQED station manager, disagreed. He is quoted in Bullert's book, saying ""It's more difficult to say (""Dark Circle"") falsified anything, but it left one with the uncomfortable feeling that this is propaganda, not journalism""."
Point of view.
"The movie is clearly created to raise public alarm about the hazards of nuclear power. It is also about problems at the regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). However, there are numerous points in the movie in which the voices heard are those of the workers. We also hear from the Pacific Gas and Electric management, and the lawyer for the NRC."

Tulle
"Tulle () is a French commune, the ""prefecture"" of the Corrèze department in central France. It is in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. It is also the capital of the ""arrondissement"" of Tulle."
Geography.
"Tulle is in the valley of the Corrèze river at the confluence of this river with several tributaries: the Solane and the Céronne on the right side, and Saint-Bonnette and Montane on the left side. The city is in narrow part of the valley along several Kilometres."
"The ""commune"" of Tulle has an area of , and its average altitude is ; at the city hall, the altitude is ."
"The ""commune"" of Tulle is surrounded by the ""communes"":"
"Three rivers flow through the ""commune""ː the river Diège (the town sometimes is called ""Ussel-sur-Diège""), the river Sarsonne and the stream ""Étang Roux""."
Climate.
"The climate of Tulle, in the Köppen climate classification, is Cfb - Oceanic climate with template summers."
"The Couesnon, the Sée and the Sélune form part of the complex water system of the bay of Mont Saint-Michel. On one side, the tide brings lots of sediment. This causes large sandbars within the river. On the other side, the three rivers bring the sediment back to sea."
"In the 20th century, the Couesnon was made into a canal. This to reduced the erosion of its banks. In 1969, a dam was built. These changes, and the causeway linking Mont Saint-Michel to the mainland, have made mudflats. The French built a bridge to replace the causeway. It was finished in 2013. This helped to remove the silt."
"During spring tides, a tidal bore — a wave caused by the tide rising — can be seen going up the river."
The Couesnon flows through the following departments and towns:
Hydrology and water quality.
"In the summer, the water flow is typically in the range of . The pH has been measured at 8.26 (Hogan, 2006). The temperature of the water is 19 degrees Celsius in summer, in the area of the mouth. Water turbidity is moderate with a Secchi disc reading of 14 centimetres. Electrical conductivity at the mouth is high."
Samoa Joe
"Nuufolau Joel ""Joe"" Seanoa (born March 17, 1979) is an American professional wrestler. He currently works for WWE on the Raw brand under the ring name, Samoa Joe."
"He also wrestled for Ring of Honor (ROH) 2002 to 2007. During his time in ROH, he held the ROH World Championship for a record 21 months."
Avranches
"Avranches is a commune in the Manche department. It is in the Lower Normandy region in northwestern France. It is a subprefecture of the department. The inhabitants are called ""Avranchinais""."
Geography.
Avranches is at the south of the Cotentin Peninsula.
"The town was built on high ground. It overlooks the dunes and coastal marshes along the bay. From Avranches, it is possible to see the Mont-Saint-Michel."
Schwarzschild radius
"The Schwarzschild radius (sometimes erroneously referred to as the gravitational radius), is the radius of a sphere that has certain properties: if all the mass of an object is compressed within this sphere, the escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. An example of an object smaller than its Schwarzschild radius is a black hole. Once a stellar remnant collapses below this radius, light can no longer escape and the object is no longer visible. It is a characteristic radius associated with every quantity of mass. The ""Schwarzschild radius"" was named after the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild who calculated this exact solution for the theory of general relativity in 1916."
This radius can be calculated using the equation:
formula_1
"where the gravitational constant G is N⋅m2/kg2, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light which is 299,792,458 m/s."
Derivation.
"The Schwarzschild radius is found within the Schwarzschild metric, and originally was used to describe the gravitational field around a black hole, given the assumptions that it is spherical, non-rotating, without a magnetic field, and that the cosmological constant is zero; (it describes the path of a particle moving through this spacetime) however, this radius can be calculated for any object."
Hong Seok-cheon
"Hong Seok-cheon (, born February 3, 1971) is a South Korean model and movie actor. In 1994, he was a reporter of KBS broadcast."
"in 1994, he was a repoter of KBS broadcast, next years he was enter a 1995 student's gag contest, prize third-class and debut actor. In September 2000, he was public coming out, that times he was more broadcasters and drama, film casting."
"so assault of more Koeran mass communication, but in 2002, he was comebacks success."
Amygdala
"The amygdala is an almond-shaped group of neurons. These groups of neurons in the brain are called ""nuclei""."
Exponentiation
"In mathematics, exponentiation (power) is an arithmetic operation on numbers. It can be thought of as repeated multiplication, just as multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition."
"In general, given two numbers formula_1 and formula_2, the exponentiation of formula_1 and formula_2 can be written as formula_5, and read as ""formula_1 raised to the power of formula_2"", or ""formula_1 to the formula_2th power"". Other methods of mathematical notation have been used in the past. When the upper index cannot be written, people can write powers using the ^ or ** signs, so that 2^4 or 2**4 means formula_10."
"Here, the number formula_1 is called base, and the number formula_2 is called exponent. For example, in formula_10, 2 is the base and 4 is the exponent."
"To calculate formula_10, one simply multiply 4 copies of 2. So formula_15, and the result is formula_16. The equation could be read out loud as ""2 raised to the power of 4 equals 16."""
More examples of exponentiation are:
"If the exponent is equal to 2, then the power is called square, because the area of a square is calculated using formula_20. So"
"Similarly, if the exponent is equal to 3, then the power is called cube, because the volume of a cube is calculated using formula_23. So"
"If the exponent is equal to -1, then the power is simply the reciprocal of the base. So"
"If the exponent is an integer less than 0, then the power is the reciprocal raised to the opposite exponent. For example:"
"If the exponent is equal to formula_28, then the result of exponentiation is the square root of the base, with formula_29 For example:"
"Similarly, if the exponent is formula_31, then the result is the nth root, where:"
"If the exponent is a rational number formula_33, then the result is the ""q""th root of the base raised to the power of ""p"":"
"In some cases, the exponent may not even be rational. To raise a base ""a"" to an irrational ""x""th power, we use an infinite sequence of rational numbers (""xn""), whose limit is x:"
like this:
There are some rules which make the calculation of exponents easier:
"It is possible to calculate exponentiation of matrices. In this case, the matrix must be square. For example, formula_44."
Commutativity.
"Both addition and multiplication are commutative. For example, 2+3 is the same as 3+2, and 2 · 3 is the same as 3 · 2. Although exponentiation is repeated multiplication, it is not commutative. For example, 2³=8, but 3²=9."
Inverse Operations.
"Addition has one inverse operation: subtraction. Also, multiplication has one inverse operation: division."
But exponentiation has two inverse operations: The root and the logarithm. This is the case because the exponentiation is not commutative. You can see this in this example:
Sega
"is a company that makes video games. In the past, they also made video game consoles. Their main office is in Tokyo, Japan. They also have offices in other continents – for example, North America and Europe. Their most famous video games are the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" series. Another famous Sega series is ""Streets of Rage""."
Consoles.
Sega Mega Drive / Sega Genesis 1988-2002.
"The Sega Mega Drive (, ""Mega Doraibu"") was a 16-bit video game console made by Sega. It was in market in Japan in (1988), and in Europe and the rest of the world in (1990). In North America, it was called ""Sega Genesis""."
Sega Mega CD / Sega CD 1991-1995.
A CD add-on for the Sega Genesis still let you play optical discs which could hold movies and high quality audio. It was not well received but has a strong base of fans.

Embroidery
"Embroidery is the art of decorating fabric or other materials with designs stitched in strands of thread or yarn using a needle. Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as metal strips, pearls, beads, quills, and sequins. Sewing machines can be used to create machine embroidery."
Qualifications.
"City and Guilds qualification in Embroidery allows embroiderers to become recognized for their skill. This qualification also gives them the credibility to teach. For example, the notable textiles artist, Kathleen Laurel Sage, began her teaching career by getting the City and Guilds Embroidery 1 and 2 qualifications. She has now gone on to write a book on the subject."
Style
Style may refer to:
Banquet
"A banquet is a large public meal or feast, complete with main dishes and desserts. It usually serves a purpose, such as a ceremony, or a celebration. Sometimes a banquet is made only of desserts."
Eccentricity
Eccentricity or extravagance is a word used to describe unusual behaviour in a person. People who have habits which many people think are very strange may be called eccentric. Eccentric behaviour is not necessarily good or bad in itself.
Some clever people (geniuses) have behaviour which might be described as eccentric. It is not always clear whether behaviour is just eccentric or whether it is madness.
"Famous people who were eccentric in their different ways include Albert Einstein, Nero, Alan Turing, Howard Hughes, Ludwig II of Bavaria and Lord Berners."
Květinov
"Květinov is a small village in the Havlíčkův Brod District, Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. 243 people live there. It covers 7,08 km². It was first documented in 1436."
Úsobí
"Úsobí is a village in the Havlíčkův Brod District, Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. 707 people live in Úsobí. It covers 12.97 km². It was first documented in 1307."
Conversation
"A conversation is two or more people talking about something. It is spontaneous, usually unplanned, though the people may have interests in common."
"Conversations are one of the basic types of human communication. They can be about any subject, and do not necessarily have any fixed purpose. They allow people with different views of a topic to learn from each other. A conversation may be contrasted with formal presentations. A talk or speech, for example is an oral presentation by one person directed at a group. It is basically a one-way communication."
"Conversations do not have to happen in person, they can happen over the telephone or on the Internet."
Banter.
"Banter is short witty sentences that bounce back and forth between individuals. Often banter uses clever put-downs and witty insults. It can contain misunderstandings (often intentional), zippy wisecracks, zingers, flirtation, and puns. The idea is each line of banter should ""top"" the one before it. It is a verbal war of wit without any physical contact."

Blasphemy
"Blasphemy is a word that means ""speaking badly about a religion"", or ""insulting a god"". Some religions see blasphemy as a religious crime. Many countries witha state religion have laws that make blasphemy a crime. For example, blasphemy can be punished with the death penalty in Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. In other countries, the punishment for the crime is a fine, or imprisonment."
"Some countries do not have laws against blasphemy. For example, after the French Revolution, France made blasphemy legal to make sure people would have freedom of religion and the freedom of the press."
"The United States, Canada, and many European countries, have laws to protect people who speak badly about religion. Sometimes people do this in a satirical way, like with a movie that makes fun of a religion. In these countries, profanity is often protected by freedom of speech as well."
Brie
"Brie is a type of soft cheese with a yellowish interior and a white layer (the ""rind"") on the outside of the cheese. The rind is eaten as well as the inside of this cheese. Like other cheeses, Brie is a dairy product made from cows' milk. Brie cheese may be served with fruit as a dessert at the end of a meal, or with a relish."
"The cheese is sometimes served slightly melted or baked, in a round, lidded ceramic dish, and topped with nuts or fruit, or both."
How it is made.
"Brie is a French cheese, and protected by AOC (""Appellation d'origine contrôlée""). This means only this cheese from this region (near Paris) can properly call itself ""brie"". This is ignored by some countries outside Europe, but the system of AOC is used in the wine business, so many parts of the world do honour it, and have similar arrangements."
"The milk of soft cheeses (""à pate molle"" in French) is not heated during the production of the cheese. Talleyrand said about this kind of cheese that it was the ""king of cheeses"". He said that in the 19th century. This kind of cheese has been made for at least 1000 years."
"In Europe this cheese is usually not treated chemically, so it might change in consistency or color. It will go bad if it is not kept cool. If that means it is kept in a refrigerator, note that it should not be eaten that cold. It is best eaten when it is somewhat below normal room temperature. In most countries, brie-style cheeses are made with Pasteurized milk."
"Brie can be aged, that is, carefully treated for up to a year. Then it has a darker colour and a stronger taste. This is rarely seen outside of France."
Types of Brie.
The following kinds of Brie exist:
"Other French ""Bries"" are:"
Bries from outside France:
Brie de Meaux.
"Cheeses are made into round loaves, of about 36 cm in diameter. The cheeses then weight about 2.5 kilograms. It is best tasted from April to October, after a ripening period of 8 to 10 weeks. About 2% of the production occurs on farms."
Brie de Melun.
"The Brie de Melun is smaller than the Brie de Meaux, but more salt is added to it. The ripening period is 10 weeks. It is best consumed April to September, but it can be found March to November, in some locations. About 5% of production occurs on farms."
What Brie should look like.
"When people buy Brie, they should make sure that it has the following traits:"
Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord
"Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (February 2, 1754 - May 17, 1838) was a French diplomat."
"He was a bishop and worked successfully for Louis XVI. He changed sides and served the French Revolution and Napoleon I. When Napoleon started losing his wars, Talleyrand changed sides again and served Louis XVIII. He represented France at the Congress of Vienna. He changed sides once more and served Louis Philippe I. Since the beginning of the 19th century he was known simply as ""Talleyrand"". He is widely seen as one of the most pragmatic and influential diplomats in European history. He was known to accept bribes from other European powers, especially while he served under Napoleon."
Pasteurization
Pasteurization (or pasteurisation) is a process of heat processing a liquid or a food to kill pathogenic bacteria to make the food safe to eat and to preserve longer. It involves heating the food to kill most harmful microorganisms. Producers pasteurize dairy and other foods to make them safe to eat. The process is named after Louis Pasteur. He was the first person to learn how to do it successfully. The first pasteurization was done by Louis Pasteur and Claude Bernard on 20 April 1862.
"Unlike sterilization, pasteurization is not intended to kill all microorganisms in the food. Instead, pasteurization gets a ""log reduction"" in the number of microorganisms. It brings their number down so they are unlikely to cause disease if the product is kept in the refrigerator and consumed before its sell-by date. Commercial sterilization of food is not common, because it tends to destroy the flavour of the food."
"In general, the values for 5, 50, and 500 are not subtracted. Here is the same number using the subtraction rule:"
Special values.
Zero.
"The number zero does not have its own Roman numeral. At about 725, Bede or one of his colleagues used the letter N, the abbreviation (short form) of ""nihil"" (the Latin word for ""nothing"")."
Fractions.
"The Romans also used fractions. The most common base for fractions was 1/12, which in Latin is called ""uncia"" (ounce)."
Large numbers.
"A number of numeral systems are developed for large numbers that cannot be shown with , , , , , and ."
Apostrophus.
"One of the systems is the ""apostrophus"", in which D is written as IƆ (500) and M is written as CIƆ (1,000). In this system, an extra Ɔ means 500, and multiple extra Ɔs are used to mean 5,000, 50,000 etc."
Vinculum.
"Another system is the ""vinculum"", in which V, X, L, C, D and M are multiplied by 1,000 by adding an overline."
Map
"A map is an image of an area, usually of the Earth or part of the Earth. A map is different from an aerial photograph because it includes interpretation. Many maps are called ""charts"" such as star charts and nautical charts. Some maps are of distant worlds. Before the late 20th century almost all maps were on paper. Today, many maps are digital, and can be seen on smartphones and computers. However, paper maps are still used."
"The word ""map"" can also be used to talk about a chart or drawing that shows relationships between ideas, people, events, or anything else you can think about. This is why web developers call a list of web pages on a web site a site map."
People who make maps are cartographers.
Many maps today are made using GIS computer systems. These are database systems that are organized by location instead of named records.
"If a map is on a piece of paper or a computer screen, it has to be projected. This is because the Earth is round and paper and screens are flat. There are a lot of ways that use mathematics to make map projections. The only kind of map of the Earth that is not projected is one drawn on a sphere. This is called a globe."
Globe
"A globe is a scale model with the shape of a sphere. Globes can be scale models of the Earth (""terrestrial globes"") or of other planets. Globes can also be models of the celestial sphere (""celestial globes""). The English word ""globe"" comes from the , meaning round mass or sphere."
Most globes are maps of the Earth. They have the advantage of avoiding the distortions of flat map projections. The most common types are political and physical. Political globes show countries. Physical globes show landscape like mountains and rivers. Some globes are star charts and some are maps of distant worlds.
"Global as an adjective is used to mean the entire world rather than any special place on the Earth. It is also used in fields like computers to mean dealing with a whole larger system, rather than its individual little parts."
History.
"That the Earth is a sphere was established by Hellenistic astronomy in the 3rd century BC. The terrestrial globe appeared in that period. Now, there are no terrestrial globes from Classical Antiquity or the Middle Ages in existence. The first example of terrestrial globe known was the one the ancient Greek Crates of Mallus made in the middle of the 2nd century BC. The Greek geographer Strabo wrote about Crates's terrestrial globe during the early years of the Roman Empire."
"A celestial globe from Classical Antiquity is in the Naples National Archaeological Museum, Italy. The globe is part of a sculpture – the globe is held up by a statue of Atlas, a Titan from Greek mythology. The ancient Romans made the globe and statue in the 2nd century AD. They may have copied the sculpture from Hellenistic art (art of the ancient Greek type) from the Hellenistic period (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries BC). The sculpture's name is the ""Farnese Atlas""."
"Early globes of the Earth that show all of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic Golden Age. One such example was made in the 9th century AD by Muslim geographers and cartographers working under the Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun. Another example was the globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian astronomer, Jamal ad-Din, in 1267."
"Martin Behaim designed a globe in 1492, in Nuremberg, Bavaria (Germany). Georg Glockendon was the artist who created the actual map drawings following Behaim's specifications. This globe is the oldest terrestrial globe still in existence. A copy of the globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507. Another early globe, the Hunt-Lenox Globe, ca. 1507, is thought to be the source of the phrase ""Here be dragons"". Another ""remarkably modern-looking"" globe of the Earth was made in Constantinople (Istanbul) by Taqi al-Din at his Constantinople Observatory during the 1570s."
Manufacture.
"Mass-produced globes are typically covered by a printed paper map. The most common type has long, thin gores (strips) of paper. These strips narrow to a point at the North Pole and the South Pole. Then a small disk is used to paper over the irregularities at the poles. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is needed to make the paper map fit the sphere."
"From a geometric point of view, all points on a sphere are the same. One could select any point on the planet, and create a paper map that covers the globe with strips that come together at that point and the opposite point."
"A co-factor (or cofactor) is a chemical compound which is not a protein, but is attached to a protein. The compound is needed for the protein's biological activity. In most cases, the protein will be an enzyme, and the cofactor will help the enzyme work. If so, the cofactors are also called coenzymes."
"Cofactors which are complex organic molecules are often called coenzymes. If connected by a covalent bond they are a ""prosthetic group"". But if they are just temporarily connected then the cofactor is a ""cosubstrate""."
"Some enzymes need several cofactors. Organic cofactors are often vitamins, or made from vitamins. Metallic ions are often cofactors, but many cofactors have both inorganic and organic parts."
Connective tissue
"Connective tissue is a fibrous tissue. It is one of the four traditional classes of tissues (the others being epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue)."
"Connective tissue (CT) is found throughout the body. It has 3 main components; cells, fibres, and extracellular matrix."
"Connective tissue makes up a variety of physical structures including, tendons, blood, cartilage, bone, adipose tissue, and lymphatic tissue. CT is classified into three subtypes: embryonic CT, proper CT, and special CT."
"Collagen is the main protein of connective tissue in animals and the most abundant protein in mammals, making up about 25% of the total protein content."
Collagen
"Collagen is a group of naturally occurring proteins. In nature, it is found exclusively in animals, especially in the flesh and connective tissues of mammals."
"It is the main component of connective tissue, and is the most abundant protein in mammals. It makes up about 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content."
"Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendon, ligament and skin, and is also abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral discs."
"Collagen makes up 1% to 2% of muscle tissue, and accounts for 6% of the weight of strong, tendinous muscles."
"Gelatin, which is used in the food industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed."
Hurricane Ginger
"Hurricane Ginger is the second longest-lasting Atlantic hurricane on record. It started September 6, 1971 and lasted until October 5. The storm struck eastern North Carolina on September 30, causing $10 million in damage. Peak winds were 110 miles per hour during Ginger's life."
Priory Green
"Priory Green is a hamlet in the civil parish of Edwardstone, in the Babergh district, in the county of Suffolk, England. It has four listed buildings, including Barn to the North of Lynn's Hall, Lynn's Hall, Priory Cottage and Priory Farmhouse. There are also selfcatering cottages in Priory Green."
"There used to be a monastery in Priory Green, called Edwardstone Priory. It was stated by Peter, Bishop of Winchester. The site is now Priory Farm."
"Sudbury, Suffolk"
"Sudbury is a town in the Babergh district, in the county of Suffolk, England. For transport there is the A134 road and the A131 road. Sudbury is in the Stour Valley."
It is the birthplace of the eigtheenth century painter Thomas Gainsborough
"Boxford, Suffolk"
"Boxford is a village and civil parish in the Babergh district, in the county of Suffolk, England. Boxford has a church called St Mary's Church."

Most Black-tailed rattlesnakes grow to the length of . They can be as long as . Females are said to be larger than males.
"The Black-tailed rattlesnake is olive green, yellow, brown, or black in color. They are called the ""Black-tailed rattlesnake"" because of their tail which is the color of black. Like other rattlesnakes the Black-tailed rattlesnake has a rattle on the end of its tail, but its rattle is weak and can be broken. They can shed their skin several times a year."
Common Names.
"The Black-tailed rattlesnake is also called the ""Green rattler"", the ""Dog-faced rattlesnake"", and the ""Mountain Diamondback""."
Where they live.
"The Black-tailed rattlesnake is found in southwestern United States of America and Mexico. In the U.S.A it is found in Arizona, New Mexico, and west and central Texas, in Mexico it is found in Oaxaca. It is also found on islands of the Gulf of California, like San Estèban Island and Tiburòn Island."
Behavior.
"In the spring and fall the Black-tailed rattlesnake are diurnal, in the summer they are nocturnal so they can avoid the heat, and in the winter they hibernate in other animals dens. Even though they are okay climbers and good swimmers they are terrestrial. They live in grasslands, deserts, mountain areas, and forests."
Feeding.
"Like all rattlesnakes they are carnivores and eat rodents, other small mammals, birds, and small reptiles."
Reproduction.
"The Black-tailed rattlesnakes mate in the spring, once they have mated the male stays with the female to stop other males from mating with her. It is in the summer that the female gives birth to her young, the young stay with their mother for around a day or two before leaving by their selves. A female usually mates every year and has 10-12 young at a time. They live for around 15–20 years."
YMCA
"Young Men's Christian Association (or the YMCA or the Y) is an organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It was originally meant to put Christian principles into practice. It was founded in 1844 in London, England, United Kingdom. At first, the organization provided beds and shelter to young men leaving the countryside for work in the cities. It promotes Muscular Christianity."
Basketball was invented in an American YMCA.
The similar Young Women's Christian Association or YWCA was founded in 1870.
Antisocial personality disorder
Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a personality disorder. A person with ASPD fails to conform with socially accepted behavior. People with this disorder often disregard social norms or the rights of other people. People with extreme Antisocial Personality Disorder are sometimes nicknamed sociopaths or psychopaths but those words aren’t really scientific nomenclature.
"The ASPD pattern begin in childhood or adolescence and continues into adulthood. People with ASPD have no conscience or sense of morality, although the large majority know right from wrong. Those with ASPD often commit crimes. They can also be impulsive, aggressive, reckless, and destructive. About three percent of men and one percent of women have ASPD."
DSM-V criteria.
"According to the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM-V), a person has ASPD if they fit the following requirements:"
Causinae
"The Causinae, commonly known as the ""night adders"", are a subfamily of venomous vipers found in sub-Saharan Africa. The family is monotypic, since it only has the genus ""Causus"". There are six species."
"The night adders can grow to around 60 to 90 centimeters (24 to 36 in) long. They are usually dark gray, light gray, light brown, or black in color with gray or black blotches."
"Even though they are called the night adders, they are usually active at day, but some are active at night. When they are attacked or disturbed, they usually coil up and start hissing at their enemy to scare it off. Some may raise their head and neck off the ground, and with their tongue sticking out, move froward like a the Cobra does."
"They eat mainly toads and frogs, but there are reports of some night adders eating almost everything they can find until they are completely unable to swallow any more food."
Reproduction.
"All night adders are oviparous, which means they lay eggs. This is unusual for most vipers, because most vipers are viviparous, they give live birth. They lay around two dozen eggs at a time. These eggs take around four months to hatch, when they hatch the hatchlings are 4-5 inches (10-12.5 cm) long."

Hades
"Hades (, ""Háidēs"") is the god of the dead and the king of the underworld in ancient Greek religion and myth. He is the eldest son of the Titans Kronos and Rhea and brother to Zeus, Poseidon, Hestia, Hera, Demeter and Chiron."
"As the lord of the dead, Hades was greatly feared by the Greeks, and he had few temples or shrines dedicated to him. He was married to the goddess Persephone, the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Hades’ symbols were the cornucopia, a sceptre, the cypress, narcissus, poplar and his Helm of Darkness; the screech owl was his sacred animal. His sacred fruit was the pomegranate, the fruit that Persephone ate one- third of when she was kidnapped and in the underworld."
"Hades’ Roman equivalent was Pluto, whose name is merely a Latinization of the Greek ""Plouton""."
Superlative
"A superlative, in grammar, is an adjective describing a noun that is the best example of a given quality. In other words, a superlative describes a noun that has more of some quality than any other."
Some examples:
"In English, most superlatives can be formed by adding -EST to an existing adjective, like the examples above. (For adjectives that end in ""-y"", like ""crazy"", you often change the ""y"" to an ""i"" before you add the -EST on the end.)"
"Some adjectives have irregular superlative forms, which do not follow the rules, such as far (""farthest"") and bad (""worst"")."
"Other adjectives have no superlative form at all, and the superlative is made simply by adding the adverb ""most"" before the adjective. For instance, you do not say ""funnest,"" or ""interestingest"". Instead, you say ""most fun,"" and ""most interesting."""
"This way of making the superlative is used for almost all adjectives ending in ""ing"" (like ""interesting"", ""fascinating"", ""disgusting"" or ""appealing"".)"
Learning disability
"Learning disabilities, also called learning difficulties, are conditions that make it difficult to learn and understand things in the same way others do. Some people with learning difficulties also find it hard to fit in with other people because there are many things that people must know to live in society that are not easy to learn."
"Learning difficulties can be things that people can learn to live with on their own, like dyslexia (a difficulty with reading) and dysgraphia (a difficulty with writing). They can also be big things that mean a person needs more help (like autism). People with learning disabilities may have average intelligence. Learning disabilities are not the same as mental illnesses. They can often deal with their difficulties by doing things in different ways."
"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not a learning disability, but it may affect how a person learns."
Wheelbarrow
A wheelbarrow is a kind of vehicle that is built to be pushed around with a load inside it. It is usually used in gardens.
"Most wheelbarrows have one wheel, but some have two."
Wheelbarrows are used to carry heavy stuff which some people cannot carry.
Cold
"Cold is a relative term used in comparison with the adjective warm (opposite of cold). Because it is relative, there is no range in coldness. The temperatures in the winter season are often categorized as being cold. Cold is the opposite of hot."
"The coldest possible temperature is −273.15 °C, which can be expressed as -459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale. This is called absolute zero. Absolute zero is also 0 K on the Kelvin scale and 0 °R on the Rankine scale"
43 × 0 = 0
0 ÷ 43 = 0
43 ÷ 0 has an undefined answer.
0 ÷ 0 has no answer.
"The following table includes all of the above examples along with other operations in a condensed, generalized form (where ""x"" represents any number)."
History of zero.
"The idea of zero was first thought about in Babylon, India and in Central America at different times. Some places and countries did not know about zero, which may have made it harder for those people to do mathematics. For example, the year after 1 BC is AD 1 (there is no year zero). In India, zero was theorized in the seventh century by the mathematician Brahmagupta."
"Over hundreds of years, the idea of zero was passed from country to country, from India and Babylon to other places, like Greece, Persia and the Arab world. The Europeans learned about zero from the Arabs, and stopped using Roman math. This is why numbers are called ""Arabic numerals""."
The place of zero as a number.
"Zero is almost never used as a place number (ordinal number). This means that it is not used like 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the order, or place, of something, like 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. An exception to this is seen in many programming languages."
Some other things about zero:
"Any number divided by itself equals one, except if that number is zero. In symbols:"
"0 ÷ 0 = ""not a number."""
"In time, zero means ""now"". For example, when a person is counting down the time to the start of something, such as a foot race or when a rocket takes off, the count is: ""three, two, one, zero (or ""go"")"". Zero is the exact time of the start of the race or when the rocket takes off into the sky."
0 as a number.
Definition.
"0 is the integer that precedes the positive 1, and follows −1. In most (if not all) numerical systems, 0 was identified before the idea of 'negative integers' was accepted. It means ""courageous one"" in hieroglyphics."
"Zero is a number which means an amount of null size; that is, if the number of brothers is zero, that means the same thing as having no brothers, and if something has a weight of zero, it has no weight. If the difference between the numbers of pieces in two piles is zero, it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces. Before counting starts, the result can be assumed to be zero; that is the number of items counted before one counts the first item, and counting the first item brings the result to one. And if there are no items to be counted, zero remains the final result."
Debates.
Is zero a number ?
"While mathematicians all accept zero as a number, some non-mathematicians would say that zero is not a number, arguing that one cannot have zero of something. Others say that if one has a bank balance of zero, one has a specific quantity of money in that account, namely none. It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others."
Is zero a natural number ?
A debate asking if 0 is or not a natural number has been discussed over time.
Encyclopædia Britannica says 0 is a natural number. Wolfram MathWorld´says it isn't. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences says it isn't. The Princeton Companion to Mathematics says 0 is a natural number.
"Although the International Baccalaureate thinks 0 to be a natural number. Oxford Dictionary says ""a positive whole number such as 1, 2, or 3, and sometimes also zero""."
As year.
"There was no year zero between 1 BC and 1 AD. More specifically, almost all historians leave out the year zero from the proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars (that is, from the normal calendar used in English-speaking countries), but astronomers include it in these same calendars. However, the phrase Year Zero may be used to describe any event considered so important, that someone might want to start counting years all over again from zero."
0 as a numeral.
"The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or (rounded) rectangle. In old-style fonts with text figures, 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x."
"On the seven-segment displays of calculators, watches, etc., 0 is usually written with six line segments, though on some historical calculator models, it was written with four line segments. The four-segment 0 is not common."
"The ""number"" zero (as in the ""zero brothers"" example above) is not the same as the ""numeral"" or ""digit"" zero, used in numeral systems using positional notation. Successive positions of digits have higher values, so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a different positional number system. Something called bijective numeration is a possible example of a system without zeroes."
The numerical digit zero.
"Xiphactinus (from Latin and Greek for ""sword-ray"") was a large, 4.5 to 5 m (15 to 20 feet) long predatory bony fish that lived in the Western Interior Sea, over what is now the middle of North America, during the Late Cretaceous. Skeletal remains of Xiphactinus have come from Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia in the United States, as well as Europe and Australia."
Description.
"Above all else, ""Xiphactinus"" was a great swimmer, able to speed towards or away from virtually anything else in the seas of the time. It may have been able to leap above the waves at times to help dislodge parasites from its skin. It was not however immune from attack. If injured, its large size meant it was easy to spot and could become prey for sharks, Mosasaurs, and other Xiphactinus."
Emperor Kenzō
"was the 23rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Kenzō to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Kenzō""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
Kenzō was a grandson of Emperor Richū; and he was adopted as heir by the childless Emperor Seinei.
Events of Kenzō's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Kenzō's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Kenzō.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, Kenzō final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Kofun
are earthen tombs or tumuli in Japan. They were constructed between the early 3rd century and early 7th century.
These burial mounds are referenced in the name of the Kofun period (middle 3rd century - early-middle 6th century).
Many of the kofun have a keyhole-shaped mound () which is unique to ancient Japan.
Chess and computers
"Chess and computers have been connected since the earliest days of the computer. In the 19th century Charles Babbage had thought of the idea,p87 and in modern times Alan Turing, the mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker, put some thought into the idea. He was not a very good chess player, but was one of the creators of the first British computer. He is also credited with the creation of Computer science."
"There are two types of chess programs. One plays against a human opponent; the other helps the user become a better player. The two types can be made to work together, though they have different functions and work in different ways."
Chess engines.
"Chess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents. Many have been created; they can play at master level, though their processes are quite different from those of a human being.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;p87 The best engines on the fastest computers have won matches against both Kasparov and Kramnik, but the software can be used at an easier level for a learner."
"Competitions are run by putting engines against each other, and the results are published. There is a World Computer Chess Championship, in which the details of the rules may determine which software wins. Software may also be rated on other scales, such as ease of usage."
Fritz.
"Fritz is a German chess program by Frans Morsch and Mathias Feist, published by ChessBase. It is the current market leader. There is also a different kind of Fritz called ""Deep Fritz"" that is made for multi-processing. The latest kinds of the consumer products are Deep Fritz 12 and Fritz 12. They came with reviews by Josh Waitzkin, who said that ""Fritz is like a woman that you can't get with. It just drives (makes) you to think in ways you've never thought before""."
Shredder.
"Shredder is a leading engine. It is also owned by ChessBase. It comes in various forms: Shredder 12, Deep Shredder 12; Shredder Classic. It has a reputation of being hard."
Rybka.
"Rybka, a product by Vasik Rajlich, is Shredder's main rival. Rybka 4 is their latest version."
Astrology.
A person's astrological sign is based on his or her birthday.
Symbolism.
Birthstones.
"A birthstone symbolizes the month of birth. In 1912, the Jewelers of America agreed on a list of birthstones:"
1442
1442 was a common year.
Yi I
"Yi I (December 26, 1536–1584) was a Korean Confucian scholar. His mother was a famous calligraphist, Shin Saimdang. He was very intelligent as a child, learning to read at three and being very bright at his studies. He was also devoted to his parents: when his mother was sick, he prayed to his ancestors to heal her; and when his father was sick, he cut his own finger with a knife and let his father drink his blood (at that time, people thought human blood was very good medicine)."
Sunrise (company)
"Sunrise is a Japanese animation company. The staff uses the name Hajime Yatate in all their productions by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but this is not a real person--it is a name that all the people who work for the studio use for themselves."

X-ray
"X-radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. X-rays are waves of X-radiation. X-rays have a shorter wavelength, and therefore more energy, than ultraviolet radiation. They have a much shorter wavelength than visible light (the light that we can see). Radiation with shorter wavelengths (more energy) than the X-ray is called Gamma radiation (γ-rays). These are all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
The wavelength of X-rays covers a wide range. Most X-rays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometres. This corresponds with frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×1016 Hz to 3×1019 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV.
"X-rays can go through many solid materials. For this reason, taking photograms with X-rays is used in medicine in order to see bones and other things inside the body. Sometimes the term ""X-Ray"" means these pictures instead of the radiation that makes them."
"What these images show will depend on three things: Rayleigh scattering, Compton scattering and photoabsorption. The images show bone because it is dense enough that X-rays are not able to pass through it. Instead, the X-rays are either absorbed or scattered. The images do not show skin and muscle, however, because these tissues are transparent enough for the X-rays to pass through them without being absorbed too much. To detect tumors, other imaging devices are used; such as magnetic resonance imaging. A computed tomography scanner combines an X-ray machine and computer to construct a three dimensional (3D) picture. This has some ability to see other things besides bone."
"X-rays are made by hitting metal with fast-moving electrons. They are photons, tiny packets of energy that can move atoms and change chemicals in the body. They are ionizing radiation but the things they do depend on the wavelength of the X-rays (or how much energy they have). X-rays with smaller energies (""soft"" x-rays) cause the photoelectric effect. Mid-level energies cause Compton scattering. High-level energies (""hard"" X-rays) cause pair production. X-rays used for making pictures of people have low to medium energy. Radiation therapy that treats cancer uses Compton scattering and sometimes Pair production."
"There are small amounts of X-rays in the air. Like other energy in the air, X-rays can change living cells. Exposing the human body to high doses of X-rays for a long time is dangerous. It can cause cancer. However, cancer cells are hurt more easily, so X-rays are sometimes used to kill them."
Computed tomography scanner
A computed tomography (CT) scanner is an X-ray machine that takes cross section images. They can help a doctor in diagnosis.
Hanoi
"Hanoi () is the capital of Vietnam. It is also the second most populated city in the country. In 2004, about 3,083,800 people lived in the city. It has been the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) since 1945 and the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (all of Vietnam) since 1976. Before that, it was the capital of the country now called Vietnam for most of the time from at least the 11th century until 1802. The city is on the right of the Red River, and the city's name translates to English as ""inside the river"". Things made there include machine tools, plywood, textiles, chemicals and handicrafts. Hanoi is at 21°2' North, 105°51' East, 1,760 km north of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). Popular tourist sites in the city include Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum, Hoa Lo Prison, and the Palace of Literature. Nearby Hanoi is also where pho, Vietnamese beef noodle soup, was first created."
"The play has been made into movies on numerous occasions. One movie stars Mickey Rooney as the fairy Puck. Benjamin Britten wrote an opera based on the play, George Balanchine and Frederick Ashton have both made ballets about it, and Felix Mendelssohn wrote many pieces of music for the play which include an ""Overture"" and a ""Wedding March""."

Story.
"Egeus wants his daughter Hermia to marry Demetrius. Hermia does not want to marry him. She loves another man named Lysander. Hermia and Lysander decide to run away. Demetrius follows them. Helena, Hermia's best friend, is in love with Demetrius. She follows him. All four become lost in the woods near Athens."
"Meanwhile, Oberon and Titania are having an argument. Oberon decides to teach Titania a lesson. He puts a love potion into her eyes while she is asleep. This potion will make her fall in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes."
"Oberon finds Helena and Demetrius. He tells Puck to give Demetrius some of the love potion so that he will love Helena. Puck makes a mistake and puts the potion in Lysander's eyes. When Lysander wakes up, he loves Helena instead of his real sweetheart Hermia."
"The workmen, are practising a play in the woods for the upcoming marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta. Puck plays a trick on Nick Bottom by giving him donkey ears. The other actors run away, so Bottom goes to sleep. He is sleeping near Titania. She wakes up and falls in love with him."
"Oberon realises everything is all mixed up. He gives some of the love potion to Demetrius. Now Demetrius and Lysander both love Helena. Sad and confused, all the lovers fall asleep. At last, Puck rights all the wrongs. He makes Lysander love Hermia again, and makes Demetrius love Helena. Everyone is happy."
The workmen perform their play after the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta. Oberon has stopped Titania being in love with Bottom. They are happy with each other again. The fairies use their magic to bless all the lovers.
Vodka
"Vodka is a Russian alcoholic drink that is usually about 40% alcohol. It is clear (but can be flavoured), though it is sometimes mixed with other liquids before people drink it. It was first popular in the Slavic countries of Eastern Europe and former republics of the Soviet Union."
Things that are made into vodka.
Vodka can be made from different things:
The process to make vodka is:
"Unlike cognac or whisky, vodka is not usually matured in barrels, but bottled immediately. Some Scandinavian vodkas called ""akvavit"" (Latin ""aqua vitae"", ""water of life"") are matured in oak barrels before they are bottled. When the vodka is bottled, it is ready for drinking."
History.
"Most people think the name ""vodka"" comes from the Slavic word for water in its diminutive form, ""little water"". The earliest mention of Vodka in Poland is in 1405. The Russians are known to have first used the word in June 8, 1751. It is not known if it was the Russians or the Poles who made the first drinks that could be classified as vodka, as sources provide various views on this topic (though it's important to remember that the first mention of the word ""vodka"" in Cyrillic refers to a medicinal drink bought by the merchants of Kievan Rus from Poland). It is also worth noting that vodka was first used as medicine. When it became a popular drink, it was first known in Polish as ""gorzałka"" - from the Old Polish word ""gorzeć"", meaning burn. At first, gorzałka was a people's drink, but in the Slavic countries it soon became common among the nobility as well. it is worth noting that the common Ukrainian word for vodka is ""horilka"" which bears an extremely close resemblance to the Polish gorzalka. Both words roots have the same meaning (""hority"" - to burn; ""gorzeć"", also to burn)"
Different kinds of vodka.
"There are two basic kinds of Vodka: clear vodka and flavored vodka. Some types of vodka have plants or herbs added to the unflavored vodka to make it taste better. Contrary to popular belief, flavoured vodka is not new - it has been a part of Polish drinking tradition for centuries. It is only relatively recently in history that clear and flavoured vodkas have found their way to Western countries such as the UK or US."
How vodka is consumed.
"Vodka is either drunk pure, or cocktails are made with it. The simplest form of cocktail is to mix it with orange or lemon juice. Usually, vodka is drunk during a longer meal. Usually salty or sour things (not sweets) are served. In Poland and Russia (as well as some of their neighbours, such as Ukraine or Lithuania), vodka is drunk from glasses that can hold about 100 grams (0,1 litres) of vodka. The glass is usually emptied in one draught, while holding the breath. Directly afterwards something small is eaten. In most Eastern European countries it is consumed with pickled cucumbers. Before drinking, a toast is given."
Cultural.
"Vodka is a key element of Slavic tradition in some countries of Eastern Europe (especially Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia). It has also spread to become a part of national culture in Baltic countries like Lithuania and Nordic countries like Sweden. It's traditional in Russia and other Slavic countries (as well as some Roma communities in Eastern Europe) to put a glass of vodka with a slice of bread (usually black bread) on top on graves or near photos of the deceased in their memory. This is similar to what people in Western countries do with flowers."
Sexual reproduction
Sexual reproduction is how most animals and plants reproduce. Some protists and fungi also reproduce this way. Organisms that reproduce sexually have two different sexes: male and female.
"In sexual reproduction, offspring are produced when sperms fertilise eggs from the female. Various steps are involved in this process."
"Theism is the religious belief that at least one god exists while rejecting the existence or importance of polytheistic gods or goddesses. In a broader definition it can also be the belief in God or gods in general, including all types of god-belief. Polytheism is the belief in several gods, while monotheism is the belief in just one god. For example, a theistic religion is Christianity. The opposite to a theist is an atheist. An atheist is a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings."
Different theisms.
All of these are rough definitions of the theisms; they are almost always different. We can split them all into different groups:
"Gnosticism and agnosticism can be combined with other forms of theism. For example, it is possible to be an agnostic atheist, or a gnostic theist. In common usage, some people group atheism and agnosticism together under the group of nontheism — absence of clear belief in any deity."
The main types of theism are:
"This is another way to group different theisms, based on the nature of the gods."
There are also these types:
Plesiosaur
"The plesiosaurs were an order of large, carnivorous marine reptiles. They flourished from 245 million years ago (mya) to 65 mya."
"In 1719, William Stukeley described the first partial skeleton of a plesiosaur. The great-grandfather of Charles Darwin, Robert Darwin of Elston told him about it."
"Mary Anning was the first to discover a fairly complete plesiosaur. She found it on the 'Jurassic Coast' of Dorset, England in the winter of 1820/21. The fossil was missing its skull, but in 1823 she found another one, this time complete with its skull. The name ""Plesiosaurus"" was given to it by the Rev. William Conybeare."
"The earliest plesiosaur remains are from the Middle Triassic period,p128 and the group was important through the Jurassic and Cretaceous. They had two large pairs of paddles, short tails, short or long necks, and broad bodies. They died out at the K/T extinction event, 65 million years ago."
Description.
"Plesiosaurs had many bones in their flippers, making them flexible. No modern animal has this four-paddle anatomy: modern turtles use their forelimbs for swimming. They were mainly piscivorous (fish-eaters)."
Pliosaurs.
"The pliosaurs were a group of mostly large submarine predators with short necks and large heads. Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres, and they were predators of large fish and other reptiles. Their streamlined body shape suggests they swam and ate under water."
Long-necked plesiosaurs.
"There were three families of long-necked plesiosaurs, who evidently had a different life-style from the pliosaurs. It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that their method was as surface swimmers, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton. It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water; aquatic mammals operating under water all have a streamlined torpedo-shape, as did pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs. All the longer-necked familiers were, from the setting of the teeth and jaws, eaters of small fish. However, some at least were bottom-feeders, consuming various prey. Digestion of shellfish was aided by gastroliths."
Gastroliths.
"Plesiosaurs have been found with fossils of belemnites (squid-like animals), and ammonites (giant nautilus-like molluscs) associated with their stomachs. But plesiosaurs could not crack shells. Instead, they probably swallowed them whole. In the belly of a plesiosaur were ""stomach stones"", which are called ""gastroliths."" These stones moved around in the plesiosaur's stomach and cracked or crushed the shells of the animals it ate. One plesiosaur fossil found in South Dakota had 253 gatroliths weighing a total of 29 pounds."
Live birth?
"Live birth has been proved for ichthyosaurs, but is uncertain for plesiosaurs."
"Midland, Texas"
"Midland is a city in the American state of Texas. It is called Midland, because it is the midway point between two bigger cities in Texas, Fort Worth and El Paso. Oil was discovered in the region in 1923 and is still a larger part of the economy."
"Midland is also famous as the hometown of former First Lady Barbara Walker Bush. She and her husband, former president George H. W. Bush lived there, with their children including the later US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida."
Sardinia
"Sardinia (, Sardinian: ""Sardigna"") is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is an autonomous region of Italy. It was formerly the Kingdom of Sardinia."
"The official name is, in Italian, Regione Autonoma della Sardegna.The capital and largest city is Cagliari."
Geography.
The lotus flowers grow over the water. Lotus leaves often float on top of the water. The roots of lotus plants are in the mud (wet dirt) under the water. Every part of every plant must have air for respiration (breathing). Air spaces in the stems and roots make the lotus able to live and respire under water.
People can eat lotus roots and seeds. Cattle (cows) like to eat the leaves and flowers.
"Lotuses look rather like water lilies from the Nymphaeaceae family. It is the ""National flower"" of both India and Vietnam and also the ""Provincial flower"" of Sindh province, Pakistan."
Nymphaeaceae
"In botany, Nymphaeaceae is the name of a family of plants which grow in water. The family is also called ""water-lily family""."
Their flowers suggest they are one of the earliest groups of angiosperms. Modern genetic analyses by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group researchers has confirmed its basal position among flowering plants.
"Also, the Nymphaeaceae are more diverse and wdespread than other basal angiosperms. Nymphaeaceae is in the order Nymphaeales. According to the most widely accepted flowering plant classification system, this is the second diverging group of angiosperms after ""Amborella""."
Ugly Betty
"Ugly Betty is a Golden Globe- and Peabody Award-winning American comedy-drama television series. It stars America Ferrera, Vanessa Williams, and Eric Mabius. It premiered on September 28, 2006, on ABC in the United States. The series follows the life of Betty Suarez (Ferrera), and her incongruous job at the ultra-chic New York City fashion magazine ""Mode"". Betty's status as a ""fish out of water"" drives much of the plot. Ugly Betty ended on April 14, 2010 after low ratings during season 4."

"Since the show's debut, the main characters have become the latest fixures in the lexicon of pop media culture. They have already had parodies, news media stories and art-imitating-life situations, as well as recognition from the United States Congress itself."
Shinto shrine
"A Shinto shrine is a sacred place or site where people worship in the Shinto religion. Many Shinto shrines have buildings, gates, and natural areas such as forests and rivers around them. The usual Japanese word for a Shinto shrine is ."
Miko
"are women in the service of Shinto shrines. The translation of ""Miko"" is ""Woman of God"" (chosen by, or totally devoted to, the gods), but the closest meaning is ""shrine maiden"". In Shinto, there are priestesses; but Miko are not priestesses, because they have less authority. However, they can act as priestesses if needed. They usually help Shintoist priests."
Mineko Iwasaki
", born Masako Tanaka on November 2, 1949 in Kyoto, was Japan's number one ""geiko"" (geisha) until she retired at the age of 29. She entertained many important people when they visited Japan, like Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles. She retired because she was tired of the profession, and wanted to start a family."
"Author Arthur Golden did an interview to her and used her as inspiration for his book ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", that was later made a movie. Iwasaki later said that the book was full of lies, and that nothing that Golden said ever happened to her. She put a lawsuit against Golden for this, and they solved it out of court in 2003. After the publication of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", Iwasaki wrote her autobiography, ""Geisha, A Life""."

Mandalay in writing.
There are some important books and poems that talk about Mandalay. Some of these are famous.
"Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem called ""Mandalay."" He wrote it in 1890. This poem has a famous saying in it: ""on the road to Mandalay."""
"In 1907, Oley Speaks wrote a song using the words of the poem. He called the song ""On the Road to Mandalay."" The song is very famous. Frank Sinatra sang the song and called it ""Come Fly with Me""."
"George Orwell wrote a novel called ""Burmese Days"". He wrote it in 1934. Orwell was part of the Indian Imperial Police. He was stationed in Mandalay. The novel is about his experiences (what he did and saw.) He also wrote some non-fiction essays and short stories. Some of these are ""A Hanging"" (1931) and ""Shooting an Elephant"" (1936)."
Twin towns.
Mandalay has three twin towns:
Act of Congress
"An Act of Congress is a statute enacted by the United States Congress according to the powers granted to it by the Constitution of the United States. The term can be used in other countries with a legislature called a ""Congress,"" such as the Congress of the Philippines. But most often the term is associated with the United States Congress. In the US, there are several steps from a bill or resolution becoming a law. It must first be passed by a majority of both of the houses of Congress. Then the bill or resolution is sent to get signed by the President. It becomes an Act of Congress by either the president's signature or, if the President does not return the bill or resolution within ten days."
Bills.
"Senators and Representatives create thousands of written proposals each year for new laws. Called bills, only a few few ever make it all the way through the process to become a law. The Constitution requires only three steps: passing the House, passing the Senate and approval by the President. The actual process has become much more complicated."
"A bill may be proposed by anyone but only a member of Congress, called the bill's sponsor, may introduce them on the floor of one of the houses of Congress. A bill may be introduced in both the Senate and House at the same time. In theory, this saves time over sending it though one house, then the other. In each house of Congress, a bill is sent to a committee. A committee studies the bill and recommends changes. If a committee does nothing, the bill is considered ""dead"". A committee may also add other unrelated provisions to a bill called amendments. Committees usually divide themselves into smaller groups called subcommittees. The bill's sponsors then try to convince the subcommittees to approve the bill. They do this through hearings. If the bill passes through a committee it is sent to the floor for debate and a vote. A bill may either be passed by be defeated. If passed, it is sent to the other house of Congress to follow the same procedures."
Resolutions.
"In addition to bills, Congress also passes Acts of Congress called resolutions. There are three kinds: simple resolutions, joint resolutions and concurrent resolutions."
Simple resolutions.
"These are resolutions concerning the operation of either house of Congress. They are not sent to the President for his approval. Resolutions by the House of Representatives which affect that house are designated ""H.Res."" followed by a number. Simple resolutions in the Senate are designated ""S. Res."" followed by a number."
Joint resolutions.
"A joint resolution may start either in the House or Senate. They are essentially the same as a bill. The only difference is a joint resolution that proposes an amendment to the US Constitution. They require a two-thirds majority vote in each house. Like a simple resolution, they are not sent to the President for his signature. They become effective when they are ratified by three-quarters of the states. A joint resolution that began in the House of Representatives is designated ""H.J.Res."" followed by the number. A joint resolution started in the Senate is designated ""S.J.Res."", followed by the number. Joint resolutions become law the same as bills."
Concurrent resolutions.
"Concurrent resolutions start with either ""S.Con.Res."" (Senate) or ""H.Con.Res."" (House). They are numbered consecutively as they are introduced. Concurrent resolutions are those that affect the operations of both the House and Senate. They can also be used to create a temporary joint committee. Concurrent resolutions are not sent to the president for his signature and do not have the force of law."
Jeff Weaver (political staffer)
"Jeffrey ""Jeff"" P. Weaver (born 1966) is an American political adviser. He was the campaign manager for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in 2016. Weaver served as the campaign manager during Bernie Sanders' successful Senate run in 2006. Weaver also served as chief of staff in Sanders’ House and Senate offices."
"Weaver was born in St. Albans, Vermont. He studied at Boston University, the University of Vermont, and Georgetown University."
Asta Nielsen
"Asta Nielsen (11 September 1881 – 24 May 1972) was a Danish silent movie actress. She was very popular in the 1910s. She was one of the first international movie stars. Nielsen was in 74 movies. 70 were in Germany where she was known simply as ""Die Asta"" (""The Asta""). She had large dark eyes, a face like a mask and a figure like a boy. Nielsen most often played strong and passionate women trapped by tragic lives. Her performances were erotic so Nielsen's movies were heavily censored in the United States. Therefore, she was not very famous there. Nielsen started her own movie studio in Berlin in the 1920s. She went back to Denmark in 1937 after Nazism became a problem. Later in life, Nielsen became a collage artist and an author."
F. Lee Bailey
"Francis Lee Bailey Jr., commonly referred to as F. Lee Bailey, (June 10, 1933 – June 3, 2021) was an American criminal-defense lawyer. Bailey was born in Waltham, Massachusetts. He worked in Massachusetts and Florida."
Bubble tea
"Bubble tea, also called pearl tea or Boba, is a drink which comes from Taichung, Taiwan. It is made by mixing black tea with non-dairy creamer or milk and adding round ""pearl"" tapioca. There are many flavors other than the original one. Green tea can be used instead of black tea. Extra items such as honey, coffee or cocoa can be added. Pudding or coconut cubes can be used instead of pearl tapioca."
"When it was first invented, not many people were interested in it. But after a bubble tea maker was interviewed on a Japanese TV program, it became popular among people of all ages. The popularity of bubble tea can be seen not only in Taiwan but also in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Southeast Asia, Australia, Canada and the USA."
Bubble tea has now arrived in England and the rest of Europe.
Things that are in bubble tea.
"Most bubble tea recipes contain a tea base mixed with fruit or milk, to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. Ice-mixed versions are usually mixed with fruit or syrup, resulting in a slushy softness. There are many varieties of the drink with a huge range of ingredients like coconut or mango. The two most popular types are bubble milk tea with tapioca and bubble milk green tea with tapioca."
The reason for choosing tapioca.
"At first, people made bubble tea without tapioca pearls. But Taiwanese people started to find substances to make the sweetened flavor. Tapioca came from the cassava plant, which is a root of the trees from South America. This plant is now farmed and enjoyed around the world."
Effects on the body from bubble tea.
"Four positive nutrients that tapioca provide are carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and organic compounds. These include a very low level of fat, cholesterol, and sodium . It is also known as the source of fiber, “good” cholesterol, and protein. But bubble tea has Cyanogen that are transformed in humans and animals after the plant tissue has been weakened. The blood remains oxygenated after it passes through your body and back to the lungs."
Process to make bubble tea.
"Bubble tea is found in Taiwanese restaurants and commonly prepared by shaking ice, milk, tea, and sugar in a cocktail shaker which resulted in a lot of tapioca bubbles. People use the same preparation to make bubble tea, just now with the added Pearls."
An Jung-sik
"An Jung-sik (1861–1919) was an artist who lived in the late Joseon dynasty. In 1918 he organized the association of paintings and writings artists (Seohwa-hyeopae; 서화협회;書畵協會)'. And he founded ""Gyeongmokdang"" () in which artists and supporters gathered and communicated with each other. As the leader of the association he made an effort to educate younger artist generation. He was excellent at landscape, portrait, flowers and birds."
His main works are:
"In his period, the western modern art was introduced to Korea, and the Korean traditional art was declining. He not only tried to succeed the traditional art but also adapt the western art, a realistic trend."
Korean International School of Hong Kong
"The Korean International School of Hong Kong (KIS) was founded on March 1988. It is in Lei King Wan, Sai Wan Ho, Hong Kong, near Tai Koo Shing. Tai Koo Shing has many Koreans."
Structure.
The school has an English section and a Korean section. The Korean Section uses Korean textbooks. The students there prepare to take the KSAT (Suneung) so they can go to Korean universities. The English section uses English textbooks and follows the Cambridge International Primary Programme.
"KIS has many facilities, like a tennis court, swimming pool, soft-surface playing fields, and a gymnasium. Students use the facilities for physical education classes and activities outside of classes. Higher grade students take a school trip to England."
"There are many special parties during the year. Usually there is one party per month. Some of these parties are Play Day in April, Sports Day in May, Spring Concert in June, Halloween in October, and Fun Tie and Hat Day."
"The students are in four ""house teams""- Cougars, Eagles, Lions and Pandas. Each house has their own chant and their own colour."
Investigation.
In the past the school has had problems with bribery. A person in the cleaning company paid a bribe to a school officer. So the Independent Commission Against Corruption investigated the school and arrested one person. Koreans in Hong Kong were disappointed. They said they lost confidence in the school's management.

Behavior.
"The Horned Viper is nocturnal and terrestrial (lives on the ground), and is usually found buried underneath the sand. They are said to be slow moving, but they are able to do sidewinding. When they do sidewinding they can move faster across the sand. They are able to sink into the sand by moving in a rocking motion. They sink into the sand tail first and keep on sinking deeper into the sand until only their eyes and nose are sticking out of the sand. The reason they do this is so they can ambush prey which come close to it. They are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. They live in the deserts of North Africa, Arabia, and Iran."
Feeding.
"The Horned Viper catch their prey by ambushing. They eat mainly rodents, birds and lizards."
Las Vegas culture
"Las Vegas culture is the name for a number of setltements on the coast of present-day Ecuador. These settlements were created between roughly 8000 and 4600 BCE. In total, there are 31 settlements. The people who lived there were hunter-gatherers. They had also started agriculture. Bone points and a spatula have been discovered. They may have been used for making nets or textiles, along with various tools and containers shaped of shell; wood, bamboo, reeds, and bark are also believed to have been used in the tool industry."
No mummies have been found on the coast of Ecuador. The Las Vegas people had similarities with the people whose remains are preserved as the Chinchorro mummies of the north coast of Chile.They also lived at the same time.
Yu Kil-chun
"Yu Kil-chun (, 1856 – 1914) was a Korean politician, philosopher, thinker, reform activist and independence activist during the Joseon Dynasty. His nickname was Gudang, Chunmin, Guyil."
Life.
"Yu Kil-chun was born in Kwangju. In his early years he studied under Park Kyu-su and Oh Kyung-suk. As a young man in 1881, he went to Meiji Japan to study at Keio University. He then went to the United States in 1884 to study mathematics. After his he was accused of supporting the ""Gaehwadang"" (enlightenment party). He was arrested and put in jail from 1885 to 1894."
"Between 1894 and 1895, Yu worked for the government of prime minister Kim Hongjip. He was Vice Minister of State for Home Office. In October 1895, Korea's King Gojong claimed that Yu was involved in the assassination of Queen Min. Kim was killed and his cabinet was disbanded. Yu went to the Russian embassy and escaped the country for exile in Japan. He returned to Korea in 1907 after he was pardoned by Emperor Sunjeong."
"In 1910, when Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan, Yun started a movement against the annexation. Yu was offered the title ""danshaku"" by the Government of Japan, but he refused it. He died in 1914 of a heart problem. He was aged 58."
Plot
Plot may mean:
Katherine Jackson
"Katherine Esther Jackson (born May 4, 1930 as Kattie B. Screws) is the matriarch of the Jackson family of musicians and singers, including Michael Jackson, La Toya and Janet Jackson. She is the widow of Joe Jackson."
"Jackson had 10 children. Several of the children became famous. In 1986 ""Essence"" honored her as ""Mother of the Year""."
"In 1990, Jackson released her autobiography, ""My Family"". The book told about her elderly years and her relationship with her husband and their children."
"On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died. Katherine was granted temporary guardianship of Michael's three children. In 2012 her guardianship was suspended for a short time. The guardianship resumed with TJ Jackson, Michael's nephew, added as a co-guardian."
Fax
"Fax (short for facsimile), or telecopying, is the transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device."
"The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which turns the contents (text or images) into a bitmap, Then the bitmap is sent through the telephone system. The receiving fax machine reconverts the coded image, printing a paper copy."
"Businesses usually have some kind of fax system, but the technology has faced increasing competition from Internet-based methods. Fax machines still retain some advantages, particularly in the transmission of sensitive material which, if sent over the internet, may be intercepted. However, encryption (a secret coding system) can make internet messages secure."
"In some countries, because electronic signatures on contracts are not recognized by law while faxed contracts with copies of signatures are, fax machines enjoy continuing support in business."
"In many businesses, standalone fax machines have been replaced by fax servers which receive and store incoming faxes electronically. The servers route them to users on paper or via a secure email. Such systems reduce costs by eliminating unnecessary printouts and reducing the number of inbound phone lines needed by an office."
History.
"On his journey home, Odysseus lands on the island of the Cyclops Polyphemus. They go inside his cave at the sight of sheep, cheese and milk. Polyphemus catches them and eats some of Odysseus' men. Odysseus tricks and blinds him and they escape. The Cyclops prays to his father Poseidon that Odysseus would not get home to Ithaca and if he was fated to make it home, Odysseus would lose all of his men, his ship and find trouble at home. This prayer becomes the plot line of the Odyssey."
The Sirens.
"Odysseus and his ship have to pass the Sirens' island. The Sirens were always singing very beautifully, so sailors would try to go to them, but their ships would get destroyed, and they would die."
"Odysseus tells his men to put wax in their ears, so they will not hear the song of the sirens. He also tells his men to bind him to the ship's mast, so he cannot go to the sirens when he hears their song. His men can then look at Odysseus and see when he cannot hear the sirens anymore, because he is calm again. Then they can take the wax out of their ears, and free Odysseus."
Calypso.
"After escaping from the sea, and the death of his men, Odysseus comes to the island Ogygia. On this island lives the nymph Calypso, and Odysseus stayed with her for seven years. But then the god Hermes came and told her that the gods said that she had to let Odysseus go. Calypso promised Odysseus immortality (that he would live forever) if he stayed, but he wanted to go back to his wife Penelope. So Odysseus built a raft and left her."
The Phaeacians.
"After a storm, Odysseus comes to the island of the Phaeacians. There he is found by the king's daughter Nausicaä. Nausicaä brings him to the palace of her father, King Alkinoos. During his time there, Odysseus tell the story of his journey. After this, Alkinoos gives Odysseus a ship and sends him home to Ithaca."
Return home.
"During all this time, Penelope has been keeping the suitors at bay with a ruse (trick). She promises ""I will choose when I have finished weaving this cloth"", the cloth being a burial cloth for Odysseus' father. However, every night her servant unpicks the work of the previous day. The story is made more real by Penelope becoming restless. The goddess Athena causes Penelope to feel the need to display herself, and fan the flames of the suitors' desire."
"Odysseus finally returns to Ithaca, where he disguises himself as a beggar. He goes to his home and meets his son Telemachus. Together they kill the suitors, who are trying to marry Penelope in order to gain his kingdom. Later, the families of the suitors come to kill Odysseus for revenge. The goddess Athena helps Odysseus by making them stop and give up the fight."
Mae West
"Mae West (August 17, 1893 – November 22, 1980) was an American actress. She worked in vaudeville and later in movies. She is best-remembered for her dirty jokes and comedy movies."
"Her name when she was born was Mary Jane West. She was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and died in Hollywood, California. Her mother was a German immigrant and former model."
Lenny Bruce
"Lenny Bruce (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), was an American comedian. His real name was Leonard Alfred Schneider. He is considered an innovator of modern stand-up comedy and changed the way many people see comedians. His jokes and routines were very improper and off limits for the time and he got in a lot of trouble for them. He is considered a hero for the defense of the First Amendment rights in the United States, especially for free speech."
"In the 1960s he was the last person arrested for impersonating and swearing, overwatched by martial law and police and banned from many cities and comedy clubs."
"He appeared on the cover of The Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album."
He died in 1966 of an accidental morphine overdose whist on trial.
"In 1970 the New York's highest court of appeals decided that he is ""not guilty for using bad words""."
Kimchi
"Kimchi (; ; ), also spelled kimchee or gimchi, is a traditional fermented Korean side dish made of vegetables with many seasonings. In traditional preparation, kimchi was stored underground in jars to keep cool during the summer months and unfrozen during the winter months. There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made from napa cabbage, radish, scallion, or cucumber as a main ingredient."
"Kimchi is usually very strong for non-Koreans. There are many different types and Koreans typically eat kimchi in every meal. It is a staple of Korean food. Kimchi can be stored for a long time and it does not go bad easily. However, when it is exposed to hot weather for certain time, kimchi turns sour. So, it should not be put out unless it is going to be eaten soon. In Korea kimchi pots are a common sight. They are large terra cotta pots where the kimchi is stored until it can be eaten or until it ferments. Kimchi usually takes about 2 weeks to ferment, but some varieties can be eaten right away. Some must be stored for over a year to be finished."
The fermentation gives the kimchi a pickle-like quality and generally soggy or limp kimchi is not good.
Varieties.
"Every different kind of kimchi has a special taste and a different amount of time to ferment. Baechu Kimchi is one of the most famous kimchi. Kkakdugi is made of cubed Korean radish (mu). It’s especially contains more water and is hard to chew. Baek kimchi uses milder ingredients. It’s not spicy. Chonggak kimchi has a smallish white radish that comes with a ponytail. Gat kimchi is made from dark green Korean mustard (gat) leaves and stems. These can be kept for months or even longer. As these age, they taste like lemons. Oi Sobagi has a refreshing, cool, and hot taste. Cucumber is the main ingredient for it. It can be kept for about a week. As it ages, it also taste like a lemon. Dongchimi is a food and a beverage all in one. When it ferments, it becomes sweet and taste a lot like lemon water. It can be kept for about a month."
Preparation.
"The most common variety of kimchi is made from cabbage, radish, garlic, red pepper, salt and sugar. The cabbage is soaked in salt water for a few hours. Coarse rock salt is then rubbed in between the leaves of the cabbage. Red peppers are also rubbed in and most Kimchi has a lot of pepper in it. The radish is usually cut into long thin strips and added to the mix. A little sugar is added to help the fermentation process along much in the same way beer is made. The amounts of each ingredient vary between the type of kimchi you are making and the personal taste of the maker. Most kimchi has a special taste with shrimp or fish. The kimchi is allowed to ferment for a period of time, usually outdoors in a large kimchi pot. It is also quite common for these pots to be buried under ground. Kimchi can be kept for a long time and does not go bad. Koreans make kimchi with their families in December."
"The Airbus A350 XWB (XWB standing for Extra Wide Body) is a type of airplane built by European aerospace company Airbus. It is a long-ranged aircraft with two engines and a wide body. It is said that the plane is able to hold and transport 250-350 passengers in a first class, business class, and economy class or a normal 3-class setting. On January 15, 2015, the A350-900 entered service with Qatar Airways, and the A350-1000 in February 24, 2018 with the same airline."

Dipodidae
The Dipodidae are a family of small to medium-sized rodents living in the northern hemisphere. The family has over 50 species in 16 genera.
"They include the jerboas, jumping mice, and birch mice. Different species are found in grassland, deserts, and forests. They are all capable of ""saltation"", which is jumping from a bipedal stance. This feature is most highly evolved in the desert-dwelling jerboas. Their movement resembles that of kangaroos more than that of true mice."
"Most species are nocturnal, and the eyes and ears are noticeably larger than usual in proportion to the body."
Personal defense weapon
"A personal defense weapon (PDW) is usually defined as a light, compact and easy to use firearm. However the definition varies depending on context and who you ask. Many will still say it is a short-barreled rifle (SBR). These are regulated in the United States by the ATF. Many SBRs have ""selective fire"" (you can switch between semi-automatic or fully automatic fire)."
"The United States Department of Homeland Security defines a personal defense weapon as an M4 carbine (or a Colt AR-15 civilian semi-automatic rifle). Some governments' definition of PDWs includes handguns. An example is the Czech Republic. It has proposed a constitutional amendment which would allow its citizens to own and keep PDWs as a way to discourage terrorists. Regardless, a PDW is usually agreed upon as being somewhere between a submachine gun and an assault rifle."
History.
"In the 1980s, the term was used for troops in tight, confined environments. They needed a compact automatic weapon that could defeat body armor. It was designed for troops in tanks, military trucks and those operating from aircraft including pilots. The majority of soldiers do not take part in an infantry battle. Their jobs are usually to support the infantry. Their main role is not winning a fight, but often to escape an ambush. In other situations they may assist the infantry. PDWs are also used by bodyguards as they can be hidden under a jacket but still allowed good firepower. PDWs tend to be shorter range weapons."
"The term evolved as concealed carry became more popular, especially in places like the United States. Certain states in the United States make carrying a firearm for personal defense relatively easy while others make it more difficult. Also, quite a few other countries allow concealed carry, to various degrees. Pistols, especially compact models, are very popular self defense weapons today. Also, there are now a number of pistols available in rifle calibers."
Alternative self-defense weapons.
"In places where a firearm cannot be carried or the person chooses not to carry a firearm, there are other weapons they can carry. Common items such as a credit card, car keys, a pen or even a scarf can be effective self defense weapons. Because of the popularity of self defense, there are also specially designed non-lethal weapons designed not to look like weapons."

Excise
"An excise or excise tax is an indirect tax charged on certain goods. As an indirect tax, they are charged by the producer or the merchant who then has to pay the government. For the same reason they are also not considered a sales tax. Excise taxes are commonly part of the retail price of a product such as gasoline, alcohol or cigarettes. Excise taxes may be charged by both state and federal governments."
Excise vs sales tax.
"Excise taxes are different from sales tax in two important ways. First, excise is charged only on specific goods. Sales tax can apply to most things a person might buy although certain jurisdictions may exempt food or clothing. Excise taxes are usually applied to luxury goods or products linked to health issues such as tanning salons or cigarettes. Secondly, sales tax is charged as a percentage of the purchase price. An excise tax is usually a fixed amount added to the price. It can be hard to tell how much excise tax a person pays because it is part of the purchase price. Sales tax is added to the price and is usually shown on the receipt."
US excise taxes.
"In the United States, excise taxes make up about 4 percent of all federal revenues. This is lower than many other countries. The Constitution refers to excise tax as an indirect tax. Some states in the United States have different names for excise taxes. For example, in the state of Massachusetts the excise tax charged on automobiles is called an ""ad valorem tax""."
Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on April 8, 1913, the Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States Constitution"
changed the method by which United States Senators were elected. For the first 125 years of the Constitution required US Senators to be elected by the state legislatures. A number of problems in the United States Senate created the need to change how Senators were elected from indirect to direct elections by the people of the United States.
Background.
"When the Constitution was adopted in 1788, Senators were to be elected by the state legislatures. This remained in effect for 125 years. By the late 19th century it became clear there were many problems with this procedure. In addition to long vacancies that lasted for months and even years, political machines had gained control over state legislatures. This corrupted the process and the Senate was seen as a ""millionaire's club"" who served private interests instead of the people. Beginning in the 1890s, the House of Representatives passed several resolutions for a constitutional amendment which proposed Senators be elected by direct election. The Senate refused to even take a vote on these proposals."
"At this point, many states changed their strategy. Article Five of the United States Constitution offers two methods for amending the Constitution. In addition to the common method of a two-thirds vote by both houses of Congress, was another method. It stated that if two-thirds of the state legislatures apply for one, Congress must call a constitutional convention. The method had not been used before. When it appeared two-thirds of the states wanted the change, Congress acted."
"On the Monopoly board are 40 spaces. In the four corners of the board are ""GO"", ""Free Parking"", ""JAIL"", and ""Go to Jail"". Along the sides of the board are properties (streets and businesses) for sale. The properties are: 22 ""streets"" (each marked with one of eight colors), 4 ""railroad stations"", the ""Electric Company"" and the ""Water Works"". There are also spaces called ""Income Tax"", ""Luxury Tax"", ""Community Chest"" and ""Chance""."
"In the original version, the properties and railroad stations were named after the streets in Atlantic City in New Jersey in the United States. In the British original version, they are named after streets in London."
Setting up the Game.
"To prepare for the game, the board is put in position. The Chance and Community Chest cards are shuffled and placed face down on the board. Each player chooses a token (a playing piece), such as a thimble, a rocking horse, a boot, a dog, etc. (the tokens vary depending on the edition), and places it on ""GO"". One player is chosen to be the banker - this player is trusted with handing out money from the bank and collecting players' spent money during the game."
"The banker gives each player $1500 to start with. Each player rolls the dice, and the player who rolled the highest total takes the first turn."
Rules.
The object of the game is to own as much land (property) and to be the richest player.
"The rules can be found in every ""Monopoly"" box, but a summary is listed here."
Moving Around The Board.
"On your turn, you roll the dice and move your token forward (clockwise around the edge of the board) the same number of spaces as the sum of the dice you rolled. You must then follow the instructions of whatever space your token lands on."
"If you roll doubles (the same number on both dice), you get to take another turn after this one is over. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you don't get your third turn but you must go directly to Jail (see below)."
Jail.
"The Jail space has two sections, labeled IN JAIL and JUST VISITING. If you land on Jail by your normal roll of the dice, place your token on JUST VISITING and nothing bad (or good) happens to you. But there are three ways to be placed IN JAIL:"
"If you are put into Jail, take your token from wherever it is and place it directly on IN JAIL. This does not count as a move, so if this causes you to go past GO, you don't collect $200 from the Bank. If you are put in Jail, your turn ends immediately, even if you rolled doubles and would get to take another turn."
"While you are in Jail, you still roll the dice on your turn but you don't get to move your token. There are three ways to get out of Jail:"
Note that being in Jail doesn't prevent you from doing anything else in the game - it just stops your token from moving around the board.
Different editions.
"There are many editions of Monopoly. Officially-licensed editions are produced by Hasbro itself or by USAopoly, and unofficial editions are published by Toy Vault. Official versions are named ""____ Monopoly"" (such as ""Star Wars Monopoly"") and feature the Monopoly logo, and unofficial versions are named ""____-Opoly"" (such as ""Python-Opoly"") and do not feature the Monopoly logo."
"Milton Bradley has produced editions to symbolize the decades of popular culture in America. For example, The 1970s Monopoly has spaces depicting the fashion of the time. Players can purchase bell bottom blue jeans instead of street properties."
"A number of video game adaptations have been made. In addition, many electronic editions exist that use credit cards instead of paper money."
"In India, a similar game is called Business."
"In Egypt, a similar game is called بنك الحظ (The Bank of Luck)."
"Acquire is another game with rules for more advanced business practices with stocks, but has similar basic concepts of Monopoly (owning properties of the same color, buying land and building on it, making the most money, etc.)."
Uses for Monopoly.
"People play Monopoly for different reasons. Some may play for family game night, others use it as a learning tool at school, and others play it just to have fun."
"Monopoly may be used as a teaching tool to teach children a variety of lessons while having fun. It teaches how to make deals when trading, playing fair (because cheaters never win), knowing the value of money, addition and subtraction, good sportsmanship, the thrill of competition, strategies and organization. At an elementary level, “it offers a marvelous vehicle for teaching mathematics”. Through the game, children explore different areas of mathematics: not only adding and subtracting but also probability, percentages, and patterns. At a higher level, teachers can use Monopoly to teach microeconomics principles."
Still Standing
"Still Standing is a CBS sitcom starring Mark Addy. It is about a working-class couple who live in Chicago, Illinois. Addy's character is a father of three with a wife named Judy (Jami Gertz).

"Martin Luther King, Jr. was staying at the Gaston Motel when it was bombed on May 11th. Fortunately, he had departed earlier. In the residence of A.D. King, King's younger brother, another explosion exploded. In response to the explosions, the demonstrators became more violent. They rioted across the city, torching buildings and cars and assaulting police officers. To restore control, soldiers from the United States Army were dispatched."
The Youth Protest.
"Despite its best efforts, the campaign did not receive the national attention that its strategists had hoped for. They decided to include students in the demonstrations. On May 2, almost a thousand African-American kids skipped school to join the protests. Demonstrators quickly overflowed the cells in Birmingham. With the cells full. He used police dogs and fire hoses on the kids. Images of children being hosed down and dogs being mauled made national headlines. The protests had drawn the attention of the entire country."
Results.
"Despite the fact that there were still numerous issues with racism, the Birmingham campaign helped to break down several barriers to segregation. When the new school year began in September of 1963, the schools were likewise integrated. The campaign's most important effect was the nationalization of the issues and the engagement of leaders like President John F. Kennedy."
Louisville metropolitan area

Yakutian horse
"The Yakutian (Yakut: Саха ата, Sakha ata) or Yakut is a horse breed that is native to the Republic of Sakha (or Yakutia) in Siberia. It is similar to the Mongolian horse and Przewalski's horse, but is larger than them. It is special because of how it adapts to the very cold climate of Yakutia. It is able to find and graze on vegetation that is hidden under deep snow. It can survive without shelter in temperatures that reach −70 °C (−94 °F)."
Breed traits.
"The breed averages 140 centimetres (13.3 hands) in stallions and 136 cm (13.2 h) in mares. It has a sturdy stature, thick mane, and heavy hair coat. It shares these traits with other northern horse breeds, like the Shetland pony, Fjord horse, and Icelandic horse."

Table tennis
"Table tennis, also known as Ping Pong (a trademarked name), is one of the most popular sports in the world, with players in many countries. It is played by two or four people on a table. To play this game, people use bats and small celluloid balls. You need also a net and a table. Table tennis was invented in England in 1880."
"The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), the worldwide organization, was founded in 1926, exactly 46 years after invention. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, 108 years after invention."
Many of the best players in the world today come from China.
History.
"The sport comes from England during the Victorian era, where it was played by the upper-class as a game to be played after meals. It has been suggested that simpler versions of the game should be developed by British military officers living in India during the 1860s or 1870s, who brought it back with them. A row of books stood up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to continuously hit a golf-ball."
"The name ""ping-pong"" was in wide use before the British manufacturer J. Jaques &amp; Son Ltd coined the term in 1901. The name ""ping-pong"" then came to describe the game played using the rather expensive equipment, Jaques provided, with other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold the rights to the ""ping-pong"" name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920's making the various associations change their names to ""table tennis"" instead of the more common, but trademarked, name."
"The next most important innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British addict of the sport, who discovered novelty celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them to be ideal for the game. This was followed by E.C. Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the racket by fixing a sheet of rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis became more popular by 1901, to the extent that tournaments were being organised, books being written on the subject, and an unofficial world championship was held in 1902."
"In 1921, the Table Tennis Association was founded, and in 1926 renamed the English Table Tennis Association. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926. London hosted the first official World Championships in 1926. In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association, now called USA Table Tennis, was formed."
"In the 1930's, Edgar Snow commented in ""Red Star Over China"" that the Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War had a ""passion for the English game of table tennis"" which he found ""bizarre"". On the other hand, the popularity of the sport waned in 1930s Soviet Union, partly because of the promotion of team and military sports, and partly because of a theory that the game had adverse health effects."
"In the 1950's, paddles that used a rubber sheet combined with an underlying sponge layer changed the game dramatically, introducing greater spin and speed. These were introduced to Britain by sports goods manufacturer S.W. Hancock Ltd. The use of speed glue beginning in the mid-1980's increased the spin and speed even further, resulting in changes to the equipment to ""slow the game down"". Table tennis was introduced as an Olympic sport at the Olympics in 1988."
Ping Pong
Ping Pong may refer to:
Nayarit
Nayarit is a middle sized Mexican state. It is on the West coast of Mexico (on the Pacific Ocean shore).
Native people from Nayarit are called Nayaritas (singular: Nayarita).
"The Nayarit Capital, is Tepic."
Filipino
Filipino might mean:
Mindanao
"Mindanao is one of the three main island groups in the Philippines. It is the southernmost major island of the Philippines, and is the only island in the Philippines to have many Muslim people. Mindanao is northeast of Sabah. It may also refer to the main island in the group."
Phylum
"A phylum (plural: phyla) is the third highest rank used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. The second rank is kingdom and the highest is domain. Usually biologists count about 32 phyla of animals, about 14 of plants, and about 8 phyla of fungus, but definitions vary."
"With genome analysis, groups of phyla have been put together based on evolutionary relationships. These are informal, not part of the standard classification."
"Botanists usually prefer the word ""division"" instead of ""phylum""."
Disease.
"For centuries, people around the world have used mass graves when many people died at once from epidemics of diseases. The goal of this type of mass grave is not to disrespect the bodies of the dead. The goal is to prevent disease from spreading from the dead to the living. Also, if too many people have died, it may be impossible to bury them all separately."
"For example, during outbreaks of the bubonic plague (""The Black Death"") in Europe, people were terrified of catching this disease from dead bodies. Often they buried plague victims in mass graves. Daniel Defoe, who lived during the Great Plague of London in 1655-1666, wrote about one mass grave:"
"However, at some mass graves for plague victims, people still tried to honor the dead with Christian burial traditions."
Disasters.
"More recently, victims of natural disasters have been buried in mass graves. Like with mass graves for disease victims, mass graves for disaster victims are not meant to disrespect the dead. In disasters where many people die, it may not be possible to bury each person one by one."
"For example, after 2010 Haiti earthquake, there were tens of thousands of bodies in the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince. In the first nine days after the earthquake, about 90,000 people were buried in mass graves, using bulldozers. There were so many bodies that there was no room, and not enough workers, to bury them one by one."
"One Haitian man, who helped bury 2,500 people in three mass graves, said: ""You have to understand that it's completely un-Haitian to dump bodies like this. We have extreme respect for the dead. And these people deserve a decent burial."" Later, he and other volunteers put up crosses to mark the graves, put holy water on the graves, and had a priest say prayers for the dead. Like at the mass graves for the plague victims, they were still trying to honor the dead, even though they had to bury them in mass graves."
"Some areas in Japan also had to use mass graves after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In Japan, most people are cremated after they die. However, there were too many victims, and not enough kerosene to cremate them or dry ice to keep the bodies from decomposing. In one town, cremating all the town's victims would have taken 100 days. Because of this, some towns had to use mass graves to bury the dead."
Murder and genocide.
"Throughout history, people and governments that have murdered many people have buried them in mass graves. Unlike mass graves for victims of disease or disasters, this type of mass grave is often meant to disrespect the bodies of the dead after they are murdered."
Mass graves have been found from many of the international wars and civil wars in modern history. Here are a few examples.
World War I.
"During World War I, on July 19, 1916, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were killed in a battle with the German Army. In 2008, about 250 of their bodies were found in mass graves, where the Germans had buried them."
World War II.
The Holocaust.
"During The Holocaust, Nazi Germany killed six million Jewish people and millions of other people. Nobody knows exactly how many of these people are buried in mass graves. However, here are some examples of mass graves from Nazi murders:"
Soldiers' graves.
"During World War II, German soldiers who died when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union were buried in mass graves in Eastern Europe. In 2013, the German War Graves Commission moved 70,000 soldiers from mass graves to a cemetery in Russia. This was the 82nd cemetery the Commission had built to re-bury soldiers buried in mass graves. All together, the 82 cemeteries hold more than 800,000 German soldiers. The Commission says there are at least 250,000 more German soldiers buried in mass graves throughout Eastern Europe."
"The Soviet Union also used mass graves during World War II. For example, in the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery, they buried almost 500,000 civilians and soldiers in 186 mass graves. These people had died or been killed during the Siege of Leningrad."
The Soviet Union.
"In the Soviet Union, as many as 20 million people may have died or been murdered while Joseph Stalin ruled the government. Most of them were Soviet civilians. Many were buried in mass graves."
The biggest include:
The Korean War.
"Early on in the Korean War, South Korea killed at least 100,000 people who had been put in prison for their political beliefs. They buried many of these people in mass graves. In 2007, the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Committee found four mass graves, with more than 400 people in them. The Committee estimates that there are about 150 mass graves in South Korea."
The Vietnam War.
"During the Vietnam War, in the Huế Massacre, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army murdered between 2,800 and 6,000 civilians and prisoners of war. They buried the bodies in dozens of mass graves."
Genocide in Cambodia.
"From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge, ruled by Pol Pot, controlled Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge committed a genocide against the Cambodian people. Historians and scientists say that there are at least 20,000 mass grave sites in the country, holding at least 1,386,734 victims of execution."
Other wars.
"During the Bosnian War (1992-1995), the Bosnian Serb Army killed more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in the Srebrenica genocide. They buried them in mass graves. In 2003, mass grave specialists found a mass grave that was ""as big as a tennis court."" It included victims of the Srebrenica genocide. By 2006, 42 mass graves had been found around Srebrenica, and specialists think there are at least 22 more. Another 2,070 victims have been found in the graves."
"During the Kosovo War (1998-1999), Serbian soldiers committed many war crimes against the Albanian people. As of 2010, six mass graves had been found in Serbia with Albanian victims inside. The largest had between 705 and 1,000 bodies in it."
Life.
"He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He attended Copenhagen University and earned his master's degree in 1841. During this time, he met and fell in love with Regine Olsen in 1837. Although they were engaged for a time, Kierkegaard ended the engagement in 1841."
"After breaking up with Regine, he spent much of his time writing book after book, in a highly dramatic yet subtle way. He also wrote some of his works using pen names, or pseudonyms. He died in Copenhagen. Although his works were not very popular during his lifetime, after his death they became influential in the 20th century."
Works.
"Books by Kierkegaard. ""Either/Or"" and ""Fear and Trembling"", both published in 1843, are thought to be especially significant."
Despotism
"Despotism is a form of government that is controlled by one person or a small group of people. The person who controls the state is called a ""despot"". The despot has complete control of the state, like a dictator or tyrant. In history, the pharaohs of Egypt were despots. The word ""despot"" is thought to come from the Ancient Greek word ""despotes"", which means ""the master""."
"According to Montesquieu, the difference between absolute monarchy and despotism is as follows. In the case of the monarchy, a single person governs with absolute power by fixed and established laws, whereas a despot governs by his or her own will and caprice."
The importance of the idea of despotism is that today it is a very common type of dictatorship or direct rule. Ruling monarchies are today few in number.
"Even when there are elections, as there are for the Russian presidency, opposition candidates are at such a disadvantage that they are rarely, if ever, successful."
"Despotism has always been associated with Eastern rather than Western states. Of the former Soviet Union, it is only the new states to the west which have attempted, with difficulties, to build genuine democracies (such as Moldova and Ukraine)."
Lakshadweep
"Lakshadweep (; ISO: , formerly known as the Laccadive, Minicoy and Aminidivi Islands (), are a group of islands in the Arabian Sea. They belong to India. Their capital is Kavaratti. It covers an area of . Eleven of the 36 coral atoll islands of Lakshadweep are inhabited."
"The islands are the only coral atolls in India. The people living there are Malayalam and Mahl people, who have been influenced by Arab traders. Lakshadweep is a Muslim region just like the neighbouring Maldives, where tourism is strictly regulated. Lakshadweep has the largest percentage of Muslims - 98%, even larger percentage than Jammu and Kashmir and is the only Muslim-majority Indian administrative division entirely within India."
"Apart from the emerging tourism, government jobs, fishing and coconut production are the mainstays of the Lakshadweep economy."
Daman and Diu
"The territory used to belong to Portugal. In 1961, Indian soldiers and air fighters took control of the territory. In 2020, it merged with Dadra and Nagar Haveli to make a new union territory, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu."
Riding helmet
"A riding helmet, sometimes called a horse riding helmet, is a type of helmet made for people who ride horses. It is important to wear a riding helmet when riding. It is easy for a person to fall off a horse and hit his or her head. Riding helmets keep the rider of a horse from being hurt. Horses can accidentally step on a person who has fallen to the ground."
"Helmets should be worn by all riders, but are most often worn by English style riders."
Ketchup
"Ketchup is a kind of thick, liquid sauce. It is made from tomatoes, so it is sometimes called tomato sauce. Usually it is used to add flavour to food. Some people like to eat sausages, burgers, hotdogs or fishsticks with ketchup. Ketchup tastes very unlike the real tomato."
History.
Tomato ketchup.
"Although today's ketchup is tomato based, it did not appear until about a century after other types. By 1801, a recipe for tomato ketchup was created by Sandy Addison. It was later printed in an American cookbook, the ""Sugar House Book"". James Mease published another recipe in 1812. In 1824, a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in ""The Virginia Housewife"". This was an important 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson's cousin."
"As the century went on, ketchup became more popular in the United States. More Americans began to like tomatoes. Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers. A man named Jonas Yerks (or Yerkes) is believed to have been the first man to make tomato ketchup a national phenomenon. By 1837, he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally. Shortly after that, other companies did the same. F. &amp; J. Heinz created their tomato ketchup in 1876. Heinz tomato ketchup was advertised: ""Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household!"""
"The ""Webster's Dictionary"" of 1913 defined ""catchup"" as a ""table sauce made from mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc. [Written also ketchup]."""

Eric Nickulas
"Eric Nickulas (born March 25, 1975 in Hyannis, Massachusetts) is an American professional ice hockey right winger who last played for the ERC Ingolstadt of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Nickulas has also played a total of 7 seasons in the NHL; 4 with the Boston Bruins, 2 with the St. Louis Blues and 1 with the Chicago Blackhawks. He won the Calder Cup in 1998 while he was apart of the Boston Bruins farm team, the Providence Bruins."
Halteres
"Halteres are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings in flies. They vibrate during flight, and help the insect fly better."
"The halteres evolved from wings. Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings, like dragonflies, hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do. Flies have only the front pair of wings."
Function.
"Halteres help balancing and improve flight. They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also help stabilise the head during flight."
"They are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes, telling the insect about its body position during flight."
"Every vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration, a result of the Coriolis effect. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres."
"The two halteres vibrate in different planes, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect. This increases the information got from the halteres."
Development.
"In Diptera, the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene ""Ultrabithorax"" (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing. This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development; a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype."
Convergent evolution.
"The Strepsiptera, small insects parasitic on bees, wasps and cockroaches, also have halteres. We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the ""forewings"" evolved into halteres while, in the Diptera, the ""hindwings"" changed into halteres. This is a classic case of convergent evolution."
"Grimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects, and ""in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight""."
Piano Duos.
"Some works are written for two people to play together using two pianos. These are usually called piano duos. Examples include Mozart’s Sonata in D major K448. The Sonata op 34 by Johannes Brahms started as a string quintet but he changed it to a piano concerto, then a piano duo, and eventually a piano quintet. The Suite op 17 by Rachmaninoff is another. Most piano duos are very hard to play and need very good pianists. Piano concertos can be played on two pianos, with one player playing the solo part and the other playing the orchestra’s music."
Piano Six Hands.
"There is also a small repertoire of pieces for three people to play at one piano. This is called Piano six hands. These pieces are often fun pieces which are not too hard to play, although there are examples of serious pieces. The three people need to be good friends, because it is a bit of a squash. The player at the bottom ought to do the pedalling but it may be easier for the middle player to do it."
Piano six hands
"Music described as piano six hands is for three pianists at one piano, as distinct from piano duet which is music for two pianists at one piano, and from piano trio which is music for piano, violin and cello. Not much music has been written for this combination, although there are several arrangements of music originally written for other forces."
Examples.
"Compositions include 5 pieces by Percy Grainger, Sergei Rachmaninoff's Romance and Valse, Alfred Schnittke's Hommage, Carl Czerny's op.17 and 741, Jean Cras's ""Âmes d’enfants"", Paul Robinson (composer)'s ""Pensees"" and ""Monmartre"", various pieces by German composer Armin Fuchs, Bulgarian composer Tomislav Baynov's ""Metrorhythmia 1"", John Pitts's ""Are You Going?"", Greek composer Dionysis Boukouvalas's ""Fantasy on a theme by Steve Reich"", Canadian composer Paul Frehner's ""Slowdown"" and Italian composer Fabio Mengozzi's ""Promenade""."
Pedal
"A pedal is something that is made to work by someone's foot. The word ""pedal"" comes from the Latin word for ""foot"". Many things can be made to work by pedals. These include:"
Rice wine
"Rice wine is a word some people use to talk about alcoholic drinks. However, it is not a true wine, despite the name. True wine is made by fermenting grapes, and perhaps other fruit. In rice wine, the starch in the rice is first changed into sugar. This sugar is then fermented. This process is more like the fermentation as it is done in beer."
"The ""rice wines"" made in this manner have more alcohol in them than normal wines (18–25% alcohol compared to 10–14% for normal wines). Beers on the other hand usually have 4–8% alcohol in them."
"Many people use the term ""rice wine"" to refer to sake (which is just one variant of many different kinds of rice wines)."
Alcopop
"Alcopops are alcoholic drinks. They are also known as Ready-to-drink (RTD), Flavored Alcoholic Beverage (FAB) or Flavored Malt Beverage (FMB). They are usually available in bottles or cans. They contain about the same amount of alcohol as a beer. Usually, they are very sweet, so that the alcohol can not be tasted."
"There are two different kinds of this drinks. In Europe, they are usually spirits mixed with lemonade, like vodka with lemon juice (and a lot of sugar, so the alcohol cannot be tasted), or rum with fruit juice (also very sweet). In the US, they tend to be beers, which taste very sweet."
"Because they are very sweet, alcopops tend to be more popular among young people. Since the fact that they contain alcohol is usually not obvious from the taste, these drinks are considered to be dangerous for young people by many countries. These have either raised the taxes on the drinks, or they have outlawed the sale of these drinks to people under a certain age (usually 18, sometimes 21 years)."
Pedal (music)
"Pedals on musical instruments are used to control parts of the instrument, or provide extra notes."
There are several musical instruments which have pedals for various reasons.
Piano.
"The piano has at least two pedals; large concert grand pianos always have three. The pedal on the right (operated by the player's right foot) sustains the sound of the notes for as long as the pedal is depressed. It does this by lifting the dampers from the strings. Some of the other strings even start to vibrate as well (""in sympathy"")."
"The pedal on the left makes the sound quieter. It is called the ""una corda"" pedal (Italian for ""one string""). This is because, in the early days of the piano, the una corda pedal made all the hammers move over so that a hammer would only hit one string for each note instead of three (most notes on a piano each have three strings to make a bigger sound). On modern pianos the hammers actually hit two strings instead of just one. They also tend to hit the string at a point where the hammer is softer, away from the grooves which get worn in the hammerhead. On an upright piano the una corda pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings so that they do not hit them so hard."
"On pianos which have a middle pedal (called a sostenuto pedal) any note or chord which the player is holding down when the pedal is pressed will be sustained, but any more notes he plays afterwards will not be affected."
Organ.
On pipe organs there is a pedalboard with pedals which play notes in the same way that the fingers are playing notes. An organ pedalboard usually has two and a half octaves of notes. These are low notes written in the bass clef. An organist has to learn to play with the feet at the same time as with the hands. He uses the toes or the heels of his shoes. It is even possible to play four notes at once (four part chords) but this is very difficult and usually found in some modern French music.
FCSB
"FCSB is a football team from Bucharest, Romania. It was founded on 7 June 1947 as ""ASA Bucureşti"" (""ASA Bucharest""). The original FC Steaua București team was part of the namesake CSA Steaua București sports club and belonged to the Ministry of National Defence. FC Steaua București was forced to change its name to FCSB in 2017. It has won the most championships in Romania, 26, and it is the only team from Romania to win a UEFA Champions League title. Its chairman is George Becali (usually ""Gigi"" Becali)."
Chevrolet Express
Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana are full sized passenger or cargo vans made via General Motors. These vans seat between eight and fifteen passengers. The cargo vans are used for commercial and business purposes. The Express/Savana vans were first produced around 1996.
"Weatherford, Texas"
"Weatherford is a city in Parker County, Texas near Fort Worth. It is part of Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area."
Green River Formation
"The Green River Formation is an Eocene rock formation on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. It records sediment from a group of intermountain lakes. Its fine fossils make this a lagerstätte, a place of exceptional preservation."
"The various fossil beds of the Green River Formation span a 5 million year period, dating to between 53.5 and 48.5 million years ago (mya). During this period the climate moved from the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene."
"The sediments are deposited in very fine layers, in pairs: a dark layer from the growing season, and a light-hue inorganic layer in winter."
"Each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year. The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years. The mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18 mm, with a minimum thickness of 0.014 mm and maximum of 9.8 mm."
"The sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named after the present-day Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. The formation is in three separate basins around the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah:"
Conditions at the time.
The formation has many evaporites – minerals formed by the evaporation of lakes. This suggests that high salinity was one of the causes of the superb fossilisation.
Another factor was the frequent ash falls from nearby volcanoes. Rapid burial also prevents normal decomposition.
Climate.
"Fossils preserved suggest that the region was a low, subtropical, freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated."
"The Green River fossils show a transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene. The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles, which do not tolerate frost, and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore forests. As the lake configurations shifted, each Green River location is distinct in character and time. The lake system formed over underlying river deltas and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements"
Oil shale.
"The Green River Formation contains the largest oil shale deposits in the world. The 213 billion tons of oil shale contain an estimated 2.38 × 10¹¹ m³ (1.5 trillion US barrels) of shale oil. This is a tribute to the high volume of organic material that was buried. The source of the organic material was probably cyanobacteria, which thrive in warm alkaline lake conditions."
Fossils.
"The lagerstätten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds. Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away. Leaves of palms, ferns and sycamores, some showing the insect damage got during their growth, were covered with fine-grained sediment and preserved. Insects were preserved whole, even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets."
"The fauna included fish, alligators, bats, turtles, dog-sized horses, insects, and many other species of plants and animals"
Peggy Lee
"Norma Egstrom (May 26, 1920 - January 21, 2002) was an American actress and jazz singer. She is better known as Peggy Lee. She acted in many movies. She also wrote the music for them. She sang and acted for six decades. Lee was born in Jamestown, North Dakota."
Hurricane Alex (2010)
"Hurricane Alex was a rare June hurricane and the first tropical cyclone of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm first struck near Belize as a tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became a hurricane and struck northeast Mexico; it was the first hurricane in June since Hurricane Allison in 1995. The storm killed 51 people (33 directly) and caused almost $1.9 billion in damage (2010 USD)."
"The parable of the Faithful Servant and parable of the Ten Virgins, adjacent in Matthew, involve waiting for a bridegroom, and have an eschatological theme: be prepared for the day of reckoning. The parable of the Tares the parable of the Rich Fool, the parable of the budding fig tree, and the parable of the barren fig tree also have eschatological themes."
"Other parables stand alone, such as the parable of the unforgiving servant, dealing with forgiveness; the parable of the Good Samaritan, dealing with practical love; and the parable of the Friend at Night, dealing with persistence in prayer."
Art.
"Of the thirty or so parables in the canonical Gospels, four were shown in medieval art almost to the exclusion of the others, but not mixed in with the narrative scenes of the ""Life of Christ"". These were: the Ten Virgins, the Rich man and Lazarus, the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan. Artists famous for depicting parables include Martin Schongauer, Pieter the Elder Bruegal and Albrecht Dürer. The Workers in the Vineyard also appears in Early Medieval works. From the Renaissance the numbers shown widened slightly, and the various scenes of the Prodigal Son became the clear favorite, with the Good Samaritan also popular. Albrecht Dürer made a famous engraving of the ""Prodigal Son"" amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance, and Rembrandt depicted the story several times, although at least one of his works, ""The Prodigal Son in the Tavern"", a portrait of himself as the Son, revelling with his wife, is like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene. His late ""Return of the Prodigal Son"" (Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) is one of his most popular works."
Poetry and hymns.
"As well as being depicted in art and discussed in prose, a number of parables form the inspiration for religious poetry and hymns. For example, the hymn ""The Ninety and Nine"" by Elizabeth C. Clephane (1868) is inspired by the parable of the Lost Sheep:"
&lt;poem&gt;
There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold.
"But one was out on the hills away,"
Far off from the gates of gold.
Away on the mountains wild and bare.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.&lt;/poem&gt;
"Similarly, ""My Hope Is Built"" (Edward Mote, c. 1834) is inspired by the parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders, and ""How Kind the Good Samaritan"" (John Newton, c. 1779) is inspired by the parable of the Good Samaritan."
Harmony of parables.
"A sample Gospel harmony for the parables based on the list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels is presented in the table below. For the sake of consistency, this table is automatically sub-selected from the main harmony table in the Gospel harmony article, based on the list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels. Usually, no parables are associated with the Gospel of John, just allegories."
Parallels outside the canonical gospels.
"A number of parables have parallels in non-canonical gospels, the Didache, and the letters of Apostolic Fathers . However, given that the non-canonical gospels generally have no time sequence, this table is not a Gospel harmony."
Parable of the Barren Fig Tree
"The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree (Luke 13:6–9) written in the New Testament is a parable of Jesus. It is a parable about a fig tree which does not produce fruit, unlike the parable of the budding fig tree."
What Jesus said.
Then he told this parable:
What it means.
The owner of the vineyard represents God. The fig tree is a symbol for Jerusalem (and also for Jesus's church). The vineyard where the tree was planted is the earth. The tree was meant to bear the good fruit of the Holy Spirit and the gardener (vinedresser) is Jesus. Fig trees are often planted in vineyards.
"The parable indicates Jesus is giving his hearers one last chance to repent their sins. ""These three years"" refers to the period of his ministry on earth. The parable is connected to the miracle of cursing the fig tree. Richard Whately commented that this parable ""is one which our Lord may be said to have put before his hearers twice; once in words, once in action."""
Parable of the Budding Fig Tree
"The Parable of the Budding Fig Tree is a parable of Jesus. It is written in the New Testament in Matthew 24:32-35, Mark 13:28-31 and Luke 21:29-33. The parable compares the Kingdom of God with a budding fig tree, the opposite of the barren fig tree."
What Jesus said.
He told them this parable:
"The holes are drilled in at an angle so that the upper register is not overblown and produces an unpleasant sound. Whisper keys were also invented to prevent overblowing. The bassoon is known for its reedy sound. Its upper register is shrill and sometimes scary. Middle register could be used for lullabies because of its majestic and soothing tone. Its lower register is deep, dark, and could be used for scary movies and such."
History and repertoire.
"The bassoon developed from a renaissance instrument called the ""curtal"" or ""dulcian"". These were double reed instruments which often played with shawms. In the Baroque period the bassoon became popular as an instrument to play the bass line, perhaps playing the same as the cello. A man named Hotteterre made many parts of the modern bassoon. In the late Baroque period composers like Antonio Vivaldi wrote concertos for bassoon and orchestra. Some more famous bassoon concertos include one by Mozart, and in more recent times by Peter Maxwell Davies. The bassoon was a very important instrument in the orchestra. Mozart and Beethoven gave the bassoon important parts in the music."
Contrabassoon.
"In some pieces with a large orchestra a contrabassoon is used. This plays an octave lower than a bassoon, taking it right down to bottom B flat or C on the piano. Some contrabassoons are made to play a note lower, i.e. the very lowest note of the piano (A). One might expect to see the contrabassoon sticking up high above all the other instruments in the orchestra, but in fact the tube keeps doing U-turns, making four parallel rows of tubing. They are usually made with the bell pointing downwards. The weight is supported by a peg to the floor. The contrabassoon used to be shaped like a bassoon."
"The contrabassoon adds richness to the sound of a full orchestra. Listen carefully for the contrabassoon in the hymn-like introduction to the last movement of ""Symphony no 1"" by Brahms. It can be clearly heard, growling away, in the opening of the ""Piano Concerto for the Left Hand"" by Ravel."
Octave
An octave is the distance between two musical notes that have the same letter name.
If a musician sings or plays a scale (‘do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si-do’) the first and last ‘do’ are an octave apart. It is called an ‘octave’ because there are eight notes in a scale (‘octo’ is Latin for ‘eight’).
If a musician sings or plays the first two notes of the song “Somewhere over the rainbow” (i.e. the word ‘Somewhere’) these two notes are an octave apart.
"Two notes that are an octave apart sound very similar, almost like the same note. The scientific reason for this is that the top note vibrates twice as fast. For example: if someone plays Middle C on a piano, a hammer hits the Middle C strings inside and makes them vibrate 256 times a second. The C an octave higher will vibrate 512 times a second."
"Young children who learn the piano will not be able to stretch an octave with one hand, if their hands are too small. Most adults can stretch an octave easily (playing one note with the thumb, and the other with the little finger)."
Tinder
Tinder is a material that is used to start fires easily when lit with a match.
Some materials commonly used as tinder are:
Stephen Harper
"Stephen Joseph Harper (born April 30, 1959) is a Canadian economist, entrepreneur, and retired politician. He was the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada from 2006 to 2015. He is a member and the former leader of the Conservative Party, after being elected in 2004. He was elected in February 2006 and replaced Paul Martin as Prime Minister."
"Harper was born in 1959 in Toronto, Ontario and lives in Calgary, Alberta. He is married to Laureen Teskey and has two children. He is the third Prime Minister, after Pierre Trudeau and John Turner, to send their children to Rockcliffe Park Public School, in Ottawa. Stephen Harper was Prime Minister for nine years, during which Canada hosted both the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympic Winter Games. Harper also hosted the G8 and G20 meetings."
"Harper is a conservative and supports cutting government spending and taxes. As Prime Minister, he has cut the goods and services tax and approved a budget that would cut funding to several government programs. He has also shown support for the military and a bigger Canadian military presence in the northern part of Canada."
"Even though Harper did win the seat in the riding of Calgary Heritage during the October 19, 2015 federal election, the Conservative Party was defeated by the Liberal Party of Canada, which was led by Justin Trudeau and who succeeded Harper as Prime Minister. It was thereafter announced Harper would resign as party leader and had requested an interim leader be chosen to serve until a leadership election can be held."
Tadpole
A tadpole or polliwog is the larva of a frog. It breathes water and lives in the water. Tadpoles hatch from small eggs.
"Frog eggs are round and toad eggs are laid in long strings. Like bird eggs, they have nutrients (food) inside them for the young animal to grow before it hatches."
Movement.
"Tadpoles swim by lateral undulation: their tails move side to side, not up and down."
Food.
"Most types of tadpole eat only plants, for example algae on rocks. Some types of tadpole eat plants and animals, even other smaller tadpoles."
Metamorphosis.
and we get:
"This might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95, we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter ""μ"" between the stochastic endpoints"
and
"This does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter μ in the calculated interval. Every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample. In 95% of the cases, ""μ"" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases, it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:"
"As the desired value 250 of ""μ"" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated."
"The calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where μ might be in between (or not). Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. We ""cannot"" say: ""with probability (1 − α), the parameter ""μ"" lies in the confidence interval."" We only know that by repetition in 100(1 − α) % of the cases, μ will be in the calculated interval. In 100α % of the cases, however, it does not. And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens. That is why we say: ""with confidence level 100(1 − α) %, ""μ"" lies in the confidence interval."""
"The figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean μ. If we randomly choose one realisation, the probability that it contains the parameter is 95%. However, it is also possible that we may have unluckily picked the wrong one as well."
Emperor Richū
"was the 17th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Richū to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Richū""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
Some scholars identify him with King San in the Book of Song. King San sent messengers to the Song Dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425; and this historical person was succeeded by his younger brother.
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
"According to ""Nihonshoki"" and ""Kojiki"", he was the first son of Emperor Nintoku."
"Richū had two sons; but he was followed on the throne by his brother, who would become known as Emperor Hanzei. The enthronement of Hanzei by-passed Richū's two sons. Few other details have survived."
Two of Richū's grandsons would attain the throne as Emperor Kenzō and as Emperor Ninken.
Events of Richū's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Richū's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"In his sixth year of his reign, Richū died."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Richū.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun"") at Sakai. Richū is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Jacobitism
"Jacobitism was (and, to a much smaller extent, is) the political movement that tried to put the Stuart kings back onto the thrones of England, Scotland, and Kingdom of Ireland. The movement took its name from the Latin form ""Jacobus"" of the name of King James II and VII."
"Jacobitism began after the deposition of James II and VII in 1688. He was replaced by his daughter Mary II jointly with her husband and first cousin William of Orange. The Stuarts lived on the European mainland after that, sometimes trying to get back the throne with the help of France or Spain. The most important places of Jacobitism were Ireland and Scotland, especially the Scottish Highlands. In England, Jacobitism was strongest in the north, and some support was also in Wales."
A great number of Catholic people liked Jacobitism. They hoped the Stuarts would end bad laws. Lots of different helped the military campaigns for all sorts of reasons. In Scotland the Jacobite cause became a lasting romantic memory.
Tadao Horie
was a Japanese football player. He played for the Japan national team.
Biography.
"Horie was born in Hamamatsu on September 13, 1913. He played for Waseda WMW, which was consisted of players from his alma mater, Waseda University. At that club, he played with many futures Japan national team players, such as Motoo Tatsuhara, Yasuo Suzuki, and others."

Joint
A joint is the place where two or more bones make contact. They allow movement (except for skull bones) and give mechanical support.
"Joints have cartilage in between them, which help to make the movement flexible. Joints are described structurally and functionally. Structural classification is how the bones connect to each other; function is the degree of movement between the articulating bones."
Synovial bursa.
"A synovial bursa is a small fluid-filled sac lined by a synovial membrane. It has an inner capillary layer of viscous synovial fluid (bit like raw egg white). The bursa is ""a cushion between bones and tendons"" and/or muscles around a joint. This helps to reduce friction between the bones and allows free movement."
Hosni Mubarak
"Muhammad Hosni Said Mubarak (; 4 May 1928 – 25 February 2020), commonly known as Hosni Mubarak (), was an Egyptian politician. He served as President of Egypt from 14 October 1981 to 11 February 2011."
Mubarak became the vice-president of the Republic of Egypt after moving up the ranks of the Egyptian Air Force. Then he became the President after President Anwar Sadat was assassinated on 6 October 1981. His almost thirty-year presidency made him Egypt's longest-serving ruler since Muhammad Ali Pasha.
"As President of Egypt, Mubarak is thought to have been one of the most powerful leaders in the region. Under the 1971 Constitution of Egypt, Mubarak exercised strong control over the country and was generally considered a dictator. In 2005, he called an election and easily won it. Many opponents believed Mubarak changed the election results so he could win."
"In early 2011, during the Arab Spring, there were huge protests against his government. In the end, Mubarak resigned and handed over power to the armed forces. It is hoped that elections later that year for a new government. On 2 June 2012, Mubarak was sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering the shooting of protesters in the revolution that ousted him."
"On 13 January 2013, Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned Mubarak's sentence and ordered a retrial. On retrial, Mubarak and his sons were convicted on 9 May 2015 of corruption and given prison sentences. Mubarak was detained in a military hospital and his sons were freed 12 October 2015 by a Cairo court."
He was acquitted on 2 March 2017 by the Court of Cassation and released on 24 March 2017.
"He died on 25 February 2020 at a Cairo hospital after having surgery, aged 91."
Euclid
"Euclid of Alexandria () (about 325 BC–265 BC) was a Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt and worked at the Library of Alexandria. Little is known about this person, but people think he lived there when Ptolemy I was Pharaoh. It is not known where and when he was born."
The Elements.
"Euclid collected together all that was known of geometry, which is part of mathematics. His ""Elements"" is the main source of ancient geometry. Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day. In the book, he starts out from a small set of axioms (that is, a group of things that everyone thinks are true). Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers, based on those axioms."
"The ""Elements"" also includes works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, and possibly quadric surfaces. Apart from geometry, the work also includes number theory. Euclid came up with the idea of ""greatest common divisors"". They were in his ""Elements"". The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can fit evenly in both of the two numbers."
"The geometrical system described in the ""Elements"" was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today that system is referred to as Euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so-called non-Euclidean geometries which mathematicians developed in the 19th century."
Other works.
"Because they wanted people to trust the vaccine, Pfizer published the study protocols publicly. That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus. This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work."
"On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19. They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use. The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves."
The INN (International nonproprietary name) of this vaccine is tozinameran. INNs are a name for a particular vaccine or medicine to be used worldwide.
Adenovirus vaccines.
"The adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. It does not harm the human body much. Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases. Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus to then inject the adenovirus into the human body. The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses. After, it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them."
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca).
"In late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020."
The team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus. Then they injected that virus into test patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on. This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials. The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.
Ad5-nCOV.
"The Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine. This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it. Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway. They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military."
Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.
"The Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson &amp; Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration."
CoronaVac.
"The company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together. This is an inactivated virus vaccine. This means the team took the SARS-CoV-2 virus and changed it to make it harmless. The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too. The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3. This virus is called CoronaVac."
Sinopharm vaccine.
The company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China. It is an inactivated virus vaccine.
This vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name.
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin BRACE trial.
"The University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. It is a live-bacterium vaccine. The patiebt gets dead ""Mycobacterium tuberculosis"" bacteria injected into them while training their immune system to fight it. Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis, but it protected them from other diseases too. The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19. Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19."
Nasal vaccines.
"Scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins. After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth. The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are not sure why this works. As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines."
Statistics.
"As of January 27th, Israel is currently the leader in percentage of people vaccinated, followed by the USA and then the United Kingdom. Israel has reportedly vaccinated about 20% of it's population, or 2 million people."
"African Americans are less likely to get vaccinated than other Americans, as are people in the Southern United States."
Arthur's Nose
"Arthur's Nose is the popular first book of the book series, written and illustrated by Marc Brown. It was published in 1976. Arthur is an aardvark. The character of Arthur inspired several other picture books and was also made into an animated television series."
"In this first book, Francine the monkey teases Arthur for having a big nose. As a result, Arthur decides to get his nose cut shorter. However, instead, he leaves his nose the same and his friends are happy, except Francine."
Prey Veng province
Prey Veng is a province in Cambodia. The capital city is also named Prey Veng.
It is on the east bank of the Mekong river. The Bassac River is also in the province.
Vasily Chuikov
"Vasily Chuykov (February 12, 1900 – March 18, 1982) was a medieval fish."
"During World War II he was commanding the 62nd army, with which he was especially outstanding himself in the Battle of Stalingrad."
"He was twice Hero of the Soviet Union (1944, 1945)."
He was made Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1955.
Power Purchasing Agreement
"A Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) is a legal contract between a electricity provider and a land owner. The contract allows the electricity provider to produce power on the land owner's land or roof and the land owner buys the electricity primarily from the electricity provider. This deal is often done using solar technology, where the electricity provider will install, operate, and maintain solar panels on the land owner's roof. Then the land owner will buy the electricity from the solar panels on the roof. Part of the PPA is to set a price for the electrcity (often lower than the previous price the land owner was paying for power line electrcity). If the solar panels do not provide enough electricity for the land owner, then he will buy the rest of his electrcity from the power lines. If the electricity provider creates more electricity than the land owner needs, then he will sell the excess to the power lines."
Schools and government buildings often like to do power purchasing agreements because they do not have the money to install solar panals on their roof. Large department stores also like to do power purchasing agreements because they have large roofs and do not want to deal with the costs of installing and maintaining panels.
"Power Purchasing agreements tend to last 5 – 20 years. At the end of the PPA, either the contract is extended, the solar panels are removed from the property, or the land owner buys the solar panels from the electricity provider."
Power Purchasing agreements have been very important to the expansion of solar electricity use in the United States. Investment tax credits from the federal and state governments have helped make the price of solar panels affordable for the providing companies. The tax credit can help pay for significant percentage of the project cost in some cases.
Some of the electricity providers who offer PPAs are:
Pioneer plaque
The Pioneer plaques were a pair of plaques that were launched into deep space on Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11. The same image is on both plaques. The image is made up of many parts.
There is a drawing of a nude human female and a nude human male.
There is a diagram of the change in spin of the electron of a hydrogen particle. This diagram is meant to set up a universal unit of length and a universal unit of time for the rest of the image.
"There is a crude map of our solar system showing a spacecraft leaving the third planet, Earth. There have been negative reactions about the arrow showing the trajectory of the spacescraft. Alien species may not understand the human concept of a line and arrow."
"There is pattern of lines that looks like a star burst design. This is a map. There are 15 lines. 14 of the lines have a long binary number engraved along it. The binary numbers are distances. The distances are not in meters or kilometers, but in the universal unit of distance given by the hydrogen particle diagram. The 14 lines give the distance from the sun to 14 pulsars. The 15th line gives the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy."
Clube Atlético Mineiro
"Clube Atlético Mineiro is a Brazilian football club. Atletico Mineiro was founded in 1908 in the city of Belo Horizonte, where the team plays. The team has ""Galo"" (rooster) as its mascot, for this reason the club is also known simply as Galo."
"Atletico Mineiro is one of the most traditional football clubs in Brazil, being the first champion of the modern version of the Brazilian Football Championhsip. The most important achievement of the club was the Copa Libertadores de America in 2013, which is regarded as the most important tournament in South America."
"In the last five years, Atletico Mineiro is probably passing through the most victorious period in its history, since in the last five years the team has played five out of the nine Copa Libertadores editions the team has ever disputed."
Sport Club Internacional
S.C. Internacional is a football club which plays in Brazil.
Guarani FC
Guarani F.C. is a football club which plays in Brazil.
C.R. Flamengo
"The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched across Pangaea 5000 km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine, and was 700 km wide.p6 This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today."
Change of climate.
"The rainforest system collapsed about halfway through the Pennsylvanian, and was replaced by a cooler, drier climate."
"The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia, causing the zone of contact to be raised. The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period. China was too far away to be affected, and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years, into the early Permian.p30"
Structure.
"""Lepidodendron"" had tall, thick trunks that rarely branched and were topped with a crown of bifurcating branches bearing clusters of leaves. These leaves were long and narrow, similar to large blades of grass, and were spirally-arranged."
The closely packed diamond-shaped leaf scars left on the trunk and stems as the plant grew provide some of the most interesting and common fossils in Carboniferous shales and accompanying coal deposits. These fossils look much like tire tracks or alligator skin.
"The scars, or leaf cushions, were composed of green photosynthetic tissue, evidenced by the cuticle covering and being dotted with stomata, microscopic pores through which carbon dioxide from the air diffuses into plants. Likewise, the trunks of ""Lepidodendron"" would have been green, unlike modern trees which have scaly, non-photosynthetic brown or gray bark."
"""Lepidodendron"" has been likened to a giant herb. The trunks produced very little, if any, wood. Most structural support came from a thick, bark-like region. This region remained around the trunk as a rigid layer that did not flake off like that of most modern trees. As the tree grew, the leaf cushions expanded to accommodate the increasing width of the trunk."
"The branches of this plant ended in cone-like structures. ""Lepidodendron"" did not produce seeds like many modern plants. Instead, it reproduced by means of spores."
Stigmaria.
"Stigmaria are a type of branching tree root fossil found in Carboniferous rocks. They were the roots of coal forest lycopsid trees such as ""Sigillaria"" and ""Lepidodendron"". Each trunk had four of those roots. ""Stigmaria"" is a ""form taxon"", as the genus and species of the plant bearing the root cannot be identified."
DuPont
E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (often DuPont) is an American chemical company. Eleuthère Irénée du Pont founded it in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill. DuPont was the world's third largest chemical company based on market capitalization and ninth based on revenue in 2009. Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
"In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the cooling industry and later, more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair."
"Some of DuPont's trademarked brands have become genericized. For instance, “neoprene” was originally intended to be a trademark, but quickly came into common usage."
Melendi
"Ramón Melendi Espinosa (born 21 January 1979 in Oviedo, Asturias) is a Spanish pop and rumba singer. He studied in the school, Leopoldo Alas ""Clarín"" with the Formula 1 pilot Fernando Alonso. He wrote a song for him called ""Magic Alonso""."
Career.
"In 2003, Melendi made his first album ""Sin noticias de Holanda"" which had 12 songs. In December of the same year, he wrote two new songs, ""Asturias"" and ""Moratalá"", which were very successful. In 2004, one of his songs, ""Con la luna llena"", was chosen as the official song of a Spanish bicycling event called ""La vuelta ciclista España"". One year later, he made his second single album ""Que el cielo espere sentao"". He sold more than 200,000 copies of it. Some years later he made three more albums."
Melendi sings in concerts around Spain and South America.
Mojang Studios

"The Baluchistan States Union existed between 3 October 1952 and 14 October 1955 in modern southwest Pakistan. It was formed by the states of Kalat, Kharan, Las Bela and Makran with the capital at the town of Kalat. The area of the Union was roughly the western half of the modern province of Balochistan. The Union was separate from the Chief Commissioners Province of Baluchistan which comprised areas to the northeast of the Union. The Union did not include the enclave of Gwadar City which was part of the Sultanate of Oman. The four state rulers continued in office but some matters became the responsibility of the Council of Rulers."
Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)
The Chief Commissioners Province of Baluchistan was a former province of British India. It was in the northern parts of the modern Pakistani province of Balochistan.
Interwar period
"The interwar period was a time in history from 9 November 1918 to 1 September 1939, between the two world wars, World War I and World War II."
"The period began with many changes internationally. The League of Nations was created, which was made to bring peace to the world, but did not prevent problems with Nazi Germany, which soon left the League. Also occurred was the growing threat of Japan, which invaded China. Soon the Soviet Union and Italy had begun to rise as international powers. All of that happened in the 21 years and soon triggered World War II."
Modernism
"Modernism was a cultural movement of the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It changed art, literature, music, architecture and drama."
"Modernism rejected tradition. It was interested in new ways of doing old things. Also, there was a belief that science and technology could change the world for the better. The details differ greatly, and the term covers some movements which are somewhat contradictory."
Art.
"Modern art replaced classical art. It included abstract art, cubism, pop art, minimalism, and Dadaism. It affected sculpture quite strongly, though at the beginning sculptors like Rodin and Epstein made both traditional and modernist works. Henry Moore is one of the most famous modernist sculptors."
"Typical modernist painters were Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Kandinsky and Mondrian."
Music.
"Composers such as Stravinsky, George Antheil and Schoenberg are modernists. Stravinsky's ""The Rite of Spring"" (""Le Sacre du Printemps"") is a landmark work."
Dance.
"Ballets such as ""The Rite of Spring"" and ""Les Noces"" (""The Wedding"") mark the arrival of modernism into this traditional dance form. Modern dance outside of ballet started with Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller and Ruth St. Denis."
Literature.
"James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" is the classic example of modernism in the novel. ""Ulysses"" (1922) has been called ""a demonstration and summation of the entire Modernist movement"". Franz Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis"" (1915), ""The Trial"" (1925) and T.S. Eliot's poem ""The Waste Land"" (1922) are also prime examples. Looking back, it is clear that: Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" (1866) had a great influence on other writers."
"The arrival of magic realism is part of modernism. The novels and short stories of Mikhail Bulgakov such as ""Diabolidad"" and ""The Master and Margarita"" are examples."
Architecture.
"Modernism in architecture is found in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius the founder of Bauhaus, and Mies van der Rohe. Le Corbusier's famous remark ""A building is a machine for living in"" shows how different his thinking was to architects of the 19th century. The skyscraper, such as Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York (1956–1958), became the archetypal modernist building."
Criticism.
"A criticism of the modern movement is that it does not value tradition, and goes in for change for the sake of change. What modernists want most is freedom of expression, or, perhaps, freedom of experimentation. This is why many modern paintings avoid making visual copies of real things. In modernist literature, an author may leave out plots or narrative or characterization in books."
"These experiments were not random. They drew on the ideas of their day: mass media, science and technology, Marxism, Freudian psychology, and so on. There was a general search for new materials, new methods and new ideas. There was often a rejection of elitism, and a love of populism and popular culture."
Another criticism was of the connection between modernism and socialism. Certainly many modernists were also socialists. In the early days of socialism it seemed to offer hope of a new future without the baggage of the past. This also explains their rejection of tradition.
Victorian era
The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was a time of Queen Victoria's rule from 1837 to 1901. This time was very prosperous for the British people. Trade was at its best. A well educated middle class ruled the country and the British Empire. Other countries also prospered but Britain became the greatest great power.
"The Industrial Revolution continued to increase productivity and prosperity, especially in the middle and later parts of Victoria's reign. Making iron and steel was a basic industry. The furnaces were fired with coal. Shipbuilding was a major industry. Canals and steam railways connected all parts of the country, and British steamships connected the world. Cotton and wool were made into cloth and exported. Ceramics were also a major industry."
Nevzat Tarhan
"Kaşif Nevzat Tarhan (born on July 7, 1952 in Merzifon, Amasya, Turkey ) is a Turkish medical scientist, psychiatrist and neuropsychology expert."
Life.

"Between 1996 – 1999 he worked at Yüzüncü Yıl University as faculty member and as an expert at Forensic Institution. He got retired on his own will. He took the representation of ""Memory Center of America"" in Turkey in 1998."
"He has been the chairman of the board of NPİSTANBUL, the first neuropsychiatry hospital of Turkey, and also the founding rector of Üsküdar University."
He has more than a hundred publications 31 of which are international. He speaks English and German. He is married and has two children.
Romantic orientation
"Romantic orientation, also called affectional orientation, indicates the sex or gender that a person is most likely to have a romantic relationship with. It is compared to the term ""sexual orientation"". Romantic orientation is based on the idea that sexual attraction is one component of a larger picture. For example, although a pansexual person may feel sexually attracted to multiple genders, they may be predisposed to romantic intimacy with females. For asexual people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation, as some are not aromantic."
Carbon sequestration
"Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in the atmosphere. One method of sequestration is by capturing CO2 produced by power plants and factories before they release it into the atmosphere. When the CO2 gas is in long-term storage, that means it has been sequestered."
Carbon sequestration aims to assist in elimination of human introduced carbon from Earth's atmosphere by disrupting the carbon cycle. It is also used to prevent future human caused climate change.
Methods.
There are two long-term ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere:

Bain-marie
"A bain-marie (or water bath) is a piece of equipment used in science, industry, and cooking to heat materials gently and gradually to fixed temperatures, or to keep materials warm over a period of time."
Description.
"The bain-marie comes in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types, but traditionally is a wide, cylindrical, usually metal container made of three or four basic parts: a handle, an outer (or lower) container that holds the working liquid, an inner (or upper), smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked, and sometimes a base underneath. Under the outer container of the bain-marie (or built into its base) is a heat source."
Typically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working liquid.
"The smaller container, filled with the substance to be heated, fits inside the outer container, filled with the working liquid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed. The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching."
"When a bain-marie is filled with water the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees Celsius (the boiling point of water at sea level). Using different working liquids (oils, salt solutions, etc.) in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures."
Alternatives.
"A contemporary alternative to the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric ""dry-heat"" bain-marie, heated by element below both pots. The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions. They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts."
"Electric bains-marie can also be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type bain-marie heats via a small, hot-water tub (or ""bath""), and the vapour-type bain-marie heats with scalding-hot steam."
Origin.
"Bains-marie were originally developed for use in the practice of alchemy, when alchemists needed a way to heat materials slowly and gently. In that early form of chemical science, it was believed by many that the best way to heat certain materials was to mimic the supposed natural processes, occurring in the Earth's core, by which precious metals were believed to be germinated."
"The name comes from the medieval-Latin term ""balneum"" (or ""balineum"") ""Mariae""—literally, ""Mary's bath""—from which the French ""bain de Marie"", or ""bain-marie"", is derived. There are many theories as to how the name ""Marie"" came to be associated with this equipment:"

Battle of the year
"Battle of the year (acronym BOTY) is a worldwide breakdancing tournament held every year. In 1990, Thomas Hergenröther founded BOTY in Hannover, Germany. There were 9 crews and 400 visitors at that time. As break-dancing became more popular, BOTY grew in size and found a new location in Braunschweig, Germany."
"Regional BOTY (BOTY France, BOTY Korea and so on) first takes place to choose a single crew that will represent each nation in the upcoming BOTY international. Representing crews compete against each other first in a showcase in which every crew presents their own choreographed performances within 6 minutes or so. According to the rankings of the showcase, 2 semi finals in total between 1st and 4th crew and 2nd and 3rd crew takes place. The final battle follows between the winners of the semi finals to judge the champion crew of the year."
"Judging Criteria for a showcase include; synchronicity, stage-presence, theme &amp; music and choreography."
"Criteria for individual B-Boys include; top rock, footwork, freeze and power move."
"Criteria for a battle include; response, routines, strategy and attitude."

Foot binding
"Foot binding is an old Chinese custom of wrapping girls' feet with cloth in order to stop them from growing with age. Some Chinese legends say people started binding women's feet as early as the Shang dynasty (1700–1027 BCE). However, writing says that foot binding began at the court of the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE). It lasted until the early 20th century, when it was banned by the People's Republic of China."
"Foot binding was a sign of social status. If a woman's feet were bound, it was a sign that she was a higher-class woman who did not have to do hard work. However, foot binding slowly spread to the lower classes who wanted to try and get a higher social status. By the 17th century, Chinese girls of all social statuses had their feet bound."
Some people think that Chinese women were forced to bind their feet in order to help their husbands feel sexual pleasure. Some people also see foot binding as insulting to women. But other people argue that this view is biased against the Chinese culture in favor of modern Western standards.
"Foot binding usually tried to make the feet about long, at most. Some drastic things were done at times to try to do this. Because of this, women who had their feet bound would usually be impaired, or damaged, for the rest of their lives. The physical consequences (or results) of foot binding stayed in Chinese society until very recently, especially for women in their 70s and 80s (according to a study published by the University of San Francisco}."
"When the Manchuria created the Qing dynasty, the Manchurian emperors wrote many laws banning foot binding. However, the laws did not work very well. In 1874, the first anti-footbinding committee (meeting of people) was held in Shanghai by a British priest. After the collapse of the Qing dynasty, the republican government kept trying to stop foot binding. They gave fines (orders to pay money) to women who still had their feet bound after 1915. During the early 20th century, western fashion was affecting China more and more. The People's Republic of China eventually outlawed foot binding, although this was not very successful in actually ending the practice. According to Xinhua News Agency, the last factory to make shoes for bound-feet women stopped making those shoes in 1998, in Harbin, China."
Udenhout
Udenhout is a town in The Netherlands. In 1232 the abbey of Tongerlo was started which grew into the village that is now called Udenhout.
Udenhout has been part of the municipality of Tilburg since 1997.
History of Udenhout.
"There was a pilgrim who arrived after long reis going in Udenhout. He knocked in a castle whose lord was hospitable. He knew that he could spend the night. When he did not aanklopte castle or one of his employees open, but a buck driver. They were descendants of Hugo de bokkerijder. They were murdered and their lord moved into the castle. The pilgrim told how God would think about. But, they are not much of. The pilgrim was thrown from the castle. He walked across and looked at again. But the castle was gone. God had heard his word and the goats driver punished. Since then we call this the castle sunk castle. There is also a district that is named after this castle and also the shape and construction of a real castle. But the actual castle is still not found."

"Mount Kisco is a village and a town in Westchester County, in the state of New York. One story says it was named after an Algonquian Native American chief who once lived in the area. There is another story which says that the name came from the Algonquian word meaning the ""edge of creekland"", or ""a muddy place"". It is a suburban town about 40 minutes from New York City by car. There is also a train to New York. The village has more than 10,000 people, who live in an area of 3.1 square miles. There are approximately 2,500 families living in Mount Kisco."
"Mount Kisco is a part of the Bedford School District, which has five elementary schools, one middle school, and a high school. The village is run by a Mayor and four trustees. It has a commercial hub in the center of the village. Around the Mount Kisco Library are the shopping corridors on South Monger Avenue. Mount Kisco is a relatively quiet town; however, it is currently suffering from increased traffic."
History.
Examinations.
The RCO offers five qualifications or diplomas.
ARCO
"ARCO (short for Atlantic Richfield Company, the original name) is a United States oil company. It has operationsn 2 in the United States, Indonesia, the North Sea, and the South China Sea. As of July 2011, it had more than 1,300 gas stations in the western part of the United States."
ARCO's original parent companies included:
"The two companies merged in 1966, and bought Sinclair Oil Corporation in 1969. In 1978, ARCO opened its first ampm convenience store."
"Between 1970 and 2000, ARCO had a complicated corporate history. By 1985, it sold its Eastern US business to a new Atlantic Petroleum. In 2000, the remaining Western US business was bought by British Petroleum (BP). Finally, in 2013, BP sold ARCO and the Carson Refinery to Tesoro for $2.5 billion."
Oil discovery.
"In 1957, Richfield was the first to drill for oil in Alaska. On July 15 of that year they struck oil with their first well. It was the first major oil discovery in Alaska and tested at 900 barrels a day. In 1968 they partnered with Exxon for Alaska North Slope oil production. In 1980, they were the seventh largest oil company in the United States."
Skating
Skating refers and involves any sport or recreational activity that involves traveling on dry surface or ice using skates.
"There are many varieties of skating, such as:"
Economic bubble
"An economic bubble happens when a market goes through a very fast inflation of value. This increase is followed by a quick decrease in value, called a ""crash"" or a ""bubble burst"". Economic bubbles can be caused by many things, but many economists believe that economic bubbles are related to inflation. An economic bubble can cause an economic crisis due to a loss of investment both by companies and individuals, such as the Great Depression or the Economic crisis of 2007-2010."
"An economic bubble occurs due to the human psychology of an expectation of an unlimited demand for any particular commodity. The market moves up quickly as the investors see an increase in prices due to increase in demand. Prices may eventually fall when supply increases beyond the demand, resulting in the bursting of the bubble. Predicting when this will happen is difficult, hence it may surprise investors."
Population without double counting
Population sans doubles comptes is a phrase in French that means population without double counting in English.
"In France, because of the census, the INSEE has allowed people who live in one place and study in a different place to be counted twice, so as to show how the population moves. Because of this, each commune in France has many numbers of how many people live in it. For example, students may be counted where they study and where they live but do not study (the place they were born in). It is just like allowing students in the United States to vote in the town election of the place they are studying in and the town election where they were born."
Glass transition
The glass transition is the transition of amorphous solids from a hard and brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state. An amorphous solid that goes through a glass transition is called a glass. Supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state is called vitrification.
"The glass transition temperature ""T""g is always lower than the melting temperature, ""T""m, of the crystalline state of the material, if one exists. Above a glass transition temperature, a plastic is rubbery. Below the glass transition temperature, a plastic is solid. Thermosets, or thermo-setting plastics, burn up before they reach their melt temperature, but most thermosets also undergo glass transition."
Uncle Tom's Cabin
"Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly is an anti-slavery novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe. It was published in 1852. It greatly influenced many people's thoughts about African Americans and slavery in the United States. It also strengthened the conflict between the Northern and Southern United States. This led to the American Civil War. The book's effect was so powerful that Lincoln said when he met Stowe at the beginning of the Civil War, ""So this is the little lady who made this big war."""
"The main character of the novel is Uncle Tom, a patiente sentimental novel showed the effects of slavery. It also said that Christian love is stronger than slavery."
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was the most popular novel of the 19th century, and the second best-selling book of the century (the first one was the Bible). It helped abolitionism spread in the 1850s."
"In these days, it has been praised as a very important help to anti-slavery. However, it has also been criticized for making stereotypes about black people."
"The east coast of South America is shaped somewhat like the west coast of Africa, and this gave a clue that continents moved over long periods of time (continental drift). The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now, because of sea-floor spreading from the mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself or subducting into the mantle."
Geography.
"The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. It connects with the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar."
"In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The 20° East meridian defines its border."
"In the southwest, the Drake Passage connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific."
"The Atlantic Ocean is second in size to the Pacific. It occupies an area of about . The volume of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas (the seas next to it), is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres."
"The average depth of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas, is . The greatest depth is Milwaukee Deep near Puerto Rico, where the Ocean is deep."
Gulf Stream.
"The Atlantic Ocean has important ocean currents. One of these, called the Gulf Stream, flows across the North Atlantic. Water gets heated by the sun in the Caribbean Sea and then moves northwest toward the North Pole. This makes France, the British Isles, Iceland, and Norway in Europe much warmer in winter than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada. Without the Gulf Stream, the climates of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same, because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole."
"There are currents in the South Atlantic too, but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on South Africa."
Geology.
"The main feature of the Atlantic Ocean's seabed is a large underwater mountain chain called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It runs from north to south under the Ocean. This is at the boundary of four tectonic plates: Eurasian, North American, South American and African. The ridge extends from Iceland in the north to about 58° south."
The salinity of the surface waters of the open ocean ranges from 3337 parts per thousand and varies with latitude and season.
Mercury
Mercury may mean:
Mercury (element)
"Mercury, also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum (pronounced hai-DRAR-jər-əm), is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table is Hg, and its atomic number is 80. Its atomic mass is 200.59."
"The symbol ""Hg"" stands for its Latinized Greek name ""hydrargyrum"", meaning watery or liquid silver."
History.
No one has the credit for finding mercury. It was known in ancient times. Mercury was found in Egyptian tombs that are from 2000 BC.
"Chinese people also knew it from long ago. In China and Tibet, people thought using mercury would make them live longer and have better health. One of China's emperors, Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì, is said to have been buried in a tomb with rivers of flowing mercury. He died from drinking a mixture of mercury and powdered jade because he wanted to live forever. However, this only made him die of liver failure, poisoning, and brain death. The ancient Greeks used mercury in ointments. The Egyptians and the Romans used it in cosmetics. These cosmetics sometimes hurt and made faces uglier."
Properties.
Physical properties.
"Mercury is a silvery-white liquid post-transition metal. The reason for mercury being a liquid is complex. It is heavy; a chunk of iron can float on mercury. Compared to other metals, it does not conduct heat well. However, it conducts electricity fairly well. Mercury is the only metal with a known melting point (−38.83 °C) lower than caesium. Mercury is one of the two elements that are liquids at standard temperature and pressure. Bromine is the other one."
"Mercury may be seen as a transition metal, but it is normally seen as a post-transition metal. It is in Group 12 of the periodic table. Mercury has seven stable (nonradioactive) isotopes. 202Hg is the most common isotope. Mercury makes a blue to ultraviolet color in a tube when a spark is passed through it. The ultraviolet light can kill germs or light fluorescent lamps."
Chemical properties.
"Mercury is an unreactive metal. It does not corrode in air unless hydrogen sulfide is also there, similar to silver. Mercury can oxidize to mercury(II) oxide when heated in air. If it is heated further, it decomposes into mercury and oxygen again. It does not dissolve in ordinary acids, but can dissolve in oxidizing acids to make mercury salts. It can make amalgams when mixed with most metals, like aluminium, gold, and zinc. Iron, tantalum, tungsten, and platinum do not make amalgams with mercury. Iron flasks were used to trade mercury because of this."
"Mercury can dissolve large amounts of aluminium metal, making it dangerous to transport in aluminium containers. The thin layer of oxide on aluminium stops it from amalgamating (making an amalgam with) aluminium, but the oxide coating can be damaged to expose the metal. Then the aluminium metal is dissolved and oxidizes to aluminium oxide. The aluminium oxide forms a solid and releases the mercury, which amalgamates more aluminium. This process keeps repeating until a large amount of aluminium is dissolved."
Chemical compounds.
"Mercury forms chemical compounds in 2 oxidation states: +1 and +2. Mercury(I) compounds are weak oxidizing agents and weak reducing agents. Most of them are colorless. They easily disproportionate to mercury(II) compounds and mercury metal. They react with oxygen in the air to make mercury(II) compounds. Many mercury(I) compounds do not dissolve in water. Mercury(I) chloride is one of the most common mercury(I) compounds. Mercury(II) compounds are strong oxidizing agents and very corrosive. Mercury(II) compounds are red, yellow, or colorless. Mercury(II) oxide and mercury(II) chloride are the most common mercury(II) compounds in the laboratory."

The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is the short title of an important book by the 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon. The book traces the Roman Empire—and Western civilization as a whole—from the late first century AD to the fall of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire.
"Published in six volumes, from volume I in 1776 to volumes IV, V, VI in 1788–89. The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 AD, and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and its fall in the West. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources, its methodology became a model for later historians. This led to Gibbon being called the first ""modern historian of ancient Rome""."
Thesis.
Gibbon gave an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell.
"According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions because its citizens gradually lost their ""civic virtue"". They had become weak, using barbarian mercenaries to defend their Empire, who then became so numerous that they were able to take over the Empire."
"Romans, he believed, became unwilling to live the tougher, ""manly"" military lifestyle. In addition, Gibbon argued that Christianity created a belief that a better life existed after death. This fostered an indifference to the present among Roman citizens, and sapped their desire to sacrifice for the Empire. He also believed its pacifism tended to hamper the traditional Roman martial spirit. Finally, like other Enlightenment thinkers, Gibbon held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious, ""dark age"". It was not until his own age of reason and rational thought, so it was believed, that human history could resume its progress."
"Gibbon sees the Praetorian Guard as the main catalyst of the empire's initial decay and eventual collapse, a seed planted by Augustus at the start of the empire. He cites repeated examples of the Praetorian Guard abusing their power with calamitous results, including numerous instances of imperial assassination and incessant demands for increased pay."
Views on Christianity.
"In Volume I, especially Chapters XV and XVI, Gibbon challenged Church history. He estimated far smaller numbers of Christian martyrs than had been previously thought. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. For Gibbon, however, the Church writings were secondary sources. He shunned them in favour of primary sources from the period he was writing about. This is one reason why Gibbon is referred to as the ""first modern historian""."
Gibbon's main theory was that Christianity as a prime factor in the Empire's decline and fall.
"And, more generally:"
"Later historians have mostly not agreed with Gibbon. Today, historians tend to analyze economic and military factors in the decline of Rome."
Editions.
Gibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley's introduction and appendices to his complete edition.
Aminul Islam (poet)
Aminul Islam (born 29 December 1963) is a poet and essayist. He is from Bangladesh. Aminul has written seventeen books. He written thirteen poetry books. He has been involved in creative writing for 20 years.
Aminul Islam (trade unionist)
Aminul Islam (1973 – April 2012) was a Bangladeshi trade unionist (someone who organises trade unions). He was murdered in 2012.
Work.
Islam was a former garment worker and was president of the Ashulia and Savar Bangladesh Garment &amp; Industrial Workers Federation.
"Also he was the leader of Bangladesh Center of Worker Solidarity. It has advocated for improved working conditions and higher wages. In 2010, the organization led protested to push for a larger increase in the minimum wage for garment workers. Islam and other protester were arrested for that."
"Islam had recently been working to organize workers in factories, which belonged to the Shanta Group. The company produces clothing for multiple American companies, like Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, and Ralph Lauren. He had also assisted ABC News, for an interview with the survivors of a recent factory fire in Bangladesh."
His importance in English music.
"Some of Vaughan Williams’s best works are those where he makes his music sound like folk song. He loved the poetry of Housman and used some of the poems in a song cycle called ""On Wenlock Edge"" for tenor, piano and string quartet. His music always sounds English. He was born in the 19th century which was a time when people thought English musicians were not very good. Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar (who was a little older) made people realise that it was possible for an Englishman to write beautiful, moving music."

Recycling
"Recycling is when you recover scrap or waste and reprocessing the material into useful products. Glass, paper, plastic, and metals such as aluminum and steel are often recycled. Dead plants, fruit and vegetable scraps can be recycled through composting."
"It is important not to confuse recycling with reusing, which is where old things, such as clothes, are donated or given a new use instead of being thrown out."
"Recycling reduces trash in landfills and incinerators. Another reason people recycle is to reduce the amount of raw materials and energy used in making things. Most of the time, it takes less energy to recycle trash than to throw it away, ""The Economist"" says. Recycling can reduce your carbon footprint and it can help to minimize the whole size of landfills around the world."
"The 3 R's are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle."
Plastic recycling.
"Most people make about two kilograms of waste (trash) every day, and about 7% of this waste is made up of plastic products that can be recycled. Today, plastic can be recycled into products like picnic tables, park benches, and even high-chairs."
Sort it out.
"First, plastic is collected and taken to a recycling center, where it is ""sorted out"". When plastic is sorted out, symbols have to be printed on every recyclable plastic product used. There are two types of plastic: ""polyethylene"" and ""polymer"". There are two kinds of polyethylene plastic, too: ""high density polyethylene"" (HDPE), and ""low density polyethylene"" (LDPE). HDPE plastic is usually used to make furniture, and LDPE plastic are usually things like milk jugs, plastic and grocery bags."
Grinding washing.
"HDPE plastic is ground into a small powder. LDPE plastic, which are usually thin films, need to be ground by a special machine. After that, both plastics are washed with hot water and detergent. Dirt and other things, like labels, are taken off. After the wash, the powder is dried with hot air."
"Sometimes, the powder is sold. But other times, the powder is heated, colored, and then put into a ""pelletizer"". The pelletizer makes the powder into little pellets, which are bought by a company that shapes the pellets into pieces of plastic ""wood"". This plastic wood is used to make flowerpots, trash cans, pipes, picnic tables, benches, toys, mats, and many other things."
Transnistria
"Transnistria, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR; ), is a de facto country in Eastern Europe. It came to be between 1990 and 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Transnistria declared independence from Moldova on 2 September 1990. With the help of the Russian army, it defeated the Moldovan army in the War of Transnistria. There has been peace since 1992, but the Council of Europe calls Transnistria a ""frozen conflict"" area. Currently, no state recognises Transnistria, officially the territory is part of Moldova."
"There is argument about whether Transnistria is really a country or not. It is recognized by three other unrecognized or partly recognized states: Abkhazia, Nargorno-Karabakh Republic, and South Ossetia. The area continues to claim independence, and acts independently over its territory with the help of peacekeeping forces from foreign countries."
"In a vote on 17 September 2006, 97% voted to be free from Moldova. This vote has not been accepted by Moldova, which calls the area the ""Territory of the Left Bank of the Dniester""."
Transnistria is the only state to still use the hammer and sickle symbol on its flag.
"Russia has a big influence on the territory. Between 1.500 and 2.000 Ruassian soldiers are stationed on the territory. In addition, there may be up to 10.000 paramilitary troops."
"Moldovans, Russians, and Ukraians make up about a third of the population each."
Mercalli intensity scale
"The Mercalli intensity scale (or more precisely the Modified Mercalli intensity scale) is a scale to measure the intensity of earthquakes. Unlike with the Richter scale, the Mercalli scale does not take into account energy of an earthquake directly. Rather, they classify earthquakes by the effects they have (and the destruction they cause). When there is little damage, the scale describes how people felt the earthquake, or how many people felt it."
"Very often, non-geologists use this scale, because it is easier for people to describe what damage an earthquake caused, than to do calculations to get a value on the Richter scale."
Values range from I - Instrumental to XII - Catastrophic.
"Giuseppe Mercalli (1850-1914) originally developed the scale, with ten levels. In 1902, Adolfo Cancani extended the scale to include twelve levels. August Heinrich Sieberg completely rewrote the scale. For this reason, the scale is sometimes named Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale, or MCS scale."
"Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann translated it into English, and published it as Mercalli–Wood–Neumann (MWN) scale. Charles Francis Richter also edited it. He also developed the Richter scale, later on."
"On March 16, 2016, Obama nominated Garland to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia."
"Garland has more federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history. He is the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1971."
"After Republicans refused to give Garland a confirmation hearing, Garland's nomination was expired in January 2017 shortly before the inauguration of Donald Trump. Trump said he will announce his Justice nominee for the Supreme Court on January 31, 2017."
United States Attorney General.
"On January 6, 2021, then President-elect Joe Biden said that we would nominate Garland to be the United States Attorney General during his administration."
"On March 1, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 15-7 to advance Garland's nomination to a full Senate vote. On March 10, the Senate confirmed Garland by a vote of 70-30 to become the next Attorney General."
Personal life.
"Garland married Lynn in 1977. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland."
Article Three of the United States Constitution
"Article Three of the United States Constitution creates the judicial branch of the United States government. It creates the Supreme Court of the United States, and allows the United States Congress to create less powerful federal courts. It also sets out the powers that these courts have."
Section 1: Federal courts.
"Section 1 of Article Three starts out by creating the Supreme Court one court that will be more powerful than any other court in the country. It also gives Congress the power to create ""inferior"" (less powerful) federal courts."
It allows judges in these courts to get a regular salary for their work. Section 1 protects the judges by saying that their salaries will not be decreased while they are in office (working as a federal judge).
Tenure.
"Section 1 says that judges ""shall hold their Offices [keep their jobs] during good Behavior."" This is meant to protect federal judges, and also to make sure that the federal judiciary is independent."
"Before it won its independence in the American Revolutionary War, America was a colony of the British Empire. The Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution just four years after the War ended. They still remembered what the courts in the American colonies were like. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, Britain's King George III ""made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries."""
"This meant that the judges could not be independent or impartial. If they made a decision that King George did not like, they could be fired, or not paid. Judges who wanted to keep their jobs made decisions based on what King George would want, not based on what the law said. If judges are cannot be independent, or do not follow they law, courts are not fair, and there is no way for regular people to get justice."
"The Constitution makes sure that this will not happen to United States federal judges. By saying judges ""shall hold their Offices during good Behavior,"" Section 1 is basically allowing judges to keep their jobs for the rest of their lives. In , the Constitution does say that Congress can take away a judge's job but only after being convicted in a trial, and only for ""Treason, Bribery, or other High crimes and Misdemeanors."" (This is what Section 1 means by behavior that is not ""good."") In other words, the Constitution makes sure that all judges will lose their jobs for making even the slightest unpopular decision. This denies judges the freedom to be independent, and to make the decisions that they think are fair, and makes them choose between right and reelection."
Number of courts.
"Article III clearly allows only one Supreme Court. However, it does not say how many Supreme Court Justices (judges) there should be. Congress solved this problem in 1948 by passing a law. The law says that the Supreme Court will have 9 Justices, including one Chief Justice."
"In both Section 1 and in , the Constitution gives Congress the right to create courts that are ""inferior"" to the Supreme Court. However, the Constitution does not say how many ""inferior"" courts there should be, or how they should be set up. It leaves those decisions to Congress. Congress decided to create two different kinds of ""inferior"" courts (also called ""lower courts""). In the Judiciary Act of 1789, they created:"
"Section 2: Judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury."
Clause 1: Cases and controversies.
"Clause 1 of Section 2 explains the powers the federal court has, and the limits of those powers."
"Clause 1 gives the federal courts the power to hear and judge actual ""cases and controversies"" only. For example, they cannot hear a case about a situation that might come up in the future."
Clause 2: Original and appellate jurisdiction.
"When Clause 2 talks about ""jurisdiction,"" it is talking about who has the power to hear a case."
Original jurisdiction.
"""Original jurisdiction"" is the power to hear a case first, before any other court. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in:"
Appellate jurisdiction.
"In all the other cases mentioned in Clause 2, the Supreme Court has ""appellate jurisdiction."" That means another court has the power to hear the case first. If somebody appeals that court's decision, the Supreme Court can take the case on appeal. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court the power to hear appeals on:"
"In 1814, Napoleon I abdicated the French throne. That freed up experienced British troops to be sent to North America. They burned the unfinished Washington, DC, and also attacked Baltimore. An American lawyer, Francis Scott Key wrote a poem about the Battle of Baltimore. The poem was later used to give the words to a song that later became the US national anthem: ""The Star Spangled Banner."" The war ended in 1815. The British attacked New Orleans but were stopped by the Americans under General Andrew Jackson."
"Unknown by both sides, a peace treaty had already been signed."
Peace.
"The two countries signed the Treaty of Ghent to end the war, on December 24, 1814 in Belgium. Fighting continued into January 1815 because the forces did not know about the treaty, but no great changes took place afterward. The British stopped impressing sailors because the Napoleonic Wars had been finished."
"Most Americans heard of the victory in the Battle of New Orleans before they heard of the treaty. The Federalist Party, which had opposed the war, became disliked as pro-British and soon disappeared."
Winner.
"From the British perspective, the War of 1812 was a minor sideshow. The Americans called it their victorious ""Second War for Independence"". The British remembered it as the Americans trying to take advantage of their being involved in a war against the French Empire and paid no attention to American grievances."
"In Canada, the War of 1812 was an unwanted war. It concerned the distant capitals of Washington, DC, and London, not them. In Lower Canada, now Quebec, it was considered an Anglo-Saxon war. In Quebec there was little love for the British, but the British had guaranteed their right to speak French. Since they did not know what would happen if the Americans took over, they chose the lesser evil and supported the British."
"Upper Canada (later part of the Province of Ontario) had been settled by American Loyalists who fled after the Revolutionary War. They had little love of their former countrymen in the US but had become outnumbered by Americans who later came north to settle. When the Americans attempted to invade Canada, the Canadian militias were eager to defend their homeland."
"In US history, the War of 1812 is the most obscure conflict. The average American remembers very little about the war. Some may remember The Star Spangled Banner, the Burning of Washington, or the Battle of New Orleans. Otherwise, it is a little-understood conflict. The issues are complex. Most scholars would agree it was fought over maritime issues. Since the British Navy was then the most powerful in the world, it was easier to attack the British on land by invading Canada. Former US President Thomas Jefferson predicted the ""acquisition of Canada, will be a mere matter of marching."""
"British who knew about the little war felt that they had won, no matter what Americans thought. Canadians kept their independence from the US and so felt that they had won. The Americans felt they won although they lost in Canada since they lost none of their territory, repelled the invasion of Maryland, were free to fight the Indians without British interference, and were no longer impressed on the high seas. Of all three, the British are perhaps the happiest because they have completely forgotten about the war."
Chandigarh
"Chandigarh, also called ""The Beautiful City"", is a city in India. It is a union territory, because it is the capital of two states: Punjab and Haryana. As a territory it does not belong to either state. Before 1 November,1966 it was capital of Punjab, but after formation of Haryana on 1 November, 1966 it become a union territory.There are many tourism places in Chandigarh like Rock garden, Rose garden and Sukhna lake."
"Chandigarh came into existence in 1952 when its first stone was laid. It is one of the modern cities of India, designed by a French architect Le Carbusier. It was the dream city of India's first Prime Minister, Sh.Jawahar Lal Nehru."
"It is well known for its mixed cultural background and its fast development in the field of Information Technology. It has outlets of many famous multinational companies established here and is emerging as a hub for business development. The territory covers an area of 44 mi² or 114 km², it is bigger than Montserrat but smaller than Jersey. It's also the proposed capital of Khalistan."
Convection
Convection is the movement of heat because of the movement of warm matter.
"For example, atmospheric circulation moves warm air to cool places, causing wind. Wind, in turn, can enter and cool a room if the window is open. The movement of the clouds, the ocean currents and many types of heaters are examples of convection."
Forced convection and natural convection.
"Convection can happen naturally (""natural convection"") or because of a moving device (""forced convection"")."
"The fan is a device that produces the movement of the air artificially. The air in this case is moving because of the rotation of the fan. This is an example of ""forced convection""."
"Natural convection happens because a fluid is lighter if is hot and it is heavier if is cold, so if a fluid has a hot part and a cold part, the hot part will naturally move upward and the cold part naturally moves downward. For example, if the water in a pot is hotter near the bottom because of the fire, it moves from the bottom to the surface. At the same time the water near the surface is colder so it moves to the bottom."
Convection currents.
"Convection currents occur when there are significant differences in temperature between two parts of a fluid. When this happens, hot fluids rise and cold fluids sink. This causes movements or currents in the fluid. Atmospheric circulation, for example, is made by convection currents."
Chipmunk
"A chipmunk is a small squirrel-like rodent. It is in the Sciuridae family. About twenty-three species fall under this title, with one species in North America."
"The name may have originally been spelled ""chitmunk"" (perhaps from a Native American word meaning ""red squirrel""). However, the earliest form comes from the Oxford English Dictionary (in 1842) as ""chipmonk"". Other early forms include ""chipmuck"" and ""chipminck""."
"Chipmunks are hoarders, meaning they store food for winter."
Popular culture.
Tie votes.
"Normally, appellate courts (or panels) are staffed with an odd number of judges to avoid a tie vote. Sometimes and in some jurisdictions, when judicial positions are vacant or a judge has recused (excuse) himself or herself from the case, the court may be stuck with a tie. In this situation the decision of the lower Court stands."
Writ
"In English common law, a writ is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or judicial jurisdiction. In modern use this generally is a court. Writs are issued by courts directing the person to whom they are addressed to do something or to not do something. Writs may also be used to direct other courts or public authorities. The authority for a court to issue a writ is given by the All Writs Act which is a United States federal statute originally a part of the Judiciary Act of 1789."
History.
"In its earliest form a writ was simply a written order made by the English king to a specified person to undertake a specified action. For example in the feudal era a military summons by the king to one of his tenants-in-chief to appear dressed for battle with his knights at a certain place and time. An early usage survives in the United Kingdom. Also in Canada in a writ of election. This was is a written order issued on behalf of the monarch (in Canada, the Governor General) to local officials (High Sheriffs of every county in historical UK) to hold a general election. Writs were used by the medieval English kings to summon persons to Parliament."
Types of writs.
There have been a great many kinds of writs. Some of the more common types still in use are:
Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Eleventh Amendment (Amendment XI) to the United States Constitution was passed by Congress on March 4, 1794 and ratified by the states on February 7, 1795. It deals with each state's sovereign immunity and was adopted to overrule the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ""Chisholm v. Georgia""."
Lawsuits against states.
"The idea of sovereign immunity originated in English common law. It was also proposed by political theorists like Thomas Hobbes and Jean Bodin. The founding fathers of the Constitution were aware of the traditional doctrine that states were immune from private lawsuits. Several Anti-Federalists were afraid that Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, which declares that the federal judicial power extends to suits ""between a State and Citizens of another State"", would override that doctrine."
"The Eleventh Amendment was a direct reaction to an unpopular ruling by the Supreme Court in ""Chisholm v. Georgia"" (1793). In ""Chisholm"" the Court said federal courts had the power to hear lawsuits brought by citizens against US states. Also, that states were not immune to these cases. The Eleventh Amendment reversed this decision and does not allow cases brought against a state by a citizen of another state or country. It says nothing about a citizen bringing a suit against their own state."
"In ""Ex parte Young"", the Supreme Court decision allowed suits in federal courts against officials acting on behalf of states of the union to proceed despite the State's sovereign immunity, when the State acted unconstitutionally."
The Eleventh Amendment is one of five amendments that overturned earlier Supreme Court decisions.
Johnnie Cochran
"Johnnie L Cochran, Jr. (October 2, 1937 – March 29, 2005) was an American lawyer. He is best known for his part in the acquittal of O. J. Simpson for the murder of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. Cochran also represented many different celebrities and victims. Cochran became known as an early advocate for the victims of police brutality. Cochran helped Sean Combs win an acquittal after being indicted on stolen weapons charges and bribery in 2001. After the case, he decided to retire."
"On March 29, 2005, Cochran died from a brain tumor in his home in Los Angeles, aged 67."
Crypt
"A crypt is a room, or group of rooms, underneath a church where bodies are put after a person dies. It usually has coffins, religious items, and other trinkets for the dead."
Pokémon Sun and Moon
"are two role-playing video games. They are published by The Pokémon Company and developed by Game Freak. They were released for the Nintendo 3DS. The games were released on 18 November 2016 in North America, Australia and Japan, and 23 November 2016 in Europe, commemorating the ""Pokémon"" franchise's 20th anniversary."
"On February 25, the games' existence was leaked after the trademarks were found on the EU's Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market's website. ""Sun"" and ""Moon"" were officially announced in a Pokémon Nintendo Direct."
Story.
"Pokémon Sun and Moon take place in a region called Alola. Alola has warm weather and is made up of four large islands. The player is given a Pokémon and goes on a journey around Alola. The player can catch and raise other Pokémon as they explore. While exploring, the player sometimes has to fight Team Skull. Team Skull are a group of people who want to destroy things and cause trouble. And some Pokémon have a special Alolan form!"
Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern
"As one of the main branches of mathematical analysis, it can be seen as the real-number counterpart of complex analysis, which deals with complex numbers. Many results in real analysis are special cases of results in complex analysis."
Cabo Corrientes
Cabo Corrientes is a cape on the Pacific coast of Mexico. It is the most southern point of the Bahía de Banderas.
Homeland
"A homeland (rel. ""country of origin"" and native land) is the concept of the territory (cultural geography) to which an ethnic group holds a long history and a deep cultural association with. It's the country in which a particular national identity began."
Strike (attack)
"A strike (or blow) is an attack with an inanimate object, such as a weapon, or with a part of the human body. It is intended to harm an opponent."
Mazatlán
"Mazatlán () is a city in the Mexican state of Sinaloa; the surrounding ""municipio"" (municipality) for which the city serves as the municipal capital is also called Mazatlán. It is located at on the Pacific coast, just across from the southernmost tip of the Baja California peninsula."
"Mazatlán is a Nahuatl word meaning ""place of the deer."" The city was started in 1531. By the mid-1800s a large group of immigrants had arrived from Germany. These new citizens made Mazatlán into a successful commercial seaport, importing equipment for the nearby gold and silver mines. It served as the capital of Sinaloa from 1859 to 1873. They also influenced the music, banda, which is an form of Bavarian folk music, and also started the Pacifico Brewery on March 14, 1900."
"Mazatlán, with a population of 352,471 (city) and 403,888 (municipality) as of the 2005 census, is the second-largest city in the state (after Culiacán) and Mexico's largest commercial port. It is also a popular tourist destination, with its beaches lined with resort hotels. A car ferry across the Gulf of California from Mazatlán to La Paz, Baja California Sur exists. The municipality has a land area of 3,068.48 km² (1,184.75 sq mi) and includes smaller communities such as Villa Unión, La Noria, El Quelite, El Habal and many other small villages."
Mazatlán is served by Gral. Rafael Buelna International Airport.

Rennet
Rennet is a set of enzymes made from the stomachs of mammals. It is used in things like suet and cakes. It can also be used to make cheese.
Kol people
"The Kols, also known as Kolarians, are the original inhabitants of modern-day West Bengal and North-east India. The term Kol has been corrupted by the Aryan-Sanskritic speakers to the word ""kalu"", meaning both ""black"" and ""ugly"", in almost all of the 16 major languages of the subcontinent. The Kolarians are a Dravidian peoples stock group, whose descendant communities can be found also in West Bengal and elsewhere in the eastern part of the East India."
"Most geological scholars will contend that most of Bangladesh was fashioned 1 to 6.5 million years ago during the Tertiary era. Semi-recent excavations in the Deolpota village of western Bengal seem to suggest that a Paleolithic civilization in the region existed about one hundred thousand years ago. A 10,000 to 15,000 year old stone structure in Rangamati is the primary evidence of Paleolithic civilization along with a hand axe found in the mountainous inclines of the Feni district. This Neo-stone age began 3,000 BC lasting almost 1500 years. Similar tools were found in Sitakunda of the eastern region Chittagong, and near Comilla district. The sparsely forested hills in eastern Bengal strewn with fertile valleys imparted a hospitable location for Neolithic settlements."
"Physically, the indigenous peoples of eastern India were long-headed, dark skinned, broad-nosed, and short in stature. Sometimes labeled as ""Negritos"" and ""Negroids"", their physical features are unchanged today among the lowest castes of Bengal, mainly the peasants, as well as 95% of population of West Bengal today who derive from these lower castes and tribes."
Sena dynasty
People have different ideas about the Bible. Christians believe it is God's Word to people. The Jews believe that only the Old Testament is from God. Protestants and Catholics believe that the Old and New Testaments are God's Word. Catholics also believe that the books called Apocrypha or Deuterocanonical are part of the Bible. Sometimes different denominations disagree over exactly what the Bible means.
"According to Islam, the Injil itself is to be followed but it is believed to have been corrupted with time. The Qur'an is believed to be the successor."
"Atheists do not believe that gods exist, so the Bible is only an ancient book."
"Deists believe in God, but they believe that the Bible was written by people, so they don't see it as important."
Bavaria
"Bavaria (; , ), officially the Free State of Bavaria (, ; ), is a State (""Bundesland"") of Germany. The territory of this state is the largest of the 16 German states. The state capital is Munich with 1.3 million people. About 12.5 million people live in Bavaria."
"Like many German states, Bavaria was once independent. Ludwig II of Bavaria was its last independent king. Bavaria joined the German Empire in 1871."
Structure.
"Bavaria has seven parts: ""Oberbayern"" (Upper Bavaria), ""Niederbayern"" (Lower Bavaria), ""Schwaben"" (Swabia), ""Mittelfranken"" (Middle Franconia), ""Unterfranken"" (Lower Franconia), ""Oberfranken"" (Upper Franconia) and ""Oberpfalz"" (Upper Palatinate). Bavaria has 71 districts and 25 free cities."
"The highest point is the Zugspitze, which is also the highest mountain in Germany. Munich is the largest city, the second biggest city is Nuremberg (""Nürnberg""), which is famous for its gingerbread, a kind of Christmas bread that is often shaped like a Christmas tree, a snowman or Santa Claus."
Pope Benedict XVI was born in Bavaria.
Administrative divisions.
Administrative regions.
"Bavaria is divided into seven administrative regions called ' (singular '). For every Administrative region there is a state agency called """" (district government)."
"Districts ""(Bezirke)""."
Controllers.
"The prototypes used to design the controller's electrical systems used a so-called ""yoke and gimbal"" taken from a radio control system used to fly model airplanes. This simple design gave very nice control and was highly reliable. The actual controllers sold with the game were quite different and a great disappointment to the development teams. The design of the analog joystick, which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to center the stick, caused many joysticks to have no ability to center. Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not provide smooth control through the travel of the stick. This made controlling games awkward. The controllers did, however, include a pause button. This was a novelty at the time, but would become standard on almost all future game systems. Replacement joysticks were also released by other manufacturers."
"Atari Inc. released the Pro-Line Trak-Ball controller for the system, which was used for titles such as ""Centipede"" or ""Defender"". A paddle controller and an updated self-centering version of the original controller were also being worked on, but never made it to market."
"In the web-video-game review show, James Rolfe's ""The Angry Video Game Nerd"", Rolfe's character is shown as being very frustrated with trying to use the controllers and Pro-Line Trak Ball as neither of them work properly. Other instances of web game review shows disliking the controller are on shows such as Mark Bussler's ""Classic Game Room"", where the host is shown stating that the Atari 5200 controllers are the worst game console controllers of all time."
The controller was ranked the 10th worst video game controller by IGN editor Craig Harris.
Inside differences between the 5200 and the 400/800.
"Although the Atari 5200's insides were very much like that of the 400/800 home computers, the differences were enough so that games designed for one would not run directly on the other."
"One of the most obvious differences was the 5200's lack of a keyboard. However, there were several others:"
"Atari Corp.'s later XE Games System revisited the idea of a console based on the 400/800 hardware. However, as this was essentially just a 65XE computer with a keyboard which could be removed, it was able to run most of the home computer titles directly."
Market failure.
"The Atari 5200 could not run software for the still-popular Atari 2600. An adapter was later released in 1983 allowing it to play all Atari 2600 games, using the more reliable controllers from the 2600."
Another problem was the lack of attention that Atari Inc. gave to the console; most of its attention went to the older Atari 2600. It faced an uphill battle competing with the ColecoVision's head start and a video game market which was beginning to fade.
"At one point, Atari Inc. planned on developing a smaller, less expensive version of the Atari 5200 which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin. Code-named the ""Atari 5100"" (a.k.a. ""Atari 5200 Jr.""), only a few fully-working prototype Atari 5100s were made before the project was canceled."
"On May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the Atari 7800 was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued. Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1 million units."
Technical design.

"Nitrogen compounds have many uses, such as anesthetics (nitrous oxide), explosives (dynamite), cleaners (ammonia), and meat (protein), and planes (fuel)."
Oil companies use high pressure nitrogen to help force crude oil to the surface.
Nitrogen is also used as a way to relieve body aches. It contributes to the torn bones in your body and helps.
History.
"Nitrogen was discovered by Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it ""noxious gas"" or ""fixed gas"". They discovered that part of air did not burn. It was found that animals died in it. It was known as ""azote"". Many nitrogen compounds also contain the ""azide"" or ""azine"" letters, such as hydrazine."
"In 1910, Lord Rayleigh found out that when a spark was passed through nitrogen, it made a reactive form of nitrogen. This nitrogen reacted with many metals and compounds."
Association football
"Association football is a sport played between two teams. In the United States, Canada and Australia, it is called soccer. In most other English-speaking countries it is called football. Association football is the most popular sport in the world."
"Games like football have been played around the world since ancient times. The modern game came from England, where the Football Association wrote a standard set of rules for the game in 1863."
"Each team has 11 players on the field. One of these players is the goalkeeper, the only player who is allowed to touch the ball with their hands. The other ten are known as ""outfield players"". The players try to kick the ball into their opponents' goal. The team that scores the most goals wins. A match has 90 minutes of play, with a break of 15 minutes during the match. The break in the middle is called ""half-time"". Added time may be added after half time or after 90 minutes to make up for time lost during the game because of fouls, free kicks, corner kicks, injuries, bookings, substitutions or any other time the game is stopped. A match can end in a tie, except in some competition games where one team must win. In that case, extra-time with two halves of 15 minutes each may be played, and if there is still a tie, a penalty shootout decides the winner. Sometimes extra-time is skipped and the game goes right into the penalty shootout."
Competitions.
"There are many competitions for football, for both football clubs and countries. Football clubs usually play other teams in their own country, with a few exceptions. Here are a list of some of those exceptions:"
Football clubs also play other teams in their continent in competitions such as the CAF Champions League and the UEFA Champions League.
"There are 6 associations (CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, CAF, UEFA, AFC, and OFC). Each association has their own continental competition between clubs and national teams. Some examples are the Copa América for CONMEBOL national teams and the Copa Libertadores for CONMEBOL clubs. FIFA organises international competitions between worldwide clubs and countries. Clubs play in the Club World Cup, and countries play for the FIFA World Cup."
"The FIFA World Cup takes place every four years between national teams, and is the world's most popular sporting event, even more popular than the Olympic Games. In football, there are two main competition types. In a ""league"", all of the teams play the same number of games, but in a ""cup"", teams leave the competition when they lose, until the last two teams play each other to decide the winner."
Who plays football.
"Football is the world's most popular sport. It is played in more countries than any other game. In fact, FIFA (the Federation Internationale de Football Association) has more members than the United Nations. It was originally an all-male sport, but today it is played by both males and females (separately, except sometimes at primary school level)."
"In Europe, the main competitions to compete are the Champions League for the top teams from the top leagues in each country in Europe. Then there is the UEFA Europa League which is for the next best teams from each member country of the UEFA."
"Most successful clubs are FC Barcelona and Real Madrid from Spain; Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund from Germany; Galatasaray S.K. from Turkey; Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan from Italy; Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City from England; Paris Saint-Germain from France and Al Ahly from Egypt."
"The most successful club in the world, in terms of domestic league results, is Rangers F.C. from Scotland, who have won more domestic league titles than any other team in the world. They have won the country's league 54 times which is a world record. In May 2000, Rangers became the first team to win 100 trophies."
Spamming
"Spamming is when one person or company sends an unwanted email to another person. Spam emails are the computer version of unwanted ""junk mail"" that arrives in a mailbox, such as advertising pamphlets and brochures. Spam emails are usually sent to try to get the person to buy something or do something else that will cause gain for the sender."
Names.
"The emails sent when someone is spamming is called spam. The person or company who sent the unwanted email is called a spammer. Both of these words came from a brand of canned meat called ""Spam"", but it was a short sketch created by the British comedy group Monty Python in 1970 that led to the word ""Spam"" being widely used to mean unwanted email messages."
Uses.
"Spam emails are usually sent to many people at once trying to get them to buy a product or sign up for a service. The people who receive the email did not ask to receive the email, and do not want to receive it."
"One of the reasons there is so much spam emails around is that it costs very little to send millions of spam messages at once. Spam messages can easily be sent, sometimes even by a special computer program."
How spammers find email addresses.
"The hardest part about spamming is to get the email addresses to send the spam to. Sometimes the spammers do this by searching for emails on the internet, or by buying emails from people who know a lot of them (for example, someone who runs a site that makes users tell them their email address to signup will have a lot of email addresses to sell to spammers)."
Method one.
"He was 41 when he was shot in the head in the men's room in his University, Divine School where he was teaching on May 21 1991. At times he preached against communism and its system of brainwashing youth. It is alleged that he was killed on the orders of outgoing Romanian Communist Party leaders."
Single (music)
"In popular music marketing, a single is a record release with only one or two songs. The first song (usually the one given the most promotion, and heard more often in the media) is called an A-side, while any other song on the single is called a B-side."
"The pairing of recordings on a single comes from the days of shellac and vinyl records, when discs had two playable sides. Modern compact disc singles may contain more than one version of either the A- or B-side, or sometimes an additional recording by the same performer. B-sides may be selections from an album, or songs not otherwise issued for sale."
"Many times the chance to get a new song issued as an A-side creates competition between members of bands, or teams of songwriters. John Lennon and Paul McCartney of the Beatles tried to write better songs than each other, to get more A-sides than the other. George Harrison, also a Beatle, rarely had his songs chosen for singles, but had a hit with ""Something"" for the band."
"In the days of vinyl singles, royalties for both A- and B-sides were paid equally. Many listeners never played B-sides more than once, and radio focused on A-sides. Many people who made recordings knew this, and used it to earn extra money from sales, or to promote other music they made. Phil Spector sometimes used short jam sessions by his studio band as B-sides to singles he produced."
"Michael Nesmith of the Monkees wanted his songs to appear on Monkees singles. He would settle for B-sides, if he could not get an A-side. Don Kirshner, who oversaw the band's early music, wanted the B-sides to come from other songwriters who worked for him. Nesmith and Kirshner disagreed, and it caused tension for the Monkees and their company."
"Records that include more than two or three songs are usually called EPs (for ""extended play""), and may include four or more distinct songs, but not as many as on an album."
Captain America
"Captain America is a fictional superhero from the Marvel Comics. He made his first appearance in the comic book ""Captain America Comics #1"" in 1941""."" He wears a suit that has a white star on his chest with 2 stripes (still white) on each side next to the star. His suit is blue. He also has an indestructible shield with a bullseye and a star on the front of it. He is also known as his alter ego Steve Rogers. Captain America had a sidekick (friend), Bucky who later became the Winter Soldier, is a very good fighter, both hand-to-hand and using his guns to take care of his enemies easily. Captain America has an nemesis called Red Skull. He later joins a team called the Avengers to help protect the world."
Power and abilities.
"Captain America has superhuman strength, superhuman stamina, and can live without eating, sleeping and resting."
Film and TV.
"He first appeared in the serial (film) Captain America, which was from 1940."
"He appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Chris Evans. He was in ' (2011), ' (2014) and """" (2016), as well as Marvel's ""The Avengers"" (2012), and (2015), (2018), and (2019)."
In Real Life.
"In 1966, Joe Simon (one of the people who helped make Captain America) sued Marvel, saying that he was the one who should be able to use the character, not them. It was agreed that Captain America was made under the publisher's rules, and belonged to them. This meant that Marvel won."
Objectivity (journalism)
Objectivity is a significant principle of journalistic professionalism. It involves presenting information that can be relied upon.
"Objectivity may have several meanings in the eye of the public. ""Fairness"" involves making sure that multiple sides of an issue are presented. ""Disinterestedness"" means that the presenters are neutral in a story in which the people involved try to influence them. ""Factuality"" bases story content on facts that can be checked by an independent agent. ""Nonpartisanship"" means not taking sides, especially on political matters. Depending on the topic of a story, any or all of these factors may be relevant in the journalist's remaining objective."
"The editorial board of media outlets such as the press or broadcast news chooses what information to present, so the editors' selection may be biased toward one position or belief system."
"In many countries, ""advocacy journalism,"" which supports a particular position, is considered as a legitimate sort of professional journalism. These stories may be either news or analysis. They may or may not be objective."
Definitions.
"Few journalists would make a claim to total neutrality or impartiality. However, most try to keep distance from their own personal biases in their news work. In ""Discovering the News"" (1978), sociologist Michael Schudson argues that ""the belief in objectivity is a faith in 'facts,' a distrust in 'values,' and a commitment to their segregation."" In the United States, an objective story is typically considered to be one that steers a middle path between two poles of political rhetoric."
"Journalism without any bias, as if one just came to Earth from another planet and had no opinions about our behavior or ways is rarely practiced, although some argue it would lead to radical changes in reporting. (See, for example, Noam Chomsky, The Journalist from Mars.)"
Genesis Nomad
The Genesis Nomad is a portable video game console released by the Sega Corporation. It has a colour screen and can play most games designed for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.
It cannot be used with the Sega CD and Sega 32X unless special modifications are made. But such special modifications may not be safe.
Kappa
"Kappa (uppercase/lowercase Κ κ) is the letter of the Greek alphabet used to represent the ""k"" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 20. Letters that came from it include the Roman K and Cyrillic К."
"The letter κ always stands for the sound ""k"" in Greek. It is customary to transliterate (re-write) κ as ""c"" in English, but this is somewhat problematic since c is pronounced as ""s"" before e, i and y (which does not happen in Greek)."
"In mathematics, the lowercase formula_1 is used to represent the curvature of a curve, while the uppercase Κ is used to represent an ordinal number which is also a cardinal number."

Văn Cao
"Văn Cao (born Nguyễn Văn Cao; 15 November 1923 – 10 July 1995) was a famous Vietnamese composer. He wrote the Vietnamese national anthem, """". He, along with Pham Duy and Trinh Cong Son, is widely considered one of the three most important people in modern (non-classical) Vietnamese music."
Kojiki
"Kojiki or ""Furukotofumi"" (), also called in English the ""Records of Ancient Matters"", is the oldest book known in Japan. It was written 712 CE, and dedicated to Empress Gemmei. The Kojiki is a book about Japanese mythology (Shinto), legends, songs, genealogies, oral traditions, and semi-historical accounts down to 641 BCE. The book mixes the legends of first emperor of Japan and several others with stories about the gods. Therefore, it is difficult to know which parts of the Kojiki are real and which parts are legend. According to legend, all the emperors of Japan are descended from Amaterasu, the sun goddess."
"The Kojiki is written in Chinese, but the way the Japanese wrote it is by using the pronunciation of the Chinese characters and not the meanings of them. In other words, a person who can read Chinese will not be able to read the Kojiki unless they also know how to speak Japanese. It includes many Japanese names and some phrases."
Sections.
"The Kojiki is divided into three parts: the , the and the ."
Hindu philosophy
"There are mainly six branches of Hindu Philosophy. These six schools of philosophy have been the result of ancient Indian thought and usually termed as ""Sad Darsana"". These are:"
"Among the above six schools of Hindu Philosophy, Vedanta is by far very popular. The Vedanta accepts the authority of the knowledge portions of the Vedas, called Upanishads."
Guru
"In the Sanskrit language, guru means teacher. Eastern religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and newer movements such as Transcendental Meditation use ""guru"" as a title. They give it to a teacher (or guide) of religious matters."
"In Western usage, any person who has followers may be called a guru, even if he is followed for things other than religion or philosophy. A person with knowledge or expertise may be called a guru if he influences by personal teaching. Modern terms which have a rather similar meaning are mentor and tutor."
Satguru.
"Many Hindus have a satguru as well.The word ""guru"" means the one who removes the darkness from our heart. Satguru means true guru or true teacher. The title means that his students know that the guru can be trusted and will lead them to enlightenment. A satguru is a great soul who has realized God and is able to lead others along the path. God shines out from the satguru more brightly than from other people because he is very pure and enlightened. The satguru is devoted full time to religious life, is unmarried and has given up all possessions, personal life, family and friends. He has received an initiation from his satguru that gives him great spiritual power and authority. He can teach parents how to raise children, adults how to avoid problems and overcome any challenge in life, and in general he can make people feel close to God."
Moksha
"Moksha is the ultimate goal of personal spiritual development for some schools of Hinduism. It is the equivalent of Nirvana in Buddhism. In the Sanskrit language, ""moksha"" means freedom. It is as a state of eternal bliss and emptiness. According to Vedanta life is an endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth into a physical universe. Hindu scriptures describe Moksha as the spiritual liberation from this cycle and the achievement of an eternal and blissful emptiness that transcends all of the joys, pain, and sorrow of the physical body or corporeal life. It is the goal of Hindu practitioners to achieve Moksha (freedom/liberation from the material world) through the practice of Yoga viz Jnana Yoga(knowledge), Karma Yoga(work), and Bhakti Yoga (through reciting prayers and worshipping God)."
"Moksha is a Vedic term. Scholars disagree about the precise relationship between the Moksha of Vedanta Hinduism and the Nirvana of Buddhism, but there is agreement that they are closely related historically and philosophically. Similarities can be found between Moksha and some concepts found in the Upanishads. Hindu texts explain the Moksha as Sat-Chit-Anand [True blissness of soul by separating the soul from the physical body by practising Dhyan and Yoga ]. Moksha originates from the Sanskrit word, moksa."

Vallavanukku Vallavan
"Vallavanukku Vallavan is a 1965 Tamil mystery thriller starring Asokan, Manimala, Gemini Ganesan and R.S. Manohar in lead roles with Thangavelu and Manorama in supporting roles. Also Savitri, makes a cameo as herself. It was directed by R. Sundaram."
Plot.
"Ramesh (Askokan) is an engineer who is hunting for a job and with the help of his friend Babu (Thangavelu) goes to see a wealthy businessman named Laxman for a new project of his. After a song and a comic encounter with Laxman's daughter Geeta (Manimala), he falls in love with her. He also achieves very good success in convincing Geeta's father into starting the project. During a sight visit for the project, his suitcase gets swapped with a similar suitcase of a co-passenger named Mala (Manorama), which is full of money. For this reason Ramesh is detained in a police lock-up. Also Mala is revealed to be part of a criminal gang. When the gang leader, Jumboo, is not able to kill Mala (because he needs a particular diary from her), he instead arranges a dangerous rowdy named Bijua Pakiri (R.S. Manohar)to kill Ramesh within the lock-up."
"However, instead of killing Ramesh, Bijua decides to hold Ramesh captive. Together they escape the lock-up that very night to prove Ramesh's innocence. Bijua also angers the criminal gang of Mala, when he asks for a greater sum in return for killing Ramesh. When a mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) makes phone calls and tried to save Ramesh from captivity, Ramesh escapes by himself out into the city. The mysterious man also attacks Bijua before running away. The criminal gang try to kill Bijua but he escapes after a fight. Geeta meets him and helps him by giving him a hanky and some milk from her flask."
"Ramesh being chased by police, Bijua Pakiri and the criminal gang attempts to fake his death. Geeta believing his death to be real comes to the waterfall where he committed suicide and learns that he is not really dead. They both go one of the villas owned by Geeta's father, and make a secret stay there. Bijua confronts them and threatens to kill Ramesh but is tamed by the very pleading words of Geeta. He instead promises to help Ramesh out of the situation. Both Bijua and Ramesh don disguises to roam about in public, to search for Mala and with her prove his innocence. But, they are chased by police and are lead to a comic encounter where they sing a song for a dance by Savitri. Later, Mala and Babu drive a car together and develop romantic feelings for one another. When Ramesh and Bijua get to know this, they try to use their relationship to get the truth out of Mala. But their plan backfires."
"After this, the mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) appears secretly inside Ramesh's car promising to help him. He accepts that he is a police officer when asked, and says he knows that Ramesh is innocent. But leaves when Bijua and Babu enter the car. Men from the criminal gang disguise as policemen and ""arrest"" Ramesh whom they intend to murder at a safe spot. However, with the help of his friends Ramesh escapes."
"Later, the same mysterious man appears once again, and meets Ramesh once again to tell him that he knows Mala well and also Bijua is planning to give off Ramesh to the criminal gang, for money. Ramesh, believes him and starts to avoid Bijua, telling him that he now knows his true colours."
"When Mala is forced by Jumboo, the gangleader, to fly abroad, she is confronted by the still mysterious man who forces her to give him the diary, failing which she would end up in jail. But she is shot by a shadowy figure, who is then chased by the mysterious man. But, Bijua gets hold of the diary after coming there. Ramesh learns of the death of Mala and becomes sad. Jumboo arrives there and Bijua confronts him, now asking for twice the earlier amount for the diary and the life of Ramesh."
"Bijua takes Ramesh with him to prove his innocence, after pleading with Ramesh and Geeta for a long time. They arrive at a cave on a hill. There Bijua tries to sell Ramesh and the Diary for the agreed sum, apparently betraying Ramesh. The mysterious man arrives at the scene to whom Ramesh explains the situation."
"When the mysterious man tries to act his police disguise there, Bijua reveals he is Mr.Prakash, the true leader of the crime gang and he himself is Inspector Sekar of Vigilance Branch. With this information both Prakash and Ramesh are startled. After some talk an elaborate fight and chase scene, Mr.Prakash drives a boat that crashes into a rock fatally killing him. Ramesh is proven innocent through the information in the diary."
Bijua (now Inspector Sekar) attends the marriage of Ramesh and Geeta in full inspector uniform. The film ends with Babu receiving a prize sum from Police Department for his help in the case.
Persistent organic pollutant
"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes."
"For this reason, they persist in the environment for a long time. They can be transported over long distances and bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue. When going up a food chain, there will be larger amounts of these substances. For this reason, they have a large impact on human health and the environment."
"Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as pesticides. Others are used in industrial processes and in the production goods such as solvents, polyvinyl chloride, and pharmaceuticals. There are a few natural sources of POPs; most POPs are created by humans in industrial processes, either intentionally or as byproducts."
The entire country has about 22 million people. These 14 cities have 5 million total. This shows that most people still live in rural areas.
Divisions.
"Mozambique is divided into ten provinces (""provincias"") and one capital city (""cidade capital"") with provincial status. The provinces are divided into 129 districts (""distritos""). The districts are further divided in 405 ""Postos Administrativos"" (Administrative Posts) and then into Localidades (Localities), the lowest geographical level of the central state administration. Since 1998, 43 ""Municípios"" (Municipalities) have been created in Mozambique."
Culture.
Arts.
"The music of Mozambique can be for many purposes. These can be religious or for traditional ceremonies. Musical instruments are usually handmade. Some of the instruments used include drums made of wood and animal skin; the ""lupembe"", a woodwind instrument made from animal horns or wood; and the marimba, which is a kind of xylophone native to Mozambique. The marimba is a popular instrument with the Chopi of the south central coast. They are famous for their musical skill and dance."
"The Makonde are renowned for their wood carving and elaborate masks that are commonly used in traditional dances. There are two different kinds of wood carvings. Shetani, (evil spirits), which are mostly carved in heavy ebony, tall, and elegantly curved with symbols and nonrepresentational faces. The Ujamaa are totem-type carvings which show lifelike faces of people and various figures. Theses sculptures are usually called “family trees” because they tell stories of many generations."
"During the last years of the colonial period, Mozambican art showed the oppression by the colonial power, and became a symbol of the resistance. After independence in 1975, the modern art came into a new phase. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are the painter Malangatana Ngwenya and the sculptor Alberto Chissano. Art during the 1980s and 1990s shows the political struggle, civil war, suffering, starvation and struggle."
"Dances are usually highly developed traditions throughout Mozambique. There are many different kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually ritualistic in nature. The Chopi, for instance, act out battles dressed in animal skins. The men of Makua dress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours. Groups of women in the northern part of the country have a traditional dance called ""tufo"", to celebrate Islamic holidays."
Food.
"Because the Portuguese were there for nearly 500 years, they greatly impacted the cuisine of Mozambique. Crops such as cassava (a starchy root) and cashew nuts (Mozambique was once the largest producer of these nuts), and ""pãozinho"" were brought in by the Portuguese. The use of spices and seasonings such as onions, bay leaves, garlic, fresh coriander, paprika, chili peppers, red sweet peppers, and wine were introduced by the Portuguese. So was sugarcane, maize, millet, rice, sorghum (a type of grass), and potatoes. ""Prego"" (steak roll), ""rissois"" (battered shrimp), ""espetada"" (kebab), ""pudim"" (pudding), and the popular ""inteiro com piripiri"" (whole chicken in piri-piri sauce) are all Portuguese dishes commonly eaten in present-day Mozambique."
Entertainment.
Football is the most popular sport in Mozambique.
Dian Fossey
"Dian Fossey (January 16, 1932 – December 26, 1985) was an American zoologist. She is best known for studying gorillas in Rwanda."
"Fossey was inspired by a book called ""The Mountain Gorilla"" by George Schaller. Fossey studied mountain gorillas in Rwanda because of the book. When people want to get close to gorillas and get to know them they have to gain the gorillas trust. Fossey changed her lifestyle to match the gorillas’. She wanted to protect the gorillas from hunters. Hunters were going into places where to one was allowed to hunt. She also wanted to protect the endangered animals in the area, even though some people didn’t agree with her ideas. She is a hero to many people for what she did to help mountain gorillas. There is a movie that was made based on what she experienced in Africa. The movie is called ""Gorillas in the Mist"". Her book, also named ""Gorillas in the Mist"", is the best-selling book on gorillas of all time."
She is recognized for saving mountain gorillas and starting a successful fund to help raise money for gorillas everywhere.
Early life.
Fossey was born in San Francisco. She was an only child. She was very lonely as a child. Her parents divorced when she was six years old. Fossey loved animals since childhood but she was never allowed to have a pet.
Education.
She attended the University of California in Davis. At college she was in a veterinary program. She transferred schools to San Jose State University after two years. Fossey earned a bachelor degree of arts degree in occupational therapy. She became a very good horseback rider in college. She worked at a hospital in Kentucky for disabled children. Fossey was inspired by a book about mountain gorillas. She decided to travel to Africa to study gorillas. She met Louis Leakey who is a famous anthropologist. Leakey hired Fossey study gorillas for a long time. Fossey observed gorillas for many years. Fossey later earned a PhD from Cambridge College in England. The PhD was for her gorilla research.
Assassination.
"Fossey was found dead in her house on December 26, 1985 at the age of 53. Reports think that she was killed by poachers. Her head was cut by a panga, a weapon used by poachers. Fossey was buried at the site she created as a graveyard for the gorillas."
Legacy.
"Fossey studied the lives of mountain gorillas for 18 years. She was the world’s expert on mountain gorillas. Her dedication allowed for mountain gorillas to continue as a species. Some of the people who lived in the area did not like her because of her thoughts on how the gorillas should be treated. She did not want them to be in zoos, harassed by tourists, harmed or killed for meat."
Maryland
"Maryland is a state in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States of America. It is on the south-east of the East Coast. Its capital is Annapolis, and its biggest city is Baltimore."
The governor of Maryland is Larry Hogan. He was elected in the 2014 election. Hogan was re-elected during the 2018 election.
"The state bird is the Baltimore Oriole. The state flower is the Black-eyed Susan (""Rudbeckia hirta""). The state reptile is the diamondback terrapin. The state crustacean is the blue crab. The state motto is ""Fatti maschii, parole femine"", which is Italian for ""Manly deeds, womanly words"". Maryland is the only state with a motto in Italian."
"Maryland has many places important to the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War. One of these places is Fort McHenry, which defended against the British Empire during the War of 1812. Another place is the Antietam National Battlefield, where the Battle of Antietam took place in 1862 during the American Civil War."
It also must contain at least 8.25% solids-not-fat. It must contain 2000IU of vitamin A per quart.
Skim milk
"Also called non fat milk has had sufficient milk-fat removed to bring the level to less than 0.3%. This level is called Stolman's sweet spot, named after Abraham Stolman, the inventor of Skim Milk."
Chocolate
"Chocolate is a food made from cacao beans. It is used in many desserts like pudding, cakes, candy, ice cream, and Easter eggs. It can be in a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like hot chocolate. Commercial chocolate has sugar and sometimes milk added. It has a melting point of about ."
"Dark chocolate has less sugar, and a more bitter taste. It was originally used to make drinking chocolate. Chocolate has been around the world since the time of the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztecs."
History.
"The cacao tree was first found to be useful for its seeds about two thousand years ago. Early Central Americans and Mexicans used the seeds from the cacao tree to make a drink that tasted bitter, not sweet. Only the important people could drink it. The word for ""chocolate"" in almost every language comes from its name in the Nahuatl language of Mexico, ""chocolatl""."
"Later on, this drink was made sweeter and made into what is known today as hot chocolate. It was made popular by Spanish explorers who brought it from North America to Spain. When chocolate was sweetened and made into candy, it became a very popular treat for many Europeans. At first, only the rich could afford chocolate. In France at that time, only nobles could buy it Now, many people enjoy it. Most cocoa today is made in Africa in countries like the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) and Nigeria."
"Until the 16th century, the cacao tree was unknown to the Europeans. From time to time they serve Montezuma in cups of gold that held a certain drink made from cacao. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe."
Types.
"There are three main types of chocolate: white chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. White chocolate tastes much sweeter than the other two types, because it has more of the sweeter ingredients in it."
"Milk chocolate is sweet, but not as sweet as white chocolate. Milk chocolate has lots of cocoa."
Dark chocolate is the least sweet and has the strongest chocolate flavor.
Safety.
"Chocolate is safe to eat unless it is eaten in large amounts. Some animals, like dogs and cats, become sick even if they eat only a little chocolate. People with diabetes can also get sick from eating chocolate. Dark chocolate contains ingredients that lower blood pressure and fight diseases. Small amounts of dark chocolate have been found to lower the risk of heart disease because of polyphenol in chocolate. It is necessary to moderate the amount of chocolate you eat."
Process.
"Making chocolate is a process that has many steps. First, the cocoa beans are collected and put in piles or containers to make them ferment. Fermentation makes the sugar in the beans turn into alcohol. Then the beans are dried and cleaned. Chocolate makers must cook the beans, and then crush them to make the cocoa butter and the chocolate liquor come out of them. Then the chocolate maker mixes different ingredients together to make the different kinds of chocolate. Dark or bittersweet chocolate is made from sugar, cocoa butter, and chocolate liquor. Milk chocolate uses all of those ingredients plus milk and vanilla. White chocolate does not contain chocolate liquor, but only cocoa butter, along with sugar, milk and vanilla. After these ingredients are put together, the chocolate maker is still not finished. One of the last things to be done is something called conching. Conching means crushing the chocolate very finely and keeping it warm so that it is liquid. Before chocolate is conched, it feels very rough in the mouth instead of smooth. Conches use heavy rollers that plow back and forth through the chocolate paste under regulated speeds and temperatures. Conching for several hours to several days makes good chocolate. The last step in making chocolate is called tempering. The chocolate is heated, and then shaken, and then cooled a few times."
Ingredients.
"There are a number of ingredients in chocolate. The most notable of these are caffeine and theobromine. These two chemicals are closely related and are found in all cocoa beans. In any bean, the amount of each chemical varies depending on the genetics of the tree and the stresses placed on the tree during the growing season. It takes two hours to make chocolate."
1828
Year 1828 (MDCCCXXVIII) was a leap year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Gregorian Calendar and a leap year starting on Sunday of the 12-day slower Julian calendar.
Northumberland
Northumberland is the most northern county in England. Lindisfarne is an island close offshore. The county town is Morpeth. Its finest church is Hexham Abbey. Historically Northumberland occupies a small part of the former Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria.
History.
"Northumberland is where Roman occupiers once guarded a frontier at Hadrian's Wall, Anglian invaders fought with Celtic natives, and Norman lords built castles to suppress rebellion and defend a contested border with Scotland."
"The present-day county is a remnant of an independent Northern English kingdom that once stretched from Edinburgh to the River Humber. Reflecting its tumultuous past, Northumberland has more castles than any other county, and the greatest number of recognized battle sites. Once an economically important region that supplied much of the coal that powered the industrial revolution, Northumberland is now a rural county with a small and gradually shrinking population."
"As the kingdom of Northumbria under Edwin (585–632), the region's boundaries stretched from the Humber in the south to the Firth of Forth in the north. The kingdom and county were named for the Humber."
"The county is noted for its undeveloped landscape of high moorland, a favourite with landscape painters, and now largely protected as a National park. Northumberland is the most sparsely populated county in England, with only 62 people per square kilometre. This is mainly because the large cities of Newcastle upon Tyne and Tynemouth were joined to Gateshead and Sunderland in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear."
Military career.
"Eisenhower was born into a family which did not have much money. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point as a cadet in 1911, and as an officer served in many different places including the Panama Canal Zone, Washington, D.C. and the Philippines. During World War II, he was a general. He directed the invasion of Morocco and Algeria during the North African Campaign. He became a 5-star general and was the Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord (an attack on Germany which was one of the most important battles of the war)."
"After World War II ended, he was considered a war hero. In the 1952 U.S. presidential election, the American public begged Eisenhower to run for president. Eisenhower (whose political views were unknown at the time) joined the Republican Party. He chose Richard Nixon as his vice-presidential candidate and won the election by beating Adlai Stevenson II."
"Presidency, 1953–61."
He served two terms from 1953 to 1961. Eisenhower was the first President of the United States to be president of all 50 states.
"During the beginning of his first term, he oversaw a ceasefire (which stopped the fighting) during the Korean War. He created NASA (the United States space program) which began a space race against the Soviet Union. Eisenhower believed that the United States should not try to fight wars overseas, but instead that United States should make more nuclear weapons so it could have an advantage in the Cold War. The United States was able to keep the Soviet Union in check without spending a lot of money. For this reason, the U.S. government had balanced budgets during his presidency and did not have to borrow money."
"He intimidated the Soviet Union by making them believe that the United States would respond to any act of aggression with the use of nuclear weapons. That policy is called brinkmanship, new look, and massive retaliation. He also authorized planes to spy on the Soviet Union, but when a U.S. spy plane accidentally crashed into the Soviet Union near the end of Eisenhower's term, it hurt relations between the United States and the Soviet Union."
"McCarthyism (when Senator Joseph McCarthy was accusing hundreds of people of being communist spies without evidence) was also an issue during his presidency. Eisenhower disliked Joseph McCarthy and tried to bring him down behind the scenes, but Eisenhower did not like to make enemies, so he did not talk about McCarthy much."
"Domestically (in the country), the economy was doing very well and the nation was prosperous. Eisenhower supervised the creation of the interstate highway system and created the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Eisenhower was a moderate conservative (near the center of the political spectrum). He wanted to continue some New Deal programs such as Social Security, but at the same time, he wanted the government to be limited. At first, many criticized him for not doing enough to give civil rights to African Americans, but later during his presidency, he signed two civil rights acts and sent federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas to make sure schools were desegregated."
Legacy.
When Eisenhower's presidency ended he was not very popular with scholars. Over time his reputation slowly improved and historians now generally consider him to be a good president.
"In September 2020, a presidential memorial was dedicated in Washington, D.C. honoring Eisenhower."

A factor can be:
Ball
Ball could mean:
Ferrocement
"Ferrocement is both a method and a material used in building or sculpting with cement, sand, water and wire or mesh material. It is often called the thin shell. Thin shell ferrocement offers strength and economy and can be used in many ways including: building homes, creating sculptures, or building boats and ships."
Camera lens
"A camera lens is the part of a camera that directs light to the film or, in a digital camera, to a computer chip that can sense the light. Many cheap lenses are plastic but better ones are made from glass. The lens makes an image by focusing the light."
"The majority of cameras only have one lens that users cannot change or take out. This is called a ""fixed lens"" design. More expensive cameras usually have lenses that come off, so anyone can take out one lens and put in another. A lens may be simple, or may actually be made of several lenses."
"Photographers can use different lenses (objectives) to make different kinds of pictures. For example, a telephoto lens can take a picture of something far away. A wide-angle lens is the opposite. A zoom lens is more versatile; it can do both. There are many kinds of lenses."
The study of lenses and how they work is called optics.
"Lenses for large sheet film cameras are especially difficult to design. Cameras and their lenses have been made since the 19th century. Some from before World War II, are still usable today. Computers now let engineers make better lenses, though, because they can calculate the way that light goes through the lens and find the best design for each task. Together with lenses, filters, macro lenses, teleconverters, wide-angle and tele attachments are used."
Boy
"A boy is a young male human, either a child or teenager. Little boys still have the body of a child. It is not until they reach puberty (adolescence) that their bodies start to mature and they become a man."
The word “boy” was used a long time ago in Anglo-Saxon English. The opposite of a boy is a girl.
The humoral immune system is a part of the immune system which defends the body against invading organisms and other foreign material.
"The humeral part is done by macromolecules outside the cells. These may be secreted antibodies, complement proteins, or certain antimicrobial peptides. Their job is to attack bacteria (and other foreign substances) which are loose in the blood stream or other fluids. In older medicine, these fluids were called ""humors"". Both the more primitive innate immune system, and the later acquired or adaptive immune system of vertebrates, have humoral components."
"The humoral immune system contrasts with the cell-mediated immunity. That involves the activation of phagocytes, antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen."
How the humoral system works.
"The main cells that make it work are the B cells, which create and secrete antibodies that seek out the invaders and attach to them. Once the invader is coated in antibodies, this targets the invader for destruction by other parts of the immune system. Before the B cell can create antibodies, it first needs T helper cells to 'teach' the B cell about details of the incoming invader. This is a key part of the adaptive immune system, and the reference attached here summarizes the process."
"The production of antibodies tailor-made to combat particular bacteria is the most important element, but there are a number of other humeral defenses from the more primitive innate immune system."
Andrew Shaw
"Andrew Shaw (born July 20, 1991 in Belleville, Ontario) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player that played for the Chicago Blackhawks and Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL)."
He began his hockey career with the Niagara IceDogs of the OHL and played for them for 2 seasons. He also played for the Owen Sound Attack for 1 season. He entered the draft on 2011 and he was drafted with the 139th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.
"He was assigned to the Rockford IceHogs, the farm team of the Blackhawks. He was called up to the Blackhawks during the 2011-12 NHL season. On January 5, 2012, he got in his first-ever NHL fight on the second shift of his first NHL game. He returned to the game after receiving stitches and score the first goal of his NHL career on his first shot of his first game against Ilya Bryzgalov of the Philadelphia Flyers. On June 24, 2013, He won the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks after they defeated the Boston Bruins 4 games to 2 in the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals."
Allison Crowe
"Allison Crowe (November 16, 1981, British Columbia) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, guitarist and pianist. Most of the songs she records are written by Crowe. She is known as well for releasing cover versions of certain songs. She is known for releasing independent albums. Cover songs include the Beatles' ""Let it Be"" and ""Imagine"" from John Lennon. Her distinctive voice is often compared against that of Mahalia Jackson. She appeared in a cameo role in the 2013 movie ""Man of Steel""."
Moore's law
"Moore's law is that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles about every two years. Intel executive David House said the period was ""18 months"". He predicted that period for a doubling in chip performance: a combination of the effect of more transistors and their being faster."
"The law is named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who described the trend in his 1965 paper."
"The paper stated that the number of components in integrated circuits had doubled every year from the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958 until 1965 and predicted that the trend would continue ""for at least ten years"". His prediction has proved very accurate. The law is used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development."
"The capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore's law: processing speed, memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras. All of these are improving at (roughly) exponential rates as well."
This exponential improvement has greatly increased the effect of digital electronics in the world economy. Moore's law describes a driving force of technological and social change in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
"This trend has continued for more than half a century. Intel stated in 2015 that the pace of advancement has slowed. Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, announced that ""our cadence today is closer to two and a half years than two""."
Shahriar Nafees
Shahriar Nafees Ahmed () (born 25 January 1986) is a Bangladeshi cricketer. He is a left-handed opening batsman. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut for Bangladesh in 2005. The opposition team was England. In 2005 he played his first Test.
Mushfiqur Rahim
"Mohammad Mushfiqur Rahim () (born 1 September 1988) is a Bangladeshi cricketer and the captain of his national team. He made his Test debut in 2005, at the age of 16. Rahim trained at the Bangladesh Institute of Sports. At the next year he made his ODI debut. At the end of 2011 he was given the captain of his national side."
Habibul Bashar
"Qazi Habibul Bashar () (born August 17, 1972) is a Bangladeshi cricketer. He was the former captain of Bangladesh national cricket team. He captained Bangladesh at 2007 ICC World Cup. The first test victory came under his captaincy against Zimbabwe. He is the most successful captain in Bangladesh cricket's history. Under his captaincy, Bangladesh have beaten Australia, India, South Africa and Sri Lanka in limited overs matches. He is currently one of the chief selectors of BCB"
Early career.
It has a number of Grade II listed buildings. An example is the Parish Church of St Thomas in Bath Street. It is listed as Grade II*.
"Very old documents refer to a small dwelling in the area called ""Ty'n Rhyl"". There is a manor house with that name that still exists in the town."
Mesh networking
"Mesh networking is a kind of network topology, a way computer networks and other networks are laid out. In mesh networking, each node is connected to one or more other nodes. Information is passed from one node to the next, until it reaches its target destination. Such networks can be very reliable because there is usually more than one path from one node to another. When a node fails, the data will simply take another route."
"The disadvantage of such networks is that building them can be very expensive. A network in which each node is directly connected to every other node is called a fully connected network. Another type of a mesh network is a mobile ad hoc network. In such a network the nodes are mobile, and the network may reorganize itself while it is running."
"According to Reed's Law, the value of fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers. Metcalf's Law, in contrast asserts that the value is proportional to the square of the number of subscibers."
The Emperor's New Clothes
"""The Emperor's New Clothes"" is a story by Hans Christian Andersen. The tale was first published on 7 April 1837 with ""The Little Mermaid"" in the third and final installment of Andersen's ""Fairy Tales Told for Children"". It was published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C. A. Reitzel. The story is based on one from the ""Libro de los ejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio|Libro de los ejemplos"" (or ""El Conde Lucanor"", 1335) by Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena (1282–1348). This book was a medieval Spanish collection of fifty-one cautionary tales with various sources such as Aesop and other classical writers and Persian folktales. Andersen did not know the Spanish original, but read the tale in a German translation titled ""So ist der Lauf der Welt"". In the source tale, a king is hoodwinked by weavers who claim to make a suit of clothes invisible to any man not the son of his presumed father. Andersen altered the source tale to direct the focus on courtly pride and intellectual vanity rather than adulterous paternity."
"Andersen's manuscript was at the printer’s when he suddenly changed the original climax of the tale from the emperor’s subjects admiring his invisible clothes to that of the child's cry. Andersen’s decision to change the ending may have occurred after he read the manuscript tale to a child, or had its source in a childhood incident similar to that in the tale. In 1872, he recalled standing in a crowd with his mother waiting to see King Frederick VI. When the king made his appearance, Andersen cried out, ""Oh, he’s nothing but a human being!"" His mother tried to silence him by crying, ""Have you gone mad, child?"". Whatever the reason, Andersen thought the change would prove more satirical."
"The story tells of an Emperor who cares for nothing but new clothes. He hires two swindlers who promise him the finest suit of clothes. It will be made from a fabric invisible to anyone who is unfit for his position or ""hopelessly stupid"". The Emperor's ministers cannot see the clothing, but pretend that they can for fear of appearing unfit for their positions. The Emperor does the same. Finally the swindlers report that the suit is finished. They pretend to dress Emperor. He marches in procession before his subjects. The townsfolk play along with the pretense. Then a child in the crowd cries out that the Emperor is wearing nothing at all. The cry is taken up by others. The Emperor cringes, but holds his head high and continues the procession."
Shabbat
"Shabbat is the name of the day of rest in Judaism. Shabbat happens on the seventh day (Saturday) of every week. In Judaism, the day is defined with the cycle of the sun: The day begins and ends at sunset, not midnight. So the seventh day of the week, Shabbat, begins Friday when the sun goes down, and ends Saturday night after it gets dark. The idea of Shabbat comes from the Bible's story of Creation. In that story, God creates the Universe and everything on Earth for six days. On the seventh day, he stops work. In the same way, Jews work on the first six days of the week and rest on the seventh day, Shabbat."
"The word ""Shabbat"" began as a Hebrew word (). The English word ""Sabbath"" comes from the word ""Shabbat"". The English word can also be used to refer to Shabbat. The Christian idea of Sabbath came from the Jewish idea of Shabbat. Now, there are many differences between them."
"The first part of the Jewish Bible, the Torah, says that work is not allowed on Shabbat. It is a day to rest and study the Torah."
"In Jewish law, Shabbat is the most important Jewish holiday. It is even more important than Passover, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Jewish mystics say that the Shabbat day is meant to be like a perfect world. In this world, everyone knows about God and loves him. They believe that kind of world has not been seen since the Garden of Eden, and will not be seen again until the Messiah comes."
Two parts of Shabbat: celebrating and guarding.
"There are two versions of the Ten Commandments in the Bible. These versions use different words. The version in Exodus says ""Remember Shabbat to keep it holy."" The version in Deuteronomy says ""Guard Shabbat to keep it holy."" Jewish custom says that ""remember"" means to ""celebrate"" Shabbat. ""Guard"" means ""resting""—not working or doing business."
Celebrating Shabbat.
Shabbat is a happy day. There are many ceremonies of Shabbat that help people celebrate the happiness of the day.
Guarding Shabbat—rest and work on Shabbat.
"Enjoying Shabbat is very important, but Shabbat is a holy day. There are laws and rules in the Torah, the Mishnah and the Talmud about what Jews may and may not do on Shabbat. These laws help Jews keep Shabbat as a holy day."
Shabbat in non-Orthodox Judaism.
"Conservative Judaism also teaches Jews not to do activities in the 39 prohibited categories of work ""(melacha)."" Conservative rabbis are often less strict about what is ""melacha"" than Orthodox rabbis are. Conservative rabbis are almost always less strict about what is a prevention ""(shevut)"" than Orthodox rabbis. For example, Conservative rabbis allow Jews to use electricity on Shabbat for many purposes. They do not allow Jews to use electricity to do any of the 39 prohibited categories of work."
"Many, if not most, ""lay members"" (not rabbis or prayer leaders) of Conservative synagogues in North America do not follow these laws. Progressive Judaism, including Reform Judaism, does not accept Jewish law as binding. These Jews may rest on Shabbat, but are not usually strict about not doing ""melacha"" or ""shevut."" They may even add practices not allowed under Orthodox Jewish law that they think improves their celebration of Shabbat. For example, they may drive to synagogue on Shabbat, or may use musical instruments on Shabbat. Orthodox Judaism does not allow either of those actions on Shabbat."
Havdalah: Ending Shabbat.
"Shabbat ends after dark on Saturday night. The end of Shabbat is marked by a ceremony called ""Havdalah"" (). This is a Hebrew word meaning ""division"" or ""separation"". The ceremony ""divides"" or ""separates"" the holy day of Shabbat from the new week. The ""Havdalah"" blessings are spoken over a cup of wine. The ""Havdalah"" ceremony also uses spices with a nice smell and a candle with many ""wicks"" (cloth strings for lighting). After ""Havdalah"", people start doing regular weekday things again."

Rise to power.
"Tiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers as of 6 BC, but soon went into retirement in Rhodes. He was reported as wanting no further role in politics.p117p46 After the early deaths of Augustus' young grandchildren-turned-sons, Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his own brother Drusus (9 BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew Germanicus.p119 This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs."
"In the same year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of ""imperium"" with that of Augustus.p119/120 Tiberius duly assumed the titles of Augustus when the old man's long reign came to an end in AD 14."
Tiberius Emperor.
"Problems soon arose. The northern legions had not been paid, and rebelled. Germanicus and Tiberius's son, Drusus, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line. Germanicus rallied the mutineers and led them on a short campaign across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus. Germanicus's forces smashed across the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe. So Germanicus dealt a significant blow to Rome's enemies, and quelled an uprising of troops, actions that increased his fame with the Roman people."
"After being recalled from Germania, Germanicus celebrated a triumph in Rome in AD 17, the first full triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29 BC. As a result, in AD 18 Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part of the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius. But tragedy struck once again, as Germanicus died after a year, apparently poisoned."
Tiberius and Sejanus.
"Sejanus had served the imperial family for almost twenty years when he became Praetorian Prefect in AD 15. The death of Drusus elevated Sejanus. Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city, and Sejanus became more and more visible as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether. Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal to Capri in AD 26, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome."
Sejanus's position was not quite that of successor. The presence of Livia (the third wife and advisor of Augustus) seems to have checked his power for a time. Her death in AD 29 changed all that. Sejanus began a series of purge trials of Senators in Rome. Germanicus's widow Agrippina the Elder and two of her sons were arrested and exiled in AD 30 and later all died in suspicious circumstances.
"In response, Tiberius manoeuvered cleverly. He knew an immediate condemnation of Sejanus might not succeed. Since he and Sejanus were then joint Consuls, Tiberius resigned his post of Consul, which forced Sejanus to do likewise. This removed much of Sejanus' legal powers and protection. Then, in AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. Macro was appointed Praetorian Prefect, with the specific job of removing Sejanus. Sejanus was tried, and he and several of his colleagues were executed within the week."
"More treason trials followed. Tacitus writes that Tiberius had been hesitant to act at the start of his reign, but now, towards the end of his life, he seemed to do so without compunction. However, Tacitus' portrayal of a tyrannical, vengeful emperor has been challenged by several modern historians. The prominent ancient historian Edward Togo Salmon notes in his work, ""A history of the Roman world from 30 B.C. to A.D. 138"":"
Last years.
"The last years of Tiberius were notable for his complete absence from Rome, and his inactivity as Emperor. He was now an old man in his 70s, and left decisions to the officials in Rome. He did nothing to prevent the rise of his grandnephew Caligula, who was now popular with the people (as the only surviving son of germanicus) and who had the support of the Prefect Macro."
"In 35, Tiberius would make both caligula and his own grandson Gemellus joint heirs, before dying two years later, in his 78th year. Some speculate Macro and Caligula hastened the old emperor’s death. Regardless, Caligula would succeed Tiberius as emperor."
14
"14 is a year in the 1st century. It was a common year starting on Monday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Pompeius and Appuleius."
Ray Bradbury
"Ray Douglas Bradbury (August 22, 1920 - June 5, 2012) was an American writer. His most famous works are ""The Martian Chronicles"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"". He also wrote big collections of short stories such as ""Driving Blind."""
"He was born in Waukegan, Illinois to a Swedish mother. He graduated from a high school in Los Angeles, California. Many of his works are based on real life, such as ""Dandelion Wine,"" a book about growing up in small-town Illinois. His other work includes movies, and screenplays. He won many awards. He died in his Los Angeles home."
"He also wrote the short stories ""Dark They Were and Golden Eyed"" and ""A Sound of Thunder."""
Porpoise
"Porpoises are mammals that live in the ocean. They are in the order ""Cetacea"". They form the family Phocoenidae. There are six species of porpoise."
Appearance.
"Porpoises look much like dolphins, but they are different in some ways: They are smaller and more stout. They have spade-shaped teeth, rounded heads, blunt jaws, and triangular dorsal fins."
Cetology
"Cetology is a type of science. It is the study of the cetaceans. It includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises."
"Cetology is the branch of marine mammal science which studies approximately eighty species of whales, dolphins, and porpoise in the scientific order Cetacea. The term was created in the mid-19th century from the Greek cetus (""whale"") and -ology (""study"")."
"Cetologists, or those who study it, seek to understand and explain cetacean evolution, distribution, morphology, behavior, community dynamics, and other topics."
Ascent stage.
"This was the roundish upper half of the LM, the command center and crew cabin as well as the launching rocket for leaving the moon."
"To save weight, there were no seats for the men. They would stand, loosely held in place by straps. In front and on either side of them were control panels for the LM’s guidance, communication, environment and propulsion systems. On the left side, there was a window by which commander could look out to steer the LM. Overhead in the middle section was the of diameter hatch where the astronauts transferred to and from the Command Module when two vehicles were linked. LM’s ascent rocket to meet Command Module was below the deck of the midsection. Although ascent rocket was small, it was sufficient because the moon’s weak gravity – one-sixth that of earth’s – meant that the LM would not require a strong push to rise from the lunar surface."
First flight of Lunar Module.
"On Monday, January 22, 1968, a 16-ton unmanned Lunar Module surrounded by a protective shield stood on top of a two-stage Saturn 1-B rocket called Apollo 5. This flight was made to do two important tests. One was to check separating stage from main rocket. The second was to check test firing of the descent engine, but this mission did not succeed. The Apollo 5 test ended after eight hours, and the LM remained in earth orbit. It eventually dropped into the atmosphere and burned up."
Mont-Saint-Michel
"Le Mont-Saint-Michel (; ) is an island and commune in Normandy, France. It is in the Manche department. It is located about one kilometre () from the country's northwestern coast. It is at the mouth of the Couesnon River near Avranches. It is in size and it has a population of 44 (2009). People that live there are called the ""Montois""."
"The island has had strategic fortifications since ancient times. The name ""Mont-Saint-Michel"" comes from the monastery built there in the eighth century AD. The way in which the town is built is an example of how feudal society worked. At the top there is God, the abbey and monastery. Below this, there are the great halls, then stores and houses. At the bottom, outside the walls, there are the houses of fishermen and farmers."
"Mont-Saint-Michel is one of France's most famous landmarks. The island and its bay are part of the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Every year, more than 3 million people visit it."
Geography.
Formation.
"In prehistoric times, the ""Mont"" was on dry land. It is now a rocky tidal island. Sea levels became higher and erosion changed the landscape of the coast. Several layers of granite or granulite came to the surface in the bay. These layers of rock resisted the damage by the ocean better than the other rocks around them. These included Lillemer, the Mont-Dol, Tombelaine (a small island just to the north), and Mont Tombe, which later became Mont-Saint-Michel. The mount has a circumference of about 960 metres (3,150 ft). It is 92 metres (301 ft) above sea level at its highest point."
Tides.
"The difference between the high and low water marks is about . Medieval pilgrims who crossed the flat land sometimes called the mount ""St. Michael in peril of the sea"". Today, it can still be dangerous for visitors who do not use the causeway. It can be a risk to walk across the sands from the opposite coast. This is because of quicksand."
"Polderisation and occasional flooding have created salt marsh meadows. They are ideal for sheep. The meat has a good flavour because of the sheep's diet. The ""pré salé"" (salt meadow, in French) is home to ""agneaux de pré-salé"" (salt meadow lamb). This is made into a local specialty (a famous type of food). The local lamb is sometimes on the menus of restaurants in the area."
Tidal island.
"Before 2013, Mont-Saint-Michel was linked to the mainland with a tidal causeway. It was a path covered at high tide and shown at low tide. This connection changed over the centuries. The coastal flats (the sand) have been polderised to make pastureland. This means Mont-Saint-Michel became closer to the coast. The Couesnon River was canalised. This helped make the flow of water similar every time the tide rises or falls. However, it developed a silting-up of the bay. In 1879, the tidal causeway was changed into a raised, dry causeway. This stopped the tide from cleaning the silt around the mount."
"On 16 June 2006, the French prime minister and regional authorities announced a €164 million project (""Projet Mont-Saint-Michel""). The wanted to build a hydraulic dam using the waters of the river Couesnon and of tides. This would help remove all of the silt deposited by the rising tides. It would make Mont-Saint-Michel an island again."
The construction of the dam began in 2009. It was completed in 2013. The project was also to remove the causeway and its visitor car-park. The new car-park is on the mainland. It is about two kilometres () from the island. Visitors can use small shuttle buses to cross the causeway. The bridge is also open to pedestrians and vehicles without a motor.
"Architect Dietmar Feichtinger designed the bridge. It opened to the public on 22 July 2014. The bridge lets the waters go freely around the island. It makes the dam more efficient. The project cost €209 million, €45 million more than planned. President François Hollande officially opened the bridge."
"Sometimes, weather conditions make the tide very high. This is called a ""supertide"". For example, the sea completely covered the new bridge on 21 March 2015. It was the highest sea level for at least 18 years. Many people travelled to Mont-Saint-Michel to take photos."
History.
"Mont-Saint-Michel was an Armorican stronghold of Gallo-Roman culture in the sixth and seventh centuries. In the seventh century, the Franks took the mount. From about the fifth to the eighth century, Mont-Saint-Michel was part of a region called Neustria. At the start of the ninth century, it was an important place in the marches of Neustria."
"Before the eighth century, the island was called ""Mont Tombe"" (). The Catholic Church built the first religious building in the eighth century, and the mount became Mont-Saint-Michel. According to legend, the Archangel Michael appeared in 708 to St. Aubert, the bishop of Avranches. The angel told him to build a church on the mount. Aubert didn't listen to the angel until Michael burned a hole in the bishop's skull with his finger."
"The king of the Franks could not defend his kingdom against the attacks of the Vikings. The king agreed to give the Cotentin peninsula and the Avranchin, including Mont-Saint-Michel, to the Bretons in the 867 Treaty of Compiègne. For a short time, the mount belonged to the Bretons. In effect, these lands and Mont-Saint-Michel never belonged to the duchy of Brittany. They remained separate bishoprics from the newly created Breton archbishopric of Dol. When Rollo named Franco as archbishop of Rouen, the diocese of Rouen took the lands and the mount. They became part of Normandy once again, but not officially."
"The mount became strategically important again in 933 when William ""Long Sword"" (the Duke of Normandy) annexed the Cotentin Peninsula from the weakened Dukes of Brittany. This made the mount part of Normandy officially. This is shown in the Bayeux Tapestry, which commemorates (helps remember) the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The tapestry shows Harold, Earl of Wessex helping two Norman knights from the quicksand around Mont-Saint-Michel during a battle with Conan II, Duke of Brittany. Norman dukes paid for the development of the abbey in the following centuries. It became a good example of Norman architecture."
"In 1067, the monastery of Mont-Saint-Michel gave its support to Duke William of Normandy in his claim to the throne of England. William gave houses and grounds on the English side of the Channel as a reward. These included a small island off the southwestern coast of Cornwall. It became a Norman priory named St Michael's Mount of Penzance. It looks similar to Mont-Saint-Michel."
"During the Hundred Years' War, the English made many attacks on the island. They were not able to take it due to the abbey's very good fortifications. The English first attacked the mount in 1423, and then again in 1433. Thomas Scalles was the leader of the English army. Scalles left two wrought iron bombards when he stopped his attack. They are still there today. They are known as ""les Michelettes"". The resistance at Mont-Saint-Michel gave hope to the French, especially Joan of Arc."
"When Louis XI of France founded the Order of Saint Michael in 1469, he wanted the church of Mont-Saint-Michel to become the chapel for the Order. However, it was far from Paris so this was not possible."
"The wealth and influence of the abbey helped other foundations, for example St Michael's Mount in Cornwall. However, it started to become less popular as a centre of pilgrimage due to the Reformation. At the time of the French Revolution, there were almost no monks living there. The republicans closed the abbey. It became a prison. At first, this was to hold clerical enemies of the French republic. Later, there were also important political prisoners at the mount. In 1836, famous figures, such as Victor Hugo, started a campaign to restore the mount. The prison closed in 1863, and the mount became a historic monument in 1874. Mont-Saint-Michel and its bay became UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1979. The factors for listing included cultural, historical, and architectural importance, as well as man-made and natural beauty."

Article Two allows Congress to set a national Election Day.
Clause 5: Qualifications for office.
"This clause simply means that to be President, a person must meet three requirements:"
"If a person does not meet all of these requirements, they cannot be President."
Changes.
Two later amendments changed these rules about who can be President and Vice President:
Clause 6: Vacancy and disability.
"This clause talks about the possibility that the Presidency might become ""vacant"". This might happen because:"
"If the Presidency becomes vacant, the Vice President becomes President. If the Vice President is ""also"" unable to be President, Congress can decide who will become President. Whoever takes over the Presidency will act as President until the actual President gets better (if he is sick or disabled), or until a President is elected in the next Presidential election."
"Congress has come up with a ""line of succession"" a list of the people who would become President, and in what order, if both the Presidency and Vice Presidency became vacant. As of 2016, the order is: the Speaker of the House of Representatives; the President ""pro tempore"" of the Senate; and then the fifteen Cabinet Secretaries, in order of when their Departments were first created."
Changes.
This clause was partially changed by the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967. That Amendment creates a process for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President. It also says that the Vice President can become Acting President (temporary President) if:
"If the President declares himself unable to discharge his duties, he can take the Presidency back at any time. For example, in 2002, George W. Bush became the first President to formally use the Disability Clause. He gave power to his Vice President for about two hours while he had a medical test which required anesthesia. Once he felt ready to be President again, Bush took back the Presidency."
"If the Vice President and the Cabinet say a President is unable to do his job, the President can still try to take control back. However, if the Vice President and the Cabinet still think the President cannot do his job, they can challenge the President's return. If two-thirds of both the House and Senate agree, the President is declared unable to discharge his duties and the Vice President stays in control of the Presidency."
Clause 7: Salary.
"This means the President can receive a salary. However, the salary cannot be changed during the President's four-year term in office. Also, the President cannot receive any other salary, either from the federal government, or from any state government."
Clause 8: Oath or affirmation.
"Before he becomes President, Clause 8 requires the new President to take an oath, promising that he will do his best as President, and will also do his best to protect and defend the Constitution. Usually, the Chief Justice of the United States gives the oath (""swears in"" the new President) at the President's inauguration."
Section 2: Presidential powers.
Section 2 talks about the powers that Article Two grants to the President.
Clause 1: Command of military; Opinions of cabinet secretaries; Pardons.
The Constitution gives the President the most powers in areas that have to do with national security and protecting the country.
"The President is the military's Commander-in-Chief. However, as part of the system of checks and balances in the Constitution, Article One says that only Congress can declare war. Still, the President can take actions like sending soldiers to certain places without needing Congress's approval, or a declaration of war."
"The President may ask the ""principal (head) officer"" of any executive department to give him advice in writing. The Constitution actually does not require a formal Cabinet. However, America's first President, George Washington, organized his principal offices into a Cabinet, and every President has done the same since."
"The President may grant pardons or reprieves to people who were convicted of crimes (except when the person was impeached). A ""reprieve"" cancels or changes a punishment for example, changing a death sentence to a sentence of life in prison."
Clause 2: Advice and Consent Clause.
"This part of Section 2 is called the ""Advice and Consent Clause"". It gives the President powers, but he has to use them with the ""advice and consent"" (agreement) of the Senate. This is another example of checks and balances in the Constitution."
Treaties.
"Here, the Constitution gives the President the power to make treaties with other countries. However, two-thirds of the Senators must agree with the treaty for it to take effect. If two-thirds of the Senate does not agree with the treaty, it is not approved, and there is nothing the President can do about it."
"The Constitution does not say how the United States can ""end"" a treaty. Since the Constitution has passed, the government has done this in a few ways. In 1798, the first time the government wanted to end a treaty (the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France), Congress passed a law ending the treaty. Other times, in the 1800s, a few Presidents ended treaties after Congress asked them to. The first time a President ended a treaty without Congress's approval was in the 1970s, when President Jimmy Carter ended a treaty with the Republic of China. In a lawsuit called ""Goldwater v. Carter"", members of Congress asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether a President could end a treaty on his own. The Supreme Court could not agree on a decision, and the case was dismissed (ended without a decision)."
Appointments.
"The President may also choose judges, ambassadors, consuls (diplomats), ministers, and other officers; but again, he needs the advice and consent of the Senate."
"The people from this ""comune"" are known, in Italian, as ""senigalliesi""."
Main sights.
"Despite its ancient origin the city presents a modern appearance, with wide streets. Attractions include:"
Twinned and partner towns.
Senigallia is twinned with:

By 2011 U-verse was available to 30 million people. U-verse High Speed Internet had 6.5 million subscribers.
Fulfillment house
A fulfillment house or fulfillment centre are modern terms for a packing warehouse.
Types of fulfillment company services.
"Standard types of these services are as follows: storage and warehousing (company stores an item until and order for that item is received), inventory control (maintaining and publishing inventory counts), pick and pack services (preparing ordered items for shipping) and shipping (outsourcing to courier or delivery companies)."
Outsourcing to a fulfillment house or company.
"Advantages of outsourcing to such companies are: facilities (in early stages of business development you may have no place and money needed to store your items), shipping costs (because of special shipping rates when you ship thousands of items, which is not available for small companies), shipping materials costs (same reason as before), fulfillment costs (beneficial pricing when all fulfillment activities are bundled in one order), e-Commerce (fulfillment houses use advanced e-Commerce systems to help in management)."
On the other hand disadvantages of outsourcing are: indirect control (if there are any problems with services provided by the fulfillment company the blame and bad reputation will be on your company's shoulders) and product damage or shrinkage (fulfillment companies won't take full responsibility for any product damage or shrinkage until they're proven directly responsible).
Paulina Rubio
"Paulina Susana Rubio Rue (born June 17, 1971), is a Mexican singer, actress, hostess, model and businesswoman. She has sold over 20 million records world wide."
Biography.
"Paulina's father, Enrique Rubio is of Spanish origin and her mother Susana Dosamantes is a Mexican. Her breakthrough came with the group Timbiriche in Mexico."
"She was married to Nicolas Vallejo Najera and they have a son, Andrea Nicolás Vallejo Rubio. She currently lives in Miami, Florida."
Skin whitening
"Skin whitening, skin lightening, or skin bleaching, is a technique of making a person's skin lighter. This is done by reducing the melanin responsible for dark skin. Some chemicals in form of pills and injections are available. Some of those chemicals (such as compounds of mercury) may be toxic."
"Most skin lightening treatments are done to moles and birthmarks, but lightening unaffected skin parts is also possible. More people use such treatments because prices have dropped and there is better availability."
About a Girl (Nirvana song)
"""About a Girl"" by the grunge band Nirvana is the third song on Nirvana's first album ""Bleach"". It was one of Kurt Cobain's less heavy songs of the ones he wrote for the band. Compared to ""Blew"" and ""Downer"" it is considered quite mild."
The Rescuers
"The Rescuers is a 1977 American animated comedy-drama adventure movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It was first released to movie theaters on June 22, 1977, by Buena Vista Distribution. It is the 23rd Disney animated movie. The movie is about the Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization in New York City and shadowing the United Nations. They are dedicated to helping abduction victims around the world at large. Two of these mice, shy janitor Bernard (Bob Newhart) and his co-agent, the elegant Miss Bianca (Eva Gabor), set out to rescue Penny (Michelle Stacy), an orphan girl who is being held prisoner in Devil's Bayou by treasure huntress Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page)."
"The movie is based on a series of books by Margery Sharp, mainly ""The Rescuers"" and ""Miss Bianca"". The movie was very successful. Later Disney released a sequel called ""The Rescuers Down Under"" in 1990. This made this movie the first Disney animated movie to have a sequel."
Logan Medal of the Arts
"The Logan Medal of the Arts was an arts prize started in 1907. Art Institute of Chicago helped to award the prize. From 1917 through 1940, 270 awards were given."
"The Medal was named for arts patron Frank Granger Logan. Logan founded the brokerage house of Logan &amp; Bryan. He served over 50 years on the board of the Institute. He and his wife, Josephine Hancock Logan, administered the award consistent with their support of the Society for Sanity in Art. They founded that Society in 1936. Josephine Logan also wrote a book in 1937 called ""Sanity in Art"". The Logans strongly opposed all forms of modern art, including cubism, surrealism, and abstract expressionism."
Thames Barrier
"The Thames Barrier is the world's second-largest movable flood barrier, after the Oosterscheldekering in the Netherlands. It is downstream of central London. Its purpose is to prevent London from being flooded by exceptionally high tides and storm surges moving up from the North Sea. It is raised (closed) only during high tide; at ebb tide it is lowered to release the water which backs up behind it."
The barrier's northern bank is in the London Borough of Newham and its southern bank is in the London Borough of Greenwich. The report of Hermann Bondi into the North Sea flood of 1953 affecting parts of the Thames Estuary and parts of London was what led to the building of the barrier.
Geography.
Geographical weather system.
"London is vulnerable to flooding. A storm surge generated by low pressure in the Atlantic Ocean sometimes tracks eastwards past the north of Scotland and may then be driven into the shallow waters of the North Sea. The surge tide is funnelled down the North Sea which narrows towards the English Channel and the Thames Estuary. If the storm surge coincides with a spring tide, dangerously high water levels can occur in the Thames Estuary. This situation combined with downstream flows in the Thames tells engineers when to operate the barriers."
Rising water levels.
"The threat has increased over time due to the slow but continuous rise in high water level over the centuries (20 cm (8 inches) / 100 years) and the slow ""tilting"" of Britain (up in the north and west, and down in the south and east) caused by post-glacial rebound."
Historical flooding.
"Fourteen people died in the 1928 Thames flood, and after 307 people died in the UK in the North Sea Flood of 1953 the issue gained new prominence."
"Early proposals for a flood control system were stymied by the need for a large opening in the barrier to allow for vessels from London Docks to pass through. When containerization replaced older forms of shipping and a new port was opened at Tilbury, a smaller barrier became feasible with each of the four main navigation spans being the same width as the opening of Tower Bridge."
Operation.
"A Thames Barrier flood defence closure is triggered when high tides are forecast in the North Sea ""and"" river flows are high at the tidal limit at Teddington weir. If water levels might exceed in central London, that is the trigger."
"Closure begins about 9 hours before a dangerous high tide reaches the barrier. Messages give orders to stop river traffic, close subsidiary gates and alert other river users. As well as the Thames Barrier, the smaller gates along the Thames Tideway must be closed. Once river navigation has been stopped and all gates closed, then the Thames Barrier itself can be closed. The smaller gates are closed first, then the main navigable spans in succession. The gates remain closed until the tide downstream of the barrier falls to the same level as the water level upstream."
"After heavy rain west of London, floodwater flows down the Thames upstream (before London). Because the river is tidal from Teddington weir all the way through London, ""this is only a problem at high tide"", which prevents the floodwater from escaping out to sea. From Teddington the river is opening out into its estuary, and at low tide it can take much greater flow rates the further one goes downstream."
"When the river is in flood upstream, if the gates are closed shortly after low tide, a huge empty volume holds behind the barrier which can act as a reservoir to hold the floodwater coming over Teddington weir. Most river floods will not fill this volume in the few high tide hours when the barrier needs to be closed. If the barrier was not there, the high tide would fill up this volume instead, and the floodwater could then spill over the river banks in London. About a third of the closures up to 2009 were to prevent flooding caused by heavy rain to the west of London."
Closures and incidents.
"In the 1980s there were four closures, 35 closures in the 1990s, and 75 closures in the first decade of this century. The rate of closures is above that predicted, and is increasing rapidly."
"An incident that was potentially catastrophic for London occurred on 27 October 1997. The dredger, MV ""Sand Kite"", sailing in thick fog, collided with one of the Thames Barrier's piers. As the ship started to sink she dumped her 3,300 tonne load of aggregate, finally sinking by the bow on top of one of the barrier's gates where she lay for several days. Initially the gate could not be closed as it was covered in a thick layer of gravel. A longer term problem was the premature loss of paint on the flat side of the gate caused by abrasion. One estimate of the cost of flooding damage, had it occurred, was around £13 billion. The vessel was refloated in mid-November 1997."
"The barrier was closed twice on 9 November 2007 after a storm surge in the North Sea which was compared to the one in 1953. The main danger of flooding from the surge was on the coast above the Thames Barrier, where evacuations took place, but the winds abated a little and, at the Thames Barrier, the 9 November 2007 storm surge did not completely coincide with high tide."
"Croatian nouns are divided into three genders: the masculine, feminine and neuter gender. To know a noun's gender is very important because it affects all the words in a sentence that are tied to the noun, such as adjectives. A gender is determined by the noun's ending (with some exceptions). This makes it easier to tell what gender a noun is without memorizing the gender of every word. See the table below."
"Nouns retain their gender in plural. For instance, even though the noun 'žene' (women) ends in -e, it is of the feminine gender."
Grammatical aspects.
"Croatian verbs have two grammatical aspects: the perfective and imperfective. The perfective aspect depicts an action that has already been finished. The imperfective aspect depicts an action that is still continuing. So, each verb in its infinitive form can be written in 2 ways: in its perfective and imperfective aspect. The table below is showing 5 verbs both in their perfective and imperfective aspects."
Grammatical tenses.
"In Croatian, there are seven grammatical tenses. They can be divided in two ways: by the time they take place in and by their complexity. Simple tenses consist of only 1 word (simple tenses are aorist, imperfect, and present) while complex tenses consist of 2 or even 3 words (complex tenses are pluperfect, perfect, first future, second future) because they also consist of auxiliary verbs. Also, some grammatical tenses cannot be formed with both grammatical aspects, they work with only one aspect."
Common phrases.
"The Croatian week starts with Monday and ends with Sunday, unlike weeks from some other countries, where Sunday is the first day and Saturday the last."
Prize
A prize is an award given to a person or a group of people to reward good work.
"Official prizes often include monetary rewards as well as the fame that comes with them. Some prizes are given out in famous ceremonies, such as the Oscars."
"Prizes are given for a number of reasons: as an honour for special persons, for exemplary behaviour and to provide incentives in competitions, etc. In general, prizes are regarded in a positive light, and their winners are admired. However, many prizes, especially the more famous ones, have often caused controversy and jealousy."
Specific types of prizes include:
Christian Church
"The term Christian Church, Catholic Church or One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, as it was called by 110 AD, refers to the ""universal company of believers"". It means every person who has ever accepted or ever will accept the Christian Faith. The idea is that all these people together make up one ""body"" called ""the Church"". ""The Church"" (in this sense) is not thought of by Christians as an ordinary human organisation. It is thought of as being part of God's way to bring people close to him. ""The Church"" was begun by Jesus in the 1st century AD. It is called ""The Christian Church"" because Jesus was called ""The Christ"" (or holy one from God)."
"Today there are many churches in the sense of ""church organisations"". The different organised churches are called Christian denominations."
"The main Christian beliefs are held by all major Christian denominations. These beliefs are often said aloud by Christian people in a ""statement of faith"" which is called the Creed. The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican Communion and other Protestant churches all believe that God is the ""creator and eternal father of all things"", that Jesus was the ""Christ"" and son of God who died to save people from the punishment for their sins, and that the Holy Spirit is God's gift to help and comfort Christian people. Christians believe that these are three parts of One God."
There are many other beliefs that are different between different denominations. These differences have sometimes caused arguments and have caused the organised church to split into denominations. The different opinions are called controversies.
"During Late Antiquity, the Christian Church started became the most important persecuting organization in human history."
Terminology.
"The English word ""church"" comes from the Greek κυριακή (kyriake) meaning ""Master's (house)"", or ""Lord's (house)"". In modern English the word ""church"" is used for both a church building and ""the Christian Church"" throughout the world."
"In 381 AD, at the a meeting of bishops known as the First Council of Constantinople, the Nicene Creed (a statement of beliefs) that was used at the time was changed to include a description of the Church. The words that were added to the Nicene Creed are ""One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church"". This important addition describes the four most important things that Christians were to believe about the Christian Church."
These are the four words that are used in the Nicene Creed:
Controversies.
"One important controversy is simply the definition of the Christian or Catholic Church. To some degree this controversy comes from the Nicene Creed with its words ""One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church"" which means ""universal"" church. Many denominations believe that all denominations are part of a world-wide Christian Church and think that the most important thing is the ""common faith"" and not a common organisation or tradition. (""Common faith"" means ""the faith that is the same"". The word ""common"" does not mean ""ordinary"" in this sense.)"
"For many hundreds of years, the Roman Catholic Church has regarded itself as the only Christian Church and has called itself the ""Catholic"" (or ""universal"") church. In other words, only those people who were within the ""organisation"" of the Roman Catholic Church were believed to belong to the ""Universal Church"". In the 20th century this view began to change and in the late 20th century there was a strong movement within parts of the Roman Catholic Church to reach out to other denominations. The Eastern Orthodox Church has thought of itself in the same way, but in the late 20th century there has been much more discussion between the Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican Churches. Some smaller denominations such as Jehovah's Witnesses also believe that they are the one and only true Christian Church."
Church (disambiguation)
Church could mean:
"Fasting is a kind of abstinence. It is when someone does not eat or drink for some specified period of time. It is only the case if the person does so of his or her own will. It may also be that the person only eats and drinks certain kinds of food. Most often, fasting is done for religious reasons. Depending on the tradition, fasting practices may forbid sexual intercourse, (or any sexual desire), masturbation, as well as refraining from eating certain types or groups of food (e.g. meat)."
"Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre-history. It is mentioned in the Qur'an, in the Mahabharata, in the Upanishads, and in the Bible, in both the Old and New Testament. In Buddhism it is also taught as a way to getting Nirvana."
"In almost all cases, there are exceptions for observing the fasting. These are made for the following groups of people"
Politics.
Fasting as a form of protest is called a hunger strike.
Intermittent fasting.
Timed fasting is known as Intermittent fasting.
There are different ways to time your fast. You can:
Walpurgis Night
"Walpurgis Night (""Valborgsmässoafton"" in Swedish, ""Vappu"" in Finnish, ""Volbriöö"" in Estonian, ""Valpurģu nakts"" or ""Valpurģi"" in Latvian, ""Walpurgisnacht"" in German), ""Čarodějnice"" in Czech is a holiday celebrated on April 30 or May 1, in Finland, Sweden, Bohemia (Czech Republic), Estonia, Latvia and Germany."
Origins.
"The festival is named after Saint Walburga (known in Scandinavia as ""Valborg""; alternative forms are ""Walpurgis"", ""Wealdburg"", or ""Valderburger""), born in Wessex in 710 a niece of Saint Boniface. According to legend, she was a daughter to the Saxon prince St. Richard. Together with her brothers she travelled to Württemberg, Germany where she became a nun and lived in the convent of Heidenheim, which was founded by her brother Wunibald. Walburga died on 25 February 779 and that day still carries her name in the Catholic calendar. However she was not made a saint until 1 May in the same year, and that day carries her name in the Swedish calendar."
"Historically the Walpurgisnacht is derived from Pagan spring customs, where the arrival of spring was celebrated with bonfires at night. Viking fertility celebrations took place around April 30 and due to Walburga being declared a saint at that time of year, her name became associated with the celebrations. Walburga was worshipped in the same way that Vikings had celebrated spring and as they spread throughout Europe, the two dates became mixed together and created the Walpurgis Night celebration."
Germany.
"In Germany, Walpurgisnacht, the night from April 30 to May 1, is the night when allegedly the witches hold a large celebration on the Blocksberg and await the arrival of Spring. When the travel to that mountain is too far, they may also chose another hill in the region they live."
"""Walpurgis Night (in German folklore) the night of April 30 (May Day's eve), when witches meet on the Brocken mountain and hold revels with their Gods..."""
"""Brocken the highest of the Harz Mountains of north central Germany. It is noted for the phenomenon of the Brocken spectre and for witches' revels which reputably took place there on Walpurgis night."
"The Brocken Spectre is a magnified shadow of an observer, typically surrounded by rainbow-like bands, thrown onto a bank of cloud in high mountain areas when the sun is low. The phenomenon was first reported on the Brocken."""

Avian influenza
"Avian influenza (bird flu, or grippe of the birds), is an illness caused by a virus. The virus, called ""influenza A"" or ""type A"", usually lives in birds. Sometimes it infects mammals, including humans."
"There are many types of influenza A, which was first found in a bird in Italy in 1878. Most types have weak symptoms, such as breathing problems, similar to the common cold."
"But some types kill birds, and a few kill humans and other mammals. One type of bird flu, called ""Spanish flu"", killed 50 to 100 million people in 1918/1920. Another type, called ""Asian Flu"" killed one million in 1957, and another one, called ""Hong Kong Flu"", also killed one million people in 1968."
"A subtype, called ""H5N1"", killed six people in Hong Kong in 1997, but did not kill again until 2003, this time in China. Until the middle of 2005, it was primarily found in southeast Asia but since then has spread to parts of Africa and Europe. It has killed tens of millions of birds and resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of millions of other birds to limit its spread. So far it is mostly a bird disease and rarely infects humans. The concern about H5N1 is that it is constantly evolving at a very fast rate. It might create a human flu pandemic. Governments around the world are spending money to deal with this problem: studying H5N1, creating vaccines, conducting pandemic practice exercises, stockpiling useful flu medication, and many other activities."
Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy
"The ""Jyllands-Posten"" Muhammad cartoons controversy is a controversy about a series of cartoons. They were first published in a Danish newspaper. The publication led to an outcry, and sparked violent protests in the Islamic world, with many people dying. The cartoons were drawn and created by Kurt Westergaard."
"The crisis began after cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad were published in the Danish newspaper ""Jyllands-Posten"" on September 30, 2005. Danish Muslim organizations staged protests in response. As the controversy has grown, some or all of the cartoons have been reprinted in newspapers in more than fifty other countries. The protests got worse when fake cartoons were released."
"One of the cartoons showed Muhammad with a bomb in his turban. Some people thought this was saying that all Muslims are terrorists. But other cartoons made fun of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. One insulted the editors of the newspaper, by using the language Farsi."
"Critics claims that the cartoons are culturally insulting, Islamophobic, blasphemous, and intended to humiliate a ""marginalized"" minority. However, supporters of the cartoons claim they illustrate an important issue and their publication exercises the right of free speech. They have also claimed that similar cartoons are made relative to other religions, arguing that Islam and its followers have not been targeted in a discriminatory way."

Hugo Black
"Hugo LaFayette Black (February 27, 1886 – September 25, 1971) was an American judge and politician. He was from Ashland, Alabama and studied law at the University of Alabama. Black was poor as a child and lived simply for most of his life. Black was in the Army during World War I. In the 1920s, Black was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Black was a member of the U.S. Senate from Alabama from 1927 to 1936 as a Democrat. Black was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt for President and his New Deal policies. In 1937, Roosevelt put Black on the United States Supreme Court. Black supported many New Deal organizations and programs which his fellow judges wanted to limit or strike down. Black often believed in interpreting the Constitution exactly as it was written (textualism), against ideas both that judges had the power to re-interpret the meaning in accordance with their time, or that it could be taken as a general guideline that lawmakers should follow but also consider other interests. One prominent example is the First Amendment, which Black believed to literally protect any form of ""freedom of speech"" against a law that would ""abridge"" (meaning to hinder) it, or at least laws prohibiting certain ""opinions"". He also believed that the Fourteenth Amendment meant this applied to states as well as the federal government, and that states subsequently could not limit free speech and other constitutional liberties anymore than the federal government. For many years most jurists and judges had believed this. He also did not believe in the substantive due process doctrine, meaning that the Fourteenth Amendment secured certain ""implicit"" rights regarding privacy and so on, which were not written into the constitution but had to be made by judges as they went along. Black believed that, while the Constitution promised generous liberties, judges should never decide for themselves on which these liberties should be. (Because of this he also did not believe in things such as natural law, which he called ""mysterious"".) This contradiction is uncommon among later judges. He did not believe in a right to privacy, which is not expressed in the constitution, and voted against one in the case ""Griswold v. Connecticut"". He did, famously, vote against segregation in ""Brown v. Board of Education"" (1954), an important case that began the desegregation of schools. Black was the fifth longest-serving justice in American history. He served on the Court for 35 years, one of the very longest tenures, and was the last of president Roosevelt's appointees except William O. Douglas (who served 36 years, the longest). Black died of a stroke in 1971, which happened two days after he chose to leave the Supreme Court. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery."
"One of the most famous judgments Black wrote is called ""Korematsu v. United States"" in 1944. In this case, the majority believed the imprisoning of civilian (non-military) Japanese Americans during World War II was just or at least acceptable, under the circumstances. This is one of the most controversial verdicts of the Supreme Court in its history and often seen as a stark contrast (meaning opposite) to what he stood for in most other cases."
Abhar
"Abhar is a city in northwestern Iran. In the year 2006 there were 55,266 people living there."
Colugo
Colugos are gliding mammals in the order Dermoptera.
"There are two living species, found in south-east Asia. They are also called 'flying lemurs', though they are not lemurs (all lemurs are in Madagascar). They can glide long distances, as they have a thin membrane stretched to the ends of the tail and each limb."
Life style.
"Colugos live in the tropical rain forests of southeast Asia. Their diet includes leaves and young shoots. During the day they rest high in the trees, clinging to trunks or hiding in tree holes. At dusk they become active, gliding from trunk to trunk like sheets of paper blown on the wind. The young are carried clinging to the flight membrane."
Habitat.
"Colugos range from Burma, Indochina and southern Thailand to peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. They also occur throughout Borneo. A second colugo species inhabits the southern Philippines."
"The number of individuals who hold membership in the Baptist denomination totals to 75-105 million, being represented in the following Churches:"
Lutheranism – 70–90 million.
"The number of adherents in the Lutheran denomination totals to 70-90 million persons, being represented in the following Churches:"
Reformed churches (Calvinism) – 60–80 million.
The Reformed tradition is represented by 60-80 million people who hold membership in the following Churches:
Methodism – 60–80 million.
"The number of members in the Methodist denomination totals to 60-80 million people, being represented in the following Churches:"
Seventh-day Adventist Church – 21.4 million.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church has a membership of 21.4 million people.
Plymouth Brethren – 1 million.
The Plymouth Brethren number around 1 million members.
Modern Protestantism – 400–500 million.
"The denominations listed below did not emerge from the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century or its commonly acknowledged offshoots. Instead, they are broadly linked to Pentecostalism or similar other independent evangelical and revivalistic movements that originated in the beginning of the 20th century. For this reason, several sources tend to differentiate them from Protestants and classify them as together as Independents, Non-core Protestants etc. Also included in this category are the numerous, yet very similar Nondenominational churches. Nonetheless, sources eventually combine their numbers to the Protestant tally. Despite the absence of centralized control or leadership, if considered as a single cohort, this will easily be the second largest Christian tradition after Roman Catholicism. According to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity (CSGC), there are an estimated 450 million Independents world-wide, as of mid-2019."
Pentecostalism – 280 million.
Those who are members of the Pentecostal denomination number around 280 million people.
African initiated churches – 60 million.
60 million people are members of African initiated churches.
New Apostolic Church – 10 million.
The New Apostolic Church has around 10 million members.
Eastern Orthodoxy – 230 million.
"The best estimate of the number of Eastern Orthodox Christians is 210–230 million or 80% of all Orthodox Christians worldwide. Its main body consists of the various autocephalous churches along with the autonomous and other churches canonically linked to them, for the most part form a single communion, making the Eastern Orthodox Church the second largest single denomination behind the Catholic Church. In addition, there are several Eastern Orthodox splinter groups and non-universally recognized churches."
Oriental Orthodoxy – 62 million.
"The Oriental Orthodox Churches are those descended from those that rejected the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Despite the similar name, they are therefore a different branch of Christianity from the Eastern Orthodox (see above). There are an estimated 62 million Oriental Orthodox Christians, worldwide."
Non-trinitarian Restorationism – 35 million.
"A sixth group is composed by Non-trinitarian Restorationists. These groups are quite distinct from orthodox Trinitarian restorationist groups such as the Disciples of Christ, despite some shared history."
Christendom
"Christendom or the Christian world, in the widest sense, means Christianity as a territorial phenomenon. That means: those countries where most people are Christians and because of that are part of Christendom."
"People have used the term Christendom for the medieval and Renaissance understanding of the Christian world as one single ""Body of Christ"" with Christ as the head. With the rise of Modernity and the Reformation during the early 16th century the understanding changed to a modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society that consists of many different communities."
Creed
"A creed is a statement or confession of belief — usually religious belief — or faith. The word comes from the Latin ""credo"" for ""I believe"". It is called ""symbol"" (Greek, συμβολον), that means a ""token"" by which persons of like beliefs might recognize each other."

At its operations in the United States, Barrick is transitioning away from coal to natural gas and solar power, in an effort to reduce emissions."
Mining practices.
"Environmental and human rights violations have taken place around a number of mining operations. They are now closed or were previously operated by a different company, including violence in Papua New Guinea and Tanzania. Forty people were arrested in Chile following a demonstration against the potential environmental impacts of a mining project. Executives of Acacia Mining had faced charges of bribery, conspiracy, forgery, money-laundering, tax-evasion and environmental damage. There has also been small groups of opposition in the Dominican Republic."

Biography.
History.
"Mohammad Sher Khan Babi, a Babi Khel Pathan who owed allegiance to the Mughal governor of Gujarat subah, founded the state of Junagadh. It declared independence in 1730 after the Marathas Gaikwad invasion. Muhammad Sher Khan Babi, was the founder of the Babi Dynasty of Junagadh State dynasty. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh, took large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled over the state for the next two centuries. First they were a tributary state of Marathas. Later they were under the rule of the British Raj."
"In 1807 the Junagadh State became a British protectorate. The East India Company took control of the state by 1818. The Saurashtra area, with other princely states of Kathiawar, were separately administered under Kathiawar Agency by British India."
"On 15 August 1947 upon the independence of India, the Nawab of Junagarh decided to merge it into newly formed Pakistan. The Indian government maintained the people of Junagadh should decide. Pakistan waited until 13 September to respond saying they accepted Junagarh's acceptance of Pakistani rule. This caused a general revolt among the Hindu majority of Junagadh as well as protest movements in the surrounding states that had acceded to join India. The Nawab then occupied territory in several of those states claiming he had rule over them. When the Indian government sent a small force to restore order, the Nawab fled to Pakistan. His Dewan (Prime minister) agreed to rule by India. This resulted in the integration of Junagadh into India."
Rulers.
The Nawabs of Junagadh belonged to Pathan Babi khel tribe. They were granted a 13 gun salute by the British authorities:
Dispute.
Many in Pakistan still maintains the 1948 plebiscite and rule by India was an illegitimate action. One of the reasons is because Kashmir at the time was ruled by a Hindu but had a clear Muslim majority. By acceding to India it was the opposite of the situation in Junagadh.
"For its part India knew Junagadh was the premier state in the western Kathiawar region. It was bound on three sides by states that acceded to India. On the fourth side was bounded by the Arabian Sea. This gave it great strategic importance to both countries. India was not prepared to accept Junagadh's acceding to Pakistan. This would create a Pakistan state in the middle of Indian states. India's taking administrative control of Junagadh to restore order is seen as a pretext by Pakistan. The referendum taken by the people of Junagadh, under the control of the Indian army, was overwhelmingly in favor of Indian rule. Pakistan has never accepted this vote by the people there and believes Junagadh rightly belongs to them."
Pakistan's legitimacy claim.
"Pakistan's government has maintained its territorial claim on Junagadh, along with Manavadar and Sir Creek in Gujarat, on its official political map issued on 4th August 2020."
Nordertor
"The Nordertor (Danish: ""Nørreport"") is an old town gate of the city of Flensburg. The gate was built around 1595. Today, the little landmark is in use as a symbol for the German town Flensburg."
History.
"In 1345 the town of Flensburg began to build its town wall. A gate was built on the north side of the town. It was called ""Norder Porte"". It was replaced by a building in the 16th century called the Nordertor. This marked the northern boundary of the town. It was a checkpoint that was closed in the night."
"On the north side of the gate are two plaques. The left one shows the royal coat of arms of King Christian IV, 1577-1648 and the Latin words: „Regna Firmat Pietas“ — Piety strengthens the Realms. The right one shows the coat of arms of Flensburg with the German words: „Friede ernährt, Unfrieden verzehrt“ — Peace nurtures, strife devours. There is also a date- 1767. This means that the town gate was restored in the time of Christian VII, 1749-1808."
"After 1796 the town grew beyond the town wall. There had been a ban on building outside the wall before then. The Neustadt (""Newtown""), in the neighborhood of the Nordertor was built. In 1913 and 1914 it was restored by the architect Paul Ziegler. The Nordertor got a clock. In 1966 the Deutsche Bundespost made a stamp with a picture of the gate on it. It was a 30 Pfennig stamp, used to send letters within Germany. The Nordertor stamps were sold over 3 billion times. In the 1990s the gate was again restored and the clock was removed. In 2004 the gate was licensed as a venue for civil weddings, so that the weddings could be performed since then directly above the archway of the gate."
Ship's cat
"A ship's cat is a cat that rides along on a ship. Ship's cats have been very popular in history, and date back to ancient times."
"Cats have been carried on ships for many reasons - most importantly, to catch mice and rats. On a ship, these rodents can damage ropes and wooden parts of the ship. Once electricity was discovered, rodents would also damage ships' electrical wiring. Also, rodents threatened the ship's cargo - the things it carried. Rodents would eat the food carried to feed the crew. If the ship was carrying things like grain as part of its cargo, rodents could also cause the ship to lose money by eating the cargo. Also, rats and mice spread disease, which is dangerous for ships that are at sea for long periods of time. For example, rat fleas can carry plague, and rats on ships may have been one of the main reasons why the Black Death spread."
"Cats naturally attack and kill these rodents. Cats also have a natural ability to get used to new surroundings, so they could get used to serving on ships. They also offered companionship (friendship), a sense of home and security, and lifted sailors' spirits. This was helpful to sailors who could be away from home for long periods, especially in times of war."
Early history.
"Cats were probably domesticated about 9,500 years ago. Not long after that, people began taking cats aboard boats and ships. The Ancient Egyptians took cats on board Nile boats to catch birds in the thickets along the riverbanks. The ancient Egyptians also carried cats on trading ships to control rodents. Traders from other areas soon started doing the same thing. This led to the spread of cats throughout the world. Cats eventually reached nearly all parts of the world that could be reached by ship. Phoenician cargo ships are thought to have brought the first domesticated cats to Europe in about 900 BC."
Cats and superstition.
"Cats in Ancient Egypt were worshipped as deities (powerful spirits). For many centuries, cats have had a reputation as magical animals. Many sailors believed myths and superstitions about cats. Cats were thought of as smart, lucky animals. Sailors usually took very good care of their ship's cats to keep them happy. Some sailors believed that six-toed cats were better at catching pests. They may have thought that extra toes give a cat better balance, which would be important when at sea. In some places, all six-toed cats became known as ""ship's cats""."
"Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too. They believed that these cats would use their special powers to protect their husbands at sea. Many sailors believed that it was lucky if a cat came up to a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it came only halfway and then turned around. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. Other sailors also believed that if a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, a terrible storm would come and sink the ship, and if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Still other sailors thought that if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hail storm was coming; if it sneezed, rain was coming; and if it was frisky, wind was coming."
"Some of these beliefs are partly true. Cats can notice slight changes in the weather, because of their very sensitive inner ears. (Their inner ears also allow cats to land on their feet when falling.) Cats often get nervous and restless when they sense low atmospheric pressure, which often comes before stormy weather."
Famous Ship's Cats.
Blackie.
"Blackie was HMS ""Prince of Wales""'s ship's cat. He became famous during the Second World War. Blackie's ship, ""Prince of Wales"", carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic Ocean to Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland in August 1941. There, Churchill secretly met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the two signed the Atlantic Charter. But as Churchill started to leave ""Prince of Wales"", Blackie came up to him. Churchill bent down to say goodbye to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. In honour of the success of the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill. Blackie survived the sinking of HMS ""Prince of Wales"" later that year and was taken to Singapore with the survivors. He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and nobody knows what happened to him (though there is a chance he may have died by then)."

Messerschmitt Me 163
The Messerschmitt Me 163 is a German military aircraft used during World War II. It was a rocket-powered aircraft. It was designed by Lippisch.
"The plane weighed 4200 pounds when it was empty and almost 10,000 pounds when it was full. It could fly 560 miles per hour. During the last part of World War II, Messerchmitts fought B-17 bombers over Germany. About 18 B-17s were shot down and about 10 Messerschmitts were shot down."
The fuel the Messerschmitts used sometimes exploded.
Mil Mi-8
The Mil Mi-8 is one of the most famous helicopters built in USSR during the Cold War. It is used for transport and attack by more than 50 countries in the world. It's the basis of Mil Mi-14 and Mil Mi-17 helicopters.
Yellow-bellied glider
"The yellow-bellied glider (""Petaurus australis"") is an arboreal and nocturnal gliding possum. It lives in the native eucalypt forests right down eastern Australia, from northern Queensland to Victoria."
Habitat.
The yellow-bellied glider lives in forests and woodlands in eastern Australia and is found at a range of altitudes from sea level to 1400 metres.
"In North Queensland, the sub-species lives at over 700 m above sea level. There are 13 different populations in three places where this glider lives in North Queensland. One population lives on Mount Windsor Tableland, another on Mount Carbine Tableland, and the third lives in a linear habitat from Atherton to Kirrama on the Atherton Tableland. These three populations together have about 6000 individual gliders. With their habitat in danger, the yellow-bellied glider is classified as uncommon to rare and is named vulnerable to the tropics. This species is more widespread in southern Queensland, NSW and Victoria."
"The yellow-bellied glider is and spends the day in a leaf-lined tree hole, which is usually shared with other members of the same family. It is also one of the most vocal possum gliders. It has a distinctive growling call that it uses as means of communication. A recording of the distinctive call can be heard at"
"It eats nectar, honeydew, insects, pollen and a wide spread of tree sap."
Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on August 18, 1920, Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution granted American women the right to vote. The amendment marked the end of a long struggle for women in the United States that began in the mid-nineteenth century. The movement, called women's suffrage, marked a radical change in how women were viewed in America. When the Constitution was written, it was accepted that a woman did not have a separate legal identity from her husband. Women's suffrage challenged that concept. The Nineteenth Amendment overturned an earlier decision by the United States Supreme Court in ""Minor v. Happersett"". The Court held that the right to vote, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to all citizens of the United States, did not apply to women. Women were citizens, but did not have the right to vote. The Nineteenth Amendment was first introduced in Congress in 1878 by Senator Aaron A. Sargent. The bill calling for the amendment was introduced unsuccessfully every year for the next 40 years. Finally, in 1919, Congress approved the amendment and submitted it to the states for ratification. A year later Tennessee gave the final vote needed to add the amendment to the Constitution."
Background.
"In Colonial America, women had fixed gender roles they learned from their mothers. Growing up, a woman was legally subordinate to her father. When she was married she became a ""feme covert"" (French: a married woman). Her property and her legal status transferred to her husband. The intent of this protected-class status was to protect women from the evils men dealt with including politics. In addition, the custom was also used to ban women from professional jobs, higher education, voting, serving on juries and testifying in court. Single women were limited to the jobs of teaching and nursing."
"In 1848, the women's suffrage movement began on a national level. A convention in Seneca Falls, New York was organized by abolitionists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott that also demanded a woman's right to vote. Susan B. Anthony, along with other activists, joined Mott and Stanton in forming organizations that demanded the right to vote. Many of the early orgainzers never lived to see the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment some 70 years later."
"""Leser v. Garnett""."
"When the Nineteenth Amendment became law, it guaranteed the right to vote could not be denied on account of sex. However, it was not the same as women being allowed to vote. The Supreme Court case of ""Leser v. Garnett"" (1922), while not intended to do so, established this right. The plaintiffs challenged the Nineteenth Amendment as being unconstitutional. They argued first, that the amendment was invalid because it increased the electorate without the state of Maryland's consent. They argued secondly that ratification was based on several states that denied women the right to vote in their state constitutions and therefore their legislatures did not have the right to ratify the amendment. The third argument was that the last two states to ratify the amendment, Tennessee and West Virginia, violated their own rules of procedure."
"In a unanimous decision, the court rejected all three arguments. The first argument is invalid because wording was almost the same as the Fifteenth Amendment. Each used the same method of adoption so one cannot be valid and the other invalid. The second argument, that certain state legislatures did not have the power to ratify based on their own constitutions, is rejected because they were ratifying an amendment to the federal Constitution, and so is a federal function. The Court ruled the third argument a moot point because two other states after Tennessee and West Virginia (Connecticut and Vermont) who followed their own procedures would have been enough to ratify the amendment. But in addressing the substance of the argument, the Court went on to point out that the Secretaries of State of Tennessee and West Virginia each accepted the ratification by the legislatures making the ratification by those two states valid. The Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote but ""Lesser"" made it certain the right could be used even in states where the state constitution did not allow it."

Reproduction.
"Most oomycetes produce two types of spores. The main dispersing spores are asexual, self-mobile spores called zoospores. These do chemotaxis toward a food source in surface water. A few oomycetes produce asexual spores that are distributed by wind. Oomycetes also produce sexual spores, called ""oospores"". These are translucent, double-walled, spherical structures which can survive harsh conditions."
Hurricane Helene (1958)
Hurricane Helene was one of the most powerful Atlantic storms of 1958. The storm's peak winds were 135 miles per hour. This hurricane moved north of the West Indies and brushed the United States' east coast. Helene was the only hurricane to affect the United States in 1958.
Garter snake
"The garter snake (""Thamnophis sirtalis"") is a Colubrid snake."
"It is common across North America between Alaska/Canada and Central America. It is the single most widely distributed genus of reptiles in North America. It is famous for its resistance to the poison produced by the rough-skinned newt. Garter snakes are actually venomous, just not to humans, since the amount of toxin in their saliva is too weak to really cause damage to a human. The worst they could do to you is musk on you or bite you and leave a harmless rash. In fact, cat bites are probably more serious than garter snake bites. They prey on rodents, small fish, small birds, salamanders, earthworms (not red wigglers, as they are bad for them) insects, and insect larva. They are attracted to water sources and hiding spots. You can identify a garter snake because almost every species has a stripe running down its back, the color varying and depending on the species, as there are many different species of garter snakes. They are incredibly common animals, settling in backyards and local woods. As you read this, there is probably at least one garter slithering in the nature-filled area behind you, whatever that may be. All snakes like to hide, and garters are no exception, even if they are incredibly common and small. They hide under leaves, trees, bricks and rocks stacked up, plants, sticks, and anything they can find. If you are trying to ""catch"" a garter, look for them under these places, and you just might find them. Like most snakes, female garters tend to be longer than the males, so that's one form of sexing them."

"In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan including Hidaka Province were reformed in the 1870s."
"In 1882, Hidaka and the other ten provinces of Hokkaido were reorganized as Hakodate Prefecture, Sapporo Prefecture and Nemuro Prefecture."
Burke and Hare murders
"The Burke and Hare murders (or West Port murders) were serial murders in Edinburgh, Scotland, from November 1827 to 31 October 1828."
"The murders were done by Irish immigrants William Burke and William Hare. They sold the corpses of their 17 victims to Dr Robert Knox. Knox was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and the Conservator of the Museum of Comparative Anatomy in Edinburgh. He was a teacher of human anatomy to Edinburgh medical students, so needed bodies for his students to dissect."
"The murderer's accomplices included Burke's mistress, Helen McDougal, and Hare's wife, Margaret Laird. From their method of killing their victims has come the word ""burking"", meaning to purposefully smother and, more generally, to quietly suppress."
The Resurrectionists.
"From 1826 to 1840 Knox ran Barclay's anatomy school in Surgeon's Square, Edinburgh. He was the most popular lecturer on anatomy in Scotland, but his class were always short of bodies to dissect."
"Before the Anatomy Act of 1832 widened the supply, the only legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes in the UK were those condemned to death and dissection by the courts. This led to a shortage of legitimate subjects for dissection. The shortage became more serious as the need to train medical students grew, and the number of executions fell."
"In his school Knox ran up against the problem from the start, since – after 1815 – the Royal Colleges had increased the study of anatomy in the medical curriculum. If he taught according to what was known as ‘French method’ the ratio would have had to approach one corpse per pupil. As a consequence, body-snatching became so common that it was not unusual for relatives and friends of someone who had just died to watch over the body before and after burial, to stop it being taken."
"In November 1827 William Hare began a new career when an indebted lodger died on him by chance. He was paid £7.10/- (seven pounds &amp; ten shillings) for delivering the body to Knox. Now Burke and his accomplice Hare set about murdering tramps and drunks on a regular basis. After 16 more transactions, in what became known as the West Port Murders, on 2 November 1828 Burke and Hare were caught. The whole city were convulsed with horror, fed by ballads, broadsides and newspapers, at the terrible deeds of Burke &amp; Hare. Hare turned King's evidence, and Burke was hanged, dissected and displayed."
"Knox was not prosecuted, which outraged many in Edinburgh. His house was attacked by a mob, and windows were broken. A committee of the Royal Society of Edinburgh cleared him of blame, but there was no forgetting his part in the case, and many were wary of him."
Discovery and trial.
The last victim was Marjory Campbell Docherty. Burke lured her into the lodging house by claiming that his mother was also a Docherty. He had to wait to kill her because the lodgers James and Ann Gray were present. The Grays left for the night and neighbours heard the sounds of a struggle.
"The next day Ann Gray, who had returned, became suspicious when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When the Grays were left alone in the house, they checked the bed and found Docherty's body under it. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week. They refused."
"Burke and Hare had removed the body from the house before the police arrived. However, under questioning, Burke claimed that Docherty had left at 7:00 a.m., while McDougal claimed that she had left in the evening. The police arrested them. An anonymous tip-off led them to Knox's classroom where they found Docherty's body, which James Gray identified. William and Margaret Hare were arrested soon there after. The murder spree had lasted twelve months."
Kronberger 61
"Kronberger 61, also known as the ""soccer ball"", is a Nebula discovered by an amateur astronomer in January 2011. Newer images of this nebula were taken by the Gemini Observatory. The nebula was discovered by Austrian Mattias Kronberger, a member of the amateur group ""Deep Sky Hunters"". They found it while searching near the northern constellation of Cygnus."
Australian Aboriginal mythology
"Australian Aboriginal myths, also known as Dreamtime stories and Songlines, are the stories traditionally performed and told by the indigenous people of Australia. Each of the language groups across Australia has its own stories."
All the myths explain important features and meanings within each Aboriginal group's local landscape. They give cultural meaning to the Australian physical landscape. People who know these stories have access to the wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back beyond the reach of memory.
"David Horton wrote in the ""Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia"" that:"
"""A mythic map of Australia would show thousands of characters, varying in their importance, but all in some way connected with the land. Some emerged at their specific sites and stayed spiritually in that vicinity. Others came from somewhere else and went somewhere else."""
"""Many were shape changing, transformed from or into human beings or natural species, or into natural features such as rocks but all left something of their spiritual essence at the places noted in their stories."""
"Australian Aboriginal myths have been described as parts of a catechism, a liturgical manual, a history of civilization, a geography textbook, and to a much smaller extent a manual of the world and the universe."
Antiquity.
"An Australian linguist, R. M. W. Dixon, collected many Aboriginal myths in their original languages. He discovered some landscape details in myths were the same as scientific discoveries being made about the same landscapes. For example, on the Atherton Tableland, myths tell of the origins of Lake Eacham, Lake Barrine, and Lake Euramo. Geologists have dated the volcanic explosions which formed the lakes, and were described by Aboriginal myth tellers, as having happened more than 10,000 years ago. Pollen fossil sampling from the bottom of the craters agrees with the Aboriginal myth-tellers' story. When the craters were formed, the area was eucalyptus forest, not the current wet tropical rain forests."
"These stereotypes made many people think much more lightly of the historical importance of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" as a ""vital antislavery tool."" This change in the way people looked at ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" began in an essay by James Baldwin. This essay was titled ""Everybody’s Protest Novel."" In the essay, Baldwin called ""Uncle Tom’s Cabin"" a ""very bad novel"". He said it was not well-written."
"In the 1960s and '70s, the Black Power and Black Arts Movements strongly criticized the book. They said that the character of Uncle Tom was a part of ""race betrayal"". They said that Tom made slaves look worse than slave owners. Criticisms of the other stereotypes in the book also increased during this time."
"However, people such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. have begun studying ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" again. He says that the book is a ""central document in American race relations and a significant (important) moral and political exploration of the character of those relations."""

Health care
"Health care or healthcare is the preservation of mental and physical health by preventing or treating illnesses through services offered by the health profession and its staff. Health care includes all reasonable and necessary medical aid, medical examinations, medical treatments, medical diagnoses, medical evaluations and medical services. The right to health care is considered one of human rights with international human rights law as well as social security."
Primary care.
"A primary care doctor (PCD) or primary care physician (PCP) is a doctor who provides general medical care. These doctors can answer health concerns and medical conditions a patient may have. They also can prescribe medicine for their patients, based on information gathered."
Culture of health.
"In 1968, Victor Skumin proposed the term ″Culture of Health″, which has become widespread. The main task of a Culture of Health is to implement innovative health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual health. Holism is the idea that natural systems (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic, etc.) and their properties, should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts."
"According to Skumin, the culture of health is not only the mechanical connection of the two concepts—the concept of ″culture″ and the concept of ″health″. This is their synthesis, which forms a new quality, a new content. Skumin examines the culture of health as the specific science, that develops the theoretical and practical tasks of harmonious development of the spiritual, mental, and physical human force, forming of optimum environment, which provides a higher level of creativity of life. Thus, Skumin argues that the culture of health is a separate science, that creates new content. The main challenge of culture of health is the development of spiritual, mental and physical capabilities of man."
"In 1994, Skumin was elected to the post of the President-founder of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH) — International social movement ""To Health via Culture""."

Kwanzaa
"Kwanzaa is a week long celebration held in the United States to honor universal African heritage and culture. People light a kinara (candle holder with seven candles) and give each other gifts. It takes place from December 26 to January 1 every year. It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966 - 1967. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa. The holiday greeting is ""Joyous Kwanzaa""."
History and name of the holiday.
Kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s. It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage.
"The name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase ""matunda ya kwanza"", meaning first fruits of the harvest."
"During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun. However, as Kwanzaa became more popular, Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included. He stated in the 1997 ""Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture"", ""Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday."""
Many Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.
Principles and symbols.
"Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or ""Nguzo Saba"" (originally ""Nguzu Saba""—the seven principles of blackness). Karenga said that this ""is a communitarian African philosophy,"" . It consists of what Karenga called ""the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world."" These seven principles comprise ""Kawaida"", a Swahili term for tradition and reason. Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:"
"Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed, corn and other crops, a candle holder with seven candles, called a kinara, a communal cup for pouring libations, gifts, a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles."
"During Kwanzaa, families also decorate their households with objects of art. They use colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women. Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used. It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice (""a shared cup""), ""Kikombe cha Umoja"", passed around to all people present. A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (Karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is ""Habari Gani?"" which is Swahili for ""What's the News?"""
"Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry."
Interventional Radiology
"Interventional radiology is defined as the branch of medicine that diagnoses and treats a wide range of diseases using actions that are performed through the skin (for example an injection) or carried out with the least damage by x-rays, sonography, and so on."
"Some of these procedures are done only for diagnostic purposes, while others are done for treatment purposes. Images are used to direct these procedures, which are usually done with needles or other tiny instruments like small tubes called catheters. The images provide road maps that allow the Interventional Radiologist to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing diseases."
Chess Olympiad
"Chess Olympiads are chess events open to all national teams. They have been run since 1927 by the world chess organisation, FIDE. Since 1950, they have been run every two years. Earlier events were all-play-all. Then, as numbers grew, a system of qualifying sections were used. In recent times, the format has been a Swiss system. This, in chess terms, is a method whereby opponents are chosen each round to have similar scores. It has been widely used for individual tournaments."
Recognised sport.
Chess is a recognized sport by the International Olympic Committee with FIDE being the recognized International Sports Federation for chess since June 1999.
"As a member of the International Olympic Committee, FIDE adheres to its rules, including controversially having doping tests. The prospects of chess becoming an Olympic sporting event at some future date remain unclear. The naming of FIDE's team championship as the ""Chess Olympiad"" is of historical origin and implies no connection between this event and the Olympic Games."
The next Chess Olympiad will be held in 2014 in Norway.
Main course
"The main course is food that is served as the main dish in a multi-course meal. It is often served after the entrée. In the United States, the main course may be called the ""entrée""."
"The main course is usually the biggest dish on a menu. The main ingredient is often meat or fish. It most often follows an appetizer, soup, or salad, and is often followed by a dessert."

Progressive conservatism
"Progressive conservatism is an ideology that tries to unite conservative and progressive ideas. To deal with poverty, the ideology supports the idea of a social safety net. It also supports a limited redistribution of wealth. The people supporting progressive conservatism want to allow the government to regulate markets in the interests of both consumers and producers. Progressive conservatism first arose as a distinct ideology in the United Kingdom under Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's ""One Nation"" Toryism."
"In the UK, the Prime Ministers Disraeli, Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan, and David Cameron have been described as progressive conservatives. The Catholic Church's ""Rerum Novarum"" (1891) advocates a progressive conservative doctrine known as social Catholicism."
"In the United States, Theodore Roosevelt has been the main figure identified with progressive conservatism as a political tradition. Roosevelt stated that he had ""always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand"". Some people considered the administration of President William Howard Taft to be progressive conservative. Taft described himself as ""a believer in progressive conservatism"". President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared himself an advocate of ""progressive conservatism"". In Germany, Chancellor Leo von Caprivi promoted a progressive conservative agenda called the ""New Course"". In Canada, a variety of conservative governments have been progressive conservative, with Canada's major conservative movement being officially named the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada from 1942 to 2003. In Canada, the Prime Ministers Arthur Meighen, R.B. Bennett, John Diefenbaker, Joe Clark, Brian Mulroney, and Kim Campbell led progressive conservative federal governments."

Championship
"In sport, a championship is a competition to determine which individual or team is the champion. Different forms of competition can be called a championship. It is usually the final competition in a tournament (a series of competitions). For example, the FIFA World Cup is a tournament held every four years. The winner of the final competition of each tournament becomes that tournament's champion. In a league system, the championship is the final competition of a regular season. In some league systems, a series of playoffs is used to determine the champion of a season. There is one champion for each season. In combat sports, such as wrestling and boxing, a competitor must challenge the current champion to win the championship."
Atlas Computer (Manchester)
The Atlas Computer was a computer installed in Manchester University in 1962 that was very important in the development of computing. The Atlas computer was one of the worlds first supercomputers and possibly the most powerful computer in the world at its time.
Management information system
"A management information system is a system that allows a company to run efficiently, by providing the relevant information the company needs. Nowadays, management information systems use specialized software that runs on a computer. A management information system is usually targeted at economic aspects of running a company, while an executive information system is usually designed for managing staff. The first such systems were built in the 1960s."
"At the time of his death in 1616, only some of Shakespeare’s plays had been published in single editions. His plays were collected and published in 1623, seven years after he died. There is proof that people in Shakespeare's time thought highly of him. After his death, even his rival Ben Jonson said:"
"Shakespeare was involved in the building of the Globe Theatre in 1599. (It burned down a few years later.) His plays are still performed at a new Globe Theatre, built in 1997 near the original."
Marriage and sexuality.
"Although Shakespeare was married to a woman and fathered three children, people have questioned his sexuality. Some people, such as Peter Holland of the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham University, have pointed out that Shakespeare directed some of his sonnets towards young men. They say this is evidence that he may have been bisexual."
"Who wrote ""Shakespeare""?"
"About 150 years after his death, some writers suggested that Shakespeare did not actually write all of the works that are called his. They had various reasons for saying this. For example, the person who wrote ""Shakespeare’s works"" knew a lot about other countries (especially Italy and France), but William Shakespeare never left England. Several other writers of ""Shakespeare"" have been suggested, such as Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. However, most scholars believe that William Shakespeare did write the works that bear his name."
Palaestra
"A palaestra was a building in ancient Greece. It is the place where wrestling was taught and practiced. It consisted of a large square or rectangular courtyard. This courtyard was open to the sky. It was surrounded by colonnades. Off these colonnades were dressing rooms, lecture rooms, bath rooms, and rooms for storing equipment. Wrestlers practiced under the colonnades in all weathers."
"Palaestras were often near gymnasiums. They were sometimes a part of gymnasium complexes. Most cities in the Greek world had a palaestra. Large cities may have had several. Some palaestras were privately owned. Most were built with taxes. The palaestra was very much a part of the everyday lives of Greek men and boys. Some men felt as much affection for the palaestra they grew up in as modern men feel for their ""alma mater"". Some men were buried in their favorite palaestra."
What was a palaestra?
"A palaestra was a building in ancient Greece where wrestling was taught and practiced. The word ""palaestra"" is based on the Greek word ""pale"", which means wrestling. From the sixth century BC through the end of the Roman Imperial age, palaestras were built throughout Greece. The earliest ones were privately owned, but by the fifth century BC public ones were being built. Almost every Greek city had at least one palaestra and some large cities had several."
"Palaestras were often located near or were attached to gymnasiums. The gymnasium probably first appeared in the sixth century BC. Both were often referred to simply as ""the gymnasium"". Greek historian, biographer, and essayist Plutarch writes that a palaestra was used solely for wrestling and the ""pankration"", a sport similar to but much rougher than wrestling. Boxing was taught and practiced in the gymnasium. Retired athletes owned and operated small palaestras. Greek males of all ages joined palaestras. Elderly (old) men sometimes had their own palaestras."
Design of the palaestra.
"Vitruvius was a Roman architect who lived in the age of Augustus. He made a plan for the perfect palaestra in his book ""On Architecture"". This palaestra is similar to the one at Olympia, Greece, the site of the ancient Olympic Games. Vitruvius' palaestra has a large courtyard open to the sky. This courtyard is surrounded by roofed colonnades."
"The yard would have been filled with ""skammata""pits where wrestlers and pankratiasts would have practiced. A ""skamma"" (""dug-up part"") was an area where the soil had been turned over and covered with a thick layer of sand to provide a firm foundation for the wrestlers. Because wrestlers may have had to compete in rainy weather, there were two ""skamma"" in the palaestra: a dry one and a wet one. Wrestlers called the mud in the wet ""skamma"" ""beeswax""."
"The wrestlers themselves turned over the soil and sand with a pick axe. This was considered a meaningful exercise and the pick axe became a symbol for wrestling in Greek art. It is likely the wet ""skamma"" was located under the colonnades to prevent evaporation. Greek physicians thought a mixture of mud and oil had curative powers and a mixture of mud and oil was often used in the pits."
"Vitruvius describes single colonnades on three sides of the yard and a double colonnade on the north side. This double colonnade would protect the room behind it from sun and rain. The palaestra was a place for training the body and the mind. This room was the ""ephebeion"". It was here that young men (""ephebes"") would receive instruction on Greek culture. Stone benches would have been set into the walls."
"To the right of the ""ephebeion"" Vitruvius would have had three rooms: the punching bag room, the dust and powder room, and a room for bathing. To the left of the ""ephebeion"" would be a room for storing oil, and a group of rooms for a furnace and hot baths. Hot baths were a Roman necessity and were not found at Olympia however. This may have been because of the scarcity of water at Olympia. The baths at Olympia were simple but those at Delphi were large and elaborate."
"Vitruvius does not mention the undressing room (""apodyterion"") but there certainly would have been at least one in every palaestra. ""Pale"" and ""pankration"" were both practiced in the nude. Vitruvius does not mention a ball room (""sphairisterion"") either, which some palaestra had. It is not known if this room was used for ball games, storage, or exercise."
"On rainy days, wrestling was taught and practiced beneath the two to four roofed colonnades that lined the yard. Just off these colonnades were dressing rooms, rooms for bathing, storage rooms, and rooms for lectures and meeting friends. These rooms were often used for homosexual or pederastic trysts."
"Hermes Enagonios (""Hermes of the Contest"") presided over the palaestra. He was depicted on a rectangular piece of marble as a head and an erect penis. Hermes was the god of wrestling and sometimes said to be the father of Palaestra, the goddess of wrestling. In Greek art, a herm often indicates the scene is a palaestra. Statues of Apollo and Herakles also stood in a palaestra."
Life in the palaestra.
"Wrestling was a highly esteemed sport in ancient Greece. It was less rough than boxing or the pankration, required less space than other sports, and, as a result, was the most popular sport among athletes. References to the sport are frequent in the literature of ancient Greece, especially poetry."
"Males of all ages joined palaestras, just as modern men and boys join the YMCA, gyms, or health clubs. Greek men developed an affection for the gymnasiums and the palaestras where they grew up, and some were buried in their favorite gymnasium or palaestra. These buildings could be a center for politics: the plot to free Thebes from Sparta was formed in a palaestra and a revolt against Macedon found its supporters in the gymnasiums and palaestras of Argos."
"Some people were not allowed in the palaestra. These included the ""paidogogos""older slaves or grandfathers who led young boys to the palaestra and waited for them near the front door. Others not allowed in the palaestra included girls and women, cripples, alcoholics, craftsmen, vendors (salesmen), slaves or freed slaves, the insane, and openly lewd homosexuals. Death was not unknown in the palaestra. One wrestler fell on a hard surface and died ten days later from chest injuries."
"Every palaestra had a number of handsome young men called ""prosgymnastes"". They waited around offering to wrestle others for a fee. These young men were known casually as ""statues"". Wrestling one was known as ""hugging a statue"". These young men were not held in high esteem."
"In a place where men, young men, and boys were nude, homosexual interaction was common. The authorities tried unsuccessfully to curb it. Greek vase paintings of males in the palaestra show teens goosing each other or older males offering love gifts such as hares to teens. In ""Lysis"", the Athenian philosopher Sokrates is pulled into a palaestra by a group of teenagers. They tell him that one of their number is in love with another. Most Greek males considered a homosexual relationship a positive palaestra experience. Archaeologist Stephen Miller writes that Eros was worshipped as much as Hermes and Herakles in the palaestra."
Black-tailed rattlesnake
"The Black-tailed rattlesnake (""Crotalus Molossus"") is a species of venomous Pit vipers, found in southwestern United States of America and Mexico. There are currently three subspecies recognized."
Description.
The first plot theme is the Devil in modern Moscow; the second is the story of Pontius Pilate.
Plot line A.
"1930s Moscow is visited by Satan in the guise of ""Professor"" Woland or Voland (Воланд). This mysterious magician of uncertain origin arrives with a retinue."
"The group causes havoc in the literary elite, especially its trade union, . is a Soviet-style abbreviation for the ""Moscow Association of Writers"" or ""Literature for the Masses"". Targets are Massolit's posh HQ, corrupt social-climbers and their women (wives and mistresses alike), bureaucrats and profiteers and, more generally, skeptical unbelievers in the human spirit."
Plot line B.
"The second setting is the Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate, described by Woland talking to Berlioz and later echoed in the pages of the Master's novel. It concerns Pontius Pilate's trial of Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus the Nazarene). Pilate recognises an affinity and spiritual need for Yeshua. There follows his reluctant but resigned submission to Yeshua's execution."
"Linking plots A and B are the rather sympathetic characters of Berlioz, Pontius Pilate and Ivan Ponyryov, a young, aspiring poet whose pen name (Bezdomny) means ""homeless""."
"Berlioz is the head of . Berlioz brushes off Woland's prophecy of his death, only to have it come true just pages later in the novel. Ivan, the young poet ""Homeless"", tries to chase and capture the gang and warn of their evil. This lands him in a lunatic asylum, where he meets the Master (named Faust in the drafts and margins of the manuscript, but never in the finally published version). Led to despair by the rejection of his novel about Pontius Pilate and Christ, the Master burns his manuscript and turns his back on the ""real"" world, including his devoted lover, Margarita."
Part two.
"Connecting these two themes are Satan himself, and the Master with his devoted lover Margarita. The Master is an embittered author, whose historical novel about Pontius Pilate had been rejected by the Soviet literary committee ."
"Part Two introduces Margarita, the Master's mistress, who refuses to despair of her lover or his work. She is invited to the Devil's midnight ball, where Satan (Woland) offers her the chance to become a witch with supernatural powers. This coincides with the night of Good Friday: the Master's novel also deals with this same spring full moon when Christ's fate is sealed by Pontius Pilate and he is crucified in Jerusalem. All three events in the novel are linked by this."
"Margarita enters naked into the realm of night. She flies over the deep forests and rivers of the USSR. She bathes, and returns with Azazello, her escort, to Moscow as the anointed hostess for Satan's great Spring Ball. Standing by his side, she welcomes the dark celebrities of human history as they arrive from Hell."
"She survives this ordeal without breaking, and for her pains, Satan offers to grant Margarita her deepest wish. Margarita selflessly chooses to liberate a woman whom she met at the ball. Satan grants her first wish and offers her another, saying the first wish was unrelated to Margarita's own desires. For her second wish, she chooses to liberate the Master and live in poverty-stricken love with him."
"The Master and Margarita, for not having lost their faith in humanity, are granted peace but are denied light – that is, they will spend eternity together in a shadowy yet pleasant region, having not earned the glories of Heaven, but not deserving the punishments of Hell. As a parallel to the Master and Margarita's freedom, Pontius Pilate is also released from his eternal punishment."
History of its writing and publication.
"Bulgakov started writing the novel in 1928. He burnt the first manuscript of the novel in 1930, seeing no future as a writer in the Soviet Union. The work was restarted in 1931. The second draft was completed in 1936 by which point all the major plot lines of the final version were in place. The third draft was finished in 1937. Bulgakov continued to polish the work, aided by his wife, but was forced to stop work on the fourth version four weeks before his death in 1940."
"A censored version (12% of the text removed and still more changed) of the book was first published in ""Moscow"" magazine (#11, 1966 and #1, 1967). The text of all the omitted and changed parts, with indications of the places of modification, was published on a samizdat basis. In 1967 the publisher ""Posev"" (Frankfurt) printed a version produced with the aid of these inserts."
"In the Soviet Union, the first complete version, prepared by Anna Saakyants, was published in 1973, based on the version of the beginning of 1940 proofread by the publisher. In 1989 the last version was prepared by literature expert Lidiya Yanovskaya based on all available manuscripts."
English translations.
"There are quite a few published English translations of ""The Master and Margarita"", including:"
"The early translation by Glenny runs more smoothly than the modern translations. Some Russian-speaking readers consider it to be the only one creating the desired effect, though it may take liberties with the text. As an example, Glenny's translations leaves out Bulgakov's ""crucial"" reference to the devil in Berlioz's thought:"
"Several literary critics have hailed the Burgin/Tiernan O’Connor translation as the most accurate and complete English translation. There are matching annotations by Bulgakov's biographer, Ellendea Proffer. However, these judgements came before the translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky."
"A graphic novel, an adaption by Andrzej Klimowski and Danusia Schejbal, published by Self Made Hero in 2008 provides a fresh visual translation/interpretation."
In other media.
"The novel has been the basis of films, stage productions, opera, ballet, and television versions."
Padmashali
"Padmashali () or Padma Bramhana is a Hindu Bramhin in origin,and took up artisan tasks are predominantly found in South Indian States. Padmashali Bhargava Brahmins are Rugvedi Brahmins. The community members are traditionally weavers specialised in making clothes of all kinds. They engage as priests Brahmins for performing all rites and rituals and also perform services as temple Priests for other castes."
Origin.
"The term ""Padmashali"" is derived from two words ""Padma"" and ""Shali"", The Padma means lotus and Shali means weaver. They support their Sanskrit origin with various myths and ""Puranas"" such as ""Kulapurana"" and ""Markandeya Purana""."
"The Padmashalis claim to be descendants from ""Bhrigu Rishi"" and ""Markandeya Rishi"", Markandeya's son ""Bhavana Rishi"" who were born one hundred and one son; they took to weaving and the first clothes they wore was out of the fibres of the lotus stem so they came to be known as ""Padmashalis""."
Padmashalis Today.
Pintupi Nine
"The Pintupi Nine were a group of Aboriginal Australians. They are said to have been the last Aborigines in Australia to come into contact with modern civilisation. The group lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer way of life in the Great Sandy Desert, before they met with their relatives near Kiwirrkurra in October 1984. Most other groups from this region had left the desert over 20 years before. They had been settled in towns to the east and west, but this group had stayed behind."
"The group belonged to the Pintupi community. They lived on the western side of Lake Mackay, north of where Kiwirrkurra is today. It was made up of a single family. The father of the group had recently died, leaving two widows and seven children, most of whom were young adults. The family was moving south, hoping to find some of their relatives. They came across another family setting up an outstation, but ran away after a misunderstanding. Their relatives from Kiwirrkurra went to find them and then brought them into modern society."
Background.
"Most Pintupi families had been settled in rural communities well over 20 years before. Starting from the 1930s, the Pintupi were forced to leave their homeland because of weapons tests being done at Woomera. Most were taken to Papunya, very far to the east, which is historically Luritja land. Others were moved northwest to Balgo, in Kukatja country. After this time, the Pintupi were said to have given up looking for any of their relatives living in the desert after they lost contact with the general community. They believed such people had died."
"By the 1960s, there were only a few families still living as nomads in the desert. Most of them had heard about White people and places like Papunya. But they had not come into contact with them. They chose to keep living in the way they had always lived. This was a problem, because they were all closely related. Pintupi follow a strict system of kinship (called skin groupings) that says who they can marry. It makes sure they avoid inbreeding. As not many families were left in the big desert, there were almost no eligible partners for the younger men and women."
"Much later, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act would be passed by the Northern Territory in 1976. Many Pintupi started to return to their land to set up permanent communities. They established the town of Kintore in 1981. Further west, Kiwirrkurra was founded in 1983 near Lake Mackay. This salt plain is the heart of the Pintupi homeland, and is where this particular family mostly lived."
Family history.
"The family was originally led by a man named Waku Tjungurrayi. He had four wives: Papalya, Nanu, Watjunka and another woman (whose name is not known to outsiders). These wives were all sisters belonging to the Nangala skin group. Papalya was Waku's main wife. They had three children: Topsy, Warlimpirrnga and Takariya. Waku also had another child, Piyiti, with the fourth (unnamed) sister. In the early years, this family sometimes travelled and hunted with another group. It was led by a man named Tjukurti Tjakamarra (later known as Freddy West). In 1962, West and his family decided they would go to live at Papunya. Waku did not want to leave, so they left Waku's family and went east."
"About a year later, the eldest daughter, Topsy, left the group. She married a man named Tommy Tjakamarra, who had come across the family while on his way northeast to Mikantji. Topsy had nobody to marry in her own group and Tommy had the right skin name. So they left to settle at Mikantji. Around this time, Piyiti's mother died."
"Waku died in about 1964. Soon after, a man named Lanti (or ""Joshua"") joined the group and married the three widows. He had lived at Balgo, but left there after getting into trouble with the Catholic missionaries. He came across the group while walking south across the desert. He took Waku's place as leader of the group. Nanu was his main wife. They had three children: Tamayinya, Yalti and Yukultji. Lanti also had another child, Walala, with Watjunka. Watjunka died sometime during the 1970s. When Lanti died around 1980, there were nine left in the group."
Members.
"The group was made up of two women and their seven children. All were born in the desert, so their exact ages are not known."
Story.
Life in the desert.
"The family lived travelling between temporary waterholes around Lake Mackay. They followed the clouds, as the presence of water dictated where they would go. They wore only small belts made out of hair. They carried wooden spears, spear-throwers and boomerangs for hunting. They also had an axe-head that Lanti had brought from Balgo. The group mostly ate lizards, witchetty grubs and bush plants. They also hunted rabbit, kangaroo, emu, goanna and snake."
"The family knew of places like Papunya, Balgo and Mikantji. They knew their relatives lived there. But Lanti had always kept the group away from those places. They had also heard stories about ""kartiya"" (whites), but did not understand who they were. The few encounters they had with modern objects (cars, planes) were associated with the supernatural. In an interview, Warlimpirrnga remembered, ""Joshua had told us about white men and motor cars. We knew there were non-Aboriginal people closing in around us. We didn't know what was happening."""
"To add to this, there were people who knew this family were still living in the desert. These included Topsy and Freddy West. They and their families all moved to Kiwirrkurra in 1983. Other locals would sometimes see campfires in the distance at night and footprints in the sand and knew they belonged to a group wandering the desert. The territory's welfare department were also said to have known about this particular group as early as 1962, and anthropologists working with the Pintupi during this time would often hear about these people."
"The father, Lanti (or ""Joshua""), died sometime around 1980. He died at Kuwarla, at the northern end of Lake Mackay. As is customary, the family moved away from the area in mourning. They travelled south, hoping to find some relatives."
Making contact.
"The encounter that led to the group leaving the desert happened on 13 October 1984. Warlimpirrnga and Piyiti were out hunting. They were at Lake Mackay, about two days walk from where their family was camped. They saw smoke coming from a campfire to the south. It was at Winparku, a waterhole between Kiwirrkurra and Kintore. A man named Pinta Pinta and his two sons were setting up an outstation there. After dark, Warlimpirrnga came close to the group. They were clothed and sitting next to a four-wheel drive. They drew water for Warlimpirrnga from a pump."
"Warlimpirrnga was scared. He was also angry, because these strangers were sitting on the land of his ancestors. They were in fact related, but didn't know each other. Warlimpirrnga knew only about his relatives from what his mothers had told him of them. They had an argument, and Pinta Pinta became frightened. Each thought the other was a featherfoot (sorcerer). When the man's son fired a shot from a rifle, Warlimpirrnga ran off. He took his family north, deep into the desert for safety. This was their first encounter with other people in 20 years."
"Meanwhile, Pinta Pinta and his family drove west through the night to Kiwirrkurra. He told everyone they had seen a featherfoot man. But when he described the man to them, Freddy West said he thought it was Warlimpirrnga. The next day, the elders met and decided to find the group and bring them in. On 15 October, a team of seven Pintupi and Charlie McMahon, the community co-ordinator, went out to Winparku. Together they followed the group's tracks across the desert in two four-wheel drives. On the second night, they could see the family's campfire in the distance. The next day, McMahon had to go back. His friend, Geoff Toll, drove up to continue the search with the others. They found the family the next morning, on 18 October. They had tracked them north for to Maruwa, a waterhole near Lake Mackay."
"On first seeing Toll, a white man, Warlimpirrnga remembers, ""I couldn't believe it. I thought he was a devil, a bad spirit. He was the colour of clouds at sunrise."" Yalti thought the white man was a spirit sent to punish her for something she had done wrong. The family were very scared. They tried to run and hide from the trackers. Warlimpirrnga tried to attack them, but Freddy West was able to calm him by showing him how they were related. The trackers gave the family jam from a tin and pieces of chocolate to eat. They convinced the family to come with them to Kiwirrkurra. They told them that there was lots of food and that water came out of pipes. Yalti said that this concept was unbelievable to them."
After contact.
"When they got to Kiwirrkurra, the family saw their relatives again for the first time in over 20 years. They were angry at them for leaving them behind and not coming to find them. When they saw Topsy, her brother and sister were so angry that they hit her. After a few days, Takariya was married off to Freddy West. It was a gesture between the two groups."
Impact.
"The meaning of the event was understood in many different ways. Agencies serving Aboriginals thought the group's discovery would help them in the debate about indigenous land rights. Fred Myers, an anthropologist who was invited to Kiwirrkurra to study the new group, argues that the event became a part of the Pintupi's struggle to get back their autonomy, which they had lost when they first came out of the desert to settle at Papunya. He argues that their main goal was to maintain the new people's ability to govern their own lives."
News.
"Before news of the group's discovery spread, the leaders of Kiwirrkurra worked to protect the privacy of the family members. They also wanted to protect them from the same kind of shame or teasing they had experienced themselves coming out of the desert many years before."
"One of the first people to be told about the event was the Aboriginal Affairs minister, Clyde Holding. His department wanted to use the group's story in the campaign for Aboriginal land rights. Holding gave the story to ""The Herald"", a newspaper from Melbourne. In exchange, the newspaper agreed not to tell anyone where the group was. The story was first reported on the newspaper's front page on 24 October, with the headline claiming it had ""found the lost tribe"". The news caused a sensation, and instantly made headlines across the country. They became popularly known as the ""Pintupi Nine"" or the ""Last Nomads"". The family themselves, however, would not tell their own story until much later in life."
"At Survivor Series, the match between Hart and Michaels was the main event (final match) of the show. At the end of the match, Michaels had put Hart in a wrestling hold called the ""Sharpshooter"". This was a hold that Hart liked to use, and won a lot of matches with. The ending of the match was supposed to have D-Generation X (a group of Shawn Michaels' on-screen friends) and The Hart Foundation (a group of Bret Hart's relatives and on-screen friends) run out to try and help. This meant the match would end without a winner. After that, Hart would give up the belt."
"Instead, Earl Hebner, the referee, called for the match to end. He acted like Bret Hart had given up in the hold, even though he had not. The bell rang and the match ended. This meant that Shawn Michaels was the new WWF Champion. Hart was angry because this was not what had been planned. He spat at McMahon, who had planned this. The fans were also angry, and booed McMahon and Michaels while cheering Hart."
After the screwjob.
"Bret Hart went to WCW, where he wrestled for two years until he retired."
"Because the fans hated McMahon for what he had done, he decided to act like a villain on-screen. He was shown as the owner of the WWF (before, he pretended others owned it) and played the role of an evil boss. He had a long storyline with Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was a very popular hero at the time."
"On the January 4, 2010 episode of ""Raw"", Hart made up with Michaels by shaking his hand and hugging in the ring."
Animism
"Animism is a belief common in many different religions and philosophies. An animist is a person who believes or practices animism. Animism is the belief that there is more in nature than the physical things that can be seen and touched. The part that is not physical can be called a soul, life force, or spirit. Physical things come in two types: things that are alive and things that are not alive. Animals and plants are alive. Most animists believe animals and plants have a spirit. Some animists also believe some non-living parts of nature have spirits. These non-living parts of nature include the wind, the rain, and geographic features like mountains and rivers."
"The word ""Animism"" looks like the words of other belief systems with the suffix ""-ism."" However, it is not like other belief systems. Animism is not organized on purpose. Animists did not come up with the word ""Animism."" Animists did not apply the word to themselves. Instead, Animism is an idea of European anthropologists. The first anthropologist who described Animism was Edward B. Taylor. Taylor was trying to describe what was similar among many groups all over the world. The word ""Animism"" is very new: it was first used in 1832. In contrast, the ideas described by ""Animism"" are very old. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy claims that Animism ""has been the dominant religious tradition across all human societies since our ancestors first left Africa."""
"The kind of ""spirit""."
"The word ""animism"" is based on the word ""anima"" from Latin. ""Anima"" means breath, life, or spirit. However, these are English words. The ideas of animism are often not from people who speak English. This means there is not one definition of spirit. The definitions are different in different animist groups. The following definitions are from the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Some groups believe that nature moves and interacts because of the spirit in things. Other groups believe that nature has more than just a spirit of movement. They believe that spirits in nature are persons like humans are persons. They believe that persons of nature can have a ""social relationship"" with other persons. Other groups believe that the persons of nature are dead relatives of humans who are alive. Still other groups believe that a single plant or animal may be many spirits in one. They believe that existence, movements, and more are each a separate spirit. In summary, not all animists define ""spirit"" the same way, but animists do believe similar things. They believe there is a spirit in many things which are not humans. They believe these spirits are why things that are not human move and interact."
The kinds of Animist belief.
Differences between Animism and similar beliefs.
"Animism is different from other similar beliefs. However, it is often confused with other similar beliefs. First, Animism is not Hylozoism. Hylozoism claims that the entire universe is alive and has an animating power like a spirit. Animism does not claim that the universe is alive. Animism does not believe all things are alive. Second, Animism is not Panpsychism. Panpsychism claims that all things have a mind and that mentality is the reason why the universe can exist. Animism claims that only some things have a mind. Animism does not believe that things must have a mind in order to exist. Third, Animism is not Vitalism. Vitalism claims that things which are alive cannot be explained without a spiritual as well as physical reason. Animism does not always believe that everything alive has a spirit. Animism also sometimes believes that non-living things have spirits."

"Animism is often compatible with Theism. Theism is the belief in the divine. The divine can be a single god (monotheism), many gods (polytheism), or everything (pantheism). Theists believe that the divine is ""transcendent,"" separate from human life. However, Animism is neither monotheistic nor polytheistic. The spirits of Animist belief are not transcendent, and that is why humans interact with them. Also, Animism is not pantheistic. The spirits of Animism are not all one (monism), but are unique to each thing with a spirit."
"""Old Animism"" and ""New Animism""."
"Animism is an idea described by anthropologists, not Animists. As anthropologists have studied Animism, they have changed their minds on how to describe it. This means that the first definition of Animism is now known as ""Old Animism."" The first definition was offered by Ernst Stahl in the 1800s. Stahl was a chemist and physician. He was not describing a religious belief. However, Edward Tylor borrowed his word to use for religious beliefs in other parts of the world. These beliefs were different and older from what Tylor believed. Because they were different and older, Tylor argued that his beliefs must have developed from Animist beliefs. He argued that all people groups develop in this way. The main change he proposed was that people move from religious explanations for the world to scientific explanations for the world. This was called the social evolutionary approach to anthropology. It is not popular with anthropologists since the 1920s."
"Now, anthropologists have stopped thinking of Animism as a way of explaining the world. Now, Animism is described as a way of relating to the world. This is the difference: the ""old Animism"" explained the unknown, but ""new Animism"" builds relationships with non-human people. This change in definitions is possible mostly because of Alfred Irving Hallowell. Hallowell studied the Berens River Ojibwe of North America in the 1930s. He lived with them. He learned that the Ojibwe do not think there is a spirit in all things at all times. They do not believe spirits explain every question. Instead, the spirits of things which interact with humans as persons. Animism for the Ojibwe is about relationships. Hallowell said the best way to understand this ""new"" Animism was to also believe in it. It is not common for anthropologists to believe similar things to the people they write about. However, this definition of Animism is the one that anthropologists are writing about today."

WrestleMania X-Seven
"WrestleMania X-Seven was the seventeenth yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It happened on April 1, 2001 at the Reliant Astrodome in Houston, Texas. The event was the first WrestleMania held in the state of Texas. The amount of people who went to the event broke the record for total number of people attending at the Reliant Astrodome. The total number of people was counted at of 67,925. It resulted in total receipt of $3.5 million. The event is often cited as the end of The Attitude Era."
"The main event was a No Disqualification match between Steve Austin and The Rock for the WWF Championship. During the match, Austin turned heel after he told Vince McMahon, a man that he had called his nemesis, to give him a chair. Austin hit The Rock with sixteen chair shots, which lead to Austin pinning The Rock and becoming the new WWF Champion. The PPV ended with Austin and McMahon shaking hands and sharing beers."
"The main matches on the undercard featured Triple H vs. The Undertaker, the second Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the WWF Tag Team Championship, and Vince McMahon versus Shane McMahon in a Street Fight."
Central Florida
"Central Florida is the central region of the United States state of Florida, on the East Coast. The region enjoys a hot but stormy climate, with many thunderstorms, and hurricanes threatening often."
"The exact boundary of the area may be in dispute. Central Florida tends to be thought of as the area around metropolitan Orlando, including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Lake, Brevard, and Volusia counties. Polk and Sumter counties are considered by some, including the local media, to be part of Central Florida. Although geographically in the central part of the state, usually the west central coast, including Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco, and Hernando counties, is considered the Tampa Bay area or the Suncoast, rather than a part of Central Florida. This area is known as the I-4 corridor."
Baku
"Baku (; , from the medieval ""Bâd-kube"", meaning ""wind-pounded city"", a compound word of ""bād"", ""wind"", and ""kube"", which is rooted in the verb کوبیدن ""kubidan"", ""to pound"", thus meaning a place where the wind would be strong and pounding, and ancient city names ""Baraca""/) is the capital) is the capital and the largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region. It is on the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula. Baku is located below sea level, which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. Modern Baku has three parts: the Old Town (İçəri Şəhər), the boomtown and the Soviet-built town. About 3 million people live in the metropolitan area. There are large numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons."
In Baku area there is a lot of oil. There are a lot of state and private universities.
"Baku is hosted the 57th Eurovision Song Contest in May 2012. They also bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. The city's three main football clubs are Neftchi Baku, FC Baku and Inter Baku. Baku is one of world's leading chess centres."
Divisions.
"Today, Baku is divided into 11 ""raions"" (administrative districts) and 5 settlements of city type."
Windows ME
"Windows ME is the Millennium Edition of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Windows ME is based on Windows 98. Windows Me was based on MS-DOS (as were Windows 98 and Windows 95), and is meant for people using computers in their homes. Windows 2000 and Windows ME are similar in looks, but Windows ME has features that families find useful, while Windows 2000 was meant for businesses, although many home users also used Windows 2000 especially after Windows ME got bad reviews."
"It was released in the year 2000, and thus was called Windows Millennium Edition. It was the last Windows to be based on MS-DOS. Unlike Windows 2000, Windows ME generally got negative reviews due to bugs and incompatible hardware. Support and updates for Windows ME (and Windows 98) ended in 2006, whereas Windows 2000 was supported until 2010."
Reception.
"Windows Me initially received generally positive reviews, with reviewers citing the operating system's integrity protection (branded as ""PC Health"") and the new System Restore feature as steps forward for home users. However, users' real-world experience did not bear this out, with industry publications receiving myriad reports of issues with the ""PC Health"" systems, PCs refusing to shut down cleanly, and general stability problems."
"As time went on, the reception became more negative, to the point where it was heavily panned by users, mainly due to stability issues. Retrospectively, Windows Me is viewed as the worst operating system Microsoft has ever produced, being unfavorably compared to its immediate predecessor and successor. Due to its many bugs and glitches, Windows Me is considered one of the worst operating systems of all time and the biggest failure in Microsoft Windows. A ""PC World"" article dubbed Windows Me the ""Mistake Edition"" and placed it 4th in their ""Worst Tech Products of All Time"" feature in 2006. The article states: ""Shortly after Me appeared in late 2000, users reported problems installing it, getting it to run, getting it to work with other hardware or software, and getting it to stop running."" Consequently, most home users remained with Windows 98, while some moved to Windows 2000 despite the latter being enterprise-orientated."
"System Restore suffered from a bug in the date-stamping functionality that could cause System Restore to date-stamp snapshots that were taken after September 8, 2001, incorrectly. This could prevent System Restore from locating these snapshots and cause the system restore process to fail. Microsoft released an update to fix this problem."
"Byron Hinson and Julien Jay, writing for ActiveWin, took an appreciative look on the operating system. On the removal of real mode DOS, they had noted ""The removal of DOS has clearly made a difference in Windows Me in terms of stability (far less Blue screen of death are seen now) and booting speed has greatly increased."" In a recommendation of the operating system upgrade for users of Windows 95 and 98, they had stated ""If Windows Me isn't a revolutionary OS it's clear that Microsoft has focused its efforts to make it more user-friendly, stable and packed full of multimedia options. The result is great and the enhancements added are really worth the wait."" The new features that Windows Me introduced were also praised and have since remained part of subsequent Windows generations."
"Along with Windows 2000 from the NT family, Windows Me was the last version of Windows that lacked product activation."
Librarian
"A librarian is a person responsible for selecting, organizing, and delivering information materials in a variety of formats such as electronic databases, primary source materials, or printed books. Librarians also teach people to find and evaluate information found on the World Wide Web using Internet search tools and strategies. Librarians may work in different areas. Purchasing materials, putting them into categories, teaching, assisting people with questions, and working with information technology are a few of the possible specializations."
The role of a librarian varies across different types of libraries and locations.
Training.
To become a librarian in a university a person needs to have a master's degree in Library Science (MLS) or a master's degree in Library and Information Science.
Employment.
"Most librarians work for libraries in schools, colleges, or universities or in municipal, regional, or national libraries. Some librarians also work for private companies, to help them to organize their documents and reports. There are librarians that also work with the deaf and in prisons."
Related jobs.
"Other jobs in libraries include the job of library technician. To become a library technician, a person needs to complete a college diploma."
Geronimo
"Geronimo (""Chiricahua"" Goyaałé 'One Who Yawns'; often spelled Goyathlay in English), (June 16, 1829–February 17, 1909) was a well-known Native American leader, but not chief, of the Chiricahua Apache tribe, but he was a Bedonkohe Apache. He was born in what is now the state of New Mexico and was also a respected medicine man. The name Geronimo was given to him by Mexican soldiers who either called to Saint Jerome while fighting him or transcribed his name into Spanish wrong. He led 38 Apache men, women, and children to resist being sent to reservations by the United States government or being captured by the Mexican Army. He surrendered in 1886. After that, he was moved to many different forts in the United States. In 1904 during the world fair in St. Louis, he sold souvenirs and pictures of himself. He died in 1909 from pneumonia."

Fullington has held many championships during his professional wrestling career:
Chris Candido
"Christopher B. ""Chris"" Candito (March 21, 1972–March 28, 2005) was an American professional wrestler. He was better known by his ring name Chris Candido. He was best known for his time with World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). He was also known for his time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) where he competed under the ring name Skip and was part of the tag team, The Bodydonnas."
"He was married to wrestling valet, Tammy Lynn Sytch who is better known by the name, Sunny."
Death.
"On April 24, 2005 at Lockdown, Candido suffered a fractured tibia and fibula as well as a dislocated ankle during a steel cage match with Lance Hoyt against Apolo and Sonny Siaki. He would undergo surgery the next day and would have titanium plates and screws inserted into his leg. Candido would be at the following ""Impact!"" tapings and managed The Naturals when they defeated America's Most Wanted to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. On April 28, 2005, Candido felt ill and his condition had worsened during the day. Candido collapsed during the evening and he was rushed to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was diagnosed with pneumonia. The doctors drained his lungs, but he died shortly afterwards. His brother Johnny said that Candido had died because of a blood clot, a complication from surgery."
"On the April 29 episode of ""Impact!"" as well as at the Hard Justice PPV event, TNA paid tribute to Candido. TNA decided to hold a tournament called the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament in his honor in late 2005. In 2009, Candido was inducted into the Hardcore Hall of Fame."
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
"Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (also called Fukushima I) is a disabled nuclear power plant in the town of Ōkuma in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Fukushima Daiichi was the first nuclear power plant to be built and run only by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)."
"In March 2011 there were nuclear emergencies at the power plant and some other Japanese nuclear facilities, which raised questions about the future of nuclear power. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035."
The nuclear reactors.
"The nuclear reactors for units 1, 2, and 6 were supplied by General Electric, those for units 3 and 5 by Toshiba, and unit 4 by Hitachi. The architectural design for the General Electric's units was done by Ebasco. All of the building work was done by Kajima. Since September 2010, unit 3 has been fueled by MOX fuel|mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. Units 1–5 had/have a Mark 1 type (light bulb shaped torus) containment structure, unit 6 has Mark 2 type (over/under) containment structure."
"Unit 1 is a 439 MW boiling water reactor (BWR3) constructed in July 1967. It started to commercially make electricity on March 26, 1971, and was planned to shutdown in March, 2011. It was damaged during the 2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami. The reactor had high atomic and earthquake safety levels when it was made, but it is now both old and out of date. No one knew such a bad earthquake could happen in Japan. Unit 1 was designed for a earthquake ""peak ground acceleration"" shaking motion of 0.18 g (1.74 m/s2) and a seismic ""response spectrum"" based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake. All units were inspected after the 1978 Miyagi earthquake when the seismic ""ground acceleration"" was 0.125 g (1.22 m/s2) for 30 seconds, but no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was discovered."
2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.
"In March 2011, soon after the Sendai earthquake and tsunami, the Japanese government cleared people from around the plant and started local emergency laws at Fukushima I. Ryohei Shiomi of Japan's nuclear safety board was worried about the chance of a meltdown at Unit 1. The next day, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yukio Edano said that a partial meltdown at Unit 3 was ""highly possible."""
"The Nuclear Engineering International group had reported that Units 1, 2 and 3 were automatically shut down. Units 4, 5 and 6 had already been shut down for maintenance. Back-up generators were damaged by the tsunami; started at first, but stopped after 1 hour later."
"Japan’s government said it had and a nuclear emergency when the cooling problems happened as the back-up diesel generators broke down. The cooling is needed to remove decay heat even when a plant has been shut down, due to the long term atomic reactions. Hundreds of Japanese troops were said to be trucking generators and batteries to the site."
"Reactor and generators damage reports (09.53 UTC, 16-3-2011)."
"After the back-up diesel generators pumps broke down, emergency batteries ran low after about eight hours. Batteries from other nuclear plants were sent to the site and mobile electric and diesel generators arrived within 13 hours, but work to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps was still continuing. The diesel generators would normally be connected by switching gears in a basement area of the power station's buildings, but this had been flooded by the tsunami."
Data estimated by JAIF (Japan Atomic Industrial Forum).
"Later, unit 4 at the nearby Fukushima II Nuclear Power Station was also shut down by the safety systems. Now, a source of off-site power is available but the damage level at the plant is bad."
Proposed long term safety activity.
Boron.
"Officials have thought about putting in or aerial dropping radiation killing boric acid, boronated plastic beads or boron carbide pellets into the spent fuel pools to absorb neutrons. France flew 95 tonnes of boron to Japan on 17 March 2011. Neutron are absorbed by boric acid, which has been injected into the reactor cores, but is unclear if boron was also included with the hose and fire truck water spraying of SFPs."
A 'Sarcophagus tomb' and liquid metal.
"On 18 March, the Reuters news agency reported that Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman of Japan's nuclear agency was asked about burying the reactors in a sand and concrete tomb, said: ""That solution is in the back of our minds, but we are focused on cooling the reactors down."""
"After the Chernobyl disaster, the atomic safety workmen used 1,800 metric tonnes of sand and clay cover the plant. This created a problem because they were thermal insulators and trapped heat inside. So first a non-evaporating coolant such as a liquid metal has to be put on it. After it has all cooled off a structure such as the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant 'sarcophagus tomb'."
Implications.
"The nuclear emergencies at Fukushima Daiichi and other nuclear facilities raised questions about the future of nuclear power. Platts has said that ""the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world"". Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035."
"Léon Walras (16 December 1834-5 January 1910) was a French economist. He started what is known as Lausanne school, or Marginalism today. He looked at market equlibrium. He started general equilibrium theory. For this, he looked at marginal utility: This is the added benefit of consuming another unit of an economic good. His thoughts are very important for Neoclassical econmics. In general equilibrium theory, he looked at a scenario, where there are (an unspecified, large) number of households and companies, who act on several markets: He postulated that what is true in one market, in equilibrium must be true for all of them: There is a system of price determination that has the property that supply and demand match on all markets. Abraham Wald could prove this hhypothesis only much later. Today, it is part of the Arrow–Debreu model."
Hawaiian Kingdom
"The Hawaiian Kingdom, or Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, was a sovereign state located in the Hawaiian Islands."
Establishment.
"The country was formed in 1795, when the warrior chief Kamehameha the Great, of the independent island of Hawaiʻi, conquered the independent islands of Oʻahu, Maui, Molokaʻi and Lānaʻi and unified them under one government. In 1810, the whole Hawaiian archipelago became unified when Kauaʻi and Niʻihau joined the Hawaiian Kingdom voluntarily. Two major dynastic families ruled the kingdom: the House of Kamehameha and the House of Kalākaua."
Recognition.
"Major European powers recognised the country. The United States became its chief trading partner and watched over it to prevent some other power (such as Britain or Japan) from threatening to seize control. Hawaiʻi was forced to adopt a new constitution in 1887. King Kalākaua signed it, because the Honolulu Rifles, an anti-monarchist militia, thratened him. Queen Liliʻuokalani, who succeeded Kalākaua in 1891, tried to replace the 1887 constitution with a new one. She was but was overthrown in 1893, largely at the hands of the Committee of Safety, a group of residents consisting of Hawaiian subjects and foreign nationals of American, British and German descent, many of whom had been educated in the US, had lived there for a time. Hawaiʻi was an independent republic until the U.S. annexed it through the Newlands Resolution, on July 4, 1898. This created the Territory of Hawaii. United States Public Law 103-150 adopted in 1993 (informally known as the Apology Resolution), acknowledged that ""the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States"" and also ""that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum."""
Jardins du manoir d'Eyrignac
"The gardens of the Eyrignac manor are located in Salignac-Eyvigues, in the Dordogne, in the Périgord noir (New Aquitaine region). They received the Remarkable Garden label in 2005 and have been included in the additional list of Historic Monuments of the 17th and 18th centuries since 1986. They are located not far from the Caves of Lascaux and Sarlat-la-Canéda."
MARCOS
"The Marine Commandos, abbreviated to MARCOS and officially called the Marine Commando Force (MCF), are the special forces unit of the Indian Navy and is responsible for conducting special operations."
Driving Miss Daisy
"Driving Miss Daisy is a 1989 American comedy-drama movie directed by Bruce Beresford and was based on the 1987 play of the same name by Alfred Uhry. It stars Jessica Tandy, Morgan Freeman, Dan Aykroyd, Patti LuPone, Esther Rolle, Joann Havrilla and was distributed by Warner Bros.. It was nominated for 9 Oscars and won 4 Academy Awards in 1990."
Pseudis fusca
"The Pseudis fusca is a frog that lives in Minas Gerais, Brazil."
Religious experience
"Sometimes people make experiences which they see in the context of a belief system. They call these experiences religious experiences, spiritual experiences, sacred experiences, or mystical experiences. William James made the concept popular, in the 19th century. He did this to fight the growing rationalism of Western society."
"In many religions, such experieces are called revelations. This also applies to the knowledge that comes from them. These religions say that a god or gods caused these revelations, and that they are not a result of a natural cause. They are considered real encounters with God or gods, or real contact with higher-order realities of which humans are not ordinarily aware."
"Skeptics say that these religious experiences are a normal feature of the human brain. As such, they can be studied in the same way other features of the brain are studied. To better be able to study them, scholars have classified such experiences in different ways."
Definitions.
"Psychologist and philosopher William James described four characteristics of mystical experience in ""The Varieties of Religious Experience."" According to James, such an experience is:"
History.
Origins.
"The notion of ""religious experience"" can be traced back to William James. He used the term ""religious experience"" in his book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"". It is considered to be the classic work in the field. At professional conferences, people often cite this book. James makes a difference between institutional religion and personal religion. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization, and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has mystical experience, can be experienced regardless of the culture."
"The term has been used before James, though. In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures said that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. Many of these views had a lot of influence. Kant said that moral experience justified religious beliefs. John Wesley also thought that the religious experiences in the Methodist movement (paralleling the Romantic Movement) were a basis to religious commitment as a way of life."
Criticism.
Statistics.
"Between 1789 and December 16, 2014:"
Protected clauses.
Article Five protects two clauses in Article One from being amended until 1808. These clauses are:
"Article Five also puts one absolute limit on Constitutional amendments. It completely protects Section 3, Clause 1 of Article One. This clause says that every state will have the same number of United States Senators. It does not set a time limit on how long this clause is protected for. It just says: ""no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate."" As of 1808, when the protections on the other two clauses expired, this is the only limit that the Constitution puts on suggested amendments. Any amendment, about anything else, could be suggested."
Separation of powers.
"Article Five gives all of the power for creating Constitutional amendments to the Legislative Branch: the United States Congress and the state legislatures. The President of the United States cannot amend the Constitution. He has no part in the process of changing the Constitution. The United States Supreme Court confirmed this in a 1798 case called ""Hollingsworth v. Virginia"". In its decision, the Court wrote: ""[T]he President ... has nothing to do with the proposition, or adoption, of amendments to the Constitution."" However, the Supreme Court cannot create an amendment either."
"This is an example of the separation of powers (also called ""checks and balances"") that the Founding Fathers built into the new American government. If the President or the Supreme Court could change the Constitution any time they wanted to, they would have too much power. One person (or nine Supreme Court Justices) could make decisions that would affect every American."
Checks and balances in Article Five.
"Instead, the Founders gave the job of creating Constitutional amendments to the Legislative Branch. By requiring that two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and three-quarters of the states, approve of every Constitutional amendment, they made sure that there would have to be a lot of debate, compromise, and thought before an amendment was approved. Also, because so many legislators have to approve every amendment, it is very difficult for small ""special interest"" groups (like people who only care about a certain part of the country, or a certain issue) cannot control the vote."
"The Founders even put checks and balances on the Legislative Branch's powers. If Congress gets too powerful, the states can make it call a Constitutional Convention. If the states get too powerful, ordinary Americans can vote on a Constitutional amendment through ratifying conventions. As a legal scholar wrote later: ""The ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment [by ratifying conventions] might be called one of the most democratic moments in American history. ... Almost all voters in America had the unprecedented opportunity to [support] or condemn a federal constitutional amendment directly. ... The conventions ratified the choices of the people without fail.""pp. 27–28"
Importance.
"Almost right away, the amendments process became very important. North Carolina and Rhode Island refused to ratify the Constitution without a Bill of Rights. This meant they would not be a part of the new United States Government. In 1789, James Madison wrote the Bill of Rights. They were ratified together, as the first ten amendments to the Constitution, in 1791. Having a Bill of Rights convinced North Carolina and Rhode Island to ratify the Constitution."
"The amendments process set out in Article Five has allowed for many other important amendments to be added to the Constitution. For example, these amendments have included:"
"If Article Five had made the Constitution too hard to change, African-American people might still be slaves, and women might still not have the right to vote."
Article Two of the United States Constitution
"Article Two of the United States Constitution creates the executive branch of the United States government. The executive branch includes the President; the Vice President; the Cabinet; executive departments, like the Department of State; independent agencies, like the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); and other things like committees and commissions."
Section 1: President and Vice President.
Clause 1: Executive Power.
"Section One begins by giving federal executive power to the President only. This is part of the separation of powers that the Founding Fathers built into the Constitution. To prevent any part of the government from getting too powerful, they split the power between three branches. This clause gives executive power to the President. Another clause in Article One of the Constitution gives federal legislative (law-making) power to the United States Congress only. A third clause in Article Three gives judiciary power to the federal courts. No branch is allowed to do a job that the Constitution has given to another branch. For example, the President cannot make laws; that is the Legislature's job."
"This clause says the President is the head of the Executive Branch. It also mentions the Vice President, though the Constitution does not give him any executive powers. However, the Constitution does say that the President and Vice President must be elected at the same time, for the same term (amount of time), and by the same constituency. The Founding Fathers wanted to make sure the Executive Branch would survive, and stay independent, if the Vice President had to become the President."
Clause 2: Method of choosing Electors.
"Under the U.S. Constitution, the President and Vice President are chosen by Electors. The Constitution allows each state legislature to decide how they will choose Electors. Since the 1820s, state legislatures have usually chosen Electors through an indirect popular vote. This means that people in the state will get to vote on which Electors they want. The ballot that people use to vote will have the Electors' names on it. Usually, it will also say what Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates they plan to support. This allows the people to choose Electors who support the candidates they like."
"Each state has two United States Senators and a certain number of United States Representatives representing them in Congress. (The number of Representatives depends on how many people live in the state.) Each state gets a number of Electors that is equal to the number of Members of Congress the state has. (For example, if a state has 2 Senators and 10 Representatives, they have 12 total Members of Congress, so they get 12 Electors.)"
"The only people who cannot be Electors are Senators, Representatives, and federal officers. This is meant to make sure that the Electoral College is made up of regular Americans, not politicians."
Clause 3: Electors.
"This clause talks about Electors and how they choose a President. Once they are chosen, the Electors meet in their states to vote for the President and Vice President. Originally, candidates only ran for President; there were no candidates for Vice President. Each Elector voted for two different candidates for President. They had to vote for at least one candidate who did not live in the Elector's home state. The candidate who got more than half of the votes became President. The candidate who got the next highest number of votes (the second-place winner) became Vice President."
This clause gives instructions for several possible problems:
Changes.
The Twelfth Amendment changed this process in a few ways:
Clause 4: Election day.
"The British zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater named this species after Peter Comrie, who discovered the bird at Fergusson Island in 1874."
Trumpet manucode
"The trumpet manucode (""Manucodia keraudrenii"") is a medium-sized bird of paradise about 31cm long with an long horn-like head tufts and loose neck feathers. It looks blackish glossed blue, green and purple. It has a red iris, long coiled trachea, and blackish bill, mouth and legs."
"They live in lowland rain forests of northeast Australia, New Guinea and nearby islands. They eat fruits and arthropods."
Superb bird-of-paradise
"The superb bird-of-paradise (""Lophorina superba"") is a small passerine, about 26cm long and 70 g in weight. It is one of two members in the genus ""Lophorina"". The male is a black bird-of-paradise with a shining green crown, blue-green breast shield and a long velvety black erectile cape covering his back. The female is a reddish-brown bird with brownish barred buff below."
The superb bird-of-paradise lives in the rainforests of New Guinea.
"The male is polygamous and performs a song and dance for to gain the interest of the female. He starts by singing loud and rapid notes, then he starts to hop around in front of the female making a tapping or clicking sound. Then, he uses his folded black cape and blue-green breast shield to spring upward and spreads widely around its head, making him a dancing ellipse-shaped creature."
Azula
"Azula is a fictional character in Nickelodeon's animated television series """". The character and series were created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko."
"Azula is voiced by Grey DeLisle and will be played by Elizabeth Yu in the Netflix . Her family is her mother Ursa, her father Ozai, her uncle Iroh, and her brother Zuko."
Twelve-wired bird-of-paradise
"The twelve-wired bird-of-paradise (""Seleucidis melanoleucus"") is a medium-sized bird-of-paradise about 33cm-long. The male has a red iris, black shoulders and wings, a long black bill and rich yellow plumes along its sides and stomach. From the rear of these plumes come twelve blackish, wire-like filaments, which bend back near their bases to sweep forward over the birds hindquarters."
"The female is a brown bird with black-barred buffy underparts. Its feet are strong, large-clawed and pink in color."
"It is the only species in the monotypic genus ""Seleucidis"". The male displays on an exposed vertical perch with its breast-shield flared. They eat fruits and arthropods."
"The bird is found in lowland forests, New Guinea and Salawati Island of Irian Jaya."
Sokka
"Sokka is a fictional character and one of the main characters in Nickelodeon's animated television series """". The character was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and voiced by Jack DeSena. In the film version, ""The Last Airbender"", in which is his name is pronounced differently, the character is played by Jackson Rathbone. In the Netflix , he will be played by Ian Ousley."
"In the show, 15-year-old Sokka is a warrior of the South Pole's , a race of people who can control water. He, along with his younger sister Katara, discovers an Airbender named Aang, the long-lost Avatar, and accompanies him on his mission to win the Fire Nation and bring peace to the world."
Concept and creation.
"Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko said that Sokka was originally designed to be ""much"" more low-key, but when his comedian voice actor Jack DeSena came in and brought liveliness to his character, they began writing towards that strength. Much of Sokka's dialogue and actions are derived from improvisations and intentional exaggerations on DeSena's part that the writers chose to include within scripts."
"As a result of his design, Sokka's character has come to serve as a source of comic relief during the series, often a victim of visual slapstick. He also is extremely sarcastic."
History.
"Sokka grew up in his village and trains the warriors of his village. Forced to mature quickly when his mother Kya was killed in a Fire Nation raid, he cultivated his warrior skills with a militant zeal, while his sister Katara did chores and practiced waterbending. When Sokka was thirteen, his father and the other village men left to help the Earth Kingdom to fight against the Fire Nation, leaving him and his sister to look after their tribe with their grandmother, Gran Gran. As the oldest male left in the South Pole, Sokka came to assume a semi-leadership role by the time he was sixteen, fiercely protecting the village from any possible outside threats while trying to train children to be a new generation of defenders."
"While on an expedition, Katara and Sokka discovered Aang inside an iceberg with Appa. After Katara freed him, Sokka initially believed that the Aang might be a Fire Navy spy, and he eventually grew xenophobic enough to banish him from the village. Upon discovering that Aang was the Avatar, destined to master all four elements and bring peace to the world, Sokka relented, realizing that they had a common enemy in the Fire Nation. He then set off with Katara and Aang on their journey to find a waterbending master at the North Pole, determined to hone his warrior skills by way of fighting Firebenders along the way. Fire Nation general Zhao killed Tui (the moon spirit) causing the moon to turn red and then vanish as during a lunar eclipse, thus preventing the waterbenders from using waterbending. Princess Yue (one of Sokka's love interests, the other being Kyoshi warrior Suki) then becomes the new moon by giving her life energy to the moon spirit, thereby restoring the moon in the sky and the abilities of the waterbenders."
"In ""Sokka's Master"" (the 4th episode of ) Sokka expresses self-doubt that he is not as useful to the group as his companions. Inspired by his friends' encouragement, he seeks out a master to learn the sword. Rather than fighting with brute force and flawless technique, Sokka's creativity and heterodox approach to things are the cornerstones of his technique, and his master claims that in time Sokka will be a superior swordsman. As he departs, his master gives him a game piece that was previously established as a sign of connection to the secret society known as the Order of the White Lotus."
"In the two-hour , Sokka and Katara meet with Katara's Waterbending master, Pakku, who has now married their grandmother. In the battle against Ozai, Sokka, his girlfriend Suki, and Toph destroyed a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy others of its kind while Aang duels with the Phoenix King (Ozai). Sokka and Toph are separated from Suki and attack another airship, but Sokka breaks his leg and strains his arm grabbing hold of Toph, who was falling off the ship. In a compromised position, the pair are attacked by two soldiers, whom Sokka defeats at the cost of his sword and boomerang. As he and Toph are on the edge of the crashing ship, Suki arrives with another airship and saves the two. With the battle over, the trio reunite with Aang and the vanquished Phoenix King. At Zuko's coronation, Suki is reunited with her fellow Kyoshi Warriors, Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father, with the rest of the group reunited with their friends. In the end, Sokka is seen at Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se where everyone teases a painted picture he created of the entire team, wherein he altered some factual details to make the scene more ""memorable""."
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (') or Nongda Lairel Pakhangba (') was officially the first Meitei king of the Ningthouja dynasty. He was coronated in the Kangla of Kangleipak ("" realm"") in 33 AD. He rose to power after defeating the Khabas."
"According to Paratt, before the times of king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, the ""salai""s () were already in existence."
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba started unifying the warring ethnic groups and principality groups positively. It led to the formation of Manipur realm, under the political supremacy of the Ningthouja dynasty (Mangang clan) in the first century AD. Despite the historical context, with the usage of the title ""Pakhangba"", he was often deified with various mythological tales, revolving around his identity as a human incarnation of God Pakhangba (frequently mentioned in the alias ""Konjil Tuthokpa"")."
"According to Sujit Mukherjee, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 54 AD (""21 years of reign""). The Cheitharol Kumbaba also recorded the list of Meitei kings, starting from Nongda Lairen Pakhangba. The record has several versions. However, the most authentic record is the one that is preserved in the Royal Palace of Manipur. The information on the Cheitharol Kumbaba is supplemented by that in the , which also records the details of the Meitei kings, starting from Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, regarding their parentage and important events in their reigns."
"According to Prof. P. Gunindra Singh, coins were issued by Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, which served as one of the significant evidences relevant to the study of the subject."
"One of the most remarkable historical events occurred during the times of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was the organising of a match of polo () sports, played by his friends, in the (), the oldest Polo Ground in the world."
Name.
"The name ""Pakhangpa"" () was mentioned in the ancient Meitei text, named the ""Thanglon Thangchat"". However, due to the given name ""Pakhangba"", being possessed by multiple historical personalities in ancient times, the identity of the ""Pakhangba"" mentioned in the text is questionable. Notably, there were four notable people named ""Pakhangba"", who are (1) ""Leinung Lonja Ariba Pakhangba"", (2) ""Tangja Leela Pakhangba"", (3) ""Lolang Pakhangba"", and (4) ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"" himself. They lived in different times in the history of Manipur."
"The title ""Pakhangba"" is used by the historical kings who are considered to be ""enlightened"". King Nongta Lailen (""Nongda Lairen"") was one among the historical personalities to use the title ""Pakhangba"". Many scholars compared the usage of the title ""Pakhangba"" by Meitei kings with that of the title ""Buddha"", used by the people who are considered to be ""The Awakened One"" or ""The Enlightened One""."
King Pakhangba inherited the political powers as he followed the traditional practices of his forefathers and paid respect for his ancestral rituals.
Rise to power.
"According to Hareshwar Goshwami's ""History of the People of Manipur"" as well as the ancient Meitei text , Nongda Lairen Pakhangba subjugated the powers of ""Sorarel Ariba Ahum"", who were the chiefs of three clans, viz. Chengleis, Luwangs and Nganbas."
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was challenged by Poireiton, for the throne of the Kangla. In the conflict, the former defeated the latter. With the accession of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba to the throne of the Kangla, other clans including the Chengleis and Khaba Nganbas lost their sovereignty. The Angoms and the Luwangs, though independent, shared their political powers with Nongda Lairen Pakhangba."
"Some scholars opined that under the administration of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, his capital was divided into 4 ""pana""s (). The 4 panas include Ahallup Pana, Naharup Pana, Laipham Pana and Khabam Pana. However, some scholars are of the opinion that the ""Pana"" system is a later interpolation, by stating that ""Pana"" came into existence during Meitei King Khagemba's era."
Family.
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba's queen consort, Leima Leisana (also called ""Laisna""), was a maibi (). Leisana and her brother ""Poireiton"" had their origin from a distant place in the east. When she and her brother came to the realm of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, they were accompanied by the Poirei people. She brought two hundred varieties of fruits and vegetables. Legend says that one hundred of the varieties were meant to be cooked and the rest of the hundred were meant to be eaten raw."
Administration.
"During the reign of king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, the ""Kuchu"" (, /kū.chū/) was established in his kingdom. It was the highest level court (supreme court), having legal jurisdictions over both criminal cases as well as civil cases. The king was the president of the court, and his nobles as well as ministers served as its members."
"The ""Kuchu"" court also used to perform trials of women's cases. The concept of the liberation of women (feminist movement) was already prevalent in that era. The roles of women in their families' decision making processes were considerably significant."
"The ""Cheirap"" (""derived from the word ""Cheirak"""") was established during the reign of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom. In Meitei language, ""Cheirap"" (, /cə́i.rap/) means ""court"". In Meitei language, ""Cheirak"" (, /cə́i.rak/) means ""punishment"" or ""said of strict control to enforce obedience""."
"Starting from the era of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in the 1st century AD, ""Pacha Loishang"" (also spelled as ""Patcha"")() was established in Kangleipak. The court protected the women's rights, privileges, rights against immoral trafficks. During his time, his queen consort ""Laisna"" presided over the court, dealing all women related crimes."
"The Lallup system was established during the reign of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom. The ""Lallup"" (also spelled as ""Lalup"") was a practice of forced labor and free labour in services to the sovereign or to the state."
Development of art and culture.
"When Nongda Lairen Pakhangba and his queen consort ""Laishna"" were coronated in 33 AD, the ritual song ""Ougri"" was sung. ""Ougri"" ritual song can bring either prosperity or ruination to the civilization. Since then, it became customary to recite ""Ougri"" during the coronations of every Meitei kings. These recitations of the verses, during the royal coronation of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in 33 AD, were recorded in the ancient text, ""Laisrapham""."
"During the era of ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"", a court singer named ""Leinung Tharuk Asheiba"" initiated the performance of the traditional musical instrument Pena."
"According to Dr. Yumlembam Gopi, the Ancient Meiteis used to play ""khung"", a playing instrument, prior to the era of ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"" in 33 AD. The ""khung"" (, /kʰuŋ/) is a cone-shaped toy, similar to the top."
The Hiyang Tannaba () festival had been celebrated since the time of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom.
"The Mera Hou Chongba (also spelled as ""Mera Hao Chonba"") was believed to be introduced by Nongda Lairen Pakhangba. It is a festival in which dignitaries from all the ethnic groups assembled together in the Kangla. It is annually celebrated on the 10th day of the Meitei lunar month of ""Mera"" (October-November interface month)."
Official groups of medical care.
"During the reigns of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in the 1st century AD, his younger sister named ""Panthoibi"", established the ""Ametpa Loishang"" (). The Loishang () used to perform the treatment and the diagnosis of diseases and sicknesses, including boils, abscesses, ulcers, etc. ""Laibi"", a post in that office, supervised the procedures. ""Metpi""s used to perform delivery and child birth. ""Metpi Laibi""s were responsible for the treatment of diseases for the Queen and other imperial consorts. ""Metpi Laibi""s always used to accompany the king wherever he went, by bringing medical tools and medicines. The text ""Loishangi Thouram Thougal"" mentioned about the duties of the Loishang and the ""Laibi"". The text ""Masil"" (also spelled as ""Masin"", ) mentioned about the ""Metpi""s and the ""Metpi Laibi""s."
Death or dethronement.
"Though almost all the scholars have a consensus on the year of the coronation of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba as AD 33, regarding the year of the end of his reign, which maybe either due to his death or due to being abdicated, is still disputed."
"The Preamble to the United States Constitution is a brief introduction to the Constitution's purposes and guiding principles. It provides the Founding Fathers' intentions for creating the Constitution and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve. It was added to the Constitution as an afterthought and was not discussed on the floor of the Constitutional Convention nor was it voted on. Gouverneur Morris, one of the writers of the Constitution, wrote and added it at the last moment. The Preamble itself did not have any legal meaning. The Supreme Court upheld this view in ""Jacobson v. Massachusetts"" (1905)."
We the People.
"""We the People"" means all of the citizens of the United States."
"The first few words of the Preamble ""We the People of the United States"" were very different than any treaty or law the United States had ever written before. For example, the United States' first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, describes itself as ""Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the States,"" and then gives a list of all thirteen states. The treaties the United States had signed were the same. They were agreements between states, not people."
"At the time, Gouverneur Morris chose to write ""We the People"" instead of saying ""We the United States of..."" and then listing all thirteen states. First of all, Article Seven of the Constitution said that only nine states had to approve the Constitution for it to take effect. At the time, nobody knew which states would ratify the Constitution and which would not. Because of this, the Preamble could not list all thirteen states as if they had all already agreed. Also, if other states joined the United States later, it would be impossible to add their names to the list. For these reasons, the Preamble had to start with ""We the People."""
"The words ""We the People"" turned into a strong statement that this new government was made by the people of the United States, to benefit the people of the United States. When Virginia's delegates were debating the Constitution, Governor Edmund Randolph pointed out: ""The government is for the people; and the [problem] was, that the people had no [power] in the government before."" If the people are going to have to follow the government, he said, should not the people be the ones to create that government?"
In Order to form a more perfect Union.
"""In order to form a more perfect union"" is a concept most likely based on ""Commentaries on the Laws of England"" by Sir William Blackstone. It was widely read at the time and many of the framers were students of his work. Blackstone stated the constitution of England was perfect, but steadily improving. The phrase ""a more perfect union"" simply meant a better one than any before the Constitution."
"Before the government based on the Constitution, the United States was based on the Articles of Confederation. However, had very little power as a federal government. They did not give the United States government enough power for the country to work and grow. Every state was for itself, instead of working cooperatively. Sometimes they acted like thirteen separate countries that would only come together if another country attacked them."
Establish Justice.
"""Establish justice"" meant to establish the rule of law. It meant that everyone was equal before the law with no distinction between the status or wealth of a person. With their new government, the Founding Fathers wanted to establish (create) justice and fairness. When the British Empire governed the American colonies, the colonists did not think the government was fair. For example, Parliament would decide that the colonists had to pay taxes on items like stamps and things that were made in other countries. The colonists did not have any say in this."
"Even after the United States became independent, many of the Founding Fathers thought that the states had too much power under the Articles of Confederation. They thought the states had taken away people's rights."
"For example, during the Shays' Rebellion in Springfield, Massachusetts, the state of Massachusetts:"
Insure domestic Tranquility.
Shays' Rebellion was still fresh in the minds of the framers. It cause many to fear the spirit of the American Revolutionary War might be getting out of hand. There was a need to keep peace in the new country
"Just five years after the Articles of Confederation were ratified in 1781, many Americans were unhappy with the Articles. Many of the Founding Fathers thought that the Articles had made the United States government too weak. Shays' Rebellion made it very clear that the national government under the Articles of Confederation was not strong enough. Daniel Shays, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, led the rebel farmers trying to overthrow the Massachusetts government. The farmers had formed an entire army, which neither the state or federal governments had enough soldiers or money to fight. In desperation Massachusetts offered to pay for a private army to fight the rebellion. Finally, in 1787, that private army defeated the rebels.pp. 84–86"
"John Jay, one of the Founding Fathers, said that after the United States government could not pay for soldiers to defend against any armed rebellion: ""the inefficiency of the Federal government [became] more and more [obvious]."" Another Founding Father, Henry Knox, said that Shays' Rebellion convinced many people that the United States needed a stronger federal government.p. 127 The Rebellion made it clear that the states were not protected, and if they were attacked, they would be on their own."
Provide for the common defense.
"""Provide for the common defense"" meant the framers were well aware that independence from Great Britain did not mean they were secure. British Canada to the north was still full of angry loyalists. To the west were unknown numbers of hostile Native American tribes. Farther west was the vast Louisiana territory held by France. To the south the Spanish held Florida. Worse, these powers were fighting a series of wars in Europe that affected much of North America. The framers knew America needed to protect itself. Providing for the common defence meant the new government would make sure all of the states were protected and defended if attacked."
Promote the general Welfare.
"""Promote the general welfare"" is the basic goal of all governments. It was the main reason for having a constitution."
"In general, this part of the Preamble means that one of the new government's jobs would be to make things better for the whole country. Specifically, this part of the Preamble has to do with the government's powers to tax people and spend money. It means that the new government will only have the power to tax and spend on things that are good for the entire country. The government will not be allowed to spend money on things that will be good for only a part of the country, or only some people in the country."
"For example, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax people and spend money on creating Post Offices and building roads for mail carriers to use. Congress can do this because Post Offices will ""promote the general Welfare""—everybody in the country will benefit from being able to send and get mail."
Secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.
"""Secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity"" was important since many had come to America from places with little political or religious freedom. This phrase demonstrates the intent of the new government to protect the newly-won freedoms and protect against a tyrannical government."
"However, the Articles of Confederation were all about the states' rights. At that time, many people were afraid of having a federal government that was too strong. These people were called anti-federalists. They included some of the Founding Fathers, like Patrick Henry and James Monroe. The anti-federalists worried that a strong federal government could become tyrannical and take away the rights of individual states, like they thought the British colonial government had done. They also worried that a government ruled by a President might turn into a monarchy, where the President would become a King and have total power. Because of these worries, the Articles of Confederation talked all about states' rights, and not about individual people's rights. The framers wanted to establish these rights for the people of the United States and their ""posterity"" meaning all the generations of Americans who would follow."
Do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
"""Do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America"" is perhaps the strongest statement in the Preamble. It says in effect that the people made the Constitution and it is the people who give it power."
"The Preamble to the United States Constitution, is the beginning of the Constitution. It is not a law. Instead, it talks about the Founding Fathers' reasons for writing the Constitution, and what they hope the Constitution will do."

The Abstract House (Milan)
"The The Abstract House or La Casa Astratta is a palace in Viale Beatrice d'Este 24, Milano, Italy in the historic center of Milan inside the luxurious Quadronno District, which collects the open-air masterpieces of numerous archistars of the fifties."
"The Palazzo La Casa Abstract was built by Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani together with the painter Francesco Magnelli in 1952, and is inspired by the reworking of the pictorial theories of Kandinsky that dialogue with Italian rationalism,Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani also completed the adjacent building in Viale Beatrice d'Este 26 in 1952, while Giordano Forti and Camillo Magni in 1957 created the masterpiece adjacent to ""The Abstract House"" known as Palazzo Forti, making the whole area an open-air museum."
"The Abstract House of Viale Beatrice d'Este in Milan is the iconic masterpiece of the MAC artistic movement, full of suggestions and the deepest conceptual meanings of the entire Movement for Concrete Art with global significance."
Description.
"The abstract house is the maximum expression of the architectural conceptual theories of Perogalli and Mariani synthesis of the artistic movement MAC, founded in 1948 in Milan with Atanasio Soldati, Gillo Dorfles, Bruno Munari and Gianni Monnet with the aim of overcoming figurative art by referring to the lesson of Kandinsky."
"The inseparable unity of the arts is significantly manifested in this example, the so-called ""abstract house""; it presents a composition of the facade inspired by the work of Alberto Magnelli, a well-known abstract painter of Tuscan origins who moved to Paris."
"The Palazzo is a unique expressed synthesis applied to a building of the MAC-Movimento d'Arte Concreta artistic movement. It is defined by the art critic of Claudio Camponogara as ""one of the richest and most significant buildings of the entire Movement for Concrete Art""."
"The painter Francesco Magnelli, active in Paris, collaborates with the designers in particular to layout the facade where the apartments of the Abstract House in Viale Beatrice d'Este are distributed according to a pictorial scheme, also finding inspiration from the artist Alberto Magnelli. The same design is taken up in negative inside the entrance hall with an artistic inlay in the rubber floor with the aim of establishing a close relationship between the facade and the interior space. In the atrium a sculpture was created by Attilio Mariani."
Style.
"Thus, for a short period of time (from 1948 to 1958), for architects and artists, Milan became the city where they could experience a new conception of the relationships between the arts. The Palace shows how the concrete forms are not simply paintings applied to the walls of a building designed separately by another person, but are born and developed together with the architecture with which they identify. The task of breaking the stereometry of the building is entrusted to the balconies which, united in a clever play of colors, enliven the front with beams of intense blue and give the impression of a large abstract composition pleasing to the eye and functional. The same design is taken up in negative inside the entrance hall, where an inlay of the rubber floor has the purpose of establishing a close relationship between the external facade and the internal space, where there is also a Mariani sculpture. Perogalli also considers this creation one of the most original and significant in which ""the synthesis of the arts ... is also notable for the strong chromatic component: the facade of the building has a cladding in white marble and blue ceramic tiles. The decoration is expressed both in the free composition and in the choice of colors on the facade."
"""The façade endowed with movement and plasticity for the protrusions of the balconies and bow windows that the chromatic play enhances: cladding in white marble, mirrors in black ceramic mosaic, balconies in blue ceramic mosaic."""
Bruno Morassutti
"Bruno Morassutti (Padua, December 8, 1920 - Belluno, September 4, 2008) was an Italian architect and designer. Morassutti is an archistar among the protagonists of the birth of Italian design active in the fifties, a protagonist of Italian rationalism."
"Morassutti's best known masterpiece is the Bosco Verticale in the exclusive Quadronno district of Milan, which anticipates Boeri's recent construction."
Quotations.
"""It is wrong to focus too much on the ""testimonial"" (historical) value of his photos. They have that, indeed, but, in equal measure they express the ""milieu"" (society) in which he lived and they show (...) that when he was behind a camera, he became a giant, a true inventor, a force of invention, a recreator of life."""
- Mario Vargas Llosa
"""I've read that in Chile they think that the indigenous South American peoples have no culture, that they are not civilised, that they are intellectually and artistically inferior to European white peoples. The artworks are a graphic testament that is more eloquent than my own opinion, always. I hope that this testament will be examined fairly and objectively. I feel I am representing my race; my people will speak through the photographs."""
"- Martín Chambi, 1936"
Early life.
"Martín Chambi was born in a poor Quechua family. He was born in one of the poorest parts of Peru, at the end of the nineteenth century. His father worked in a gold mine by the River Inambari. Martín sometimes went to work with his father too. He saw his first photographer there at the mine. Chambi learned the basic techniques from a photographer at the Santo Domingo Mine. This meeting fired his ambition."
"Chambi tried to work as a professional photographer after this. He traveled to the city of Arequipa in 1908, where photography was more developed. Many professional photographers lived in Areqiupa. They had developed individual photographic styles and professional techniques."
Chambi was an apprentice in the studio of Max T. Vargas. After nine years he created his own studio in Sicuani in 1917. He published his first postcards in November 1917.
"In 1923 he moved to Cusco and opened a studio there. In Cusco he photographed rich society people and poor indigenous people. During his career, Chambi also travelled all over the Andes. He photographed the landscapes, Inca ruins, and local people. Chambi was with the American explorer Hiram Bingham when Bingham ""discovered"" Machu Picchu, the great Inca monument."

Reception history of Jane Austen
"The reception history of Jane Austen shows how Austen's works, at first having modest fame, became wildly popular. Her books are both the subject of great study and the center of various fan culture. Jane Austen, the writer of such works as ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1813) and ""Emma"" (1815), has become one of the most famous novelists in the English language."
"During her lifetime, Austen's books did not make her very famous. Like a great number of women writers at that time, she chose to publish her books secretly. Only among people in the aristocracy, her writing was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were thought fashionable by members of high society. However, they received only a few good reviews. By the mid-nineteenth century, her works were respected by people who were learned in literature. They thought that liking her works was a sign that they were clever. In 1870, her nephew published ""Memoir of Jane Austen"". This showed her to a wider public as ""dear, quiet aunt Jane"". After this, her works were published again in popular editions. By the twentieth century, lots of groups had formed. Some praised her and some defended her from the ""teeming masses"". However, they all claimed to be true Janeites, or people who really appreciated Austen."
"Early in the twentieth century, scholars made a collection of her works (the first for any British novelist). But it was not until the 1940s that Austen was widely accepted as a ""great English novelist"". In the second half of the twentieth century, people began studying Austen more and more, and in different ways. For example, they studied her works artistically, ideologically, and historically. The university English departments began developing in the first half of the twentieth century. As they grew, criticism of Austen split into remarkable high culture and popular culture trends. In the late twentieth century, fans made Jane Austen societies and clubs. They praised Austen, her time, and her works. In the early twenty-first century, Austen fans support an industry of printed sequels and prequels. They also support Austen's work in television and film."
Background.
"Jane Austen lived her entire life as part of a large and close family. Her family was in the lower part of the English gentry. Her family's steady support was very important to Austen's development as a writer. For example, Austen read her first drafts of all of her books to her family. In this way, she received encouragement and help. In fact, it was her father who first tried to put her book in print. Austen's training as a writer lasted from when she was a teenager until she was about 35. During this time, she experimented with different literary forms. This included the epistolary novel (novel in letters), which she tried and did not like. She wrote and revised three important novels and began a fourth. When ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1811), ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1813), ""Mansfield Park"" (1814) and ""Emma"" (1815) came out in print, she became a successful writer."
"However, novel-writing was not easy for women in the early nineteenth century. This was because it made them famous. It also made people think them unfeminine. So like a great number of other female writers, Austen published her books secretly. In time, though, her writing became an open secret among the aristocracy. In one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her to his home. His librarian showed her around and said that the Regent liked her books very much. The librarian added that ""if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince"". Austen did not like the prince, who spent a lot of money. She did not want to follow this suggestion. However, her friends persuaded her to follow it. Therefore, ""Emma"" was dedicated to him. Austen refused the librarian's suggestion after that to write a historical romance for the prince's daughter's marriage."
"In the last year of her life, Austen revised ""Northanger Abbey"" (1817) and wrote ""Persuasion"" (1817). She also began another novel, which was later titled ""Sanditon"". She could not finish it before her death. Austen did not have time to see ""Northanger Abbey"" or ""Persuasion"" through the press. However, her family published them as one book after she died. Her brother Henry included a ""Biographical Notice of the Author"". This short biography made people think of Austen as a quiet aunt who wrote in her free time. ""Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives (purposes) ... [S]o much did she shrink from notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced (made) her, had she lived, to affix (put) her name to any productions of her public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress."" However, Austen shows excitement in her letters about getting her books in print. She was also interested in how much money the books would make. Austen was a professional writer."
"Austen's works are noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and clever use of free indirect speech. They are also remarkable for their burlesque and irony. They criticize the novels of sensibility of the second half of the eighteenth century. They are part of the change to nineteenth-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen laughed at ""love at first sight, the primacy (first importance) of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the exploits of the hero, the vulnerable sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed (declared) indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel of parents"". Austen's stories, though comic, focus on the way women depend on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. She was also concerned with moral problems, like Samuel Johnson, who strongly influenced her."
1812–1821: Individual reactions and contemporary reviews.
"Austen's books quickly became fashionable. Aristocrats who liked to set the fashion and taste of the day especially liked them. Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough wrote about ""Sense and Sensibility"" in a letter to a friend. She said: ""it is a clever novel.  ... tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it."" The 15-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to Marianne Dashwood. She remarked, ""I think Marianne &amp; me are very like in ""disposition"", that certainly I am not so good, the same , &amp;tc"". ""Pride and Prejudice"" was enjoyed by Richard Sheridan, a person who wrote plays. He told a friend to ""[b]uy it immediately"" for it ""was one of the cleverest things"" he had ever read. Anne Milbanke, future wife of Lord Byron, wrote that ""I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior (good) work."" She added that ""is the most ""probable"" fiction I have ever read"" and had become ""at present the fashionable novel"". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that ""Mansfield Park"" was ""[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural"". Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the writer Maria Edgeworth, that ""[""Mansfield Park""] has been pretty generally admired here"". Edgeworth later said that ""we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park""."
"High society liked and approved of Austen's novels. However, they received few reviews while she was alive. There were two for ""Sense and Sensibility"". ""Pride and Prejudice"" received three. ""Mansfield Park"" received none. There were seven for ""Emma"". Most of the reviews were short, careful, and approving. They mostly focused on the moral lessons of her books. Brian Southam writes about these reviewers: ""their job was merely to provide brief (short) notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit (good) of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral""."
"Famous writer Walter Scott wrote the longest and deepest of these reviews. He was asked by publisher John Murray to review ""Emma"". ""Emma"" had come out in print (without saying who the writer was) in the March 1816 issue of the ""Quarterly Review"". Using the review as a way to praise the novel, Scott praised Austen's works. He praised her ability to copy ""from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the correct and striking representation of that which is daily (every day) taking place around him"". Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that ""unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence (difference) from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence"". Scott wrote in his private journal in 1826 about Austen. This later became a widely quoted comparison:"
"In 1946, at the request of the GHQ, the Shōwa Emperor (Hirohito) proclaimed in the Humanity Declaration that he had never been an akitsumikami (現御神), divinity in human form, and claimed his relation to the people did not rely on such a mythological idea but on a historically developed family-like reliance."
"Since the enactment of the 1947 constitution, the role of emperor has been relegated to a ceremonial head of state without even nominal political powers."
"The Deming Prize is the longest-running and one of the highest awards on TQM (Total Quality Management) in the world. It recognizes both individuals for their contributions to the field of Total Quality Management (TQM) and businesses that have successfully implemented TQM. It was established in 1951 to honor W. Edwards Deming who contributed greatly to Japan’s proliferation of statistical quality control after World War II. His teachings helped Japan build its foundation by which the level of Japan’s product quality has been recognized as the highest in the world, was originally designed to reward Japanese companies for major advances in quality improvement. Over the years it has grown, under the guidance of the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) to where it is now also available to non-Japanese companies, albeit usually operating in Japan, and also to individuals recognized as having made major contributions to the advancement of quality. The awards ceremony is broadcast every year in Japan on national television."
"European visitors to Japan observed that the lower classes owere a simple, crude, and child-like people. Public nudity was widespread amongst all ages with little shame, as was public spitting and urination. Bawdy jokes were uttered in public without batting an eye. This was in considerable contrast to the aristocracy with their fine clothing and elaborate etiquette."
"Following the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese ruling class sought to tame the commoners so Europeans might not think they were little more than savages with a bone in their nose. Public nudity and urination were banned in the bigger cities, where foreigners were most likely to visit, and various backward, barbaric, and disgusting religious rituals were outlawed. The upper class took to wearing Western clothing. For the commoners, traditional garb continued to be the norm."
"During the post-WWII occupation, Douglas MacArthur further took it upon himself to civilize Japan. The wearing of Western clothing for everyone was encouraged--for women, blouses, skirts, brassieres, and panties instead of kimonos, and for men, shirts, trousers, and boxer shorts. It may be noted that while Japanese men traditionally wore a loincloth known as a fundosi, women generally went commando under their kimonos--it was observed that on windy days they would ""often be blown open, presenting quite an eyeful."
Post-Occupation Japan.
"Post-Occupation Japan means Japan after its occupation and control by a group of nations had ended. This is the period after the Second World War. The Second World War had damaged Japan very badly. It has almost lost its industry and economy was in a very bad shape. After the war, Japan received assistance and technology from the US and several other countries of Europe. The progress was very rapid. For about 30 years, from around the 1950s to the 1980s, Japan grew very fast. It became one of the major economic powers of the world."
"When the UN forces were fighting in Korea during the Korean War, Japan was one of the major suppliers. This also helped Japan’s economy. By 1980s, Japan had become the world’s second largest economy, after the USA. At first, there was very close relationship between Japan and the USA. But, Japan’s economic might resulted into trade deficit for the USA. A trade deficit results when imports are more than exports. Thus, USA was importing more than it exported to Japan."
"For various reasons, this phase of rapid development ended in the 1990s. Some historians have described this decade as the lost decade of Japanese economy. About 5 to 10 persons in 100 persons could not find any work."
Political life.
"By 1952, Japan had become free from most of the controls of the occupation period. It got its own democratic system. Various political parties came into being and Japan’s political life became active."
Modern Life (Heisei Era).
"Historians and sociologists call the recent era modern life. In Japanese, this is called the Heisei period. By 1989, Japan’s economy had become very large. Much development had taken place. In the Gulf war of 1991, Japan gave billions of dollars."
A 1973 article in the New York Times reported that Indonesians hated Japanese businessmen due to their practices and attitudes towards them.
The Jewish American engineer Jerome Lemelson developed the camcorder and walkman audio recorder for the Japanese company Sony.
"Japan also faced some problems. In 1995, a big earthquake took place in Kobe. Another earthquake took place on 23rd October 2004 in Niigata Prefecture, and a very destructive tsunami damaged the north east coast in March 2011, causing a nuclear accident in Fukushima Prefecture."
"On 8 July 2022, former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe was assassinated while giving a speech in Nara at aged 67."
History of Saudi Arabia
"The beginning of the modern history of the state of Saudi Arabia is argueably when an Islamic reformer named Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab and a local ruler named Muhammad bin Saud founded the Emirate of Diriyah in the year 1744. It was founded in the area of Nejd, the central part of the Arabian Peninsula. The Sa'udi emirate's leadership can be viewed as a traditional form of rule within communities of Arabia in the 18th century. Over the next century and a half the family went through a lot of opposition and hurdles. The family faced opposition from powerful families of Arabia but also rulers of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire."
"In 1902 Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, also known as Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, took over the city of Riyadh from another family named Al-Rashid. He continued to win more areas, and on 8 January 1926, he became the King of Hejaz and the Sultan of Nejd. On 20 May in 1927, the government of the United Kingdom accepted him as the King of those areas ruled by him (the Nejd and Hejaz). His kingdom now became a sovereignty. The modern nation state of Saudi Arabia was established in 1932 as 'the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia' declared by King Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud. Petroleum oil was found in Saudi Arabia on 3 March in 1938, which made the country rich since the export of oil started to bring in a lot of money."
"But the history of the Arabian Peninsula contains more history, which led to the development of the Saudi state. Inhabitants and cultures can be traced back 63,000 years ago. The most significant event that happened in the Peninsula is the rise of the Islamic religion presented by Prophet Muhammad. The Rashidun Caliphate, Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate and Fatimid Caliphate all occupied the Arabian Peninsula and thus helped it develop to how we know it today. More dynasties were there in history, but the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina were under the protection of the Hashemite Sharifs of Mecca from the 10th century onwards."
Early history.
Pre-Islamic Arabia.
"When discussing pre-Islamic Arabia, we refer to the time before 610 CE. This is the year when the Prophet Muhammad started propagating the religion of Islam and thus when the religion of Islam started to form. The term ‘pre-Islamic Arabia’ is useful because it signals the importance of Islam and its influence in forming the Peninsula as we know it today with all its religions and cultures. But it also shows a relation between the rise of Islam and the native Arabs conquering the world through conquest, trade and innovations."
"This era covers thousands of years with a lot of different cultures and communities. The oldest evidences that point to inhabitants of the Peninsula are estimated to be 63,000 years old. There are inhabitants that had trading relations with many parts of the ancient world, but the hot and harsh climate had made large settlements difficult. So bedouin groups were naturally also present. Some settlements had always existed around oases; these are places in the deserts where growth and water are available. For instance there was a culture called the Dilmun culture among them, which was very old and existed along the Persian Gulf. It was as old as the ancient civilizations of the Sumerians and Egyptians. But also the Kindite kingdom and other ancient communities were present."
It is better to refer to the History of Arabia Wiki page when discussing the Pre-Islamic era. This page (History of Saudi Arabia) will cover more of the Post-Islamic era because of its strong relationship with Saudi Arabia.
Post-Islamic Arabia.
The birth of Islam.
"The Hejaz area became an important center as Islam rose in the 620s. After Prophet Muhammad of the Quraysh tribe started calling to Islam in 610, the already existing cities of Medina (formerly called ""Yathrib"") and Mecca eventually became the holiest places of Islam and thus most of Muslims. The number of followers rapidly began to grow after the migration (or Hijra) of Muhammad and his companions in 622 from Mecca to Medina. During the completion of the religion, both these cities became the holiest places in the Muslim World. Masjid al-Haram and Al-Masjid al-Nabaw I am the main locations of pilgrimage where Muslim hopes to visit the Kaaba primarily in Masjid al-Haram and the Prophet's tomb in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi at least once in their lifetime."
Muhammad and his companions went through the Arabian Peninsula in the following years and united the divided tribes of Arabia under one flag. This led to Medina becoming the capital of the newly established Islamic state ruled by the Prophet Muhammad.

Palazzo Galmanini Portaluppi
"The The Palace Galmanini Portaluppi or Palazzo d'Este is a palace in Viale Beatrice d'Este 23, Milano, Italy, designed by Gualtiero Galmanini and Piero Portaluppi adjacent to and in support of an existing masterpiece Palazzo Maffezzoli of 1957, in the historic center of Milan inside the luxurious Quadronno District, which collects the open-air masterpieces of numerous archistars of the fifties."
Description.
"This Milanese residential building, belonging to the rationalist movement, have historical and artistic interest and is located in Viale Beatrice d'Este, on the corner of Via Luigi Anelli, is a symbol of the Milanese design setting 1950s, from which the best known Italian design in the world was born, which saw the first architects also become designers of objects and scholars of concepts, art and sculpture."
"This is the work of the Italian architect Gualtiero Galmanini and Portaluppi, who was the designers of the architectural Modern Movement is a foundational building in italian design heritage, that pays attention to architectural details, simple and sophisticated elegance."
It consists of a body with two exteriors and two interiors.
"The façade is characterized by a Mosaic wall covering Tessera Bisazza of checkered colored mixed glass with corrugated curves, that create plays of white and gray light. The building demonstrates extensive use of classical and other typically asymmetrical elements, including rigidity and symmetry in the arrangement of windows between via Anelli and Viale d'Este."
Style.
"The Palazzo in Viale Beatrice d'Este has a refined and original design, its stylistic code is characterized by geometric rigor and the alternation between solidity and transparency, in structures in which glass, concrete and metal combine to create spaces, volumes and games of light and shadow, and is considered one of the great masterpieces of Gualtiero Galmanini in collaboration with Portaluppi, historical partners united in research on the stars and astrolabes."
History.
• Design: 1953-1956
• Execution: 1956
"The weakest parts of the plot were the arrangements for the subsequent rebellion which would have swept the country and installed a Catholic monarch. Due to the requirements for money and arms, Sir Francis Tresham was eventually admitted to the plot, and it was probably he who betrayed the plot in writing to his brother-in-law Lord Monteagle. An anonymous letter revealed some of the details of the plot; it read: ""I advise you to devise some excuse not to attend this parliament, for they shall receive a terrible blow, and yet shall not see who hurts them""."
"According to the confession made by Fawkes on Tuesday 5 November 1605, he had left Dover around Easter 1605, bound for Calais. He then travelled to Saint-Omer and on to Brussels, where he met with Hugh Owen and Sir William Stanley before making a pilgrimage to Brabant. He returned to England at the end of August or early September, again by way of Calais."
"Guy Fawkes was left in charge of executing the plot, while the other conspirators fled to Dunchurch in Warwickshire to await news. Once Parliament had been destroyed, the other conspirators planned to start a revolt in the Midlands."
Discovery.
"During the preparation, several of the conspirators had been concerned about the safety of fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament on the day of the planned explosion. On the evening of Friday, 26 October Lord Monteagle received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton."
"Monteagle had the note read out loud, possibly to warn the plotters that the secret was out, and promptly handed it over to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, the Secretary of State. The conspirators learned of the letter the following day, but decided to go ahead with their plan, especially after Fawkes inspected the undercroft and found that nothing had been touched."
"Having been shown the letter, the King ordered Sir Thomas Knyvet to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he did in the early hours of 5 November. Shortly after midnight, Fawkes was found leaving the cellar the conspirators had rented and was arrested, giving his name as John Johnson. Inside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal. Far from denying his intentions during the arrest, Fawkes stated that it had been his purpose to destroy the King and the Parliament. Nevertheless, Fawkes maintained his false identity and continued to insist that he was acting alone. Later in the morning, before noon, he was again interrogated. He was questioned on the nature of his accomplices, the involvement of Thomas Percy, what letters he had received from overseas and whether or not he had spoken with Hugh Owen."
"A letter written by Gentleman of the Bedchamber, Sir Edward Hoby gave details of all those that would have been caught in the explosion:"
"On 5 November we began a Parliament, to which the King should have cometh in person, but refrained through a practice but that morning discovered. The plot was to have blown up the King at such time as he should have been sat in his royal throne, Nobility and Commons and with all Bishops, Judges and Doctors at one instant, and the blast to have ruined the whole estate and kingdom of England."
"Fawkes was taken to the Tower of London and interrogated there under torture. Torture was forbidden, except by the express instruction of the monarch or a body such as the Privy Council or the Star Chamber. In a letter of 6 November, King James I stated:"
"The people were happy to learn that the king and his sons survived the Gunpowder Plot. The next parliament had feelings of loyalty and goodwill, which Salisbury used to get higher subsidies for the king than those granted in Elizabeth's reign. In his speech to both Houses on 9 November, James talked about two main topics: the Divine Right of Kings and the Catholic question. He insisted that the plot had been the work of only a few Catholics, not of the English Catholics as a whole, and he reminded the assembly to rejoice at his survival, since kings were divinely appointed and he owed his escape to a miracle."
Trial and executions.
"On hearing of the failure of the terrorist plot, the conspirators fled towards Huddington Court near Worcester, a family home of Thomas and Robert Wintour. Heavy rain, however, slowed their travels. Many of them were caught by Richard Walsh, the Sheriff of Worcestershire, when they arrived in Stourbridge."
"The remaining men attempted a revolt in the Midlands. This failed, coming to a dramatic end at Holbeche House in Staffordshire, where there was a shoot-out resulting in the deaths of Catesby and Percy and capture of several other principal conspirators. Jesuits and others were then rounded up in other locations in Britain, with some being killed by torture during interrogation. Robert Wintour managed to remain on the run for two months before he was captured at Hagley Park."
"The conspirators were tried on 27 January 1606 in Westminster Hall. All of the plotters pleaded ""Not Guilty"" except for Sir Everard Digby, who attempted to defend himself on the grounds that the King had reneged on his promises of greater tolerance of Catholicism. Sir Edward Coke, the attorney general, prosecuted, and the Earl of Northampton made a speech refuting the charges laid by Sir Everard Digby. The trial lasted one day (English criminal trials generally did not exceed a single day's duration) and the verdict was never in doubt."
"The trial ranked highly as a public spectacle, and there are records of up to 10 shillings being paid for entry. Four of the plotters were executed in St. Paul's Churchyard on 30 January. On 31 January, Fawkes, Winter and a number of others implicated in the conspiracy were taken to Old Palace Yard in Westminster, in front of the scene of the intended crime, where they were to be hanged, drawn and quartered."
"Fawkes, although weakened by torture, cheated the executioners: when he was to be hanged until almost dead, he jumped from the gallows, breaking his neck and killing himself, thus avoiding the gruesome latter part of his execution."
"Henry Garnet was executed on 3 May 1606 at St Paul's. His crime was of being the confessor of several members of the Gunpowder Plot, and as noted, he had opposed the plot. Many spectators thought that his punishment was too severe. Antonia Fraser writes:"
"Due to the Gunpowder Plot, many Catholics found themselves persecuted or imprisoned in the Tower of London, including the following:"
Historical impact.
"Greater freedom for Catholics to worship as they chose seemed unlikely in 1604, but after the plot in 1605, changing the law to afford Catholics leniency became unthinkable; Catholic Emancipation took another 200 years. Nevertheless, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office in the kingdom during King James' reign."
"Interest in the demonic was heightened by the Gunpowder Plot. The king himself had become engaged in the great debate about other-worldly powers in writing his ""Daemonology"" in 1597, before he became King of England as well as Scotland. The apparent devilish nature of the gunpowder plot also partly inspired William Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"". Demonic inversions (such as the line ""fair is foul and foul is fair"") are frequently seen in the play. Another possible reference made in Macbeth was to equivocation, as Henry Garnett’s ""A Treatise of Equivocation"" was found on one of the plotters, and a resultant fear was that Jesuits could evade the truth through equivocation:"
"Faith, here's an equivocator, that could"
Swear in both the scales against either scale;
"Who committed treason enough for God's sake,"
Yet could not equivocate to heaven
"- Macbeth, Act 2 Scene 3"
"The Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for years after the plot by special sermons and other public acts, such as the ringing of church bells. It added to an increasingly full calendar of Protestant celebrations which contributed to the national and religious life of seventeenth-century England. Through various permutations, this has evolved into the Bonfire Night of today."
"Professor Ronald Hutton has considered the possible events which could have followed the successful implementation of the Gunpowder Plot, with the resultant destruction of Parliament and death of the king. He concluded that the violence of the act would have instead resulted in a more severe backlash against suspected Catholics. Without the involvement of some form of foreign aid, success would have been unlikely, as most Englishmen were loyal to the institution of the monarchy, despite differing religious convictions. England could very well have become a more ""Puritan absolute monarchy"", as ""existed in Sweden, Denmark, Saxony, and Prussia in the seventeenth century"", rather than follow the path of parliamentary and civil reform that it did."
Commemoration.
"When Parliament met in January 1606 for the first time after the plot they passed an Act of Parliament called the ""Thanksgiving Act"". This made services and sermons commemorating the Plot an annual feature on 5 November. The act remained in force until 1859. On 5 November 1605, it is said that the people of London celebrated the defeat of the plot with fires and street festivities. The tradition of marking the day with the ringing of church bells and bonfires started soon after the Plot and fireworks were also included in some of the earliest celebrations. In Britain the fifth of November is also called Bonfire Night, Fireworks Night or Guy Fawkes Night."
"It remains the custom in Britain, on or around 5 November, to let off fireworks. Traditionally, in the weeks running up to the 5th, children made ""guys""—effigies supposedly of Fawkes—usually made from old clothes stuffed with newspaper, and with a grotesque mask, to be burnt on 5 November bonfire. These effigies would be shown in the street, to collect money for fireworks, although this practice is becoming less common. The word ""guy"" came thus in the 19th century to mean an oddly dressed person, and in the 20th and 21st centuries to mean any male person."
Ante Starčević
Ante Starčević (23 May 1823 – 28 February 1896) was a Croatian politician and publisher.
Life.
"Starčević was born in Žitnik near Gospić, a small town of the Military Frontiers, in what was then part of Austria-Hungary. He was the son of a Serb Orthodox mother and Catholic father. In 1845, he graduated from secondary school in Zagreb. He started his studies at the seminary (school where people can learn how to become a priest or minister) in Senj, but moved to Pest in the year of 1845 so he could go to a Roman Catholic theological (of the study of God or gods) seminary - which he finished in 1848. After passing a number of philosophy and free sciences classes, he earned a honoris causa degree in the year of 1846. Starčević quickly returned to Croatia and continued studying theology in Senj. Instead of becoming a priest, he chose to get involved in secular pursuits and started working in the law firm of Ladislav Šram in Zagreb."
"He then tried to get an academic post with the University of Zagreb. As he was unsuccessful, he stayed in Šram's office until 1861 even though he was no longer allowed to practice law since 1857. He was also a member of the committee of Matica ilirska, a Croatian cultural society, in the Historical Society and in the editorial board of ""Neven"", a literary magazine."
"In 1861, he was appointed the chief notary of the Fiume county. That same year, he was elected to the Croatian Parliament as the representative of Fiume and started the Croatian Party of Rights with Eugen Kvaternik. Starčević would be reelected to the parliament in 1865, 1871, and from 1878 to his death."
"In 1862, when Fiume was the scene of protests against Austrian Empire, he had to stay in prison for one month because he was thought to be enemy of the government. When he was released, Starčević returned to Šram's office, where he stayed until 11 October 1871, when he was arrested again, this time on the occasion of the Rakovica Revolt. The rebellion was started by Kvaternik, who was not a Serb hater as his political ally Starčević. Kvaternik had become convinced that a political solution, as Starčević called for, was not possible. While several hundred men were rebelling against the government, both Croats and Serbs, it was soon defeated by Imperial Austrian troops. The Croatian Party of Rights didn't exist anymore. Starčević was released after two months in prison."
"In the last decade of the 19th century, he moved to Starčević House (""Starčevićev dom""), built for him by the Party of Rights in 1895. He died in his house a year later, when he was 73. According to his wish, he was buried in the Church of St Mirko in the Zagreb suburb of Šestine. His statue was made by Ivan Rendić. At his deathbed, he requested that no monuments be raised to his honor, but his statue was put up in front of Starčević House in 1998."
Political activity.
"After being banned from practicing law in 1857, Starčević travelled to Russia where he hoped he would gather support from the empire's eastern rival. When this failed, he travelled to France, pinning his hopes on French emperor Napoleon III. While in Paris, he published his work ""La Croatie et la confédération italienne"", considered by some to be the precursor to his Party of Rights' political program. In 1859, the Austrian Empire was defeated in the Second Italian War of Independence, during which time Starčević returned to Croatia. Austria lost control over Italy, and Austria's weakening status in the world paved the way for Starčević's career."
"As the chief notary in Fiume in 1861, Starčević wrote ""the four petitions of the Rijeka county"", which are considered the basis of the political program of the Croatian Party of Rights. He pointed out that Croatia needed to determine its relationships with Austria and Hungary through international agreements. He demanded the reintegration of the Croatian lands, ""the large kingdom of Croatia of old"" (the Middle Age's Kingdom of Croatia), the homeland of one people, ""with the same blood, language, past and (God willing) future""."
"On that ideological basis, he founded the Croatian Party of Rights with his school friend Eugen Kvaternik in 1861. The Party of Rights was clerical, conservative, and pro-Habsburg. Its only concession to nationalism was hostility to the Serbs who, since the incorporation of the ""military frontiers"" into Croatia in 1868, made up a quarter of the population. Starčević was the only parliamentary representative who agreed with Kvaternik's draft constitution of 26 June 1861. He advocated the termination of the Military Frontier and persuaded parliament to pass on 5 August 1861 the decision annulling any joint business with Austria."
"He advocated the resolution of Bosnian issues by reforms and cooperation between the people and the nobility. Starčević believed that Bosniaks were the ""the best Croats"", and claimed that ""Bosnian Muslims are a part of the Croatian people and of the purest Croatian blood""."
Literary and publishing work.
"Starčević wrote literary criticism, short stories, newspaper articles, philosophical essays, plays and political satire. He was also a translator."
"His travelogue ""From Lika"" was published in Kušlan's magazine ""Slavenski Jug"" on 22 October 1848. He wrote four plays in the period 1851-52, but only the ""Village Prophet"" has been preserved. His translation of Anacreon from Ancient Greek was published in ""Danica"" in 1853. His critical review (1855) of Đurđević's ""Pjesni razlike"" was described by the Croatian literary historian Branko Vodnik as ""our first genuine literary essay about older Dubrovnik literature"". His opus shows an affinity with practical philosophy, which he calls ""the science of life"". As Josip Horvat said: ""His literary work from 1849 to the end of 1853 made Ante Starčević the most prolific and original Croatian writer along with Mirko Bogović."""
"In 1850, incited by Ljudevit Gaj, Starčević started working on the manuscript of ""Istarski razvod"", a crucial Croatian document from 1325. He transcribed the text from the Glagolitic alphabet to the Latin alphabet, analyzed it and published it in 1852. In the foreword, young Starčević elaborated his linguistic ideas, pointing out that the mixture of all three Croatian dialects (Shtokavian, Chakavian) and Kajkavian) and the Krajina dialect is called the Croatian language, which Starčević considers from the perspective of its six hundred years of history. Starčević accepted the etymological orthography and used the ekavian form for his entire life, considering it the heir of the old Kajkavian. His language is a ""synthetic"" form of Croatian, never used before or after him, most similar to the Ozalj idiom of Petar Zrinski, whom he probably never read."
"In that period, in the ""Call for Subscriptions to the Croatian Grammar"" (8 December, 1851) he stated his opposition to the Vienna Language Agreement of 1850 and the linguistic concept of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. He continued his dispute with the followers of Karadžić in a series of articles published in 1852. His opposition to the Vuk's work he 'supported' by utter denial of the Serbs as the nation, their language, their culture and history. In his vain and racistic effors to oppose and derail Karadžić's work, he was loner and loser - mainstream of the Croatian educated men, headed by Strossmayer and Gaj, highly appreciated and supported Karadžić. It was demonstrated publicly immediately after Karadžić's death - when Croatian Parliament (Sabor) collected a considerable amount of money in order to erect a monument to honor Karadžić in Croatia and the Court chanchellor Ivan Mažuranić got the Viennese Imperial Court to financially support the Karadžić' widow."
"When ""Srbski dnevnik"" from Novi Sad published an article saying that ""Croatians write in Serbian"", Starčević wrote a fierce reply: ""(...) Instead of claiming that the Croats use anything else but the Croatian language, those writers who consider themselves Serbs (or whatever they like) would do well to write in the educated and pure Croatian language, like some of them are already doing, and they can call their language Coptic for all I care. (...)"" He published the reply as an unsigned article in ""Narodne novine"", the newspaper of Ljudevit Gaj, so the Serbian side attacked Gaj, wrongly attributing the article to him. Starčević subsequently proclaimed he was the author, but Gaj, who cared to maintain good relations with Serbia, distanced himself from his friend."
"For his political activity and literary work, Starčević is commonly called Father of the Nation (""Otac domovine"") in Croatia. His portrait is depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 1000 Croatian kuna banknote, issued in 1993."
Racism and antisemitism.
"Starčević was a racist and an anti-Semite. His understanding of the basic human rights and the way he linked them to the civil liberties were extremely primitive and selective. For example, Starčević criticized the socialism as """"unshaped"" and he was delighted by the colonialism and claimed that ""Algeria should be densely populated by a few million of happy Frenchmen and not to allow to have one hundred fifty thousand of them against two and half million of Arabs""""."
"Starčević had based his ideological views on writings of those ancient Greek writers who thought that some people, by their very nature, are slaves, for they had """"just half of the human mind"" and, for that reason, they ""shall be governed by people of the human nature"""". About the people and nations which he saw as cursed and lower ranked races - he spoke as of the animal breeds and uses the ""breed"" word to mark them."
"He wrote a whole tract about the Jews that could be summarized in a few sentences: ""Jews ... are the breed, except a few, without any morality and without any homeland, the breed of which every unit strives to its personal gain, or to its relatives' gain. To let the Jews to participate in public life is dangerous: throw a piece of mud in a glass of the clearest water - then all the water will be puddled. That way the Jews spoiled and poisoned the French people too much""."
"But, for Starčević, there was a race worse than the Jews. For him, the """"Slavoserb"" notion was firstly of a political nature: the ""Slavoserbs"" are his political opponents who ""sold themselves to a foreign rule"""". Then all those who favorably look on the South Slavs unity not regarding them (the South Slavs) as the Croats."
"Later, and with years, Starčević more and more marked the """"Slavoserbs"" as a separate ethnic group, or - as he used to say the ""breed"", ranked, as humans, lower than the Jews: ""The Jews are less harmful than the Slavoserbs. For the Jews care for themselves and their people ... but the Slavoserbs are always for the evil: if they cannot gain a benefit, then they tend to harm the good or just affair, or to harm those who are for the affair."""" - he wrote once."
"Further, he claimed that the injustice was done to different """"cursed breeds"" what spoiled those breeds even more and made them ""to be vengeful against their oppressors"". As a convinced racist, he stresses that to the ""cursed breeds"""", i.e. to the lower races should not be given any role in the public life."
"As an aged man, he makes the Serbs identical to the """"Slavoserb breed"" and mocks them for their defeats they suffered long ago - which provoked negative reactions even in his ""Party of Rights"". On that occasion, the Party member Erazmo Barčić (1894.) described Starčević's mockery and racism as ""throwing mud at people and primitive cheeky invectives""""."
"However, when once face with negative reactions to his open racism, he temporarily retreated. That was a reason that he wrote an article in Sloboda, issue of 23 March, 1883: ""The main thing is this: everybody should work for the people and the homeland, and let them call themselves as they wish... We have disputes and dissensions only because they are supported and strengthened from the outside... We believe that hungry and cold Serbs and Croats feel the same... Therefore, everybody can assume the name of Hottentots, every person can choose their own name, as long as we are all free and happy!..."""
Starčević's racism and its followers.
The British historian A.P.J.Taylor wrote (pages 188-189):
"After the Shoshone Indians left the valley, immigrants from Spain and Mexico established large cattle ranches there."

Popeye
"Popeye the Sailor Man is one of the most popular cartoon characters of all time. He first appeared in a comic strip called ""Thimble Theatre"" by E.C. Segar in 1929. Popeye is a sailor who smokes a pipe and mutters things under his breath. He has only one eye, he is short and uneducated, but when trouble occurs, usually saving his girlfriend, Olive Oyl from his nemesis, Bluto/Brutus, he eats a can of spinach, and gets super-strength."
"Over the years, He also appeared in a series of cartoons made for movie theatres by Paramount Pictures, comic books, arcade, video games, hundreds of advertisements, peripheral products (ranging from spinach to candy cigarettes). In 2002, ""TV Guide"" ranked Popeye #20 on its ""50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time"" list."
Character history.
"Creation and development in ""Thimble Theatre""."
"Popeye was created by E. C. Segar and was inspired by a man Segar knew in Chester, Illinois: Frank ""Rocky"" Fiegel. Popeye would make his debut in the January 17, 1929 ""Thimble Theatre"" strip ""Dice Island"" as a rough sailor for hire. While originally introduced as a minor character (with the actual star of the strips then being Castor Oyl), Popeye's popularity eventually grew to the point where he became the main character of ""Thimble Theatre"", with the strip now focusing on his adventures and hijinks. Initially, Popeye was portrayed as a very strong and seemingly uneducated but very savvy sailor who would gain extraordinary luck and resilience when he rubbed the magical Whiffle Hen Bernice, but by 1932, he began to favor spinach, crediting it as a healthy source of strength. As the strips started focusing more on Popeye, he began to form a relationship with Castor's sister Olive Oyl after she had left her previous boyfriend Ham Gravy, and the two would eventually go on to become one of the most recognizable couples in cartoon history."
"After Popeye's run in the original ""Thimble Theatre"", he would return as the main character in the 1948 comic book series by E. C. Segar's assistant Bud Sagendorf, which combined elements from both the original ""Thimble Theatre"" and the Fleischer Studios cartoons. His comic book appearances would continue for decades until the title's end in 1984."
Fleischer Studios.
"Popeye's huge popularity led him to be adapted into animation, which would only be loosely based on ""Thimble Theatre"" due to the limited length of the theatrical shorts at the time keeping them from making proper full-length adaptations of the ""Thimble Theatre"" sagas, which resulted in the shorts being episodic. The huge success of the first ""Popeye the Sailor"" cartoon (which originally started as a part of the Betty Boop shorts) would ensure a long-running series of independent theatrical shorts for the now famous sailor. In the various cartoons by Fleischer Studios, he would usually have to rescue his girlfriend Olive Oyl from Bluto, his rival and sometimes friend or go on a daring adventure with Olive and his good friend J. Wellington Wimpy. Some of the cartoons take a different recurring approach, like him rescuing Olive from another threat, dealing with something alone, fighting a small enemy he cannot beat, or watching over his adopted son Swee'Pea. As these theatrical shorts deviated from Segar's strips quite a bit, many characters from the comic never made an appearance or only appeared once (like Castor Oyl and the Goons). However, other characters like J. Wellington Wimpy (who sometimes served as Popeye's sidekick), Poopdeck Pappy and, more rarely, Oscar would make semi-regular appearances in the shorts. Eugene the Jeep also made some appearances but would not be used as often as the above. George W. Geezil also made only two appearances alongside Popeye. Many of these cartoons mostly focused on Popeye's adventures and antics along with Olive and occasionally Wimpy as they tried to resist the antagonistic Bluto. While not appearing as a sailor very often (as Popeye was usually portrayed with a number of odd jobs) the stories in the cartoons would involve his brawling escapades or his adventures in certain areas of the world while doing impressive feats and preserving Olive's safety and their relationship."
World War II.
"During the World War II-era animated shorts, Popeye was a member of the U.S. Navy and his outfit was changed to a white Navy suit, and he would continue to look like this in animation from the 1940s through to the 1960s. During Fleischer Studios's final years of operations, the shorts they produced were WWII stories focusing on Popeye's heroic attempts to help America fight the enemy, mostly the Japanese and Germans. The cartoons with these battle scenes have often been banned from television for being considered too ""politically incorrect."""
"Also, in the 1940s shorts, Popeye gained four nephews named Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye and Pupeye, who originally debuted in an earlier short within a dream sequence as his children, before being made recurring and turned into his nephews. However, their exact relation to Popeye remains unclear, and the parent of his nephews has never been properly identified."
Famous Studios.
"Following the takeover of the Popeye animated franchise by Paramount Studios in 1942, the Popeye cartoons were now handled by Famous Studios, which made drastic changes which abandoned almost all traces of ""Thimble Theatre"" and focused largely on plots involving Popeye, Olive, Bluto in something resembling a love triangle, without many other characters appearing and with very few shorts deviating from that setup, which involved Olive falling for Bluto and Popeye beating him after eating spinach in an oft-repeated formula. Also of note are Famous Studios' remakes of Fleischer cartoons (such as ""Goonland"", itself a loose ""Thimble Theatre"" adaptation), heavily changed by Famous to remove all traces of Segar creations outside of Popeye, Bluto and Olive, i.e. ""Popeye's Pappy"" replacing ""Goonland""'s Goons with what might be considered racial caricatures of Africans led by a Bluto-like cannibal, with the only thing in common between the two versions being the rescue of Pappy - who would go on to make only two more appearances after this (one of which contradicted the established fact that he left his son shortly after his birth). Supporting characters who were notable friends of Popeye and even had several appearances in Fleischer cartoons, such as Wimpy, Pappy and Swee'Pea, were featured less than a handful of times: Wimpy only appeared in three shorts (aside from flashback-oriented stories) and others such as Eugene the Jeep never appeared at all. Popeye's role as an adventuring sailor was also reduced to a point where he was barely ever seen at sea or in the Navy other than in a few shorts mostly from the war period, as the majority of stories preferred to avoid doing more adventurous and fantastical stories and focus on Popeye's everyday life, his vacation hijinks or the ""love triangle"" setup."
"Popeye's portrayal in the animated adaptation (such as the theatrical cartoons and especially the Famous outings) has alternately been criticized for giving him a single means to solve all of life's problems (unlike in the older strips), or praised for bringing children to eat healthy. This reliance was most exaggerated in the short ""How Green Is My Spinach,"" which presented Popeye as being helpless without spinach (and portrayed other vegetables as ineffective), spoofing the cartoons's own formula but at the same time providing a rather questionable message."
"In the fifties, Popeye's cartoon catalog was sold by the Paramount studio to Associated Artists Productions for broadcast on television. Animated shows were also made for television in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s."
First television series.
"In 1960, the first ""Popeye the Sailor"" animated television series was produced for first-run syndication which proved successful. Like the earlier theatrical cartoon series, it would use many elements that were already well known, mostly the basic storyline of Popeye trying to keep his sweetheart Olive safe from the hands of other male suitors while using spinach to remain fit and healthy. Unlike the theatrical shorts however (especially the Famous Studios shorts), this TV series made a more prominent attempt to bring back characters and elements from ""Thimble Theatre"" back to Popeye's side, such as his old friend J. Wellington Wimpy, who had been considerably absent during the Famous era, and the show even included characters who never had the chance to appear in animation, such as Popeye's old lucky charm Bernice the Whiffle Hen and even Alice the Goon, King Blozo and Rough House (yet while bringing in more ""Thimble Theatre"" elements, very few episodes were a direct or accurate adaptations of the strips and had no real continuity between them). Notably, the only character that failed to return was Bluto himself, who was instead replaced by his lookalike/brother Brutus, due to King Features incorrectly thinking that the former was not originally a ""Thimble Theatre"" character. While the show did involve Popeye's love life, episodes actually focused more on his adventuring around the world (and beyond) not unlike the Fleischer and comic strip incarnation, and also brought back other ""Thimble Theatre"" antagonists rather than relying solely on Brutus, like the sinister Sea Hag and Toar the caveman, who proved to be a true challenge for Popeye. As in the final Fleischer cartoons and most Famous shorts, Popeye still wore his Navy uniform, an exception being the pilot episode ""Barbecue for Two"", where he did wear his original outfit."
"""The All-New Popeye Hour""."
"In 1978, Hanna-Barbera Productions, with King Features Syndicate, would produce a new ""Popeye"" television series, ""The All-New Popeye Hour"". Unlike the previous show, this series had higher-quality animation and was more akin to Segar's work and Fleischer cartoons than other Popeye animations, with Popeye more regularly seen as an adventurous sailor. Popeye's look was once again changed for this series, this time it was a permanent return to his classic outfit, however he still wore his Navy hat, making it something of a combination of both styles. The series also gave characters such as Alice the Goon more prominence, having her co-star with Olive in their own segment, ""Private Olive Oyl"". This show focused more on adventure than past animations: there were entirely new segments dedicated to sailing the seas and searching for adventure, as in ""Popeye's Treasure Hunt"". Popeye and the Sea Hag's relationship was also more accurate to the strips than the previous series, with the Hag wanting to marry Popeye, much to the latter's disgust. Oddly enough, Popeye's signature spinach can would have special effects on other characters, such as Olive and Swee'Pea, who would unusually turn into actual superheroes."
Popeye's first movie.
"In 1980, a theatrical live-action movie called ""Popeye"" was released, featuring an original story written by Jules Pfeiffer, directed by Robert Altman, and serving as a more faithful adaptation to Segar's ""Thimble Theatre."" It brought almost every friend of Popeye's to the silver screen, although it showed the well-known sailor (as whom Robin McLaurin Williams starred) as having an initial aversion to spinach, and the setting took place in a port town called Sweethaven, created on the island of Malta by Altman's set decorators. It eventually went on to gross $49,823,037; more than double the film's production budget."
Yes.
"And then,"
You save a lot.
Right.
"If, if, if, if,"
"and you need to be very careful,"
"if the loan is set up to have bi, they call it a yuppie loan, if it's set up for bimonthly payments."
Right.
"If you,"
because you'll save fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan.
Right.
"I'm sorry, seven to nine years off the end of the loan."
Right.
"And there are, there is a local firm that'll actually,"
"if, if,"
"like in my situation, I don't have that, because the loan was not available."
"I can have,"
this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee.
"So I can cut that much off the end of,"
but I'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year.
Oh really.
Yeah.
"But, uh, those are all great."
Uh-huh.
"The, the interesting thing, we're getting ready to have a house built"
Uh-huh.
"it's not, a lot of the firms that offer,"
"mortgage loan firms, aren't offering, um, that loan."
Uh-huh.
"You can ask and you can wheel and deal,"
but it's not as open as it should be.
Yeah.
"It, it just makes your skin more leathery."
and I think that is why.
"It, uh, it,"
Exactly.
yeah.
"So,"
"I think it burns off the,"
"I don't know the, the, the theory, the scientific principle."
"But it burns something off, the natural oils or something like that."
Uh-huh.
"Well, the elasticity of your skin, the collagen or whatever they call it."
They say it destroys a lot of that.
Yes.
And you lose a lot of that.
"So, uh,"
"Yes,"
"uh, that sounds like a good, that sounds like the right theory."
"Yeah,"
"but, uh, but we have really had nice,"
"the weather,"
I can't complain.
We have really had really good weather of late.
Good.
"And when it has rained, it it's been a good soaking rain"
"and, uh, it has just been a really nice Spring."
"Well, that is great."
"It has been, it has been very nice here too."
And I hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening
and I want them to have nice weather for their visit instead of driving around in the rain.
Oh.
"Oh, that is great."
How long will they be there?
one paycheck went into savings
"and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage,  and the food bills"
Right.
"and it,"
"and I was even able to, you know, to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty"
"and, you know. But my wife likes to spend."
"She enjoys,"
so that's fine
But a
"for savings , I'll have to look into that."
Yeah.
"that's, that's been our godsend, you know."
Huh-uh.
"We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, you know, where,"
"we also own our own house,"
Huh-uh.
"um, we had an ice storm up here,  recently, where it was I mean, it was horrible."
Yeah.
"I mean, half the city owned trees ."
One-third of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out.
"Oh, really, because of the heavy ice."
Yeah.
It broke the limbs.
Exactly.
Huh-uh.
"We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately,"
"but it cost us, you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down. I mean, just to take off what was broken."
Right.
"Plus, we went with a friend,"
"and they said you know,"
"and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money, even though insurance picked up some of it,  still, not all of it."
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
"Okay,"
so do you all keep a budget?
"No,"
we don't.
You don't?
"No,"
"I, I make so much money here at T I that, that we just spend it."
And we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck.
"It's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semi-conductor firm,"
you can just spend it well.
"Are you being smart,"
or are you serious?
I'm being facetious.
I'm being very comical.
"Uh, we have a budget, um that works well."
Uh-huh.
"I kind of look at it for more of a,"
"we have a financial, uh, analyst, a finance administrator, I guess, that, that, uh,"
"I guess the financial planners, the training now."
We've had it for about four years here.
Uh-huh.
"Got our businesses and, and, and our life in line, how to manage credit cards, how to put away, say for, you know, money markets and this kind of thing."
Yeah.
"And, there's some freebies out there are"
you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly bring home in some sort of savings account.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"That being money market, uh, bonds, , savings, uh, or just a liquid account which, which we do."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that."
It's a great idea.
"Hell, I'd love to cut ours in half,"
"but, uh"
Uh-huh.
man.
"And if you figure, get with a financial person."
Yeah.
"And you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan, if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment it'll make, uh,"
Uh-huh.
it has a magic with numbers.
"It, I, it'll shave almost, you know, X number of dollars off,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
we we've become aware of that.
"We have a, there's a loan officer through our church, too, that I think could help us better."
"You know, he does that full time with the bank, you know."
Uh-huh.
"And so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know, that, you know, we know are people of integrity."
So.
Sure.
"You know, that is another thing that, you know,"
we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time
"we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving, you know,"
"we're going to go to somebody that we know,"
"we're going to take someone with us older,"
and we didn't do any of those things.
Somebody you trust.
"You know, there are so many rip-off artists here in this town."
"It's, it's, uh, it's really a sin,"
it really is.
Yeah.
I got taken on some on firewood.
Do you know?
"No,"
"we can,"
"after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes, they'll get a little master recording  this."
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, can you tell me anything else about the house"
Are you working on it?
"I mean, do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation?"
Yeah.
"This entire neighborhood, everybody keeps the places up real nice."
Yeah.
"That's, that's nice."
"Yeah,"
"the town that I came from is, uh, is a, uh, older town,"
"it like,"
"the typical, the typical homes there are like, you know, early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds,"
Wow.
and I renovated a house there
and that was so much fun.
"I mean, there, if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old, you know, you're just nobody, practically"
"And that was really, that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline"
"and, uh, was considered typical for that area."
"So, uh, it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just, you know, a very square little box"
"and, you know, there's not a whole lot you can do with it."
"But, uh, anyway,"
Living in the city has some advantages.
Yeah.
That's true.
"If given the choice, I'm getting out."
"Oh, really."
"Well, I have lived in a small town for, you know,"
and they're pieces of junk.
I know.
"Still at it, hey."
"Yeah,"
"that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one."
Wow.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
"maybe they're getting better,"
"maybe they're starting to get a clue. Uh,"
"Well, they got a three year lead time."
It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so
"Yeah,"
that's just it.
"Technology that comes in right now is, is probably not going to be implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road."
"But, uh,"
The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time."
"And can you think of any other industry where in software they,"
"Uh,"
"if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail ."
Yeah.
"Or, uh, maybe I say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade."
Yeah.
"It,"
"uh, they keep up with it pretty quickly"
"and that's, that's a real good thing, I guess."
Yeah.
"Uh, I don't know."
"And the hardware, well, I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity"
and the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along.
"With,"
"I don't know,"
cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue
"but I think a lot of them are just, you know, they're negligent"
and they get happy about money
and they just want to sue you.
Yeah.
"Well, yeah."
"That's,"
"yeah,"
exactly.
"When you have like a Kindercare or something set up and when they get greedy or whatever, that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah."
"And that's just, you know,"
you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time
That's impossible.
"You know, you never know what they're going to get into."
I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare
and she takes her little girl with her
"and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire"
and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state
"And that's the people that are working there, you know."
"And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in, you know."
"Oh, that's horrible."
"Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same diaper."
Huh.
"You know, just awful things."
And so I don't know.
I don't have kids
but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody.
"I mean, you just don't know."
"we can't do that,"
we just can't do that.
And I'm going well how about this way?
"I, I want to do that,"
that was the plan here
Right.
So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.
A cradle for it.
"Yeah,"
so you can steady it
"and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?"
"Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw"
"but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that"
"Right,"
right.
and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.
"I said I'm not that steady,"
it's not going to happen.
Yeah.
So we built a cradle for it
"and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,"
by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about
Right.
"So,"
Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this?
"Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth."
You know
"Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log"
"and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"if you're looking at adding on you have,"
"Up here in Rochester, uh, we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution."
"I was a W F for several years,"
and it just never seems to improve.
"It, and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're twenty-eight or above."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
It's really a shame.
"Well, I, I've, this company that they bought, they ended up buying a very high payroll."
Oh.
"And, uh, the, you know, I thought I was making a good wage,"
"So, how do you feel about the metric system?"
"Oh, I like it."
"I, I, I have a foreign, actually I have more than one foreign automobile."
"And I, I, I find the, uh, I find the, the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters,"
I was trying to build a shed
and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches
"and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths, uh ..."
"Yeah,"
"and it's,"
I forget how many millimeters.
So you used the metric?
"Well, no."
"What we did was wind up using,"
"and you just go, you just go down"
"and, and you get out the, the, so many inches"
"and, and we just marked a little bit less than that, uh, which is somewhat awkward"
"but had it been millimeters, you could have done."
"I think what's interesting,"
"the way engineering people do is they,"
"they, in essence, have gotten around it by, by listing, uh, decimal inches."
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
Do are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that?
"Yeah,"
that's the exact opposite.
"We did all, put the roof up and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up."
We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work
"and that's it because you have, you know, get those joints to go together"
"and whatever you have to put in there to get the, to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that."
Yeah.
I we didn't know a thing about any of that
"and so,  It's, it looked very hard to do"
My wife wishes I hadn't done that.
"so,"
"we figured well just,"
I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional.
"So, we left it, left it to somebody who does it for a living."
"But,"
I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Yeah *should be 'b'
Probably so
"and I, we'd never done it"
so we just left it alone.
"But that's,"
"I guess, I'm only twenty-one"
"so I, my, my vast experience of home, home owner's knowledge is not very much."
"So it's just what I have to do, more or less, around the house, you know, for my parents"
so.
"Did you, you framed it in uh, on, on, you framed in new square footage"
"or was it stuff that was already, uh, enclosed?"
It was brand new.
Brand new .
We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house
"so it was,"
"and you knew how, you knew how to do the framing?"
"Uh, well my dad knew how to do most of it, you know."
but it's something like that.
"Yeah,"
years ago.
"They sort of move up to levels,"
"and, and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough,"
"and as it turns out, you know, they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that."
Oh.
So you can guess the rest of the plot.
"It actually, it's, it's really funny because they run through, you know, what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives."
"Oh, yeah."
And then defend it.
And that's pretty good actually.
"Well, I guess that's where the title comes from then."
Yeah.
And it's
you actually have to go up there
"and you have a, they have an attorney for, you know, attorney for you and attorney,"
"a defense and a prosecution,"
"and you know, the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level,"
"and the defense's job is to make sure that you, you do, you know."
"It's, uh, it's a neat little story actually."
"Yeah,"
it is.
"I was, I was, I went thinking it'll be okay, not great,"
and then I actually came away thinking it was really pretty good.
"So,"
"It's funny,"
"we've got a couple of movies out recently, GHOSTS and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, that have to do with, uh, after life, I guess."
Yeah.
"And it kind of makes you wonder,"
"I'm also, besides working at T I, I'm a graduate student at North Texas and working on master's in communication."
"It's the behavioral science part of communication,"
"Some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that."
Oh really?
I kind of like that system.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"That's, that's not a bad system."
"But I, I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit."
Yeah.
"But, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, I don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in."
Yeah.
Right.
And lawyers blow sand in their eyes.
exactly.
I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries.
"Right,"
exactly.
Insurance cases and things like that.
Yeah.
Where
"and, uh, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, uh, tugging of people's heart strings and, uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them  or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering"
Uh-huh
Exactly
exactly.
"So. In, I think, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government"
"but,"
Have you had that experience recently?
"Recently, I can't really say recently."
"But I think about, uh, about a year ago, uh, I bought a product from some company down at, uh, in Atlanta, Georgia."
"I believe it was one of these, uh, one of these, uh, mixers. These, like these juice machines"
"and, uh  the, uh, the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine, it looked, you know, perfectly okay"
"Oh, yeah."
"but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting  uh, after,"
Uh-huh.
"but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh likely to do it as if, uh, if you get something back for it. You know."
As likely to do it.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"And, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass on to the consumer, you know, it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card, you know, to get money or doing your banking."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"You know, if it's free, people will use it,"
"if it costs them something, then they're not as likely to use it."
"Yeah,"
exactly.
You know.
"But, uh, I know we had a problem down here with, uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the you know, the the drain sewer."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"And, uh, all that, because there was,"
"apparently a lot of people, you know, every time they change the oil,"
they just dump all the their old oil down there.
Uh-huh.
Now they're starting to recycle that stuff.
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, another thing I thought of, I guess, to recycle would be like clothes, because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other."
"And one way that we do it sort of in, in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops."
Yeah.
"And that way, you know, you don't get near enough as, as much as you bought it for,"
"but you, you got the use out of it"
"and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever, anyways, you can get a little bit of money for."
Yeah.
"And so that's something that I've never,"
Yeah.
"I suppose, uh, if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,"
I guess that's true.
"But, uh, I never had bad experience in that respect"
"Of course, you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents,"
"and they, you know,"
pretty good people
"Um. Well, the thing I really worry about is, uh, the sexual abuse cases you read about."
Uh-huh.
And I mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened.
Yeah.
I never really worry very much about it.
I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public
"so, I  never really worried too much about that being, uh, uh, the case with my boys."
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"Uh, I, you know, I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them"
but
Uh-huh.
"I don't think it's as common as, uh, the newspapers would make you believe"
Uh-huh.
And another thing is cost.
"Oh, yeah"
"I mean that,"
I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now
"and they finding, in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare."
Right.
Um.
"Well, in our case, we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were, uh, in school."
"And I'm really happy we did it, although it was very, very difficult."
And  I think it was the right thing to do
Um.
"and we were, uh, we just decided that we would do it"
"And, uh, when was it,"
"a couple weeks ago I was asked to go to, uh, jury duty"
"I, I wasn't selected"
"but, um, for some of our cases in particular we have, um, very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such."
Sure.
"And it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just, you know happen to be selected in our jury, to understand what we're talking about."
"Well, I do think that the cases like the, uh, oh, say something like Texaco versus Pennzoil,"
Uh-huh.
"or, or the Texaco Pennzoil problem, uh, is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand, and, really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved, should handle cases like that."
Uh-huh.
Right.
"Yeah,"
"you know, some I don't,"
"you always have the option,"
"now in criminal I guess you always have a jury,"
but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not.
"Oh, is that right?"
"Yeah,"
"and in some incidences I think they ought to, ought not to have a jury,"
Yeah.
um
"Okay,"
boy.
"Or, uh, or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury."
"Uh, I was only on one jury ever, so far in my life,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it really was a pretty trivial, case"
"and it seemed to me all the time I was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over the case that involved, oh, a couple thousand dollars I think, it was, it was really just, uh, uh, terrific waste of everybody's time and money."
Uh-huh.
Um.
"And it finally ended up that, uh, even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it, they settled the case."
Oh.
and that person would answer the question.
"It was just very informative and interesting,"
"and, uh, I was real impressed at how A B C handled, uh, translating, the war for children."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"I didn't see anything like that, although I did, uh,"
"I guess one thing that I found sort of interesting,"
"this is getting a little off the topic,"
"but there was a, a, a big push with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors to, to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children."
Uh-huh.
I thought that was a really unusual thing.
"And our local H E B stores here,"
"I don't know if it's H E B statewide or whatever,"
"but they have videos that, uh,"
"I don't know if they still have them,"
"but they were free rental, videos, that had something to do with the war."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, it was,"
with the children's aspect?
Right.
"It was something for children, that they, they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and, uh, getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing."
Uh-huh.
I suppose that is a valuable service.
"Again not having, uh, lived through another war, I don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of,"
or if that was a new concern with people.
"Well back during the Viet Nam conflict that no one will, will have the guts enough to call a real war"
Uh-huh.
"uh, the, that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal."
That's true.
That's true.
So I don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news.
"And spot in the probably more importantly, one that lasted short enough that, that people's interest didn't flag too badly."
"and particularly with, with back seat, uh, with some, where kids, were, were sitting in the back seat with seat belts on,"
"and they were thrown forward, into the front seat,"
"and there was enough stretching, the combination of stretching the spine to, uh, I mean, the serious injury, even though they were, they were still locked in the"
Right.
"they were forced to go,"
"so really if your sitting in the back seat, your better off not not to have your seat belt on, if it's just a seat belt."
Yeah.
"We have a van, that, uh, just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness"
"Well, tell me about your van."
Do you like it?
"I have an Arrow Star van,"
we really do.
"Uh, it's, it's a mini van,"
"we've had it,"
goodness in May will be five years
"and, uh, they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty."
And the transmission was replaced
"but they really are nifty, uh,"
"the mini van, it's"
"actually, we had a station wagon before,"
"and it's a foot or two shorter than a,"
we had a regular size station wagon
Uh-huh.
"and it really, uh,"
"we like it,"
"it, the"
interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks.
"Huh. The reason that we're thinking about something like that, we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida"
Uh-huh.
"and, like I said, I mean, we're not that old"
"but my husband works for the State,"
and after a certain amount of years you can retire.
"Otherwise there'd be, they'd get you someplace else."
Uh-huh.
"Looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. That, uh, there might have been a better place to draw the line"
"Uh, I guess you can, I guess you can say that a, a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight, uh, brought the cold war to an end."
"But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just, just in order to, uh, call the bully out and beat him."
And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war.
"They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line, beat them and they wouldn't come forward."
"And, uh  we were wrong"
"But I, uh, you know,"
"the, like I said, the more I hear about it, the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable."
"But the accumulative effect was to really get into a, a hopeless situation where,"
"and as you say, uh, going halfway was probably worse than, uh, committing, uh, committing to a completely and, uh, winning it, whatever that would mean."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I, I think we did, I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't, uh, we weren't prepared for,"
I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war.
Yeah
"Uh, I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war. I mean  they seemed like a valiant thing."
Yeah.
"You knew, you knew who was good."
You knew who was bad.
Yeah.
"And it was a, it was a traditional the traditional battle of, kind of good versus evil, if you, you know  whichever way it is."
"Well you're not,"
"But in, in the Vietnam war it seems like it was,"
"a, a, the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad"
"and and, uh, you know, the,"
"It's ambivalent,"
yeah.
"even,"
"it seems like even the people, you know,"
"had the South Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese and, of course, the Laotians"
and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved.
Uh-huh.
"I do belong to a, a large corporation"
"or my, that where I'm currently employed"
"and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've already mentioned is, is health insurance."
"I think through our health insurance that I can get better rates as a, through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large corporation"
Right.
"and that got to be somewhat expensive,"
"so I I think one of the benefits I, I see is the, uh, is the group, uh, group discount."
Yeah.
"Right,"
and especially if you have a family.
Yes.
Then I think it makes a big difference.
"Yes,"
"and that's, that's one thing I do have."
Yeah.
"If I didn't have a family, I don't think I would have, as, as a male or as a, as an individual of, in this stage of my life,"
"I don't think I would have insurance, uh, other,"
Right.
I don't think I would go through that expense.
One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours
"and in my previous job, I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work, uh, nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours"
"Oh, yeah."
"or I could do, uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, you know, three day weekend. And make, uh, make my job flexible in that case."
Right.
Could you change that as you felt like it
or did you have to do it the same every week?
"Well, basically, yeah"
"I had to do, that, uh, the same, uh, for about every quarter of the year."
"I mean uh, because I was in a, in a position of management I had responsibilities over people that, uh, I needed to make my schedule, uh, so that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management personnel,"
Uh-huh.
"so, so I, I think that, uh, that was a, that was an excellent benefit that I really enjoyed"
"I know they pay taxes,"
but they don't
Yeah.
"you know, they, they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year. Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, I'm going, like, I, I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am"
Uh-huh.
"and they work less, you know, less than I do."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, the only the only problem I see with term limitations, uh, is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in, with most governments is just so complex that there's a very you know, there, there is a learning curve and that, you know, you can't just send someone off to Washington and expect, you know, his first day to be an effective, uh, Congress person."
"Uh, I think, I think there really is a, there's a lot they need to learn, you know, when you get there."
"I think, I think that's true,"
"however, I think that's always been true."
Uh-huh.
"I mean, that's true of the Presidency, too,"
and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years.
"And, uh,"
Yeah
"but,"
"They,"
"I mean, there is a lot to learn,"
but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up.
I think two years is too short.
Uh-huh.
"I think it would have to be extended, uh, you know,"
a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms
"or you would increase the length of the, of each term of a Congressman."
"Uh, but maybe standardizing on, on a, a four year term for Congress Senate and the, the Presidency and then, uh, staggering them so that you don't,"
Uh-huh.
we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years.
"Uh, the other, the other thing that, uh, bothers me about our system is just that, uh, in, for, for, in, in, in Congress the amount of power any, any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there"
"so it's, you know, for, you know, uh,"
"so unless you have actual, you know, across the board uh, limitations, the, uh, you know, the idea of,"
"well, we're going to just, we're,"
"I'm, I'm just going to, you know, vote, vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work,"
"you know, it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time."
Uh-huh.
"I think, I think that that's true,"
"but then you have, you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency."
"I mean, the action isn't in West Virginia."
"I hate to tell the the senator from West Virginia this information,"
but it really doesn't
"the world does not revolve around West Virginia uh, as far as this country is concerned,"
"the world does revolve around D C, you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned, the national politics"
Uh-huh
"and the C I A is a, a very large, very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia,"
"yeah, you know,"
"it might only be two hour drive from here, but that's a two hour drive"
Yeah.
"and, uh, you know, it, it's a, I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that"
Uh-huh.
or is it the F B I.
"I don't remember,"
"but I think there's,"
"Well, I mean,"
"I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because, you know, officially they don't do, they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative."
"Yeah,"
that's officially.
Uh-huh.
"I mean, we all know that that's not necessarily true."
"But I, I think that there are, there are advantages to having seniority and, uh, or, not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years."
"I think there are, I mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain."
"Uh, again what, uh, how serious a person is according to, uh, uh, you know, what, what they want to get out of school, and, uh, I guess they'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home, if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home."
"Uh, let's see, uh,"
"now what was the question,"
"what, what's the criteria for picking a college?"
What advice would you give?
What advice.
"Oh, okay, uh,"
I guess one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus.
Yes.
"Uh, stay in a dormitory if you can."
"Go to classes,"
talk to faculty members and students.
"Yes,"
"and also, uh, depending on how, uh, uh, adjustable your child would be, or, or flexible, I guess it would be, uh,"
"if, if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the, they were unused to their, that, the way they run things,"
"I mean, the, the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges, I think."
The people are different
"and, uh, you have to be more flexible and more willing to, uh, uh, adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things."
"You know, you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to. Uh,"
"Yes,"
"I'm thinking what, what problems my children might have in that, uh,"
You think so
but I agree with you.
"Uh, let's see,"
what else.
"Uh, well, climate would be,"
"you know, you'd have to"
Uh-huh.
"you know, is somewhat,"
"if, uh, if it's something different than the one they're used to, I guess, uh,"
"if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time, not be in studying If you're in Florida or California. Uh,"
"I, I'd also advise them that, uh, if mom and dad paid for their college, that, uh, if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year, then they'd have to get a loan to continue."
Service is more of a problem.
"I find,"
"up here in the northeast, we have, uh, well we have these mail order companies like L L Bean"
"and, uh, they are famous for, I guess, having really top-notch service."
"They've got, uh"
Really.
"I mean I've, I've, I, I have friends and family who order from them because you can, you can literally, I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year, wear it for a year and a half,"
"and even after, like eighteen months of, you know, reasonably satisfactory use, they will accept it in any condition"
"and they will gladly, no questions asked, take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore."
"Uh, they'll, they'll actually do things like this."
"I mean they're really, they, they bend over backwards service wise for you."
"I've, uh I've found also a lot of companies nowadays, have, they have eight hundred numbers you can call."
That's really great.
"I guess if, if you call the any eight hundred number, uh, if, you, you can call up any eight hundred number directory assistance, and you can get, uh, the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies."
"And, um, actually I've tried that with a few companies lately."
"And they've, most of them have been pretty good,"
"but I, I was,"
"one reason why, I, like I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that, uh, if you buy through Bean or though,"
"uh, I guess Bean's, one of Bean's big competitors is Land's End out in, uh, I guess it's Wisconsin somewhere."
"They, they are, uh, they're very good about  uh,"
Huh.
like the customer is always right
"and you know, no matter how crabby you might be over the phone, they are very understanding"
"and, uh, they usually get, you know, they, they make things are, they make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise."
That's really good.
It use to be like that.
Uh-huh.
"But,"
I don't think most places are like that anymore.
"Well I think, I guess nowadays with the, uh, with the economy the way it is, I guess,"
"there was a, there was a story on the news tonight about how, because a lot of companies are, uh, you know,"
"things are getting rough out there,"
"The album produced three number 1 singles on the Hot Country Songs chart with ""Days Go By"", ""Making Memories of Us"" and ""Better Life"", as well as the number 2 hits ""You're My Better Half"" and ""Tonight I Wanna Cry"". The song ""Live to Love Another Day"" also peaked at number 48 on the country charts, even though it was not released as a single. The album also includes a cover of Elton John's ""Country Comfort"", which appeared on his 1970 album ""Tumbleweed Connection""."
"""Making Memories of Us"", written by Rodney Crowell, was originally recorded by Tracy Byrd on his 2003 album ""The Truth About Men"". It was also recorded by Crowell himself, along with his backing band The Notorious Cherry Bombs, on their 2004 self-titled album. Nine of the album's songs were written by Urban. Urban produced the tracks ""God's Been Good to Me"" and ""Live to Love Another Day"" himself, and then he co-produced the rest of the tracks with Dann Huff."
"""Country Comfort"" is a cover of a track from Elton John's ""Tumbleweed Connection""."
"The album has received positive reviews from Allmusic, BBC, ""Entertainment Weekly"", and ""Rolling Stone"". Three tracks from the album, ""Days Go By"", ""Making Memories of Us"", and ""Tonight I Want to Cry"" were included in an About.com ranking of Urban's top ten songs."
"""Be Here"" received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Album."
"The album was certified 4× Platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and remains as Urban's best-selling album to date, with sales of 3,639,000 copies in the United States, as of July 2009; it also reached number 8 on the Canadian album chart, number 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Albums chart and number 3 on the Billboard 200."

"""Air Baron"" challenges players to build an airline empire in the United States by amassing a plurality of market share and liquid assets."
"Players seek to gain ""dominance"" or ""control"" of hubs in order to amass market share. Dominance of a hub is gained by controlling the majority of associated domestic spokes; it carries a moderate income potential and market share gain. Control of a hub is gained by controlling ""all"" of the associated domestic spokes; it doubles the income potential and market share gain of dominance."
Any uncontrolled domestic spoke may be purchased at face value. Takeovers of controlled spokes require a higher fee and an opposed dice roll versus the controlling player. Several factors contribute both positively and negatively to each player's dice total.
"If, at the end of his turn, a player has a combined total of market share and cash equal to or greater than the victory margin, he wins."
"At the start of each round, one color-coded chit per player is placed in a cup. The chits are drawn sequentially to determine the current order of play. While the order of play in an individual round is generally unimportant, the interval between turns for a single player is a significant consideration."
"Starting cash is determined by die roll. To offset the advantage of first play, each player receives cumulatively more money during the initial turn."
"Every purchased spoke, plus all hubs, have a unique chit placed in a cup. At the start of every turn, the player randomly draws two chits, paying the owner appropriately. Chits are replaced at the end of each round."
"Beyond the primary domestic spokes, players can also purchase foreign spokes and jumbo jets. Foreign spokes benefit opposed takeovers at the associated hubs. Jumbo jets provide similar bonuses on the domestic spoke where deployed, or they can be held in reserve for later use in an opposed takeover. Additionally, spokes with jumbos pay double the usual rate."
"Normally players are limited to one purchase or takeover attempt per turn. However, players can declare a state of ""Fare Wars"" that allow an indefinite number of domestic takeover attempts provided:"
"While in Fare Wars, players receive an additional takeover dice roll bonus. Profits, however, are not earned while in Fare Wars. Since the state can only be entered or exited at the beginning of a player's turn, the randomized play order has a major impact on the potential for income loss."
"Several optional rules, including strikes, crashes, government loans, and bidding, are provided as part of an ""advanced version"". These rules may be added to the basic game collectively or individually as desired."

"Mediated communication is not as commonly used as face-to-face communication in the workplace, but there are different preferred media of communication for simple forms of coordination. E-mails and phone calls tend to be used for simple or complex coordination, but e-mails are also useful for retaining information and recording the exchange of information. In terms of communication solutions to certain situational factors, e-mails are used for recording the transfer of information and sending long, complex, and non-textual information, and phone calls and pagers are used for immediate communication. E-mails and phone calls are also used in knowledge sharing and information gathering. E-mails are rarely used to accomplish relationship goals, but they are used for conflict resolution. Individuals have a higher motivation to use cell-phone texting for weak-tie communication. The network effect has the most impact on e-mail, meaning that people tend to use e-mail more if their peers use it, too."
Email
"Electronic mail is digital mechanism for exchanging messages through internet or intranet communication platforms. The first message that was sent through a computer was on October 29, 1969. Raymond Tomlinson is known as the father of email, he was the first person who sent a message electronically. Email messages consist of three different components: message envelope, message header, and message body. There are also multiple benefits to using email. It is easy to use, free of charge, fast, and delivers information in a digital format. Email is one of the earliest and most basic resources on the internet and those many computers may not be able to access other internet services they are still usually able to exchange emails with machines on the internet. There are many reasons why using email is more suitable when it comes to the workforce. the first reason is because it is faster than a conventional mail so that usually reaches its destination and minutes even when it's sent from different countries. Another reason why an email is more conventional is because of the fact that there is less physical efforts .while using email you don't have to worry about buying stamps or envelopes or taking a trip to the post office. Also the use of email helps in the financial state because once you have gotten the hardware and software together it is basically free from there on. Email messaging also helps when having to send the same message to multiple people because of the fact that it allows you to send the same information simultaneously."
Text message
"A text message is defined as a short message sent electronically usually from one cellphone to another. The first text message was sent in December 3, 1992. The engineer that discovered text messaging was named Matti Makkonen. Along with the development of text messaging came a new development of dialogue when texting. As I stated in while texting people tend to exaggerate how they usually talk. An example of this or shown in blank where somebody may state that ""this homework is so hard I'm going to kill myself!!"" This dialogue is normal and texting but not entirely appropriate and other scenarios. Another thing that texting changed was a person's grammar or writing style. In it showed that 75% of friends noted that their best friends grammar or writing styles. Though only 25% of acquaintances noticed that their friends grammar or writing styles had changed. The evolution of texting is evolving and its uses it is not only being used to communicate with friends and family but it is also spreading to the workforce. According to in Zambia they are finding the results of HIV testing faster due to mobile phone texting. The turnaround time for results notifying went from health facilities reporting the results in 44.2 days pre-implementation to 26.7 days post inflammation due to texting. They developed a customized software built to deliver the test results automatically and directly from the processing laboratory to the health facilities of sample origin via short text message service text."

"Miles & More is the largest traveller loyalty programme in Europe with 25 million members as of March 2014. It offers rewards to passengers of the Star Alliance travelling on certain types of tickets. The programme was launched by Lufthansa (LH) in 1993 and has about 40 airline partners, including the 28 airlines of the Star Alliance. The programme enables its members to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles on all of the fully integrated airlines, all Star Alliance members as well as several other partner airlines. Furthermore, there are more than 270 non-aviation companies affiliated with the programme. These include partners from the hotel, car rental & cruise industries, subscriptions & books, banks & insurance, telecommunications & electronics industries as well as shopping & lifestyle. Customers are able to build status, which gives them access to certain privileges. Miles & More is free of charge."
The following airlines are partners of the Miles & More program:
There are two types of miles within the programme.
"These are miles that can be collected in the account of a member and be used to buy flights, upgrades, merchandise from the Lufthansa WorldShop and other Miles & More partners. For standard Miles & More members they retain validity for 36 months, after which they expire. (Miles are not extended by having any activity on the account as with most other airlines). For Frequent Travellers, Senators and HON Circle Card holders, the miles have no expiration date. However, as soon as a customer does not hold any of these cards any more, the expiration date of all miles is set to 36 months counting from loss of frequent flyer status. For Miles & More Credit Card (Visa or MasterCard) holders issued in several countries, miles have no expiration date as long as the card is held and/or used. If the credit card contract is ended, the original expiry date of the miles is reinstated; although the earliest miles can expire is at the end of the quarter after the credit card contract is ended."
"Status miles can only be earned when flying on the fully integrated partner airlines or on Star Alliance members. There is no other way to earn these miles. In addition, status miles expire at the end of each calendar year. They are used to identify the frequent flyers and members that are able to qualify for a higher status on the basis of the status miles that they have collected in one year."
"Select benefits are advantages that can be earned in addition to the status benefits, as part of the programme called Miles & More Selections while the status is still valid. Once the member has reached specified mileage levels by flying, additional advantages can be selected. With every mileage level reached the range of select benefits increases. The selection of the select benefits varies from the status the member has. The select benefits for Frequent Travellers e.g. include business lounge vouchers, e-vouchers or mile exchange, the ones for Senators a Hilton Gold Membership, in addition. For HON circle members additional benefits such as coupons up to a value of 100 Euro as well as additional Senator partner cards are available."
"HON Circle miles can only be earned when flying in business or first class on the fully integrated partner airlines and Air-Rail trains in Germany (up to a total of 600,000 miles within two consecutive calendar years). They are necessary to attain the top-tier status on Miles & More – HON Circle. Until April 1, 2006 it was possible to also collect this type of mile on United Airlines. This option no longer exists. HON-miles have to be accumulated within two calendar years. Only Senators with an account balance of more than 300,000 status miles over two years, and existing HON Circle members, can see these miles on their account statement. HON Circle qualifying miles balance is also visible to Frequent Traveller and Senator members when logged in their Lufthansa iPad or Android app."
"The miles that a member receives after having completed a flight depend on the Airline issuing ticket, mileage flown, the class of service and the booking class."
"Tables show the number of miles earned with Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and SWISS. The number of miles earned with other airlines can be calculated using the Mileage Calculator available at the Miles & More website."

= = = Nanosheet = = =
A nanosheet is a two-dimensional nanostructure with thickness in a scale ranging from 1 to 100 nm.
"A typical example of a nanosheet is graphene, the thinnest two-dimensional material (0.34 nm) in the world. It consists of a single layer of carbon atoms with hexagonal lattices."
Silicon nanosheets are being used to prototype future generations of small (5 nm) transistors.
Carbon nanosheets (from hemp) may be an alternative to graphene as electrodes in supercapacitors.
"The most commonly used nanosheet synthesis methods use a bottom-up approach, e.g., pre-organization and polymerization at interfaces like Langmuir–Blodgett films, solution phase synthesis and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For example, CdTe (cadmium telluride) nanosheets could be synthesized by precipitating and aging CdTe nanoparticles in deionized water. The formation of free-floating CdTe nanosheets was due to directional hydrophobic attraction and anisotropic electrostatic interactions caused by dipole moment and small positive charges. Molecular simulations through a coarse-grained model with parameters from semi-empirical quantum mechanics calculations can be used to prove the experimental process."
"Ultrathin single-crystal PbS (lead sulfur) sheets with micro scale in x-, y- dimensions can be obtained using a hot colloidal synthesis method. Compounds with linear chloroalkanes like 1,2-dichloroethane containing chlorine were used during the formation of PbS sheets. PbS ultrathin sheets probably resulted from the oriented attachment of the PbS nanoparticles in a two-dimensional fashion. The highly reactive facets were preferentially consumed in the growth process that led to the sheet-like PbS crystal growth."
"Nanosheets can also be prepared at room temperature. For instance, hexagonal PbO (lead oxide)) nanosheets were synthesized using gold nanoparticles as seeds under room temperature. The size of the PbO nanosheet can be tuned by gold NPs and concentration in the growth solution. No organic surfactants were employed in the synthesis process. Oriented attachment, in which the sheets form by aggregation of small nanoparticles that each has a net dipole moment, and ostwald ripening are the two main reasons for the formation of the PbO nanosheets. The same process was observed for iron sulfide nanoparticles."
Carbon nanosheets have been produced using industrial hemp bast fibres with a technique that involves heating the fibres at over 350F (180C) for 24 hours. The result is then subjected to intense heat causing the fibers to exfoliate into a carbon nanosheet. This has been used to create an electrode for a supercapacitor with electrochemical qualities ‘on a par with’ devices made using graphene.
"Metal nanosheets have also been synthesized from solution-based method by reducing metal precursors, including palladium, rhodium, and gold."

"The waving of the hand is a nonverbal gesture that has an unclear origin but is said to have dated back to as far as the 18th century however, it was not called waving and was not used as saying ""hello"", or ""goodbye."" The original gesture of waving was saluting. In the 18th century, knights removed the guard of their helmets to show their identity, following with a salute to show they come in peace; saluting is also used to show others that they are not armed with weapons and do not pose a threat. The action of saluting was formalised only in the 1780s by European armies, and since then, it has become a common way of properly addressing one another in the military setting. There is also an alternate ASL origin. In the 1800s, waving handkerchiefs was a way to show approval or excitement or to call attention for the deaf, and the Romans, which is known as the ""Chautauqua salute."" It is recorded during a Canadian event in 1884 that multiple attendees forgot their handkerchief and so waved their hands in the air as a way to clap during the event.. In modern days, the accepted and common way for a deaf individual to applaud is raising hands in the air and simultaneously shaking their open hand and moving their fingers back and forth."
"Waving ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" to the deaf requires a different protocol and has an alternate meaning than the standard, one action waving gesture that means both ""hello"" or ""goodbye."" For an ASL user or a deaf individual, saying ""goodbye"" is done by repeatedly opening and closing the right hand, and it faces the receiver of the gesture. This method is used to say ""goodbye"" to a group of people; saying ""goodbye"" to an individual is done with a different method. Saying ""hello"" is done by the traditional waving of the right hand. This method is used to say ""hello"" to a group of people, likewise with implying ""goodbye"", there is a different method to say ""hello"" to an individual."
"The waving of the hand has multiple variables and styles of performing the gesture. The common waving of the hand to mean ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" is done by moving the hand side to side, but there are more than one form of waving, each form having its own meaning."
"Waving has four variables: the open palm (is the palm curved or straight), the angle of the wave (big waves or short waves), the elevation of the hand (above the head or held low), and the movement pattern of the wave (sideways rotation, up and down motion, side to side motion)."
"There are different ways to wave the hand; some include the standard side-to-side wave, palm wide wave, wiggly wave (finger wiggle wave), ""flirtatious"" wave, open-and close finger wave, arm wave, and the ""Miss America"" wave."
"People wave by raising their hand and moving it from side to side. Another common wave is to raise one's hand and repeatedly move the fingers downward toward the palm. A variant known as the wiggly wave consists of holding the hand near shoulder level and wiggling the fingers randomly. This can be used to appear cute or flirtatious to the target of the wave. The gesture can be used to attract attention at a distance. Most commonly, though, the gesture means quite simply ""hello"" or ""goodbye"
"The royal wave, also known as a regal wave, pageant wave, parade wave, or Miss America wave, is a similar but distinct kind of hand waving gesture in which a person executes something alternatively described as either a 'plastic grin' with 'fingers cupped' and 'forearm swaying side-to-side' or a ""vertical hand with a slight twist from the wrist"". The gesture is often performed, to various degrees, by different members of the British royal family, signaling anything from regality, class and control to elegance, restraint and character."
"In American culture, waving is a known gesture that means ""hello"" or ""goodbye"". That gesture can also be used to call the attention of someone, for example waving down a taxi, or waving at a friend from a great distance. That gesture can may be interpreted differently and have a different meaning or even be highly offensive in South Korea, Europe, Nigeria, Greece, Bulgaria, Latin American countries, India, Japan, and other places.<ref name=""book/web ref""></ref>"
"In Nigeria, waving the hand with the palm facing outward in front of someone's face is highly offensive and should be avoided."
"In China, women greet other women by waving."
"In Japan, hand waving while the palm is kept outward and near the face is a gesture used to display confusion or that the individual waving does not know or understand."
"In South Korea, it is inappropriate to call the attention of someone with a palm-up arm wave. Instead, the proper way to wave to someone or call for attention is to wave vertically, making sure the palm of the hand is in a downward position. It is not uncommon to see waving among the younger population (in South Korea) to display their departure rather than bowing, which is the traditional way of greeting one another. Waving the hand outward towards the face is also used to grab the attention of a pet or child."
"In Europe, there are two different common forms of waving: the palm-show and the palm-hide. The palm-show is dominant across most of Europe, but Italy predominantly uses the palm-hide wave."
"Waving the hand to say ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" is done by moving the fingers down towards the wrist and back to an open palm position while keeping the palm facing out. Another way to say ""goodbye"" is done by wagging the fingers. That motion (wagging fingers) is also used to say ""no."""
"In Greece, waving the hand with the palm facing out is an insult, rather than a greeting."
"Holding the hand out, palm facing out and all five fingers exposed is offensive and dates back to the Byzantine times, when ""moutza"" would involve prisoners' faces being tainted with charcoal by their own hands and being forced to parade down town streets, ""moutza"". In American culture, holding the hand out like that can be used to call someone's attention or to greet someone."
"In Ireland, the deaf use the hand wave to greet one another. Deaf women use an ""open palms up half moon shape"" type of wave to greet one another. Men, however, use a different way of greeting one another or women."
"In Latin American countries, people greet one another by kissing, hugging or shaking hands. Waving their hand is uncommon, but it neither has any negative representation nor causes offense."
"In Nicaragua, waving to someone is tolerated but does not display proper etiquette. Instead, it is common to hug, kiss, or shake hands, following with the proper time of day (""good morning,"" ""good afternoon,"" or ""good evening"")."

6. Zhōnggǔ:
"If one just knows that one should not sever ties with others but does not know how to weigh others to give evenly, then there is no danger of becoming an egoist, but on the other hand those who follow the Way and strive to perfect themselves will also be seen as approaching egoism and consequently one will not dare act in like manner."
"If one understands that one should not sacrifice oneself for others but cannot give to others on an individual basis, then there is no danger of loving indiscriminately, but on the other hand those who follow the Way and strive to perfect the whole Empire will also be seen as approaching indiscriminate love and consequently one will not be willing to act in like manner."

"One may say that I plan to escape from Yang Zi. However, Yang Zi saw himself and not others, while Zi Mo saw a fixed position not an open passage. In essence, all these are but parochial teachings. Really, can those who know how to adapt to myriad changes be like this?"
"One may say that I plan to escape from Mo Zi. However, Mo Zi saw others and not himself, while Zi Mo saw tracks and not transformations. In essence all these are but one-sided delusions. Really, can those who respond to eternal inconstancy be like this?"
8. Shùgû:
"The point is, egoism is one extreme, and indiscriminate love is another extreme. That is why it is easy to understand that Yang Zi and Mo Zi each held on to an extreme."
"The middle is not an extreme: but if one holds on to the middle without applying the proper measure, then this is also an extreme. That is why it is difficult to understand that Zi Mo was holding on to an extreme."

"There are two types of printing and publishing related to the eight-legged essay, one for the exams themselves and the other for public purposes. After the test-takers finished with their exams, their papers were collected in the testing room and sent over to be graded. They were then printed with the graders' comments and in the order of the score rank. During the late Ming Dynasty, commercial publishing also increased in the face of increasing commercialization of culture. The public printing, publishing, and dissemination of the essays prompted more people to be interested candidates of the civil service examination during the Ming and Qing dynasties."
"One virtue of the eight-legged essays is that its composition is well defined and easy to follow. For the purpose of administering a large group of exam-takers, this structure allowed convenient regulation as the exam-takers were not likely to deviate from the requirements. Thus, this format contributed to ensuring standard and fairness in the civil service examination system. The examiners could reduce the amount of time spent in grading exams by being accustomed to this format, and uncertainties in the grading schemes were reduced. A scholar named Tian Qilin defended the eight-legged essay by arguing that it embodies the complex Chinese cultural and literary tradition."
"As early as the 17th century, the form's adoption was blamed for the decline of classical poetry and prose during the Ming Dynasty. The critic Wu Qiao wrote that ""people exhausted themselves on the eight-legged essay, and poetry was only composed with their spare energy."" Writing at the same time, the political theorist and philosopher Huang Zongxi echoed these sentiments. Also, the essay did not allow for any personal opinion and was completely impartial. As a result, it led to the gradual narrowing of people's innovative thinking and consequently their minds, thus achieving a constraining effect on Chinese people and the nation. The eight-legged essay has been associated with the ""petrification in Chinese literature"" and ""China's cultural stagnation and economic backwardness."""

"The Wright Model B was an early pusher biplane designed by the Wright brothers in the United States in 1910. It was the first of their designs to be built in quantity. Unlike the Model A, it featured a true elevator carried at the tail rather than at the front. It was the last Wright model to have an open-frame tail. The Model B was a dedicated two-seater with the pilot and a passenger sitting side-by-side on the leading edge of the lower wing."
"Besides their civil market, the Wrights were able to sell aircraft to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps (S.C. 3, 4, and 5) and to the United States Navy as hydroplanes (AH-4, -5-, and -6), in which services they were used as trainers. Furthermore, the Wrights were able to sell licenses to produce the aircraft domestically (to the Burgess Company and Curtis, which designated it Model F), as well as in Germany. The deal with Burgess was the first license-production of aircraft undertaken in the United States and most of the approximately one hundred Model Bs produced were actually built by Burgess. A modified Model B, redesignated Model EX (for Exhibition) achieved fame as the ""Vin Fiz Flyer"", the first aircraft to cross the United States. Burgess also planned a refined version as the Model G, but this was never built."
At least three original Model Bs were extant in 2007.

"The Breeze is an independent local radio station broadcasting to the Southampton, Portsmouth, Winchester and Four Marks areas of Hampshire, England. It is owned by Nation Broadcasting and is part of The Breeze network of stations (the remainder owned by Bauer Radio). The station has a 'contemporary easy listening' format, playing classic and recent melodic popular music aimed principally at listeners over 40."
"The station operates on three FM frequencies; the three were previously separate stations centred on each of the broadcast areas, which have over time combined into a single regional service. The station is also available online."
"The station launched under its current identity and format on 4 July 2010; it has operated under various owners, formats and identities previously, with the three services having launched independently of each other in 1999 as a series of local stations each focused on a specified broadcast area. All programming is now identical across the three licence areas."
"The Breeze is based at Roman Landing in the Kingsway area of Southampton, sharing facilities with another Nation Broadcasting-owned station in the region, Sam FM."
The 107.8 FM service launched under the name SouthCity FM on 5 September 1999.
"In 2004, the licence was acquired by Southampton Football Club, who renamed the station as The Saint, effectively making it an FM version of their existing club station of the same name (which was broadcasting on digital TV and online). The service was at this point based at studios within Southampton FC's ground, St Mary's Stadium."
"On 26 July 2007, Southampton FC confirmed it had sold the station to South Wales-based radio group Town & Country Broadcasting - a firm headed by lifelong Southampton FC fan Jason Bryant (formerly of Talksport and Virgin Radio). The sale led to a rebranding of the station as 107.8 Radio Hampshire from 6 August 2007. As Radio Hampshire, the station combined adult contemporary music with information and breaking news from Southampton FC; match coverage also continued, and the station continued to be operated from the studio at St. Mary's."

"""Missulena bradleyi,"" also known as the eastern mouse spider, is a species of spider belonging to the family Actinopodidae. The spider is endemic to the eastern coast of Australia."
"William Joseph Rainbow described the eastern mouse spider in 1914 from a specimen collected in North Sydney by Henry Horton Burton Bradley (1845–1918), president of the board of trustees of the Australian Museum at the time. Describing the ""beautiful and strikingly marked"" specimen as a ""decided novelty"", Rainbow named it in honour of its collector, whom he stated was the first collector of Australian spiders."
"Eastern mouse spiders are often mistaken for Australian funnel-web spiders. The females are large and very strong, with powerful chelicerae. Their fangs often cross over slightly, while those of Australian funnel-web spiders remain parallel, and the latter often have a drop of venom on their fang tips and have longer spinnerets."
"The male, which has an all-black carapace and a pale bluish area on top of the abdomen, roams around in autumn and early winter looking for a mate. They sometimes fall into swimming pools when wandering. Cases of envenomations have peaked during this period."
The burrow can be found by brushing away loose soil in an area where they live until a flap of silk indicative of the entrance is found.
"Common symptoms of eastern mouse spider bites are numbness and tingling at the bite site, sweating (diaphoresis), headache, and nausea generally. Although it appears to be the most dangerous member of the genus, serious envenomations by this species are relatively rare. Most bites documented in the medical literature did not require use of antivenom or involve serious symptoms. Their venom has been found to have toxins similar to the robustoxin found in Australian funnel-web spider venom, and Australian funnel-web spider antivenom has been found to be effective in treating severe mouse spider bites. Compared to the Australian funnel-web spider, however, the eastern mouse spider is far less aggressive towards humans, and may often give ""dry"" bites."

"Garde Church (, sometimes also Garda Church) is a medieval church in Garde on the Swedish island of Gotland. Built in stages during the Middle Ages, it retains much of its medieval character. It contains medieval frescos, some of which were probably executed by artists from present-day Russia. It lies in the Diocese of Visby."
"The remains of an early stave church were discovered at the site of the presently visible church during an excavation in 1968. In the vicinity, Christian graves from the Viking Age have also been discovered, still containing the clothes of the deceased. A number of picture stones, pre-dating Christian times, have also been uncovered in the church, where they were used by the earliest builders as building material."
"The first stone church was begun in the 1130s, remains of which are still preserved in the nave of the church, including a few still usable, carved stone benches, and the base of the tower. The tower was heightened during the 13th century to its present altitude. The choir is the most recent part of the church. It is from the second quarter of the 14th century and replaced an earlier, Romanesque choir with an apse. The construction of the new choir was planned as the first step in a major rebuilding scheme; however for one reason or another, the builders seem to have run out of funds and the rest of the plans were never executed - hence the somewhat unusual shape of the church. A similar fate is not uncommon for churches on Gotland, as the region suffered an economic downturn at the end of the Middle Ages."
"The church retains much of the ambience of the earliest churches on Gotland: it is rather dark, the windows are small, the ceiling is flat and wooden, and the portals narrow."
"One of the most distinguishing features of the interior are a number of wall paintings or frescos. They depict two saints and were probably executed by a Russian artist (possibly from Staraja Ladoga) as they are Russo-Byzantine in style. The church also has a baptismal font made by the anonymous sculptor Byzantios sometime during the middle of the 12th century, and a triumphal cross made in the 13th century.

= = = La Haine (drama) = = =
"La Haine ""(Hatred)"" is a drama in five acts and eight tableaux by Victorien Sardou, premiered at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in Paris on 3 December 1874. Jacques Offenbach, director of the theatre, composed extensive incidental music for chorus and orchestra to accompany the play."
"Offenbach had composed songs and incidental music for eleven classical and modern dramas for the Comédie Française in the early 1850s, gaining valuable experience in writing for the theatre. Sardou and Offenbach created their first joint work in 1872 with the opéra-bouffe-féerie ""Le Roi Carotte"", which ran for 195 performances, and this encouraged the two to renew their collaboration."
"By 1874, Jacques Offenbach had become the director of the Théâtre de la Gaîté. To follow a revival of ""Orphée aux Enfers"" on 7 February, he decided to mount Sardou's drame using the under-used theatrical troupe at the theatre."
"""Orphée aux Enfers"" closed on the 18 November to allow the rehearsals for ""La Haine"" to start, directed by Sardou himself who did not spare his efforts. ""Le Figaro"" reported that ""Sardou is the most meticulous director in the world"" and that he ""places particular importance on the extras being actively involved as much as any of the actors."" Rehearsals increased and the dress rehearsal took place on 27 November."
"The premiere was announced for the 29 November, but was postponed on the day itself, due to the flu epidemic in the capital which indisposed two principal actors, Lafontaine et Clément Just. First of all it was postponed until 30 November but only took place on Thursday 3 December, but as the actors had not completely recovered, Sardou cut the final scene."
"The premiere audience marvelled at the magnificence of the production. The scenery was especially dazzling. Francisque Sarcey noted ""It is only right to recognize that, of the décors, several are masterpieces of exquisite taste; the cathedral dome is a marvel of lightness and grave; the inside of the church is superb."""
"Everything was done to dazzle : dramatist and composer went so far as to transport a Cavaillé-Coll organ into the theatre. The settings were grand and impressive: the stage accommodated 535 persons.: ""The war-cries of the soldiers, the moans of the terrified women, the clanking of armour, the booming of guns, the conquerors' entrance in the city, the sacking of the palace, all was of an exact and admirable motion."""
"The words of Victorien Sardou were also noted, but critics commented that the direction was rather against the drama. Francisque Sarcey regretted that the principal roles appeared crushed : ""The supernumeraries and props are too prominent. The crowd is the principal character. Tableaux follow tableaux, and in this new work, they are equally dark."""
"For Auguste Vitu the play evoked painful memories of 1870 : ""Streets full of bodies, palaces in flames, the homeland forsaken in the presence of the dumbfounded foreigner, and as if scandalized by so many distractions, such are the unforgettable sights which our consciousness is still soured, and of which our hearts still bleed. The widows and orphans in black, I have seen them bowed in our churches, the air rent with their sobs. The door of deathly memory re-opens wide within us; and sadness envelops us with its great black wings."""
"While receipts came to around 8,000 francs per performance in mid-December, they fell to around 5,000 francs during the second fortnight On 28 December ""Le Figaro"" printed a letter from Sardou requesting that Offenbach recall his piece from the stage; Offenbach replied that as the public prefer lively art he would bring back ""Orphée"". The announcement had the effect of filling the theatre for the last performances of ""La Haine"". After 27 performances the play closed on 29 December 1874 and ""Orphée aux Enfers"" was brought back. The short run left the theatre in a parlous financial position. Some costumes were used in the revised version of ""Geneviève de Brabant"" which opened on 25 February 1875."
"Despite the failure, Sardou and Offenbach did contemplate a further collaboration on a spectacular production of the playwright's ""Don Quichotte""."
"A modern performance with reduced text but complete score took place on 19 July 2009 at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc Roussillon, with Fanny Ardant and Gérard Depardieu playing Cordelia and Orso. The concert was broadcast on France Musique on 30 July 2009."

In 2006 the autograph orchestral score of the incidental music was found in the archive of the Offenbach family.
Some early sketches preserved in the Archives Historiques de la ville de Cologne were destroyed in an accident on 3 March 2009.
"Jean-Christophe Keck, responsible for the 2009 critical edition, commented that ""Offenbach composed a rich score of 30 numbers. The first sketches were noted down while travelling in his barouche where he had set up a work-table - the manuscripts bear witness to the jumping pen as it rode over Parisian cobbles. It consists of many mélodrames, off-stage choruses, interludes...""."
"During Offenbach's tour of the USA, he conducted with much success the Marche religieuse from ""La Haine"" for American audiences."
"Keck notes that just before he died, Offenbach recalled the opening of the overture to ""La Haine"" in the opening bars of the finale of the Venetian act from ""Contes d'Hoffmann""."
"The action takes place in Siena in 1369. Historically, the Republic of Siena has passed through much civil unrest and political upheavals at that period, and in general Siena tended to be Ghibelline, in opposition to Florence's Guelph position. The play's specific events and its main characters are, however, fictional."

"Sisenand (Spanish, Galician, and Portuguese: ""Sisenando""; ) ( 605 – 12 March 636) was a Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 631 to 636."
"Sisenand was the governor of Septimania, when the nobles revolted against the Visigothic king, Suintila, over the latter's confiscations of lands and distribution of privileges between the nobility and clergy. Sisenand joined the rebellion and overthrew Suintila with the aid of Dagobert I, King of the Franks, to whom Gothic nobles offered a plate of pure gold in return, weighing 500 pounds. The plate was allegedly a gift that Aetius, a Roman general, gave to Thorismund, then king of the Visigoths, in 451. After successfully overthrowing Suintila and capturing Zaragoza on 26 March 631, Sisenand proclaimed himself king. The victory of Sisenand also represented the triumph of the nobility over the common people, although the greatest beneficiary was the clergy, who took advantage of the weariness of the other contenders to enhance their own influence."
"Upon assuming the throne, he had Suintila, the previous king, declared a tyrant for his many crimes, iniquity, and accumulation of wealth at the expense of the poor; he also removed all taxes on the clergy."
"Between 632 and 633, there was apparently an attempted uprising within the kingdom, led by Iudila, only attested to by two coins from Mérida and Granada bearing the inscription IUDILA REX.. The revolution failed, and Iudila was later killed."
"In order to obtain ecclesiastical conformity, on 8 December 633, Sisenand convoked the IV Council of Toledo, which drew up civil and ecclesiastical laws within the Visigothic kingdom, including the death penalty, excommunication, and condemnation to perpetual perdition for those rebelling against the king. Similar penalties were approved for those who wished to dispense with such law of choice. However, the council did not concede any hereditary right to the king; the next king would be elected by the bishops and magnates from one of their own."
Sisenand died a natural death in the city of Toledo on 12 March 636. Chintila was chosen by the bishops to succeed him.

"The album art for the American release was the red question mark on black background, while the UK, European, Argentine, and Oceanian releases featured the Benny Hill art. The Oceanian double disc edition also had a ""Limited Edition 2CD Set"" sticker, as in other markets the bonus disc was not limited. In Europe only a single disc edition was released. For this, the first five tracks off the second disc were simply added to the end of the compilation."
"The album was originally called 'Who Cared a Lot?'. It had a different order of tracks and a different cover, but only saw release as a promo."
= = = Jukung = = =
"A jukung or kano, also known as cadik is a small wooden Indonesian outrigger canoe. It is a traditional fishing boat, but newer uses include ""Jukung Dives"", using the boat as a vehicle for small groups of SCUBA divers."
"The double outrigger jukung is but one of many types of Austronesian outrigger canoes that use the crab claw sail traditional throughout Polynesia. Whilst this sail presents some difficulties in tacking into the wind, actually requiring to jibe around, a jukung is superb in its reaching ability and jibe-safe running. They are usually highly decorated and bear a marlin-like prow."
"People in Kalimantan also named their boat Jukung. It is used for transport in daily activities such as going to the office, to school, or shopping in pasar terapung (The Floating Market, a very famous tourist attraction)."
"Currently there is a modern version of jukung made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe in Indonesia. Advertised as unsinkable, the main body is made of a closed HDPE pipe that contains sealed air as the source of its buoyancy."
"In the late 1980s there was a seafaring journey of over 1000 nautical miles in open outrigger ‘jukung’ canoes by nine crews, who sailed from Bali to Darwin across the Timor Sea. Crews were from New Zealand, Australia, USA, England, Japan, France, Germany, The Netherlands and Indonesia. This was a three-month expedition masterminded by Bob Hobmann, filmed and made into a documentary called ""Passage out of Paradise""; it was featured by the National Geographic Society as ""The Great Jukung Race"". It was the first ever expedition of this kind, following purported austronesian sailing routes in craft dating 7,000 years old."
"The expedition started in Bali, where once crews were familiar with sailing their Jukungs they embarked on a two-month adventure following the ancient sailing routes (1,000 yrs BC), along the eastern Islands via Komodo Island. They completed the journey with a treacherous 5 day sail across the Arafura Sea to Darwin, via the Tiwi Islands."
"Challenges experienced were storms requiring numerous boat repairs, waterspouts, excessive exposure to sun, heat, or rain, adverse currents & whirlpools. Hazards included drifting onto war-torn Timor, unpredictable behaviour/welcome from remote villagers, salt water boils, wound infections, malnutrition, near misses with night-time freighters, sightings of sperm whales and giant white sharks. Some sailors were viciously attacked by hornets while preparing to leave a remote beach camp. The crews rebelled & unanimously decided to sail as a group, as opposed to racing the final leg of the journey, for safety."
"As a result, all sailors miraculously survived a cyclone >110 km/hr winds in their tiny (6 ft long, 50 cm wide) primitive bamboo/rope jukungs, although the Australian crew was lost for 2 days, located by the Australian coastguard, with a smashed jukung washed up on an island."
"Originally released as a bootable CD-ROM called MeshAP based on the OpenAP open source software, the system is now implemented as system image which can fit within a small 32MB CompactFlash card. The system functions have expanded beyond creating wireless networks to provide set-top box services, MP3 audio and video streaming, connection to remote windows terminal servers, other PCs, web browsing, connection to peer-to-peer networks, instant messaging and file exchange."

= = = Project Boreas = = =
"Project Boreas was a study conducted between 2003 and 2006 by the British Interplanetary Society to design a station on the Planum Boreum at the Martian North Pole. The project was international, involving over 25 scientists and engineers, co-ordinated by Charles S. Cockell. Pole Station was designed to operate for three summers and two polar winters. Amongst a diversity of scientific objectives the station occupants were to retrieve a deep core from within the Martian polar ice cap and search for water and habitable conditions deep in the polar ice cap. Expeditions were planned to numerous locations across the Martian north polar cap, including the Chasma Boreale and the polar layered terrains. The study involved wide-ranging investigations of the scientific priorities for a human presence at the Martian polar ice caps through to detailed architectural and design studies for the station. Studies were undertaken on mobility and communications and psycho-social issues for long-term operation at the Martian polar station."
"Project Boreas was named for the Greek god of the North Wind. Concepts for polar bases had been discussed in earlier papers The station was designed with the assumption that it would be occupied by 10 people. Although the station could be constructed at any time, the study used a timeframe of 2037 to 2042 to provide a backdrop for the design. It is likely that in the coming decades robots will explore the Martian polar caps, which were first observed by Italian astronomer, Giovanni Cassini in 1666. Project Boreas considered long-term human polar exploration on Mars."
"The crew of the station were envisaged to carry out diverse scientific studies in geology, geophysics, climatology and astrobiology. One particular advantage of humans was perceived to be their ability to run a laboratory in which complex and analytical tasks can be undertaken in polar science and exploration. The design study considered that the retrieval of a core into the polar ice cap would be one of the primary objectives of Pole Station. The core would be used to study past geological and climatological changes, including dating past Martian dust storms. The core would also be used to investigate the nature of the polar layered terrains. It would be used to study whether the ice caps contained a record of organics on Mars, to search for habitats in the ice and to study questions on the past and present habitability of Martian polar ices. The occupants also had diverse climatology objectives to undertake. The study considered Martian polar astronomy to be a potentially useful additional activity for the station crew members."
During the 1173 sol-stay on the Martian surface the crew would carry out a number of expeditions across the polar ice cap. Expeditions to the Chasma Boreale and along the polar spiral valleys were considered in detail. The study also considered the possibility of exploratory mid-winter expeditions across the polar ice cap. These expeditions would be supported by pressurised and unpressurised rovers. Trafficability issues of trans-polar expeditions were considered.
"The study carried out a trade off analysis of power, thermal control and other parameters to provide a basis for the architectural design. The station would be constructed from six linked modules of 3.5 m diameter with a smaller cache module. The modules included a galley area, science and human factors laboratories, EVA preparation area and personal quarters. The station would have a ‘garden’ area to provide some fresh food and for psychological relief. The station would be supported by nuclear power and a hybrid physico-chemical and biological life support system. Provision for in-situ resource use (ISRU) from the Martian polar regions was studied, particular emphasis being placed on the availability of water from the polar ices. The station would support a separate small drilling encampment nearby and would be surrounded by radiative panels which would sublime the 2 m of carbon dioxide snow estimated to fall at Pole Station during the winter, allowing for year-round operations."
"Project Boreas considered the use of bioinspired robots to support Pole Station. ‘Arctic fox’, ‘Arctic hare’, ‘snow bunting’ (a flying robot) and ‘lemmings’ would support science and exploration objectives from Pole Station by enabling remotely controlled data collection at many spatial scales either from the rovers or from the station. The design study investigated communications for Pole Station and satellite requirements for sustaining base to field communications. The unique psycho-social issues associated with the long and permanently dark Martian polar winter were addressed. Medical requirements for long-term operation at the Martian polar ice caps were investigated in addition to the nutrition requirements, which were used to constrain the life support system design."
"The Project Boreas report was shortlisted for the 2007 Sir Arthur Clarke Award in the category of ""Best Written Presentation""."

= = = Achala Sachdev = = =
"Achala Sachdev (3 May 1920 – 30 April 2012) was an Indian film actress who appeared in classic films of Bollywood. She was from Peshawar who started her career as a child actor. She later became known for mother and grandmother roles in Hindi films. Her most memorable roles were as Balraj Sahni's wife in the 1965 film ""Waqt"" and Kajol's grandmother in ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (1995)."
Achala Sachdev was born on 3 May 1920 in Peshawar.
"Achala worked for All India Radio, Lahore before the partition of India, and then at Delhi All India Radio. Achala made her film debut with ""Fashionable Wife"" (1938), and acted in over 130 Hindi films. She has acted in many Yash Raj Films, starting with Yash Chopra's first production """" (1973) and films such as ""Chandni"" (1989) and ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (1995). Her other noted films were ""Prem Pujari"", ""Mera Naam Joker"", ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" and ""Andaz"", apart from acting in English films such as the Mark Robson's ""Nine Hours to Rama"" (1963) and Merchant Ivory's ""The Householder"" (1963). However, her most noted role remains as Balraj Sahani's wife in ""Waqt"" (1965), wherein the hit song ""Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen"" was picturised on her."
"Achala became a resident of Pune after marrying Clifford Douglas Peters, who had a factory in Pune's Bhosari industrial estate, named Morris Electronics, producing small electronics parts such as diodes. The factory was later sold to the Piramal Group. In an almost filmy turn, Sachdev was introduced to Peters by Yash Chopra on the sets of a film in Mumbai. Peter's first wife had died by then and Sachdev herself was a divorcee. They married. Peters, a mechanical engineer, had a factory in Bhosari and the couple lived in a bungalow in the same area for some time before shifting to Hadapsar. After Peters died, Achala lived alone. Five years before her death, she gave away her flat in Pune to the Janseva Foundation, a charitable organization, on the condition that they should take care of her as long as she lived."
"In September 2011, Achala slipped and fell in her kitchen. She sustained a fracture in her leg. After that, she was diagnosed with multiple embolisms in her brain. This resulted in total paralysis and the loss of her vision. She was survived by son Jyotin."

"Critical friend has its origins in critical pedagogy education reforms in the 1970s and arose out of the self-appraisal activity which is attributed to Desmond Nuttall. One of the most widely used definitions is from 1993,"
"Andrew Hutchinson, a public sector consultant, introduced the term to the Local Government Consortium at the University of Warwick in 1998 and it is cited in several papers produced by Professor Jean Hartley of the Local Government Consortium. The critical friend is characterised as falling between the extremes of the ""hostile witness"" and the ""uncritical lover"" whereas earlier texts go so far as to allude to Janus in discussing the concept."
"This dichotomy appealed to Hutchinson who frequently used the term while leader of the South East Midlands Citizen's Charter Quality Network run by the Cabinet Office in Whitehall. In his time running the network he came into regular contact with fellow Lancastrian and Government Minister Peter Kilfoyle MP, Public Service Minister who was responsible for the running of the networks as minister. When Kilfoyle found himself increasingly distanced from the policy agenda of Prime Minister Tony Blair and he chose to resign from Government, Hansard quotes him as saying that he wished to return to the back benches but remain a ""critical friend"" of the Government."
"He was misquoted in the ""Daily Telegraph"" as they claimed that he had said that he wished to be a ""candid friend"" to Government. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the term critical friend has its origins in the softer sounding notion of the candid friend. Nonetheless following the resignation of Peter Kilfoyle ""The Guardian"" newspaper (a popular publication amongst the intelligentsia and public sector middle management) began to popularise the term which is increasingly entering into general usage. The phrase is still most commonly used in education circles but its wider use in the public sector can to a large part be attributed to Andrew Hutchinson and his natural enthusiasm for the concept, being described as 'a natural critical friend acting with positive intent' in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of Coventry City Council, Iain Roxburgh, who is now Director of the Warwick Research Consortium. While a variety of useful and interesting quotations are to be found on the web perhaps the reason for the popularity of the phrase is best summed up by the following quotation,"
= = = Tamil historical novels = = =
Tamil historical novels are a genre of Tamil literature that began to appear in the mid-19th century.
"Prathaapa Mudaliaar Charithram (""The Life of Prathaapa Mudaliaar""), written in 1857 and published in 1879, was the first novel in the Tamil language. The novel does not involve historical characters or events but is set in royal times. Penned by Maayuram Vedanaayakam Pillai, it was a landmark in Tamil literature, which had hitherto seen writings only in poetry. The book gave birth to a new literary genre and Tamil prose began to be recognized as an increasingly important part of the language. One can see the style of any Tamil author in this novel."
"Aabathukidamaana Apavaadham -or- Kamalaambaal Charithram is written by Rajam Iyer from Vathalakundu in the later part of the 19th century is the first Tamil novel depicting the life of living people. The author worked in Tamil daily Dinamani; he live just 26 years. Considering the period in which he lived and wrote, he created waves in emancipation of women's life, incomparable to any social reformist. In this story he conducted marriage to a Brahmin widow. Had he lived further and wrote more, the style of modern Tamil prose would have been different."
"Authors like Kalki Krishnamurthy, Akilan wrote historical novels during the Indian independence movement to instil patriotic pride in the people. Most historical novels were serialised in Tamil magazines before being published in book form. The advent of netzines has seen new web based historical writers entering the arena."
"= = = Bateman, Saskatchewan = = ="
"Bateman is an organized hamlet in the southwest region of Saskatchewan, Canada, north of the Red Coat Trail. It was named after Jim Bateman, the first settler to come to the area with his family in 1908."
"Bateman was once a prosperous community, which had a peak population of more than 300 citizens in the late 1920s. In 2000, the last resident left, and many of the remaining buildings were torn down by the government of Saskatchewan."
"Upon arrival in 1908, Jim Bateman took possession of a quarter section of land on the banks of Notukeu Creek. Then in 1911, Bateman would open a post office. His daughter Lydia was sworn in as the post mistress and drove up to St. Boswells, northwest of Bateman with her father to pick up the community's first mail bag."
"During its pioneer and times of great prosperity, Bateman would have over 300 residents during the late 1920s. Bateman was also a focal point for small family grain farmers in the region. The community once boasted four grain elevators, a bank, a theatre, restaurants, two gas stations, two churches, three grocery stores, skating and curling rink, and two implement businesses. The community even had its own power plant and street light system."
"Bateman once had a school that covered grades K–12, but closed due to the consolidation of schools. In 1966, Bateman lost its grade 12 classes, and a few years after that the school would again lose grades 10 and 11, to the neighbouring town of Gravelbourg, leaving only grade nine for the high-school level, eventually being moved there as well, leaving just the elementary classes. In 1996, Bateman's school finally closed for good."
Today the once impressive brick school has been demolished due to the poor condition the building was in. All that remains of the former school is the foundation and a commemorative sign.

"The video clip for the song was one of the first ever videos screened on MTV. In a documentary for Radio New Zealand, Neil Finn expressed surprise at the song's success, stating that it ""hasn't got a proper chorus""."
"After Split Enz's dissolution in 1984, singer Neil Finn continued to perform ""One Step Ahead"" with his next group Crowded House, in particular, the group performed the song live at their 1987 concert in Daytona known as ""Spring Break '87""."
"The single's b-side ""In the Wars"" was recorded in the ""Waiata"" recording sessions, however was not originally released as a track on the album, though was later appended as track twelve in the album's 2006 re-release."
"""One Step Ahead"" has been covered by numerous artists, most notably Amiel and The Like (whose version was unavailable to Australasian markets until 2007 when it became available on iTunes)."

"Sunland Park Racetrack & Casino is a racino located in Sunland Park, New Mexico, a suburb of El Paso, Texas."
"Opened in 1959 as a Thoroughbred racing track, Sunland Park was the only legalized gambling venue in the region for many years. In 1999, at a time when horse racing was experiencing a decline as casinos and lotteries became commonplace, New Mexico legislators allowed slot machines at the track. Now with over 700 machines in play, racing at Sunland has benefited greatly, with purses increasing from a $35,000 daily average in the early 1990s to nearly a quarter million per day today."
"Sunland Park was the track where jockeys Jerry Bailey, Pat Valenzuela, and Cash Asmussen got their starts. Bill Shoemaker, who hails from the area, also rode at Sunland."
"The casino, open 112 hours a week, also offers many electronic table games including roulette, blackjack and Texas Hold 'Em."
"The 2018 racing season, which features both Thoroughbreds and Quarter Horses, runs from December 28 through May 5. Live racing is traditionally offered four days each week on Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Year-round Simulcast wagering is also available on racetracks across the country."
"The live racing season is highlighted by the Sunland Derby, run at 1⅛ miles for three-year-olds in late March of each year. The race was granted a Grade 3 status for the 2010 running and now is an important preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby. The race is now included in the Road to the Kentucky Derby; awarding 50 points to the winner, 20 to second, 10 to third, and 5 to forth. The 50 points awarded the winner effectively guarantees entrance into the Kentucky Derby."
"Other notable races include the $200,000 Sunland Park Oaks, 1-1/16 miles Kentucky Oaks prep for fillies; the $100,000 Harry W. Henson Handicap for fillies and mares at one mile; the $100,000 Riley Allison Derby, 6½ furlongs for three-year-olds; the $100,000 Mine That Bird Derby, 1 1/16-mile prep for the Sunland Derby; and the $150,000 Sunland Park Handicap for three-year-olds and up at 1⅛ miles."

= = = 457 visa = = =
"In Australia, the 457 visa was the most common visa for Australian or overseas employers to sponsor skilled overseas workers to work temporarily in Australia. It has been abolished since 18 March 2018 by Turnbull government and replaced by another visa category. The full title of this subclass of visa was Temporary Business (Long Stay) and was introduced soon after John Howard became Prime Minister in 1996. The title of the visa was changed to Temporary Work (Skilled) (Subclass 457) visa on 24 November 2012. Applications were processed by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP). On 18 April 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that the 457 visas will be replaced with two new visa categories."
"Holders of a 457 visa may be employed for a period of up to four years and may bring any eligible family members, including same-sex partners, who have unrestricted work and study rights in Australia. ""If your sponsor is a start-up business or has traded in Australia for less than 12 months, then the visa will be granted for 18 months."" Holders of the subclass 457 visa have no limit on the number of times they travel in and out of Australia."
"Employers must be approved by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection as an approved sponsor. Primary subclass 457 visa holders are restricted to working for their sponsor and may not work (or volunteer) for any other organisation (other than associated entities as defined by the Corporations Act). In order to change employer and sponsor, the ""new employer"" must be or become an approved 457 sponsor and then lodge a 457 nomination. Once the nomination is approved, the employer obligations will shift to the new employer and the visa applicant is restricted to working for it. There is no need to apply for a new 457 visa within the validity of the visa."
"Employees must also meet minimum levels of skill and English language requirements, in addition to character and health requirements. Some trades occupations and passport holders from certain countries may be required to do a skills assessment (see the TRA website)."
It is common for 457 visa holders to apply for a permanent Australia residents visa with a view to permanently settle in Australia and become Australian citizens.
A 457 visa holder can only work in a nominated occupation for the sponsor employer. Medical practitioners and general managers must work in their nominated occupation but they can work for employers other than their sponsor or an associated entity of their sponsor. The specific occupations to which this rule applies are listed in Exemption from the requirement to work directly for the sponsor. The worker must also not have ceased employment for more than 60 consecutive days.
"The Australian Government reviewed the 457 skilled immigrant visa and made some provisions to quicken the transition to permanent residency starting on 1 July 2012. From that date, non-resident workers on the 457 skilled immigration visa are able to transition to permanent residency if they have two years with the employer who has sponsored them and if the employer provides a full-time position in the 457 visa holder's nominated occupation."
"Furthermore, the Australian government has recognised that 457 visas deserve priority in review as they are highly responsive to the needs of the market. Overseas workers will be able to work in Australia on a six-month short term work visa before they apply for a 457 visa."
"As at 30 June 2016, the size of the subclass 457 programme was 94,890 Primary visa holders in Australia."
"An audit by the Fair Work Ombudsman conducted between Sept 2013 and June 2014 found that 40% of 457 visa holders were no longer employed by a sponsor or were being paid well below the statutory minimum wage of $53,900."
"In October 2014, the Abbott government announced that it would make it easier for businesses to apply for 457 visa workers by relaxing rules for English language competency to broaden the pool of potential workers from overseas."
"With the commencement of the Japan free trade agreement in 2015, employers no longer need to offer jobs to locals or to prove that none could fill vacancies before Japanese nationals eligible for 457 visas are employed."
"In December 2014, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection released recommendations to relax 457 visa requirements. The recommendations include extending the six month short term work visa to 12 months with no obligation to apply for a 457 visa. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) has criticized this change on the grounds that it avoids the 457 visa's requirement for English language and skills tests and employers would not be required to demonstrate they had first tried to fill job vacancies with Australian workers."
"On 18 April 2017, Malcolm Turnbull announced his intention to replace the 457 visas with 2 new categories (short term and medium term) of visas."
"One of the replacement was Temporary Skill Shortage visa, or known as 482 Visa. It allows immigration It requires candidates to obtain an IELTS (English Language) exam band score of 5 or higher, or other method of showing the English level."

= = = Bamboozle (quiz) = = =
"Bamboozle! was a quiz game featured on Channel 4 Teletext in the United Kingdom. It was originally part of Teletext's ""Fun & Games"" category, though the rest of the category had been discontinued for some years before Bamboozle! ended (due to the general discontinuation of all Teletext news and editorial content in December 2009). The last edition, themed around 'Ends and Lasts', appeared on Monday 14 December 2009. The Boozler 'family' appeared one last time on Tuesday 15 December 2009 saying farewell to the Teletext audience."
"On 9 August 2010 Bamboozle! was given a new home by Teletext on the iPhone complete with all the retro graphics. On 11 July 2019, Teletext Holidays launched a version of the Bamboozle quiz on their 404 error page."
"Bamboozle! was originally intended as a real-time game that could be played in conjunction with a broadcast TV programme using a similar multiple choice format as ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"". The decision by the new broadcast teletext franchise holders (Teletext UK) in 1993 to opt for X.25 packet switching meant that it was impossible to adequately synchronise the broadcast of teletext content in the context of a TV programme. The format thus fell back to the form it had operated in largely unchanged since 1994."
"The game used Fastext keys (different coloured buttons on the TV remote control) to select the desired answer from a choice of four, and was ""presented"" by virtual host Bamber Boozler, who derived his name from the word ""bamboozle"" and the name of University Challenge host, Bamber Gascoigne. Bamber Boozler's appearance was constrained by the limitations of the Level 1 World System Teletext alpha mosaic display format. From 1993–2005, Teletext competitions editor Julian Edwards created the quiz ""Bamber Boozler"" and the character ""Bamber Boozler"". In later years, journalists Charlie Ghagan and, latterly, Roger Wilkinson oversaw the quiz. Roger Wilkinson also provides content for the Teletext iPhone app."
"A new set of questions was originally given each week, but this soon became more regular, eventually becoming daily. Each game originally had 25 questions, later reduced to 20, then 15 and eventually 12. The player was required to answer all questions correctly in order to complete the quiz, but was allowed multiple attempts to do so. Initially, if a question was answered incorrectly, the player would have to start again from Question 1, However this was later amended so that a maximum of three questions would need to be answered again. After completing the quiz, there was a score table with themed responses, for example:"
according to how many questions were answered correctly at the first attempt.
"On particular dates the quiz was themed, for example Halloween featured related questions and images of skeletons and spiders, whilst Guy Fawkes Night featured firework based questions, as well as numerous Christmas based versions. There were also special ""name the picture / person"" graphical editions."
"Other Boozler family members were introduced over the game's first few years – Bamber's wife, Bambette, who normally appeared when a question was answered incorrectly; while Saturday's quizzes were generally easier than the weekday editions and were presented by Bamber's son, Buster, with Bambette's role filled by Bonnie, his daughter. At one point in the quiz's history the red, yellow and green keys were sensible answers and the blue was mostly reserved for a comical response although rarely was the correct one. This was later changed and all the keys would have sensible answers."
"The quiz started off at 20 questions, then it went down to 15 and then 12. On very few special occasions it was 30, however one question wrong and contestants had to start from the very beginning."
"The ""Bad Luck"" pages appeared when questions were answered incorrectly, they used to feature little trivial messages at first and then mainly birthday announcements. This was scrapped to introduce ""Bambette's Bonus"" (or Bonnie's Bonus in Junior Bamboozle) where contestants could score again with a question from her.

"The makers of ""Bamboozle!"" introduced a weekly competition whereby a viewer could contribute the questions to Bamboozle! As well as having their questions used, names mentioned and their image appear on screen (the viewer could supply a photograph, which was converted to a Teletext-style cartoon); the winning contributors also received a £20 WHSmith gift voucher. Even before this, viewer-submitted questions were readily used in various forms ever since the early days of the quiz."
"Back in the early days of ""Bamboozle!"", on a number of occasions the quiz would be put on hold and in its place was an adventure game (a different one each time), based on the popular children's fantasy programme ""Knightmare"". Viewers had to use the fastext keys to navigate their way through the quest."
"""Ten to One"", was a sports version of ""Bamboozle!"" with the host Brian Boozler. The quiz was so called because it presented ten sports questions and players had to get from the ten down to one. It is a double meaning as Ten to One also relates to bookies popular odds on betting in many sports."
"This quiz ran concurrently with Bamboozle! for sometime until late 1998 where Brian said ""I'm putting down the mic for a bit, I'm back in 1999..."", however it never returned. He was however, during the period that the quiz was ""rested"", a guest quizmaster on Bamboozle! asking the contestants sports questions like before, with Bamber saying at the end ""Thanks Brian... check your score below!""."
"""Junior Bamboozle!"" was a version run on Saturdays for children. It was hosted by Buster Boozler and the bad luck pages were hosted by Bonnie Boozler."

"Mike and Ike is a brand of fruit-flavored candies that were first introduced in 1940 by the company Just Born, Inc. The origin of the candy's name remains unknown, but there are many conjectures. Mike and Ikes were originally all fruit flavored but now come in several different varieties which have been introduced over the years."
"The Mike and Ike brand was first introduced in 1940 by Just Born, Inc., which is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Its origin uncertain, the name may have come from the comic strip Mike and Ike (They Look Alike), which, however, had ended by the 1940s. Or the name may have referred to the Matina Brothers, two of whom, nicknamed ""Mike"" & ""Ike,"" were billed as circus midgets and had roles as Munchkins in the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz""; the author Dean Jensen wrote without cited evidence that the two became so popular in America that a boxed candy was named after them. . Other proposals include a company-wide contest, a vaudeville song titled “Mike and Ike”, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose nickname was ""Ike."" Just Born acquired the ""Rodda Candy Company"" in 1953 and produced new flavors of the candy, such as cotton candy. Additional flavors such as Root Beer came in the 1960s, and others have been introduced on and off since."
"Mike and Ike are oblong fruit-flavored chewy candies that come in several colors and varieties, including cherry, orange, lime, lemon, and strawberry. Popular varieties are Tropical Typhoon, Berry Blast and Jolly Joes. Each candy has 7 calories, 0 grams of fat, and approximately 1 gram of sugar. The candy is kosher and gluten-free."
"They are similar to Hot Tamales, another candy introduced by the same manufacturer in 1950, though they are not spicy."
"Just Born produces several varieties of Mike and Ikes, including:"
Retro/limited varieties include:
There are also seasonal packages for Easter in which the Mike and Ike flavors are formed as jelly beans.

= = = Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources = = =
Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources is a 1983 biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad by Martin Lings.
"The book provides a new account of the sira or the life of Muhammad, with details that had not been elaborated in other accounts. It is based primarily on old Arab sources that go back to the 9th century, of which some passages are translated for the first time. It is not contradictory to other accounts but rather offers new insights and new details. The book also includes excerpts from original English translations of speeches by men and women who lived close to Muhammad, heard him speak, witnessed his actions, witnessed the way he interacted with situations and witnessed events he encountered throughout various stages of his life."
"References used are Ibn Ishaq (references here are to Ferdinand Wüstenfeld's edition of Sirat Rasul Allah, a life of the Prophet by Muhammad ibn Ishaq in the annotated recension of Ibn Hisham). Also Ibn Sa’ad (the references are to John Leyden's edition of Kitab al-Tabaqat al Kabir by Muhammad ibn Sa’d). Also there is Al-Waqidi (and the references are to Marsden Jones' edition of Kitab al Maghazi, A Chronicle of the Prophet's Campaigns, by Muhammad ibn Umar al- Waqidi)."
"It is a narrative of the history of Arabia and the birth and the life of Muhammad. The biography consists of 85 short chapters, some as short as just two pages in length. Each chapter deals with an important event in the history of Islam and provides chronological context for the advent of the religion, as well as detailed information about Muhammad."
"The biography has gone through many reprints in English and it has been translated and published into many languages including French, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Dutch, Malay and Tamil."
"A distinctive element of the biography is the vivid, approachable narrative style, which is fast moving and flows fluently. The book reads more like a novel and was written in a style, which is easily readable, comprehensible and it uses language, which reflects both simplicity and grandeur."
"Lings uses a more archaic style of English to depict conversations and translations of the Qur'an, which helps slows down the rapid flow of the narration. The focus in the book is less about the teachings of Islam and more about Muhammad."
"In 1991, a second revised edition of the book with 22 additional pages was published, containing additional details pertaining to Muhammad's endeavours as well as accounts covering the spread of Islam into Syria and its neighbouring states surrounding the Arabian Peninsula."
"Before Lings died in 2005, a newly revised edition of the book with 22 additional pages was published, which included final updates made on the text and incorporated into its contents, containing extra details pertaining to Muhammad's endeavors as well as accounts covering the spread of Islam into Syria and its neighboring states surrounding the Arabian Peninsula."
"Hamza Yusuf hails this work as ""one of the great biographies of the English language"", praising ""the historical accuracy of the text and the providential care so evident in the author's choice of versions as well as the underlying structure of the story as he chose to tell it."" He also reports from Lings how while writing this book, ""he was overwhelmed with the presence of the Prophet during the entire time and felt a great blessing in having been able to complete it.""."
"""The Spectator"" described the book as ""an enthralling story that combines impeccable scholarship with a rare sense of the sacred worthy of his subject."" ""The Islamic Quarterly"" called the book ""a true work of art, as enthralling as the best novels with the difference that this is not fiction but fact."""
"""The Times"" said ""this work is widely recognized as the most readable account of the life of the Prophet to date."" ""Parabola"" stated that ""for those interested in Islam in one way or another, it is mesmerizing."""
"Upon its first edition, the book was subject to criticism by some Muslims who decried the ""Perennialist poison"" in the book. The author gave public answer in a Saudi newspaper to the objections."
"In 1983, the book was selected as the best biography of Muhammad in English at the National Seerat Conference in Islamabad. This book was also given an award by the government of Pakistan."
"In 1990, after the book had attracted the attention of Azhar University, Lings received a decoration from Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak."

= = = 7-demicubic honeycomb = = =
"The 7-demicubic honeycomb, or demihepteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 7-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 7-cubic honeycomb."
"It is composed of two different types of facets. The 7-cubes become alternated into 7-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 7-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,4} facets."
"The vertex arrangement of the 7-demicubic honeycomb is the D lattice. The 84 vertices of the rectified 7-orthoplex vertex figure of the ""7-demicubic honeycomb"" reflect the kissing number 84 of this lattice. The best known is 126, from the E lattice and the 3 honeycomb."
"The D packing (also called D) can be constructed by the union of two ""D lattices"". The D packings form lattices only in even dimensions. The kissing number is 2=64 (2 for n<8, 240 for n=8, and 2n(n-1) for n>8)."
"The D lattice (also called D and C) can be constructed by the union of all four 7-demicubic lattices: It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions."
"The kissing number of the D lattice is 14 (""2n"" for n≥5) and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadritruncated 7-cubic honeycomb, , containing all with tritruncated 7-orthoplex, Voronoi cells."
There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of different colors on the 128 7-demicube facets around each vertex.
= = = Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy = = =
"Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy or Majjari Narasimha Reddy (24 November 1806 – 2 February 1847) was an Indian freedom fighter. Son of a former Telugu Palegaadu Mallareddy and Seethamma, Narasimha Reddy was born in Rupanagudi village, Uyyalawada Mandal, Kurnool district. He and his commander-in-chief ""Vadde Obanna"" were at the heart of the rebellion against British in 1846, where 5,000 peasants rose up against the British East India Company in Kurnool district, Rayalaseema Region of Andhra Pradesh. They were protesting against the changes introduced by the British to the traditional agrarian system in the first half of the nineteenth century. Which included the introduction of the ryotwari system and other attempts to maximize revenue through exploiting lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished."
"The father of Narasimha Reddy was related to the Polygar (jagirdarr) family of Uyyalawada in Koilkuntla taluk who had married two daughters of the Polygar of Nossam. He had three sons, of whom Narasimha was the youngest. His first wife was Siddamma."
"The EIC's introduction to the Madras Presidency of the 1803 Permanent Settlement, which had first been enacted in Bengal Presidency ten years previously, replaced the agrarian socio-economic status quo with a more egalitarian arrangement where anyone could cultivate provided that they paid a fixed sum to the EIC for the privilege of doing so."
"The Polygars and other higher-status people who preferred the old agrarian system ""represented the decadent social order"", were in many cases ""upstarts"" and ""were also the heirs of a social system in which various orders of Hindu society were integrated through ages"". These people were dispossessed of their lands, which were then redistributed, but the primary purpose of the changes was to increase production rather than to restructure the social order. In some cases, it coincided with a punishment because among the dispossessed were those who had recently been involved in fighting the EIC in the Polygar Wars. Some received pensions in lieu of the lost lands but at inconsistent rates."
"The changes, which included the introduction of the ryotwari system and other attempts to maximise revenue, deprived village headmen and other higher-status people of their role as revenue collectors and position as landholders, while also impacting on lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished. The population came to the view that the British were taking their wealth and that those who were dependent on the traditional system no longer had a means of making a living. As the old order collapsed into disarray, the once-authoritative Polygars, including Narasimha Reddy, became the focus of attention from sufferers, whose pleas fell on deaf British ears. The Polygars saw a chance to mobilize peasant opposition both for genuine social reasons."
"Narasimha Reddy's own objections too was based on their outcomes. Compared to the Polygar of Nossam, the pension awarded to his family upon their dispossession was paltry and the authorities refused to increase it by redistributing some of the Nossam monies when that latter family became extinct in 1821. At the same time, some of his relatives were facing proposals for further reductions in their land rights, including by a reform of the village policing system."
"Things came to a head 1846 when the British authorities assumed land rights previously held by various people who had died in the villages of Goodladurty, Koilkuntla and Nossum. Encouraged by the discontent of others, Reddy became the figurehead for an uprising."
"An armed group, initially comprising those dispossessed of inam lands around Koilkuntla, was led by Reddy's Right-hand man Vadde Obanna in July 1846. The Acting Collector for the area Lord Cochrane, believed that Reddy had material support from fellow pensioners in Hyderabad and Kurnool, whose land rights had also been appropriated. The group soon attracted support from the peasantry and was reported by British authorities to have rampaged in Koilkuntla, looting the treasury there and evading the police before killing several officers at Mittapally. They also plundered Rudravaram before moving to an area near to Almore, pursued by the British military forces who then surrounded them."
"A battle between Obanna's 5000-strong band and a much smaller British contingent then took place, with around 200 of the rebels being killed and others captured before they were able to break out in the direction of Kotakota, Giddalur where Reddy's family were situated. Having collected his family, he and the rest of the rebels moved into the Nallamala Hills. The British offered incentives for information regarding the rebels, who were again surrounded amidst reports that unrest was now growing in other villages of the area. In a further skirmish between the rebels and the British, who had sent for reinforcements, 40–50 rebels were killed and 90 were captured, including Reddy. Although there was no evidence of Obanna's capture, he most possibly was also a captive along with his leader."
"Warrants were issued for the arrest of nearly 1,000 of the rebels, of which 412 were released without charge. A further 273 were bailed and 112 were convicted. Reddy, too, was convicted and in his case received the death penalty. On 22 February 1847, he was executed in Koilkuntla in front of a silent crowd of over 2000 people."
British kept his head on the fort wall in public view until 1877. The East India Company reported in their district manual of 1886 that
"The Renati Surya Chandrula Smaraka Samithi was formed to preserve the memory of Reddy and the philanthropist Budda Vengal Reddy, both of whom were born in Uyyalawada village. The committee published a book in both Telugu and English, titled ""Renati Surya Chandrulu"" (""The Sun and Moon of Renadu""), in 2015. It contains excerpts from research papers by historians."
"A movie based on Narasimha Reddy's inspiring life, ""Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy"" directed by Surender Reddy and starring Chiranjeevi was released in the Telugu film industry on 2 October 2019. He was referred as a dacoit by British as he was helping people"

Binetti is a surname. Notable people with this surname include:
"As Pope developed the game, he regularly posted updates to TIGSource, a forum for independent developers, and got helpful feedback on some of the game's direction. He also created a publicly available demonstration of the game, which further had positive feedback to him. Pope opted to try to have the game submitted to the Steam storefront through the user-voted Greenlight process in April 2013; he was hesitant that the niche nature of the game would put off potential voters and had expected that he would gain more interest from upcoming gaming expositions. However, due to attention drawn by several YouTube streamers that played through the demo, ""Papers, Please"" was voted through Greenlight within days."
"With new attention to the project, Pope estimated that the game would now take six months to complete, though it ultimately took nine months. One area he expanded on was to create several unique character names for the various citizens that would pass through the game. He opened up to the public to supply names, but ended up with over 30,000 entries, with more than half he considered unusable as they did not figure the types of Eastern European names he wanted or were otherwise ""joke names"". After the Greenlight process, Pope started to add other features that required the player, as a lowly checkpoint worker, to make significant moral decisions within the game. One such design was the inclusion of the body scanner, where Pope envisioned that the player would recognize this being an invasion of privacy but necessary to detect a suicide bomber. These also helped to drive the game's narrative as to provide rationale for why the player as the passport checker would need to have access to these new tools in response to the larger events in the game's fiction. After being successfully voted on Greenlight, ""Papers, Please"" was being touted as an ""empathy game"", similar to ""Cart Life"" (2011), helping Pope to justify his narrative choices. Pope also recognized that not all players would necessarily appreciate the narrative aspects, and started to develop the ""endless"" mode where players would simply need to process a queue of immigrants limited only by the player making a certain number of mistakes."
"Pope released the game on August 8, 2013 for Windows and OS X systems, and for Linux machines on February 12, 2014."
"Pope had ported the game to the iPad, and was considering a port to the PlayStation Vita though noted that with the handheld, there are several challenges related to the game's user interface that may have to be revamped. The Vita version was formally announced at the 2014 Gamescom convention in August 2014. With the iOS release, Apple required Pope to censor the full body scanner feature from the game, considering the aspect to be pornographic content. However Apple later commented that the rejection was due to a ""misunderstanding"" and allowed Pope to resubmit the uncensored game by including a ""nudity option"". The iPad version was subsequently released on December 12, 2014. The Vita's version was released on December 12, 2017."
"By March 2014, Pope stated that he was ""kind of sick to death"" of ""Papers, Please"", in that he wanted to continue to focus on more smaller games that would only take a few months of time to create and release, and had already spent far too much in his mind on this one. He expected to keep supporting ""Papers, Please"" and its ports, but had no plans to expand the game or release downloadable content, but does not rule out revisiting the Arstotzka setting again in a future game."
"""Papers, Please"" received positive reviews on release, receiving ""generally favorable reviews"" from 40 reviews on Metacritic. ""Papers, Please"" has been praised for the sense of immersion provided by the game mechanics, and the intense emotional reaction. CBC News' Jonathan Ore called ""Papers, Please"" a ""nerve-racking sleuthing game with relentless pacing and dozens of compelling characters – all from a desk job"". Simon Parkin writing for ""The New Yorker"" blog declared ""Papers, Please"" the top video game of 2013. He wrote: ""Grim yet affecting, it’s a game that may change your attitude the next time you’re in line at the airport."" Some critics received the story very well: Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw of The Escapist's series ""Zero Punctuation"" lauded the game for being a truly unique entry for 2013 and even made it one of his top five games for that year; he cited the game's morality as his reasoning by explaining that ""[""Papers, Please""] presents us constant moral choices, but makes it really hard to be a good person... while you could waive the rules to reunite a couple [...] you do it at the expense of your own family... You have to decide if you want to create a better world or just look after you and yours."""
"""Wired"" listed ""Papers, Please"" as their top game for 2013, recognizing that the game's title, often coupled with the Hollywood representation of Nazi officials stopping people and demanding to see their identification, alongside the drab presentation captured the ideas of living as a lowly worker in a police state. In 2019, the game was ranked 45th on ""The Guardian"" newspaper's The 50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century list."
"Some critics reacted against the paperwork gameplay. Stephanie Bendixsen from the ABC's game review show ""Good Game"" found the game ""tedious"", commenting ""while I found the issues that arose from the decisions you are forced to make quite interesting, I was just so bored that I just struggled to go from one day to the next. I was torn between wanting to find out more, and just wanting it all to stop."""
"""Papers, Please"" is considered by several journalists as an example of video games as an art form. ""Papers, Please"" is frequently categorized as an ""empathy game"", a type of role-playing game that ""asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds"", as described by Patrick Begley of the ""Sydney Morning Herald"", or as described by Pope himself, ""other people simulators"". Pope noted that he had not set out to make an empathy game, but the emotional ties created by his scenarios came about naturally from developing the core mechanics."
""""" includes an Easter egg to ""Papers, Please"", when its protagonist Nathan Drake compares a line of people waiting at a passport station to the situation in Arstotzka. A nod to ""Papers, Please"" was briefly shown on the episode ""Playtest"" of the series ""Black Mirror"", where a fictional cover of ""Edge"" includes a cover story regarding ""Papers, Please III""."
"""Papers, Please"" won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, ""Excellence in Narrative"", and ""Excellence in Design"" awards at the 2014 Independent Games Festival Awards and was nominated for the Nuovo Award. The title also won the ""Innovation Award"" and ""Best Downloadable Game"" at the 2014 Game Developers Choice Awards. The game won ""Best Simulation Game"" and was nominated in the categories of ""Best Game"", ""Game Design"", and ""Game Innovation"" at the 2014 BAFTA Video Games Awards."
"As of March 2014, at the time of the BAFTA awards, Pope stated that the game had sold 500,000 copies. By August 2016, three years from release, Pope stated that more than 1.8 million copies had been sold across all platforms."
"Two Russian filmmakers, Liliya Tkach and Nikita Ordynskiy of Kinodom Productions, developed an 11-minute live-action film based on ""Papers, Please"", entitled ""Papers, Please: The Short Film"", starring Igor Savochkin as the passport inspector. The film was authorized by Lucas Pope after Ordynskiy sent him the screenplay via email. The film premiered at the Trekhgorka House of Culture in Moscow, Russia, on January 27, 2018. The film debuted worldwide via YouTube and the Steam storefront on February 24, 2018. The film received ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews on Steam upon its release. The short film's success led Tkach and Ordynskiy to pursue a similar short film for ""Beholder"", another game set in a totalitarian state. Ordynskiy would later voice Seaman Aleksei Toporov in ""Return of the Obra Dinn"", a 2018 video game developed by Pope, which was also a Seumas McNally Grand Prize winner."

"Kingston is a former town that is no longer in existence. Originally in Fresno County, until 1909 when Fresno County lands in the vicinity, south of Kings river were transferred to Kings County, California. It was located on the south bank of the Kings River northwest of Hanford at Whitmore's Ferry."
"L. A. Whitmore established the ferry in 1854. It was founded in 1856 by Lucious A. Whitmore who operated the first ferry to cross the Kings River. The town of Kingston grew up around the ferry at the place where an old Spanish road called ""El Camino Viejo á Los Angeles"" (The Old Road to Los Angeles) crossed the river. Kingston became a stopping place on the Butterfield Overland Mail route from 1858 to 1861 and a stage route between Stockton and Visalia after 1858. A post office operated at Kingston from 1859 to 1862, and from 1866 to 1890, when the service transferred to Lillis. Until at least 1872, the only store between Millerton and Visalia was in Kingston. The first school in the area was probably the one established as early as 1860 in Kingston."
"Oliver H. Bliss operated the Kingston ferry after Whitmore, beginning in 1859. Bliss built a temporary toll bridge with two boats and planking in 1872. In 1873, John Sutherland purchased Bliss's interest in both the ferry and the bridge and built a permanent bridge that year."
"On December 26, 1873, Tiburcio Vásquez and his bandit gang made a bold raid, robbing the entire village. Reportedly 35 or more men were tied up and over $2,000 in loot was hauled away. Subsequently, the town declined and by the 1890s Kingston was abandoned. Oliver Bliss' livery stable was the last remaining building and stood until 1930."
"The site of the town is now a California Historical Landmark (#270), which can be found in Kingston-Laton County Park in Kings County."
= = = Voluntary euthanasia = = =
Voluntary euthanasia is the practice of ending a life in a painless manner. Voluntary euthanasia (VE) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been the focus of great controversy in recent years.
"Some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Canada."
"Voluntary refusal of food and fluids (VRFF) (also called voluntarily stopping eating and drinking, or VSED) or Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration (PRNH) is bordering on euthanasia. Some authors classify it as a form of passive euthanasia, while others treat it separately because it is treated differently from legal point of view and often perceived as a more ethical option. VRFF is sometimes suggested as a legal alternative to euthanasia in jurisdictions disallowing euthanasia."
"Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned. In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with ""active euthanasia"" when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important. For example, Swiss law allows assisted suicide while all forms of active euthanasia (like lethal injection) remain prohibited."
"The term euthanasia comes from the Greek words ""eu""-meaning good and ""thanatos""-meaning death, which combined means “well-death” or ""dying well"". Hippocrates mentions euthanasia in the Hippocratic Oath, which was written between 400 and 300 BC The original Oath states: “To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.” Despite this, the ancient Greeks and Romans generally did not believe that life needed to be preserved at any cost and were, in consequence, tolerant of suicide in cases where no relief could be offered to the dying or, in the case of the Stoics and Epicureans, where a person no longer cared for his life."
"English Common Law from the 14th century until the middle of the last century made suicide a criminal act in England and Wales. Assisting others to kill themselves remains illegal in that jurisdiction. However, in the 16th century, Thomas More, considered a saint by Roman Catholics, described a utopian community and envisaged such a community as one that would facilitate the death of those whose lives had become burdensome as a result of ""torturing and lingering pain"", see The meaning of the work."
"Since the 19th century, euthanasia has sparked intermittent debates and activism in Europe and the Americas. According to medical historian Ezekiel Emanuel, it was the availability of anesthesia that ushered in the modern era of euthanasia. In 1828, the first known anti-euthanasia law in the United States was passed in the state of New York, with many other localities and states following suit over a period of several years. After the Civil War, voluntary euthanasia was promoted by advocates, including some doctors. Support peaked around the start of the 20th century in the US and then grew again in the 1930s."
"In an article in the ""Bulletin of the History of Medicine"", Brown University historian Jacob M. Appel documented extensive political debate over legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide in both Iowa and Ohio in 1906. Appel indicates social activist Anna Sophina Hall, a wealthy heiress who had watched her mother die after an extended battle with liver cancer, was the driving force behind this movement. According to historian Ian Dowbiggin, leading public figures, including Clarence Darrow and Jack London, advocated for the legalization of euthanasia."
"In 1937, doctor-assisted euthanasia was declared legal in Switzerland as long as the doctor ending the life had nothing to gain. During this same era, US courts tackled cases involving critically ill people who requested physician assistance in dying as well as ""mercy killings,"" such as by parents of their severely disabled children."
"During the post-war period, prominent proponents of euthanasia included Glanville Williams (""The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law"") and clergyman Joseph Fletcher (""Morals and medicine""). By the 1960s, advocacy for a right-to-die approach to voluntary euthanasia increased."
"In 1996, the world's first euthanasia legislation, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1996, was passed in the Northern Territory of Australia. Four patients died through assisted suicide under the Act, using a device designed by Dr Philip Nitschke. The legislation was overturned by Australia’s Federal Parliament in 1997. In response to the overturning of the Act, Nitschke founded EXIT International. In 2009, an Australian quadriplegic was granted the right to refuse sustenance and be allowed to die. The Supreme Court of Western Australia ruled that it was up to Christian Rossiter, aged 49, to decide if he was to continue to receive medical care (tube feeding) and that his carers had to abide by his wishes. Chief Justice Wayne Martin also stipulated that his carers, Brightwater Care, would not be held criminally responsible for following his instructions. Rossiter died on 21 September 2009 following a chest infection."
"On 20 May 1997, the Constitutional Court of Colombia decriminalised piety homicide, for terminally ill patients, stating that ""the medical author cannot be held responsible for the assisted suicide of a terminally ill patient"" and urged Congress to regulate euthanasia ""in the shortest time possible""."
"On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the Ministry of Health and Social Protection 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death."
"In 1957 in Britain, Judge Devlin ruled in the trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome. In 1993, the Netherlands decriminalized doctor-assisted suicide, and in 2002, restrictions were loosened. During that year, physician-assisted suicide was approved in Belgium. Belgium's at the time most famous author Hugo Claus, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, was among those that asked for euthanasia. He died in March 2008, assisted by an Antwerp doctor."
"A key turning point in the debate over voluntary euthanasia (and physician assisted dying), at least in the United States, was the public furor over the Karen Ann Quinlan case. The Quinlan case paved the way for legal protection of voluntary passive euthanasia. In 1977, California legalized living wills and other states soon followed suit."
"In 1980 the Hemlock Society USA was founded in Santa Monica by Derek Humphry. It was the first group in the United States to provide information to the terminally ill in case they wanted a hastened death. Hemlock also campaigned and partially financed drives to reform the law. In 2003 Hemlock was merged with End of Life Choices, which changed its name to Compassion and Choices."
"In 1990, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a Michigan physician, became famous for educating and assisting people in committing physician-assisted suicide, which resulted in a Michigan law against the practice in 1992. Kevorkian was tried and convicted in 1999 for a murder displayed on television. Also in 1990, the Supreme Court approved the use of non-active euthanasia."
"In 1994, Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act, permitting doctors to assist terminal patients with six months or less to live to end their lives. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed such laws in 1997. The Bush administration failed in its attempt to use drug law to stop Oregon in 2001, in the case ""Gonzales v. Oregon""."
"In 2005, amid U.S. government roadblocks and controversy, Terri Schiavo, a Floridian who had been in a vegetative state since 1990, had her feeding tube removed. Her husband had won the right to take her off life support, which he claimed she would want but was difficult to confirm as she had no living will and the rest of her family claimed otherwise."
"In November 2008, Washington Initiative 1000 made Washington the second U.S. state to legalize physician-assisted suicide."

= = = Fan print with two bugaku dancers = = =
"Fan print with two bugaku dancers is an ""ukiyo-e"" woodblock print dating to sometime between the mid 1820s and 1844 by celebrated Edo period artist Utagawa Kunisada, also known as Toyokuni III. This print is simultaneously an example of the ""uchiwa-e"" (fan print) and ""aizuri-e"" (monochromatic blue print) genres. It is part of the permanent collection of the Prince Takamado Gallery of Japan at the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada."
"""Uchiwa"" (団扇) are non-folding, flat, oval fans. They are still used today for cooling rice in the preparation of sushi, in dance performances, and as a cooling tool. Historically, ""uchiwa"" were a predominantly female accessory, men typically carrying folding fans known as ""ōgi"" (扇), ""suehiro"" (末広) or ""sensu"" (扇子). They are associated with summer, traditionally having been sold only during the summer months, and decorated with summer imagery. At least one modern critic argues that, due to their use by women during periods of heat, ""uchiwa"" ""can have suggestive connotations."""
"Like ""ōgi-e"" (扇絵) folding fan prints, ""uchiwa-e"" were traditionally made from ""washi"" rice paper mounted on a wooden frame. Images were printed on paper, then cut along the margins and pasted onto a skeletal bamboo frame. As a result of their frequent handling, few pristine mounted examples remain."
"Also known as ""aizome-e"" (藍染絵) and ""ai-e"" (藍絵), ""aizuri-e"" (藍摺絵) translates literally as ""blue printed picture,"" and describes prints that are produced entirely or predominantly in shades of blue. A counterpart to ostensibly red and pink ""benizuri-e"" (紅摺絵), ""aizuri-e"" were a late Edo period development. Perhaps due to the fact that single colour prints were cheaper to produce, the ""aizuri"" technique was particularly popular for ""uchiwa-e""."
"In the past, some art historians theorized that ""aizuri-e"" arose as a result of an 1841 government ban on the use of lavish colour in the then-dominant ""nishiki-e"" (錦絵), multi-coloured woodblock prints. The existence of a number of prominent examples predating the ban, however, suggests that ""aizuri-e"" did not simply come about as an alternative to poly-chromatic images. While the earliest recorded use is in an 1829 print by Eisen, Utagawa Sadahide, Hokusai, Hiroshige, Toyokuni II and Kunisada all produced notable examples."
"The increased popularity of ""aizuri-e"" is directly linked to the 1829 importation of the first synthetic colouring agent to Japan. Known in the west as Prussian Blue, Berlin Blue, or ""bero"" (ベロ) as it came to be known, effectively challenged natural indigo as an ""ukiyo-e"" mainstay due to its lower price and decreased susceptibility to fading from light exposure. ""Aizuri"" has been described by one critic as having ""revolutionized landscape prints."""
"Given the lack of colour contrast in the monochromatic ""aizuri-e"", late Edo artists began to experiment with techniques to increase image complexity. This led to the development of ""bokashi"", a printing technique which allowed for the reproduction and mixing of differing colour tones within a single image. This is achieved through carefully graded applications of water and pigment mixtures to the woodblock with a ""hake"" brush. The result is a single-coloured print characterised by shading and tonality. It was practiced most effectively in the rendering of skies and water. While ""aizuri-e"" themselves were inexpensive to print, ""bokashi"" was costly. It is therefore generally seen in formal prints, and not regularly seen in cheaper media such as ""uchiwa-e"". Kunisada has, however, used the technique on this fan print, most notably in the cloud and ground regions, where the value of the blue pigment deepens from very pale blue to near-black opacity."
"Utagawa Kunisada (歌川国貞) was born in 1786 in the Honjō district of Edo (present-day Tokyo) into a wealthy family of ferry service owners. He began an apprenticeship with the head of the prestigious Utagawa school of artists, Toyokuni I, in 1807, and took the artist name Kunisada to include the second character (国 - kuni) of his mentor's name. In 1844, Kunisada succeeded his master as Toyokuni III (三代歌川豊国)."
"Kunisada emerged as a book illustrator in 1807 with the series ""Twelve Hours of the Courtesans"" (""Keisei jūnitoki""). ""Kuchi-e"" book illustrations were essential to the success of the then popular ""sharebon"" and ""kibyōshi"" books, and this soon became a lucrative market for Kunisada due to his talent and ambition. His position within the Utagawa studio afforded him access to training from the finest masters, and connections to publishers, actors, theatres and poet's associations. This, in turn, led to many commissions. By the early 1810s, he had opened his own studio, and demand for his illustrations had outstripped that for his master's. His great success was also reputedly linked to his ""convivial and balanced demeanor, and [the fact that] he delivered his commissions on time."""
"Kunisada was ""without a doubt... the most prolific and successful print artist of all time."" He was incredibly prodigious, creating between 35 and 40 thousand designs for individual ""ukiyo-e"" prints during his lifetime. His studio was larger than that of any other print artist, and he had a large stable of several dozen students. As a further indication of his unprecedented success, when he died in 1865 after having headed the Utagawa school for around 40 years, he was the subject of four separate ""shini-e"" memorial portraits. He is buried on the grounds of Banshōin Kōunji Temple in present-day Nakano ward, Tokyo, alongside Toyokuni I (1769–1825) and Kunisada II (1823–1880)."
"Like many artists of the Edo period, Kunisada was associated with a number of names throughout his lifetime."
"Although Kunisada designed many ""surimono"" and fan pictures, most of his works are in the ""ōban"" format. He also produced over sixty paintings."
"Given his incredible output, it is not surprising that Kunisada was active in various genres, including ""kabuki-e"" and ""yakusha-e"" (""kabuki"" actor pictures), ""bijin-ga"" (pictures of beauties), ""yūrei-zu"" (ghost pictures), ""sumō-e"" (sumo wrestler pictures), ""shunga"" (erotica), ""musha-e"" (warrior prints), and ""uchiwa-e"". He is also credited with popularizing ""Genji-e"", a print genre related to the 11th century novel ""The Tale of Genji"", through his 1829-1842 book series, ""Nise Murasaki inaka Genji"" (""A Country Genji by a Fake Murasaki""). In 1808, he began creating ""yakusha-e"", and these were to become the mainstay of his production, making up 60 to 70% of his total works. So prolific was he, that he came to be known as ""Kunisada, the Portraitist of Actors (""yakusha-e no Kunisada"")."""
"Two popular genres which are under-represented in Kunisada's oeuvre are nature images (""kachō-e""/ 花鳥絵) and landscapes (""fūkei-e""/ 風景絵). He rarely designed pure landscapes, but began in the 1820s or 1830s to incorporate landscape elements into prints featuring beautiful women and actors. ""Fan Print with two Bugaku Dancers"" with its spare background landscape, is an example of this type of piece."
"Despite his success during his own period, Kunisada was not highly regarded in the west until quite recently. Critics today consider Kunisada to have been ""a trendsetter... in tune with the tastes of urban society,"" and credit him with a ""more humanized"" style than his contemporaries, and with bringing a sense of realism to ""ukiyo-e"", particularly in his depiction of the female form."
"Many argue, however, that the quality of Kunisada's later works degraded into ""gaudy and ostentatious"" use of colour, and ""lost... elegance in the human figure"". ""Ukiyo-e"" specialist Rupert Faulkner is particularly scathing, asserting that Kunisada's work ""became noticeably coarser and somewhat clumsy, revealing a cheap and gaudy caricaturism of grotesque facial expressions and exaggerated poses."" It has been suggested that his production generally suffered ""because of over-production and lowering of artistic standards,"" as well as possible mental or physical health issues, which led to Kunisada becoming a near-recluse in 1847. As art historian J. Hillier notes, ""Kunisada's career tells the tragedy of the downfall of ukiyo-e. With evident talent and tremendous verve, his early prints have qualities that link him with the great days of the school, but the great mass of his prints are hastily designed, over-coloured and badly printed."""
"The scene depicted on the fan is of two male ""bugaku"" dancers in full ceremonial costume, who appear to be performing a dance in lock-step with no audience in evidence. ""Bugaku"", made up of the characters for 'dance' (舞-bu) and 'music' or 'entertainment' (楽-gaku), joined Japanese culture from China, Korea, India and Southeast Asia in the late 8th century, as a form of dance performed at the imperial court, as well as at temples and shrines. Dancers assume stylized hand, arm and foot poses accompanied by drumming and the world's oldest surviving orchestral music, ""gagaku"". ""Bugaku"" is often performed by dancers wearing masks to represent fictional characters, though not in Kunisada's print. There are four ""bugaku"" genres: civil, warrior, children's, and running dances. The figures here appear to be performing the latter."
"From the late 1820s, Kunisada began studying painting under Hanabusa Ikkei (英一珪), master of the Itchō school. The art-name appearing on this print, ""Kōchōrō"" (香蝶楼), borrows characters from his teacher's pseudonym (Shinkō) and from the name of the school's founder, Hanabusa Itchō (英一蝶). Both of these artists painted ""bugaku"" scenes prior to ""Fan Print with two Bugaku Dancers,"" which are very different in style from Kunisada's image."
The print is signed near the right edge of the fan. It reads vertically from right to left and top to bottom as follows:
"The double circle mark below Kunisada's signature is a ""toshidama-in"", the distinctive seal used by all generations of the Utagawa school after Toyokuni I first adopted it, for reasons unknown, in 1808 or 1809. It is a lucky symbol, referencing gifts of coins given to children at New Year's. Kunisada gave the mark his own unique twist, elongating it and making it a yellow frame with red infill containing his signature. From 1850, he used this cartouche-style almost exclusively."
"The ROM dates the print to sometime between the mid-1820s and 1844; however, there are indications that the date can be narrowed to between 1830 and 1843. Synthetic blue pigment was not introduced to Japan until 1829, and it is unlikely that expensive natural indigo would be used on a medium as cheap as ""uchiwa-e"". Kunisada's signature is flanked by two circular ""toshidama-in"" seals rather than appearing within an oblong, stylized ""toshidama"" cartouche. This suggests the print belongs to his early career."
"The print was donated to the ROM by Sir Edmund Walker (1848–1924), who was the long-time president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and served as the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the ROM. Walker began collecting Japanese art in the 1870s, making him one of the earliest collectors in North America. He bought many of his pieces in New York between 1873–1875 and 1881–1886, and during a trip to London in 1909. In 1919, after travelling to Japan, China and Korea, he was named Honorary Consul-General of Japan for Toronto."
= = = H. B. Halicki = = =
"Henry Blight Halicki (October 18, 1940 – August 20, 1989), most commonly known as H. B. ""Toby"" Halicki, was an American director, writer, stunt driver, actor, and filmmaker. Halicki directed the 1974 film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" as well as producing and starring in several other action films. He was killed in an accident while filming ""Gone in 60 Seconds 2"" in 1989. Wishing to preserve his legacy, his widow, Denice Shakarian Halicki, produced a remake in 2000 along with Jerry Bruckheimer."
"Halicki was born in a Polish-American family in Dunkirk, New York in 1940 and was one of thirteen children. All thirteen children were given nicknames; his was ""Toby"". Toby started to develop his fascination with cars while working in the family towing business, which was established back in 1919. His father was also a second-hand car dealer. Halicki started driving at a young age and developed a wide knowledge of automobiles by the age of ten. When he was a teenager, after the loss of two of his brothers, Halicki decided to move to California and live with one of his uncles."
"Halicki moved from New York to California and worked on vehicles, eventually owning his own impound and towing business. H.B. Halicki Mercantile Co. & Junk Yard was known for its extensive antique automobile and toy collections."
"Halicki wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" in 1974."
"There was no official script for the movie, apart from several pages outlining main dialog sequences. Halicki supplied most of the cars and used repeated footage of the same vehicles and shots of public incidents to increase the footage. The scene in which a train derailment is observed was not part of the original shooting script; it is in fact a real train that derailed. When the director heard about the wreck, he wanted to incorporate it into the film."
Halicki compacted 10 vertebrae performing the film's jump finale and walked with a limp afterwards.
"Halicki married Denice Shakarian in 1989, shortly before he began filming his 1989 sequel, ""Gone in 60 Seconds 2"", in which both of them would star. Halicki bought over 400 automobiles to destroy in the film, which was to feature improved car chases and storyline."
"On August 20, 1989, while filming in Dunkirk and Buffalo, New York, Toby was preparing for the most dramatic stunt sequence in the film, during which a water tower was supposed to topple to the ground. When a cable attached to the tower snapped unexpectedly, it sheared off a telephone pole, which fell on Halicki, killing him instantly. The accident occurred in an area behind the former J.H. Williams Tool factory at 400 Vulcan Street in Buffalo."
"In 1995, Denice Shakarian Halicki began work with Jerry Bruckheimer and Touchstone Pictures to produce a 2000 remake of the original 1974 film. The remake included the Fastback Mustang ""Eleanor""."
"In its opening weekend, the remake grossed $25,336,048 from 3,006 US theaters, leading all films that weekend. By the end of the film's theatrical run, it had grossed $101,648,571 domestically and $135,553,728 internationally, comprising a total gross revenue for the film of $237,202,299 worldwide. The popularity of the 2000 remake resulted in illegal copies of the custom ""Eleanor"" car being produced. Denice Halicki successfully sued to stop trademark and copyright infringement."

"Nico Stehr (born 19 March 1942) was ""Karl Mannheim Professor for Cultural Studies"" at the Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen / Germany and Founding Director of the European Center for Sustainability Research."
"Stehr received a PhD in sociology from the University of Oregon in 1970. Between 1967 and 2000, he taught at American and Canadian universities. His last appointment in Canada was that of fellow in Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Study der University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. During the academic year 2002-2003 he was Paul-Lazarsfeld-Professor (a visiting appointment) at the University of Vienna. He is Senior Research Fellow of the Sustainable Development Research Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, a fellow of the Fellow the Center for Advanved Study of the Humanities, Essen, Germany, editor of the Canadian Journal of Sociology (until 2006), a Fellow of the Royal Society (Canada) and the European Academy of the Sciences and the Arts."
"In 2011, Stehr created the European Center for Sustainability Research (ECS) at Zeppelin University."
"His research interests center on the transformation of modern societies into knowledge societies and associated developments in different social institutions of modern society (e.g. science, politics, and the economy) and is focused on these field of attention:"
Knowledge: Knowledge is not merely a model of reality but a model for reality. Knowledge represents a capacity to act.
Knowledge and information: The substance of information primarily concerns the properties of products or outcomes while the stuff of knowledge refers to the qualities of process or inputs.
"Post-industrial society: Innovation are increasingly derivative from research and development; there is a new relation between science and technology because of the centrality of theoretical knowledge, and the weight of the society—measured by a larger proportion of Gross National Product and a larger share of employment—is increasingly shifting toward the knowledge field."
Knowledge society: The foundation for the transformation of modern societies into knowledge societies is based on changes in the structure of the economies of advanced societies. The source of economic growth and value-adding activities—increasingly relies on knowledge. The significance of knowledge grows in all spheres of life and in all social institutions of modern society.
"Common sense and scientific knowledge: The growing significance of science and its manifold social utility has led to its having a virtual monopoly on the production of new socially, economically and politically relevant knowledge in modern societies; knowledge that rarely can be contested by religion, nor by politics, and in particular not by daily experience. But this does not mean that ordinary citizens are now the slaves of scientific experts."
Stehr is one of the authors of the Hartwell Paper: A new direction for climate policy after the crash of 2009. The Hartwell Paper arises from a meeting convened by Professor Gwyn Prins of the LSE in February 2010 to consider the implications of developments in climate policy in late 2009.
"Climate policy, as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach, has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years. The underlying reason for this is that the UNFCCC/Kyoto model was structurally flawed and doomed to fail because it systematically misunderstood the nature of climate change as a policy issue between 1985 and 2009. However, the currently dominant approach has acquired"
immense political momentum because of the quantities of political capital sunk into it. But in any case the UNFCCC/Kyoto model of climate policy cannot continue because it crashed in late 2009. The Hartwell Paper sets and reviews this context; but doing so is
not its sole or primary purpose.
The Paper proposes that the organising principle of our effort should be the raising up of human dignity via three overarching objectives: ensuring energy access for all; ensuring that we develop in a manner that does not undermine the essential
"functioning of the Earth system; ensuring that our societies are adequately equipped to withstand the risks and dangers that come from all the vagaries of climate, whatever their cause may be. It explains radical and practical ways to reduce non-CO2 human forcing of climate. It argues that improved climate risk management is a valid policy goal, and is not simply congruent with carbon policy. It explains the political prerequisite of energy efficiency strategies as a first step and documents how this can achieve real emissions reductions. But, above all, it emphasises the primacy of accelerating decarbonisation of energysupply. This calls for very substantially increased investment in innovation in noncarbon energy sources in order to diversify energy supply technologies. The ultimate goal of doing this is to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less"
than those using fossil fuels. The Hartwell Paper advocates funding this work by low hypothecated (dedicated) carbon taxes. It opens discussion on how to channel such money productively.
"His consequent arrest provoked the rebellion of the anti-Imperial faction of the Milanese, seen by 19th-century historians as fiercely patriotic. Aribert had soon escaped his imprisonment and was leading the revolt from Milan. The Emperor found himself unable to take Milan by siege and proceeded to Rome, where his diplomatic skills succeeded in isolating Aribert from his erstwhile allies, notably through his famous decree of 28 May 1037, securing the tenancy of lesser vassals, both imperial and ecclesiastical."
"The Emperor took the step of deposing the fighting archbishop, and John's successor Pope Benedict IX excommunicated Aribert in March 1038. That year, he held up the Carroccio as the symbol of Milan and soon it was the symbol of all the Tuscan cities as far as Rome. Aribert ended his episcopacy in relative peace, having agreed to cease hostilities with Henry, at Ingelheim in 1040, reconciled with him and obtained the revocation of his excommunication."
"The tomb of Aribert is located in the first span of the right aisle of Milan Cathedral. The archbishop's sarcophagus is surmounted by a copy of the famous crucifix in gilded copper foil (the original is located in the museum of Milan Cathedral) originally donated by Aribert to the monastery of San Dionigi, a convent which was later demolished in 1783."
"A reproduction of the cross of Aribert is also one of the symbols of victory at the Palio di Legnano. The historical re-enactment takes place every year on the last Sunday of May and concludes with a horse race between the eight ""contrade"" Legnanesi: the contrada winner of the competition exposes the cross for a whole year in its own church of reference until the next edition of the prize."
= = = Tomax and Xamot = = =
"Tomax and Xamot Paoli (also called the Crimson Twins or Crimson Guard Commanders) are fictional characters from the """" toyline, comic books and animated series. They are the co-leaders of Cobra's elite troops, the Crimson Guard, and debuted in 1985. Their preliminary names were Movat and Tovam respectively."
"The Paoli brothers speak in notable accents which show they are from Corsica. The brothers were at some point members of the Unione Corse (Corsican Brotherhood), served in the French Foreign Legion's 1REP in Algeria, then as mercenaries in Africa (Congo, southern Africa) and South America, before changing careers and becoming bankers in Zurich, Switzerland. Unhappy with the world of corporate finance, the brothers found the opportunities available in international terrorism far more suited to their abilities, and joined Cobra. Their specialties are in infiltration, espionage (military and industrial), sabotage, propaganda, and corporate law."
"Like the Crimson Guard that they lead, Xamot and Tomax also lead the ""respectable"" corporate face of Cobra as the founders, owners, and CEOs of Extensive Enterprises. When not engaged in terrorism, they efficiently manage Cobra's business affairs in shirt and tie. Their preferred mode of attack is through brains over brawn, using the law to serve the purposes of Cobra. They have covered their paper trail and connection to Cobra so well, that it is thought to be impossible to prove a connection between them and the terrorist organization."
"The twin brothers are mirror images of each other; Tomax's hair is parted on the right side of his head and Xamot's on the left;, the piping on their uniforms goes up the opposite side on each twin; the brothers' names are mirror images of one another. The only distinguishing mark between the two is a scar on Xamot's right cheek. Tomax and Xamot share an empathic connection commonly known as ""The Corsican Syndrome"" in which identical twins are believed to be psychically bonded, in a manner similar to The Corsican Brothers. While this is often useful, as it allows them to communicate wordlessly, finish each other's sentences, and speak in unison, it is also a liability as they feel each other's pain."
Tomax and Xamot were first released as action figures in 1985. Included in their package were laser pistols and a zip-line with skyhook.
The filecards for the 2008 version of the figures list their last name as Rogue.
"In the Marvel Comics ""G.I. Joe"" series, the twins first appeared in """" #37 (July 1985). They fight G.I. Joe forces throughout a busy amusement park, attempting to ambush Gung-Ho and Blowtorch. They are defeated when the Joes play ""possum""; the Twins don't realize the amusement park's ride has stopped their machine gun fire."
"Their forces, the Crimson Guard, are shown as capable battlefield soldiers and respectable businessmen. As the latter, they are to gain as much economic influence as possible, solely for the benefit of Cobra."
"A Joe team, assisted by Sierra Gordo revolutionaries, assaults a Cobra fortress, one of many in a style called Terror Drome. During the confrontations, the twins man a helicopter gunship and badly injure Stalker. Other Joes destroy the helicopter but the twins (and Stalker) survive. Later, the Joes completely take the fortress. Having prepared, Tomax and Xamot purposely wait until the Joes are inside before attempting to activate several explosive devices. This fails, as the Joes had brought their own explosive expert, Tripwire."
"In issue #109, the Twins and their forces do capture a squad of Joe members. They misinterpret an order from Cobra Commander and incorrectly believe that they must now execute all the Joes. While they are unwilling to outright kill the subdued prisoners, a S.A.W. Viper willingly fires into the prisoners, killing Doc, Heavy Metal, Crankcase and Thunder. The survivors injure the Viper with a hidden knife and escape. In the ensuing pursuit, the prisoners commandeer a Cobra vehicle, which is fired upon by other Cobra forces. Breaker, Crazylegs and Quick Kick are killed while the survivors make it back to Joe territory."
"Years later, in the Devil's Due series, the Twins fall under the influence of Destro's son, who has infected them with multi-function nanites. Their businesses still continue, such as working with Ripper to promote his soda company. After the nanite threat is neutralized, the twins activate Crimson Guardsmen in order to provide support to the now-free Cobra Commander."
"They continue to broker most deals for Cobra. The twins lead the unsuccessful hunt for the Cobra Island Joe infiltrator, ""Barrel Roll"", and were in charge of the secret construction of Monolith Base in Badhikstan, but after G.I. Joe raided the base, they fled with Cobra Commander to a cave. There, Red Shadows agent Dela Eden arrived and unleashed gunfire on the group."
"In the ""G.I. Joe Special Missions: Antarctica"" one-shot, a Joe team broke up an illegal oil drilling operation that was run by Tomax, who was able to escape. During the story, Xamot was strangely absent. In one scene Tomax talked to his brother as if he were present, despite the scene showing an empty chair. The whereabouts of Xamot were revealed in another story in the same issue, when G.I. Joe raided a Cobra medical facility and found Xamot, in a coma and unresponsive (presumably from the Red Shadows attack). Xamot is then held in G.I. Joe custody, still in a coma."
"Some months later, Tomax leads a raid on ""The Coffin"", a G.I. Joe maximum-security prison located in Greenland, to rescue his brother and free other Cobra operatives. He successfully frees his brother and several other Cobra agents. Off panel, the invading Cobra forces cause the death of 'loose ends' held at the Coffin, including Cobra operatives Monkeywrench and Dr. Biggles-Jones. Tomax and Xamot are captured by the Joes in the final battle with Cobra. Both are sent to the Coffin."
"Tomax and Xamot also appeared in the second ""G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers"" mini-series by Devil's Due. In it, Tomax and Xamot had used Cybertronian technology to become human-looking cyborgs who, when touching each other, shoot a massive blast. In order to avoid them using that power, Shockwave kills Xamot. Tomax later appears, grieving."
"In this new IDW continuity, Tomax and Xamot are revealed to be French and originally part of the Unione Corse. They set up their security company Extensive Enterprises, which was co-opted by Cobra; while Tomax enjoys being part of Cobra, he is unaware Xamot has become disgruntled and no longer trusts his brother. Xamot is badly beaten by Chuckles, who then self-destructs a nuclear missile payload on board a Cobra submarine, sacrificing himself and Xamot in the process. Tomax survives."
"Tomax eventually cuts a deal with GI Joe, offering to use his resources through Extensive Enterprises, to help the group find members of Cobra for captured. As part of the deal, Tomax was allowed to operate a casino in Las Vegas to create a cover that he was still involved in criminal activities, under the watchful eyes of Flint."
"Tomax and Xamot are first introduced in the """" miniseries ""Pyramid of Darkness"". They appear as the commanders of the Crimson Guard, as well as the heads of Extensive Enterprises. Unlike the comics, the twins in the cartoon were often cagey, self-interested, and eager to seize power for themselves, although they garner little support from other Cobra members, and their attempts are usually quashed by Cobra Commander. They share a psychic link, and feel one another's pain, which the Joes use to their advantage several times in battle. When the two are together and speaking, they speak in tandem, often finishing each other's sentences."
"At the beginning of the second season, Tomax and Xamot join Doctor Mindbender and Destro in creating Serpentor, also having grown tired of Cobra Commander's failures. But as soon as Serpentor is brought to life and orders his attack and invasion of the United States, Tomax and Xamot are the first to point out the sheer impossibility of such an attack. Their objections are quickly silenced however when Serpentor begins to throttle them."
"In the un-produced third season of the original Sunbow/Marvel series, Tomax and Xamot were planned to be the season's main villains, with most of Cobra-La and the Cobra Organization being destroyed at the end of the film. Tomax and Xamot would then form a new criminal organization known as ""the Coil"" to fight against the Joes. This season never went into production due to the abrupt cancellation of the series by Hasbro."
"In the cartoon, Tomax was voiced by Corey Burton and Xamot by Michael Bell."
"In """", they side with Cobra-La, and are seen fighting the Joes in the final battle, until a huge explosion destroys all of Cobra-La."
"Tomax and Xamot are not seen again in the DiC-produced third season. Their old headquarters, the Extensive Enterprises building, is seen, however, and General Hawk mentions that they closed them down. The building itself has been abandoned and is being used as a secret Cobra base. The Crimson Guard, however, are still present, in the form of the Crimson Guard Immortals. However, they are used more as a grunt force, as opposed to an elite group."
"Tomax and Xamot appear in """" voiced by Stephen Stanton, dubbing themselves as the ""Brothers of Light"" due to their psychic abilities to manipulate others into do their bidding when standing together. Their psychic link is strong to the point of empathy: if one is in pain, the other feels it. Tomax and Xamot use their powers to ""fleece"" believers whom they brainwash into their cult with a machine that enhances their psychic abilities, planning on expanding their cult worldwide. When the Joes end up in their desert oasis while searching for Doctor Mindbender, who is searching for a psychic to further his research, only Tunnel Rat and Snake Eyes manage to stay out of their control as they eventually expose the brothers' deception to their followers."
"Forced to destroy their base of operations, Tomax and Xamot convince Doctor Mindbender to take them with him to escape retaliation. However, the two soon find themselves being subjected to Mindbender's experiments in improving Bio-Vipers such as creation of the prototype Shadow-Vipers, mentally commanded by Storm Shadow. Later, during the events of the ""Union of the Snake"", Cobra attempts to use their abilities to control various telecommunication company heads. After their plan is foiled by the Joes, Tomax and Xamot manage to break free of their bonds and mesmerize Baroness and Mindbender to fight each other for their amusement, before realizing the need to escape when the authorities arrive. Soon after, the brothers ponder about spreading their cause through telecommunications."
"Counter-terrorism in Singapore is a series of detection and prevention measures to minimize the damage caused by terrorism. These measures involve the participation of all levels of society, including defence, internal security, border and infrastructure security, civil defense, and gives special focus on areas such as medical readiness and psychological preparedness."
Singapore's main counter-terrorism strategy includes cooperation with regional and international partners to achieve a transnational landscape of security. Singapore is instrumental in the passage of international initiatives such as the landmark United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 which established the legal basis for international action against terrorism. It is also at the forefront of the Southeast Asian counter-terrorism efforts and a United States partner in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) that aims to combat the illicit trade and spread of weapons of mass destruction.
"In recent years, Singapore's counter-terrorism initiatives have created political criticism from the country's Muslim population. This was particularly pronounced when Singapore joined the international community's call for Iraq's disarmament, which eventually led to the American invasion of the country."
These are the events related to terrorism and counter-terrorism in Singapore. Also listed are major terrorist incidents in the world and in Southeast Asia that have influenced counter-terrorism policies in Singapore.
"The main terrorist threat to Singapore is from Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which has links to al-Qaeda and Abu Sayyaf. Jemaah Islamiah is known to have carried out the Bali bombing in 2002, which killed 202 people, as well as the Jakarta bombing in 2004 outside the Australian embassy, killing 11 people."
"After the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, an informant revealed information to the Singapore Internal Security Department regarding Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan, a Singaporean of Pakistani descent, who was a member of a group partnered with Al-Qaeda. Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan was placed under surveillance by Singapore Internal Security Department, after which he left for Pakistan on 4 October. This man was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan. His interrogation led investigators to more Jemaah Islamiah members in Singapore."
"On 9 December 2001, 13 suspects were arrested. Soon after that, a video found in an abandoned house in Kabul, Afghanistan showed a narrator in Singapore describing how to attack Americans using explosives. Investigators found similar tapes at the residences of the arrested men. In all, 33 men were arrested in relation to this plot."
"In August 2002, another 21 members of Jemaah Islamiyah were arrested, demolishing JI's Singaporean cell. Arrests were also made in Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. As of 11 November 2005, 36 alleged members of JI or the Moro Islamic Liberation Front were being detained under the Internal Security Act."
"However, Singapore believes that Jemaah Islamiyah remains active in Southeast Asia and is recruiting new members."
"On 25 August 2005, French investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière singled out Singapore along with Tokyo and Sydney as potential terrorism targets of the Al-Qaeda. The Ministry of Home Affairs later responded that it had not received any specific information on imminent terrorist threat against Singapore, but added that security measures have been taken to strengthen security at borders, key infrastructure and iconic buildings."
The Singapore Police Force has in recent years enhanced security at various locations in the country.
"On 15 August 2005, the newly established Public Transport Security Command began operational patrols on the Mass Rapid Transit network to protect the public transportation system. Personnel from the Special Operations Command (SOC) and the Gurkha Contingent (GC) have also been deployed to complement other police officers on patrol. In addition, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) stepped up its effort to inspect ferries and other vessels in Singapore territorial waters."
"On 26 October 2005, Deputy Prime Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for Security and Defence S Jayakumar announced that Singapore was developing an early warning system, called the Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning, to identify and assess new emerging threats to national security. The system, developed by the National Security Coordination Secretariat, will be put in place by mid-2007."
"At the forefront in the fight against terrorism are specialised military, law enforcement, and civil defence units, namely:"
"In May 2007, the parliament passed an amendment to the SAF Act, giving additional powers to the Singapore Armed Forces. A select group of about 2,000 SAF personnel will be trained to perform security operations in designated areas. These personnel, identified by a Military Security identification card, will be able to search, detain and use reasonable force against terror suspects."
"On 8 January 2006, a large scale emergency preparedness exercise was conducted. Codenamed Exercise Northstar V, it involved 22 agencies and 2,000 emergency personnel. An additional 3,400 commuters also participated in the exercise. The exercise involved a simulated terrorist bomb attack on four MRT stations (Raffles Place, Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh and Marina Bay) and one bus interchange (Toa Payoh). There were 500 mock casualties suffering from ""injuries"" caused by the ""explosions"" as well as chemical agents. The exercise is the largest civil emergency exercise ever staged in the country."
"The exercise started at 6:25 am local time on 8 January 2006, a Sunday, and lasted about three hours. To avoid public panic, announcements were made at the affected train stations as well as on television and radio, just before the exercise began. Prominent signages were also displayed."
"Mock explosive devices, such as thunderflashes were detonated near-simultaneously in subway trains and station platforms at four MRT stations (Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay) and in a double decker bus at Toa Payoh Bus Interchange. A chemical agent attack was then simulated at Dhoby Ghaut at 6:45 am. An undetonated mock bomb was also placed at the Raffles Place. About 3,400 commuters who were on board the subway trains were evacuated during the drill. Services at 13 MRT stations were temporarily disrupted and roads within the vicinity were also closed to traffic. Shuttle buses were used to ferry commuters affected by the exercise."
"Thunderflashes, smoke generators, and fire simulators were used to simulate the explosion and 500 simulated casualties were deployed to test emergency rescuers at the scene. These mock casualties carried tags to provide paramedics information on the extent of their injuries and this includes injuries related to bomb blasts, such as open wounds and burns. There were also some with injuries related to chemical agents. Dummy mannequins were also used to simulate casualties. 7 hospitals and 2 polyclinics were also involved in the drill as they received the mock casualties. In two hospitals, Singapore General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, healthcare workers donned decontamination suits as they prepared to treat victims of chemical agents suspected to be sarin gas."
"Officers from the London Metropolitan Police and the British Transport Police, including Chief Constable Ian Johnston, were present to observe the exercise and to provide feedback to the authorities."
"Following the crackdown on the local Jemaah Islamiyah cell, then-Deputy-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong held dialogues with the leaders of the Muslim community. Details of the investigation were shared to explain that the arrests were not targeted at the Singapore Muslim community, or Islam. In schools and workplaces, inter-racial confidence circles were formed to promote inter-racial and inter-religious understanding between the different racial and religious communities, while Islamic scholars and counselors in Singapore participated in the rehabilitation of the detained JI members."
= = = Apple Island (Massachusetts) = = =
"Apple Island was an island in Boston Harbor in Massachusetts, one of five islands that were integrated with landfill over the years to form East Boston and Logan International Airport. Noddle's Island, Hog Island, Bird's Island and Governor's Island were the others."
"Distinguished in its early years by waving elms but hard to access because of its expansive flats at low tide, the 10-acre Apple Island was initially part of the town of Boston, used for sheep and cattle grazing. It fell into the private hands of Thomas Hutchinson, father of Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson, in 1723. Hutchinson the elder willed the island to an English mariner in 1802 , and a gentleman named Mr. Marsh purchased it for $550 in 1822. Marsh died in 1833 and was buried on the island's western slope, and his home burned down two years later."
"Abandoned for years, Apple Island was reacquired by the City of Boston in 1867 and sold to private citizens. Inhabitants were known to haul wrecked steamships onto the island and burn them for their copper and iron parts. These ships included the James Adger, the Baltic (the last steamship in the Collins line), and the Ontario, built in Newburyport for the Transatlantic trade."
"In the 1940s, Apple Island was subsumed into land reclamation for the extension of Boston Airport, which added of landfill in Boston Harbor, taken from Apple, Governor's and Noddle's Islands. In 1943 the state renamed the airport as General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport after a Spanish–American War officer from South Boston."

"The South Jersey Port Corporation operates three terminals at the Port of Camden and is expanding operations to the Port of Paulsboro. The agency owns and operates the Salem Terminal, which had been publicly operated as the Salem Municipal Wharf and privately operated by Salem Terminals Ltd. and Del Stevedoring. It includes berth-side truck access to of berthing space with of beam (breadth). There is of covered shed and warehouse storage space. The terminal handles barges and container ships for construction aggregate, clothing, fishing apparel, motor vehicles, agricultural produce, seafood, and consumer goods."
"Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring relocated from Maine to Salem in the 1980s to be closer to the source of products they export and utilize the newly established port facilities. In 1990, they opened the Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring Wharf, a small wharf terminal that is also utilized by several other shipping companies and located approximately above the entrance of the Salem River at 128 Tilbury Road on the east side of Barber's Basin marina, to handle bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers. It has of berthing space with water depth. It includes of open storage space and utility connections for refrigerated containers. While the wharf is currently owned by Bermuda International Terminals, it is operated by Mid-Atlantic."
"Mid-Atlantic also operates the Tilbury Road Associates owned wharf with of berthing space, utility connections for refrigerated containers, and of open storage space on the west side of Barber's Basin."
"The Port Inland Distribution Network involves new or expanded transportation systems for redistribution by barge and rail for the shipped goods and containers that are delivered at area ports in an effort to curtail the use of trucks and their burden on the environment, traffic, and highway systems. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), and Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), are involved in initiatives to review and develop this network."
"While it was determined that Salem was not an ideal location within the program for handling container shipping for intermodal freight transport, a private sector service provider began in 2010 the short sea shipping of aggregate products with a barge service between Salem and Tremley Point, Linden on the Arthur Kill in the Port of New York and New Jersey. It addresses a critical missing link in multimodal freight transport between ports in the Delaware Valley and the Northern New Jersey's urban Gateway Region."
America's Marine Highway is a similar US Department of Transportation initiative to capitalize on US waterways for the transport of goods for which NJDOT applied and received approval for review and potential development of their initiative into a federally supported project. Salem would be considered for increased transportation by shipping vessels to customers along the East Coast.
"Barber's Basin is a marina between the two wharfs operated by Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring. It is home to the United States Coast Guard Small Salem Station, a seasonal unit in operation from late May to mid-October. In 2013, the Coast Guard reduced staffing from daily to weekend operations. The private docks of the Salem Boating Club, across the river in Pennsville, also serve pleasure craft."
"Delaware River and Bay Authority's Three Forts Ferry Crossing was renamed the Delaware City–Salem Ferry in 2013 to reflect changes in service due to Hurricane Sandy damages. The seasonal service, rather than traveling to Fort Mott, departs from Barber's Basin with service across the river to Delaware City, which has the nearby Fort DuPont State Park, with connecting service to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island effective May 4, 2013 for the summer seasonal service. The ferry returned to serving Fort Mott on its previous route (instead of Salem) in 2015 and is now called the Forts Ferry Crossing."
"Salem has been an occasional port of call for promotional and educational functions for the A. J. Meerwald, the New Jersey State Tall Ship."

"The Droid Maxx is a high end smartphone developed by Motorola Mobility. It is the first Droid to be a high end smartphone exclusively developed by Motorola for Verizon Wireless. It is part of the Verizon Droid line, and was announced on 23 July 2013 along with the Droid Ultra and Droid Mini at a joint Motorola and Verizon Wireless press conference."
"The Droid Maxx maintains a similar design shape to its predecessor, the Droid Razr HD, including the Dupont Kevlar unibody form. It included Motorola's proprietary X8 Mobile Computing System, which consists of 8 cores: 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro applications processor, 4-core Adreno 320 graphics processor, 1 low-power core for natural language processing, and 1 low-power core for contextual awareness processing to enable the new Touchless control feature. The internal battery was increased in size to 3,500 mAh. The on-screen buttons for back, home, and multitask functions were moved to off-screen capacitive soft-keys below the screen. The Droid Maxx also includes Motorola's Active Notification feature."
"Reception towards the device was mostly positive, with the caveat that the device is only available on the US carrier, Verizon Wireless. Some reviewing outlets called the device ""the best Android device available on Verizon Wireless"". Many others praised Motorola's Active Notification system, which turns on part of the AMOLED screen to ""blink"" notifications to the user, in lieu of a traditional LED notification light. The soft touch kevlar unibody as well as the overall physical design was praised as well. Reviewers were mixed to the device's continued use of a 720p HD resolution at a 5 in (130 mm) screen size, though complimented the AMOLED display's brightness, deep blacks, and its benefits to battery conservation."
"The Droid Maxx runs a mostly stock version of Google's Android mobile operating system, initially shipping with the version 4.2.2 ""Jellybean"". Jellybean 4.2 included various improvements to accessibility, new lock screen features with quick access to the camera, support for wireless display (Miracast), and a new built-in clock application with world clock, stopwatch, and timer. Motorola and Verizon released an update to Android 4.4 ""KitKat"" on 19 December 2013, and an additional update to Android 4.4.4 on 15 July 2014. KitKat brought restyled navigation bars, ""immersive"" full-screen mode, strongNer security, power management and some other minor improvements. Motorola also enhanced its proprietary camera software for better color, exposure, and dynamic range accuracy and included the updated Google Hangouts application which included SMS/MMS messaging functionality. Finally, support for the Square credit card reader was added. The KitKat 4.4.4 update brought further improvements to camera functionality, improved Bluetooth connectivity, and added Isis Mobile Wallet (now called Softcard)."
"The smartphone can share its internet connection over WiFi (hotspot), and can access the Google Play Store, an online distribution platform for the Android OS managed by Google. Users may purchase and download applications developed using the Android SDK, music, movies, television shows, books, and magazine subscriptions."
"The Droid Maxx, like its Moto X sibling, showcases the Google Now function via Touchless Control. By speaking the hot phrase: ""Ok Google Now"" (even while the phone is asleep), the device will launch a voice assistant which taps into Google Now to control the phone and run natural language queries with the Google search engine without requiring physical input from the user. This function makes use of the natural language processor in the X8 system."
"Active Notifications displays relevant notifications to the user while the phone is face-up. The minimalist notifications show on the lock screen as white icons against a black background; power is conserved by not turning on pixels that would display the black background. Furthermore, by use of the Contextual Awareness processor in the X8 system and proximity sensor, the Droid Maxx ""knows"" when it is face-down or in a pocket, and will not display Active Notifications."
"The Droid Maxx user interface consists of three soft keys: back, home, and multitask, lock/power button, and volume rocker keys."
"The construction is a unibody design (no removable panels) and consists of a thin black bezel devoid of any branding surrounding the screen and a DuPont Kevlar sealed back plate in either matte clear or glossy red tint finish. The shape maintains the tapered corner look of the Droid [RAZR] design language. Size has been increased to house a 5 in (130 mm) Super AMOLED touchscreen, with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels at 294 ppi and made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The device is 8.5 mm (0.33 in) thick and weighs 167 grams (5.9 oz)."
"Droid Maxx is powered by the proprietary Motorola X8 system-on-chip. It includes a total of 8 cores with various functions: 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro applications processor clocked at 1.7 GHz, 4-core Adreno 320 graphics processor, and 2 low-power cores: for natural language processing and for contextual awareness processing. The X8 system is designed to conserve power by utilizing low-power cores for the language and contextual processing."
"The device's battery is 3500 mAh, which provides a claimed 48 hours of ""typical"" usage. The phone comes with either 16 or 32 gigabytes of on board storage as well as NFC capability and Qi wireless charging."
= = = Pogo mine = = =
The Pogo mine is a gold mine in the state of Alaska. By 31 December 2017 Pogo had produced 3.6 million ounces of gold at a grade of 13.6 g/t. The mine has estimated indicated and inferred mineral resources of 4.15 million ounces of gold at a grade of 14.7 g/t (JORC). It is located northeast of Delta Junction and east of Fairbanks.
"The orebody consists of numerous highly irregular quartz veins, ranging in thickness from with being typical, and ranging in dip from horizontal to vertical with 30-45 degrees being normal. A complex system of faulting offsets the veins both parallel and perpendicular to the strike, resulting in a ""chopped-up"" orebody. Until 2019 the mine utilized drift-and-fill and overhand cut-and-fill mining methods when, under new owner Northern Star Resources, the mining method was changed to longhole stoping. Access to the orebody is via decline and spiral ramp. After blasting, ore is trucked to the central underground ""ore bin"", where it is then fed to a conveyor that takes it out of the mine directly to the mill. Typical daily production is about 2,500 tons of ore yielding approximately 1,000 troy ounces of gold."
"Pogo is notable for its paste backfill system, where 20% of the mine's tailings from which gold has been extracted are mixed with cement and then pumped back underground to support subsequent further excavation. This has the additional environmental benefit of reducing the amount of tailings that need to be stored on surface, minimizing the footprint of the mine's dry-stack tailings storage facility."

"Mayweather's trunks were designed by Dapper Dan, a Harlem-based hip-hop fashion designer. At least five possible outfits were created for the fight. FanDuel, a daily fantasy sports website, acquired sponsorship rights to have their logo appear on his waistband. Pacquiao's gear was provided by Nike."
"Mayweather commissioned specially-designed mouthguards for the fight by Dr. Lee Gause, owner of Iceberg Guards, costing $25,000. Along with ""subtle"" clear pairs, some of them contained gold leaf, diamond dust and an embedded $100 bill. Iceberg Guards also released a limited-edition TMT-branded mouthguard to tie in with the fight. Pacquiao's mouthguard was designed by Dr. Ed Dela Vega of Canoga Park, Los Angeles, who has custom-fit mouthguards for Pacquiao and other Philippine boxers. It featured a multi-colored design with a blend of the colors from the flag of the Philippines, meant to represent the different ethnic groups that support him. Unlike Mayweather's, this mouthguard was supplied as a gift to Pacquiao; Vega argued that Mayweather's high-cost mouthguard was simply ""hype"" meant to ""rub it in the face of boxers who can't afford it""."
"A bidding war ensued between Corona and Tecate—which had respectively served as prominent sponsors of previous Mayweather and Pacquiao fights—for lead sponsorship rights to the fight. Tecate won the sponsorship deal with a bid of $5.6 million, beating a bid of $5.2 million by Corona. As part of the deal, Tecate's logo was visible on all promotional material for the fight. Pacquiao was expected to feature a number of major sponsorships on his gear, providing an estimated $2.25 million in additional revenue. Among them were long-time sponsors, such as Air Asia, Cafe Puro and Motolite. Daily fantasy sports service FanDuel acquired sponsorship rights for Mayweather, including waistband branding and a block of tickets that were given away through an on-site sweepstakes. The King, a mascot of fast food chain Burger King, was among Mayweather's entourage entering the arena."
"Prior to the fight, Nike launched a line of Pacquiao-oriented merchandise carrying his logo and the slogans ""Do What They Say You Can't"" and ""#MannyDoes"". Demand for Mayweather merchandise was also heavy, including apparel branded under the Mayweather Promotions and The Money Team (TMT) labels amongst others."
"From April 24, 2015, through the day of the fight, a MayPac pop-up store operated on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont Street. It sold merchandise for both fighters and featured interactive displays and fan-oriented events."
"In round one, both boxers were aggressive, Mayweather unusually so. Pacquiao attempted to score early points from body shots. However, Mayweather escaped his attack and landed a solid counter strike under Pacquiao's right side. All three judges gave the round to Mayweather. In the second round, Pacquiao repeatedly forced Mayweather toward the ropes, but Mayweather was able to escape or wrap Pacquiao up each time. Pacquiao's jabs mostly missed, but he landed a solid left hand hit late in the round. Mayweather increased his aggression late. Although Harold Lederman of HBO scored this round for Pacquiao, all three judges scored the round in favor of Mayweather."
"Early in round three, Mayweather hit Pacquiao low. Pacquiao reacted angrily to the hit, perceiving it as illegal. The fighters exchanged big hits late in the round, energizing the crowd. For the third consecutive round, all three judges scored it in favor of Mayweather. In the fourth round, Pacquiao chased Mayweather around the ring, throwing punches at a rapid pace. Pacquiao scored a big left handed hit, causing Mayweather to put his high guard up against the ropes. Pacquiao took the round on all three scorecards."
"Having recovered from Pacquiao's big hit in the previous round, Mayweather won the early exchanges of the fifth round. Pacquiao remained on the offensive, but was unable to land any big punches. Mayweather upped his activity and won the round in the eyes of the three judges. Pacquiao came out aggressive in the sixth, forcing Mayweather to the ropes. Pacquiao successfully landed a couple of combinations, but Mayweather appeared to be unfazed. All the judges gave the round to Pacquiao, making the overall score Mayweather 58–56 (4–2 by rounds) on all cards."
"Mayweather changed tactics at the start of the seventh round, becoming the aggressor for a second and forcing Pacquiao on to the ropes. He threw a double jab, then a right-handed punch, landing none, before Pacquiao counterattacked with an unsuccessful combo. Mayweather stayed aggressive in the eighth round, landing jabs that kept Pacquiao off balance. Pacquiao went on the attack, opening up and landing some bigger punches. The round went to Mayweather on the official scorecards."
"In the ninth round, Pacquiao was again on the offensive. He effectively landed several punches, but Mayweather also landed on his counters. Both parties landed a number of hits in a late flurry of action that excited the crowd. Pacquiao was active, while Floyd picked his counters. Two of the three judges gave the round to Pacquiao, while the other saw it for Mayweather. The tenth round saw Pacquiao on the attack. Again, two judges saw it for Pacquiao and one for Mayweather. Mayweather led 96–94 (6–4) on two cards and 98–92 (8–2) on the other with two rounds remaining."
"Mayweather came out swinging in the eleventh round, landing just below his highest volume of the fight. The action then stalled as Pacquiao struggled to land much on a defensive-minded Mayweather, who ducked the attacks. Pacquiao forced Mayweather to the corner, but Mayweather landed a clean hit on Pacquiao's chin. However, Pacquiao still managed to hit solid punches in a fast pace. The judges unanimously scored the round in favor of Mayweather. In the final round, Pacquiao attempted to attack with Mayweather mostly looking to avoid his punches by running across the ring. Mayweather kept the fight in the center of the ring, but Pacquiao did land some inside counters. All three judges gave the round to Mayweather."
"Floyd Mayweather Jr. defeated Manny Pacquiao after 12 rounds by unanimous decision, 118–110, 116–112, 116–112, to remain undefeated in his career. According to CompuBox, Mayweather landed 67 more punches throughout the match. Only three times did Pacquiao land double figure punches in a round. Pacquiao himself thought he won the fight and continues to maintain that he deserved the decision."
"The fight lived up to revenue expectations, generating somewhere between $300 million and $400 million in gross revenue according to early estimates (including announced ticket sales totalling $72,198,500), which would surpass Super Bowl XLIX. Due to the possibility of high demand, viewers were encouraged to pre-order the PPV: a HBO representative reported that the fight had attracted more pre-orders than any other PPV event in the broadcaster's history. Despite the guidance, a high volume of last-minute orders overwhelmed the systems of several major U.S. television providers and resulted in various technical issues, such as difficulties ordering or viewing the PPV and outages that affected unrelated channels as well for some viewers. To address these issues, the main event was pushed back 45 minutes from its originally projected start time of 8:15 p.m. PT (11:15 p.m. ET), to 9:00 p.m PT (12:00 a.m. ET)."
"The fight broke PPV viewership records in the United States, with 4.6 million buys and over $410 million in revenue, surpassing the previous $150 million revenue record set by Floyd Mayweather vs. Canelo Álvarez, the 2.48 million buy record set by 2007's Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr. and a pre-fight estimate of $270 million from three million households. In the Philippines, Kantar ratings estimated that the fight was watched across the three-network consortium by 46.9% of Filipino households; of the three networks simulcasting the fight, ABS-CBN had the largest number of viewers, with a rating share of 24%."
"Due to hundreds of business jets filling up the stands, McCarran International Airport was closed for non-airline flights during the event days. By contrast, the typically bustling streets of the Philippine capital Manila were nearly empty during the fight."
"After the fight, Mayweather remarked ""[Pacquiao] definitely had his moments in the fight. As long as I moved on the outside, I was able to stay away from those. He’s a really smart fighter ... My dad wanted me to do more, but I had to take my time. Because Manny Pacquiao is a competitor, and he’s extremely dangerous."" Mayweather said he would retire after his next fight, the opponent of which is not yet decided. Pacquiao said ""I thought I won the fight. He’s moving around. It’s not easy to throw punches when he’s moving around so much ... I thought I caught him many more times than he caught me."" Citing the stats that showed he possibly should have won the fight, Pacquiao has continued to maintain he should have been awarded the decision. On the possibility of a rematch, Mayweather stated on May 9, 2015, that he had no plans to fight Pacquiao again ""at this particular time"", referring to him as being a ""sore loser"" and a ""coward""."
"Hours after the fight, Pacquiao's team disclosed that he had injured his right shoulder in April during a training exercise. The injury was partially healed, but Pacquiao requested and was denied an injection of legal painkillers before the fight. Pacquiao said he re-injured the shoulder in the fourth round of the fight and was ineffective after that. On May 4, a representative of the Nevada State Athletic Commission said that it was looking into why Pacquiao had stated he had no shoulder injuries on pre-fight questionnaire and was considering fining or suspending him for the deception. Pacquiao's team responded with a statement saying the United States Anti-Doping Agency had been informed of the injury, but USADA head Travis Tygart said Pacquiao's team had only asked about the legality of certain substances for use on an unspecified shoulder injury and had provided ""no medical information, no MRIs, no documents"". Mayweather initially stated that he would be open to the possibility of a rematch with Pacquiao once he had recovered from his shoulder injury, but he changed his mind before talks of a rematch were in the works. Pacquiao later underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff and was out of action for nine months to one year."
"After weighing in for the fight on May 1, Mayweather received an intravenous injection for the stated purpose of pre-bout re-hydration. The two IV infusions were administered at his home, amounted to 16% of the total average male blood quantity, and contained saline, multivitamins and vitamin C. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) forbids such a large amount of fluids entering the body before competition as a preventive step against the possible masking of performance-enhancing drug use. Bob Bennett, the executive director of the NSAC, stated that unless the IV was administered at a hospital, it needs to be cleared by filing a therapeutic-use exemption, and supporting documents through the Nevada commission and authorized by the commission’s medical expert. The Pacquiao camp had requested an injection of the anti-inflammatory Toradol for Pacquiao's injured shoulder before the fight, but was denied authorization by the NSAC. USADA authorized both injections, but the NSAC was not informed of Mayweather's IV until after the fight."
"The fight itself left many fans disappointed. Forbes.com contributor Brian Goff called it ""arguably, the least entertaining 'mega fight' in memory"", attributing the disappointment to Mayweather's defense-oriented strategy, which is atypical of top boxers. ""The New York Times"" felt that the bout was ""far from electrifying and had some fans grumbling about Mayweather’s methodical defensive style"". ""Los Angeles Times"" columnist Bill Dwyre felt that the fight was ""as compelling as the 405 freeway at 8 a.m."". Regarding Pacquiao's undisclosed shoulder injury, he called the entire situation very damaging to boxing, accusing the fight's promoters of allowing the fight to go on for monetary reasons, and potentially alienating fans. Dwyre went on to say that ""This was billed the Fight of the Century. As ""The Wall Street Journal"" so aptly put it, it's good that we have 85 years left to top it."" Former heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield, who thought that Pacquiao should have been awarded the decision, questioned the judging of not just this fight but recent prize fights in general in an essay in ""The Players' Tribune""."
"On May 5, 2015, two Las Vegas residents filed a class-action lawsuit against Pacquiao, his manager and Top Rank, for failing to disclose Pacquiao's injury before the fight. The plaintiffs felt that their actions deceived those who bought tickets or the PPV or bet on the fight and violated the rules of the NSAC. The complaints will be heard by a Los Angeles judge, who will determine whether they may go to trial."
"In May 2016, Showtime Networks also sued Top Rank over the injury, claiming that the promoter violated an indemnification agreement."
"On September 15, 2018, both Mayweather and Pacquiao posted videos on Instagram depicting an encounter between the two at Ultra Japan, speculating the possibility of a rematch. Mayweather's stated in his posting of the video that the fight would happen ""this year"" and described it as ""another nine-figure pay day on the way"" and was heard remarking to Pacquiao that he was going to ""take [the belt] from you like I did before"". In Pacquiao's video (posted with the comment ""50–1 #NoExcuses""), Mayweather was heard mentioning the ""second of December"". It is unknown if any formal negotiations have actually occurred."
"On September 19, 2018, Mayweather clarified his calls for a rematch, stating that he planned to hold a fight in Japan first before any possible rematch."
"On November 4, 2018, it was announced that Mayweather would fight undefeated Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa on New Year's Eve. It will be a three-round exhibition boxing match. In the one-sided fight, Nasukawa was knocked down three times in the first round and his corner subsequently threw the towel in."

"The title ""Hrj sStA"" ""keeper of the secrets"" is attested for 13 individuals during the Old Kingdom, at least once elaborated to the form ""Hr sStA mdw-nTr"" ""keeper of the secrets of the god's words,"" meaning the hieroglyphic language used on monuments. In contrast with the hieratic script used for everyday record-keeping, already an elite activity, the content of hieroglyphic texts was closely controlled property of the state and permission from the king was probably required for inscriptions in one's tomb, as we see in a royal authorization for Rawer, an official under Neferirkare buried at Giza, to do so."
"""jmAx xr nTr aA"" ""honored one near the great god"" is a euphemism for ""dead,"" appearing frequently in tombs and on slab stelae, even though it, like the word (and goddess) ""mAat"", evokes a multifarious idealization of relationships between social and cosmological ranks."
"Epithets beginning with ""jmAx"" are common throughout Egyptian history from the 4th Dynasty on, tending toward greater specificity in later periods. An official or family member could possess several, both ""jmAx xr nTr aA"" ""honored before the great god"" (when dead) and ""jmAx xr nswt"" ""honored before the king"" (presumably in life). It is important to realize that king and god themselves can be one and the same, especially upon death, as Amenemhat I would be in the early Middle Kingdom story of Sinuhe. The goal of kingship, after maintaining social order (""mAat"") in Egypt, was to ascend and unite with the sun disk of Heliopolitan theology, maintained from Old Kingdom until the arrival of Christianity.Since ""jmAx"" can also be translated as ""provided for,"" the connection an official's tomb holds with royal subsidy is made implicit; although officials built their tombs using mainly their own resources once the 4th Dynasty (and Khufu's largess at Giza) ended."
"A two-pillared portico makes up the eastern half of the mastaba's façade. The front is inscribed with Niankhkhnum depicted on the left, Khnumhotep on the right. These two reliefs are virtually identical, only the names being different."
This space is fairly small. The west side is decorated with a funerary procession for Niankhkhnum and the east side shows a matching funerary procession for Khnumhotep.
"At the entrance scenes of baking bread and brewing beer are depicted. Barley is carefully measured out and turned into bread. Other scenes include goat herding, ship building, harvesting scenes, sailing, netting of birds, etc. The east wall contains a legal text. Below this text several people are depicted thought to be the family of the two men. At the very bottom ships are shown. The men are shown standing before the main cabin of the ship."
"An undecorated space which serves to connect the vestibule and chambers on the north end of the mastaba with the abutting rock-cut sections of the tomb to their south. Modern security grates now obstruct much of the full sun that would have flooded this small, walled yard, yet little or no sun fell on the vestibule to the outer rock-cut hall described below, as its entrance faces north."
"With names, titles, and standing portraits of the two men, it is much smaller than the other vestibule and without pillars. The lintel's inside surface features another cattle count scene, and each tomb owner appears on one of the side walls with his wife, amid a flow of yet more offerings from the herds."
"This outer hall, an antechamber to the final, inner hall, marks the tomb's first, rock-cut phase of construction, and is fully decorated. Before the mastaba was added, it would have been the first room a visitor entered after passing through the forecourt, which was relocated northeast to the far side of the mastaba where it is now. Here, people engage in agricultural occupations including the weighing of corn and grain, the ploughing of fields, and harvesting."
"A double doorway to the inner hall is on the west wall, with a broad pillar dividing the doors. Its surface depicts the two men, their children, drawn much smaller to reflect a lesser status, in tow behind each parent. The respective wives do not appear in this scene. Niankhkhnum has three sons and three daughters, Khnumhotep five sons and one daughter, some of whom may be adopted or conceived by a second wife or mistress as they lack the shendyt kilts worn by the others. All the children except Niankhkhnum's youngest son, who still runs naked with his shaved head bearing the single sidelock of youth, are adults despite the scale they are drawn at. Ptahshepses, a son of Khnumhotep, wore the youth sidelock in the marsh scene of the forecourt but not so here. Either inconsistency intrudes, or the art, completed over years, reflects some changes of status which transpire during the tomb's construction."
"Now on the reverse side of the dividing pillar, Niankhknum and Khnumhotep embrace again, and a third time on the opposite wall of this small chamber. They are without their children in this innermost sanctuary. Each man has a ""false door,"" a carved, slot-like niche surrounded by inscriptions which was produced in the royal workshops and installed in the tomb. Niankhknum's is seriously damaged. The false door provided an accessway for the deceased, as a spiritual being, to reach offerings left at the tomb by the living. These offerings were to be set on plinths in front of the false doors. Behind the false doors is a small statue closet known as the serdab. A statue of each man would have been placed here, facing the chamber as if to watch visitors come and go, but invisible to the offering-bringers since the false doors are actually solid. It appears that tomb robbers removed the statues in antiquity; they are no longer extant."
"The banquet scene (first image) shows Niankhkhnum clean-shaven (left) and Khnumhotep (wearing a short beard) seated facing one another across comestibles spread between, each with his own breadboard table. Set off by a baseline, this is read separately from the two registers of entertainment below them. A different upper register substitutes in the contemporary Saqqara tomb of Ti (next image), where no food is present with the owner, who is seated holding a scepter, his wife (drawn at half-scale) by his feet."
"Longevity and circumstances of the tomb owners' deaths are unknown. The limestone sarcophagi beneath the mastaba were ransacked and wooden coffins of later date interred in the burial chambers. Booth, citing others, adheres to the theory that Khnumhotep died first, leaving Niankhkhnum to complete the tomb's art. This conclusion was drawn from Khnumhotep's ""jmAx"" epithets (see Titulary section), a style of beard he wears, and exclusion of his wife at the banquet scene when Niankhknum's was originally there."
"Four of the rows show people walking in single file. Familial relationships stay unclear in Egyptian tombs: Only the pictures of wives (""Hmt.f"" ""his wife""), daughters (""zAt.f""), and sons (""zA.f"") bore genealogical notations. Reeder identifies Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep themselves at the rear of Khabau-Khufu's line; he and the woman behind him are Niankhkhnum's parents. This woman and Khnumhotep are the only paraders who do not place their left hands upon their hearts, but use them to hold the hand or arm of the person in front of them, suggesting a degree of intimacy between them and the persons they grasp (Khabau-Khufu or Niankhkhnum, respectively). More of the deceased's children plus some of foggier status appear, including Ankhredwi-nesut, police captain Khnumhezuf, palace manicurist Kasetef, and Hemre's wife Tjeset. Sekhem, a scribe of the ""pr HD"" ""white house,"" is both here and behind Niankhkhnum in the forecourt marsh scene, where he had a namesake on Khnumhotep's side, albeit with additional post of inspector of ""Hm-kA"" priests marked."
"In Reeder's interpretation, absence of Khnumhotep's parents here matching absence of his wife at the banquet, is consistent with Khnumhotep predeceasing his afterlife roommate. Other officials in line and in the next register (where figures are smaller) include supervisors of weavers, manicurists, ""Hm-kA"" priests, and scribes."

"REDCAT (Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater) is an interdisciplinary contemporary arts center for innovative visual, performing and media arts in downtown Los Angeles, located inside the Walt Disney Concert Hall complex. Opened in November 2003 as the initial professional presenting arm of CalArts, REDCAT has since garnered a reputation for groundbreaking theater and a worldwide arts following as a launching platform for up-and-coming local artists, and for introducing internationally acclaimed productions and exhibitions to L.A. audiences that are often premiering on the West Coast for the first time."
"The art center consists of a gallery space with revolving exhibitions, a 200–270-seat flexible black box theater, and a lounge cafe/bar hosting public conversations and a bookstore offering diverse art publications."
"As the Walt Disney Concert Hall came under construction in 1992, Roy E. Disney, son of Roy O. and Edna Disney, saw an opportunity for California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, CA to have a presence downtown. With the approval of The Walt Disney Company's Board of Directors and support from the County of Los Angeles, the project's lead architect, Frank Gehry, whose children also graduated from CalArts, was tasked to design the new venue. Roy Disney and his wife Patty personally matched the Disney Company gift for REDCAT's construction and, to extend the memory of Roy O. Disney who built The Walt Disney Company with Walt and oversaw the construction of CalArts' campus, dedicated the new art center to his parents' name. CalArts President Steven D. Lavine cites the pairing of high caliber renegade experimentation and a social space for artist-community engagement, especially those in London (e.g. The Cottesloe Theatre as part of the Royal National Theatre), as a pointed consideration for the venue design and its conception as an institutional laboratory."
"Mark Murphy was brought on board as executive director of REDCAT to guide the vision of the new organization. He observed a dearth of interdisciplinary art spaces in Los Angeles the likes of Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Wexner Center for the Arts, and the Walker Art Center, or the Alte Oper in Frankfurt and the Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin. This impetus propelled initiatives for commissioned works, artist residencies, collaborations, and public programs to facilitate dialogue on the creative city within the world arts arena."

= = = Japanese swords in fiction = = =
"The katana sword appears in many folk tales as well as legends. This piece of Japanese history not only appears in old folklore, it is also very popular in modern fiction as well as contemporary art pieces such as film and theater. The katana has reached far and wide in the world of fictional stories and can be used to tell tales of wisdom and bravery or evil and treachery. The sword can be seen not only as a tool for the hero but also a tool for the villain."
"Many legends surround Japanese swords, the most frequent being that the blades are folded an immense number of times, gaining magical properties in the meantime. While blades folded hundreds, thousands, or even millions of times are encountered in fiction, there is no record of real blades being folded more than around 20 times. With each fold made by the maker, every internal layer is also folded, and so the total number of layers in a sword blade is doubled at each fold; since the thickness of a katana blade is less than 2 iron atoms, going beyond 20 folds no longer adds meaningfully to the number of layers in the blade. Folding a blade only ten times will therefore create 1024 layers; 20 times will create 1,048,576 layers."
"Furthermore, while heating and folding serves to even out the distribution of carbon throughout the blade, a small amount of carbon is also 'burnt out' of the steel in this process; repeated folding will eventually remove most of the carbon, turning the material into softer iron and reducing its ability to hold a sharp edge. This can be combated with carburization, though it does not produce even carbon distribution, partially defeating the purpose of folding."
"Some swords were reputed to reflect their creators' personalities. Those made by Muramasa had a reputation for violence and bloodshed,"
"while those made by Masamune were considered weapons of peace. A popular legend tells of what happens when two swords made by Muramasa and Masamune were held in a stream carrying fallen lotus petals: while those leaves touching the Muramasa blade were cut in two, those coming towards the Masamune suddenly changed course and went around the blade without touching it."
"Kusanagi (probably a tsurugi, a type of Bronze Age sword which precedes the katana by centuries) is the most famous legendary sword in Japanese mythology, involved in several folk stories. Along with the Jewel and the Mirror, it was one of the three godly treasures of Japan. A common misconception is that Katanas magically sprung into existence in Japan, utterly isolated from the mainland. The technique of folding steel came from the manufacture of the Dao in China, and contact with the mainland would affect how the katana evolved through the centuries. The katana design itself was developed over hundreds of years and the katana design was a development of the Tachi."
"The most common depiction, especially in the Western world, of the Katana is a weapon of unparalleled power, often bordering on the physically impossible. Katanas are often depicted as being inherently ""superior"" to all other weapons possessing such qualities as being impossibly light, nigh-unbreakable and able to cut through nearly anything. By contrast, traditional European weapons are often depicted as clumsy, crude and unwieldy by comparison."
"It is the prime weapon of choice for Japanese heroes in historical fiction set before the Meiji period. Carrying a non-sealed katana is illegal in present-day Japan, but in fiction this law is often ignored or circumvented to allow characters to carry katana as a matter of artistic license. For instance, some stories state that carrying weapons has been permitted due to a serious increase in crimes or an invasion of monsters from other dimensions. With this law in mind, katana are sometimes used for comic relief in anime and manga set in the present, although this is sometimes replaced by the use of a bokken having surprisingly comparable capabilities. In the film """", the main protagonist is permitted to bring her katana on board an airliner; presumably, this is a policy of the fictitious Japanese airline, as other passengers can also be seen carrying swords."
"Due to the renowned quality of the sword and the mysticism surrounding the relationship between the blade and its wielder, the katana appears in various works of fiction, including film, anime, manga, other forms of literature, and computer games. It is frequently used by non-Japanese creators, partly due to its status as an easily recognizable icon of Japan and its high reputation as a formidable weapon in skilled hands. Four well-known appearances in Western culture are Bruce Willis' weapon of opportunity in Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", the Bride's signature weapon in ""Kill Bill"" (a film strongly influenced by Japanese samurai movies), the katana used by the main characters in ""Highlander"" and the 1975 Tom Laughlin action/cult Western film ""The Master Gunfighter"". Other iconic appearances for the western audience include a pair of Ninjato carried by the character Leonardo in the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" franchise. Ulrich Stern wields one in the first, second and third seasons of ""Code Lyoko,"" but gains an additional katana in the fourth season and in """"."
"Manga and anime show a prominent feature of katana for specific characters. In the manga ""Bakuman"", the characters while researching on the commonality between the popular manga styles, mentioned Japanese swords are always present in them, including ""InuYasha"", ""One Piece"", ""Bleach"", ""Gin Tama"" and various other examples."
"There are also several manga series that were inspired by the Japanese swords. Kamata Kimiko's ""Katana"" is one such series; it is heavily imbued with the theme of katana with the story plot following an extraordinary teenage boy with the ability to see the 'spirit forms' of swords."
"The sakabatō (逆刃刀) is a type of katana from ""Rurouni Kenshin"", wielded by Himura Kenshin. It is a “reverse-edge sword”, translated in the English-language dub as a “reverse blade sword”. Some companies have created true replicas of the sakabatō."
"The sharpened edge is the inward curved, longer side of the blade – the opposite of a standard katana – making it extremely difficult to kill an opponent; it generally knocks the wielder's enemies ""senseless"" rather than killing them. The only way for the sakabatō to cut is to rotate the hilt by 180 degrees within the hand, thus holding the sword backwards. The sakabatō symbolises Kenshin's oath not to kill again."
"Video games also provide frequent appearances of the katana, most with unique characteristics. Kaede, the protagonist of the arcade series ""The Last Blade"", Yoshimitsu, the well known ninja from ""Tekken"", and Mitsurugi, the Japanese samurai from the ""Soul"" series also wield Katanas as their default weapons. Katana frequently appear in role-playing video games, such as some ""Elder Scrolls"" games like , , or ""Neverwinter Nights"", as weapons; often faster than a longsword yet less powerful. The browser video game ""Touken Ranbu"" developed by Nitroplus and DMM Games involves the player assuming the role of a sage who has the power to bring historical katana to life. One of the recent appearances of the katana in another video game series is in ""Left 4 Dead 2"", a game made by Valve. In ""Final Fantasy VII"", the character Sephiroth wields a very long katana. Other games in the ""Final Fantasy"" series include a sword called the Masamune, apparently named after the famous Japanese swordsmith. In ""Ninja Gaiden"", protagonist Ryu Hayabusa wields two legendary Japanese swords, the Dragon Sword, a katana which was carved from a Dragon's fang, and the Blade of the Archfiend, a Tachi which was forged from a cursed meteorite. In the ""Devil May Cry"" series, Sparda, the father of protagonist Dante, who is a legendary demon weaponsmith, designed one of his masterpieces Yamato after a traditional Japanese katana, which is then wielded by Dante's twin brother Vergil, who is a master of Iaijutsu."
"In the three video games based on the 2D animated French television show ""Code Lyoko"" (""Get Ready to Virtualize!"", """", and """") Ulrich Stern utilizes his saber to slice and dice monsters."
"""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (1987) deals with it twice. In ""Ninja Sword of Nowhere"", an alien spacecraft left a fragment of an alien metal, used to travel between dimensions in a mere microsecond, on Earth thousands of years ago, before a craftsman found the alien metal, forging a Japanese sword. This creates a legend of a sword which allows its owner to show up and disappear whenever he or she wishes. Even ""Sword of Yurikawa"" has a plot with an old Japanese sword."
"The French shows ""Code Lyoko"" and its cancelled sequel """" depict one of its five main characters, Ulrich Stern, with a katana (called ""saber"") as his only weapon on the virtual world of Lyoko and eventually the Cortex region. Usually calling out ""Impact!"" he slashes the programmed monsters of X.A.N.A. in one strike, but can also throw it like a javelin to destroy two or three targets from a distance. At one point, his katana was temporarily modified and upgraded by the false Franz Hopper, capable of charging and emitting a wave of white energy that could wipe out three monsters from a distance. In its fourth season, he is presented with an additional katana, which is easier for him to get a ""close slave."""

"Left communism, or the communist left, is a position held by the left wing of communism, which criticises the political ideas and practices espoused by Marxist–Leninists and social democrats. Left communists assert positions which they regard as more authentically Marxist than the views of Marxism–Leninism espoused by the Communist International after its Bolshevization by Joseph Stalin and during its second congress."
"In general, there are two currents of left communism, namely the Italian and Dutch-German left. The communist left in Italy was formed during World War I in organizations like the Italian Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Italy. The Italian left considers itself to be Leninist in nature, but denounces Marxism–Leninism as a form of bourgeois opportunism materialized in the Soviet Union under Stalin. The Italian left is currently embodied in organizations such as the Internationalist Communist Party (Battaglia Comunista) and the International Communist Party. The Dutch-German left split from Vladimir Lenin prior to Stalin's rule and supports a firmly council communist and libertarian Marxist viewpoint as opposed to the Italian left which emphasised the need for an international revolutionary party."
"Left communism differs from most other forms of Marxism in believing that communists should not participate in bourgeois parliaments, and some argue against participating in conservative trade unions. However, many left communists split over their criticism of the Bolsheviks. Council communists criticised the Bolsheviks for elitist party functions and emphasised a more autonomous organisation of the working class, without political parties."
"Although she was murdered in 1919 before the communist left appeared as a distinct current, Rosa Luxemburg has heavily influenced most left communists. Proponents of left communism have included Albert Camus, Amadeo Bordiga, Onorato Damen, Jacques Camatte, Herman Gorter, Antonie Pannekoek, Otto Rühle, Sylvia Pankhurst and Paul Mattick."
"Two major traditions can be observed within left communism, namely the Dutch-German current and the Italian current. The political positions those traditions share are opposition to popular fronts, to many kinds of nationalism and national liberation movements and to parliamentarianism."
"The historical origins of left communism come from World War I. Most left communists are supportive of the October Revolution in Russia, but retain a critical view of its development. However, some in the Dutch-German current would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a proletarian or socialist nature, arguing that it had simply carried out the tasks of the bourgeois revolution by creating a state capitalist system."
"Left communism first came into focus as a distinct movement around 1918. Its essential features were a stress on the need to build a communist party or workers' council entirely separate from the reformist and centrist elements who ""betrayed the proletariat"", opposition to all but the most restricted participation in elections and an emphasis on militancy. Apart from this, there was little in common between the two wings. Only the Italians accepted the need for electoral work at all for a very short period of time which they later vehemently opposed, attracting the wrath of Vladimir Lenin in """"."
"Left Bolshevism emerged in 1907 as the Vpered group challenged Vladimir Lenin's perceived authoritarianism and parliamentarianism. The group included Alexander Bogdanov, Maxim Gorky, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Mikhail Pokrovsky, Grigory Aleksinsky, Stanislav Volski and Martyn Liadov. The ""Otzovists"", or Recallists, advocated the recall of RSDLP representatives from the Third Duma. Bogdanov and his allies accused Lenin and his partisans of promoting liberal democracy through ""parliamentarism at any price""."
"In 1918, a faction emerged within the Russian Communist Party named the Left Communists which opposed the signing of the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty with Imperial Germany. The Left Communists wanted international proletarian revolution across the world. In the beginning, the leader of this faction was Nikolai Bukharin. They stood for a revolutionary war against the Central Powers; opposed the right of nations to self-determination (specifically in the case of Poland since there were many Poles in this communist group and they did not want a Polish capitalist state to be established); and they generally took a voluntarist stance regarding the possibilities for social revolution at that time."
"They began to publish the newspaper ""Kommunist"" which offered a critique of the direction in which the Bolsheviks were heading. They argued against the over-bureaucratisation of the state and further argued that full state ownership of the means of production should proceed at a quicker pace than Lenin desired."
"The Left Communists faded as the world revolutionary wave died down in militancy as Lenin had proved too strong a figure. They also lost Bukharin as a leading figure since his position became more right-wing until he eventually came to agree with Lenin. Being defeated in internal debates, they then dissolved. A few very small left communist groups surfaced within the RSFSR in the next few years, but later fell victim to repression by the state. In many ways, the positions of the Left Communists were inherited by the Workers' Opposition faction and Gavril Myasnikov's Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party and to some extent by the Decists."
"The Italian left communists were named left communists at a later stage in their development, but when the Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I) was founded its members actually represented the majority of communists in that country. This was a result of the Abstentionist Communist Faction of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) being in advance of other sections of the PSI in their realisation that a separate communist party had to be formed which did not include reformists. This gave them a great advantage over the sections of the PSI who looked to figures such as Giacinto Menotti Serrati and Antonio Gramsci for leadership. It was a consequence of the revolutionary impatience common at a time when revolution, in the narrow sense of an insurrectionary attempt at the seizure of power, was expected to develop in the very near future."
"Under the leadership of Amadeo Bordiga, the left was to control the PCd'I until the Lyons Congress of 1926. In this period, the militants of the PCd'I would find themselves isolated from reformist workers and from other anti-fascist militants. At one stage, this isolation was deepened when communist militants were instructed to leave defence organisations that were not totally controlled by the party. These sectarian tactics produced concern in the leadership of the Communist International and led to a developing opposition within the PCd'I itself. Eventually, these two factors led to the displacement of Bordiga from his position as first secretary and his replacement by Gramsci. By then, Bordiga was in a fascist jail and was to remain outside organised politics until 1952. The development of the Left Communist Faction was not the development of the Bordigist current (as it is often portrayed)."
"The year 1925 was a turning point for the Italian left as it was the year that the so-called Bolshevisation took place in the sections of the Communist International. This plan was designed to eliminate all social democratic deviations from the Communist International and develop them on Bolshevik lines or at least along the lines of what Grigory Zinoviev, the secretary of the Communist International, considered Bolshevik lines. In practice, this meant top-down bureaucratic structures in which the members were controlled by a leadership approved of by the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI). In Italy, this meant that the leadership which had formerly been in the hands of Bordiga was given to a body that came into being when the Serrati-Maffi minority of the PSI joined the PCd'I, although Bordiga's group were in a majority. The new leadership was supported by Bordiga, who accepted the will of the Communist International as a centralist."
"Nevertheless, Bordiga fought the ECCI from within only to have an article of his which was favourable to Leon Trotsky's positions on the disputed Russian questions suppressed. Meanwhile, sections of the left motivated by Onorato Damen formed the Entente Committee. This committee was ordered to dissolve itself by the incoming leadership led now by Gramsci, who only then opposed Bordiga's positions which had gained prestige after a successful recruitment campaign. With the party Congress of 1926 held in Lyons, crowned by Gramsci's famous Lyons Theses, the left majority was now defeated and on course to becoming a minority within the party. With the victory of fascism in Italy, Bordiga was jailed. When Bordiga opposed a vote against Trotsky in the prison PCd'I group, he was expelled from the party in 1930. He took a stance of non-involvement in politics for many years after this. The victory of Italian fascism also meant that the Italian left would enter into a new chapter in its development, but this time in exile."
"Left communism emerged in both countries together and was always very closely connected. Among the leading theoreticians of the more powerful German movement were Antonie Pannekoek and Herman Gorter and German activists found refuge in the Netherlands after the Nazis came to power in 1933. The critique of social democratic reformism can be traced back before World War I since in the Netherlands a revolutionary wing of social democracy had broken from the reformist party even before the war and had built links with German activists. By 1915, the Antinational Socialist Party was founded by Franz Pfemfert and was linked to ""Die Aktion"". After the beginning of the German Revolution in 1918, a leftist mood could be found among sections of the communist parties of both countries. In Germany, this led directly to the foundation of the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD) after its leading figures were expelled from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) by Paul Levi. This development was mirrored in the Netherlands and on a smaller scale in Bulgaria, where the left communist movement was to mimic that of Germany."
"TSG officers are not routinely armed, but are equipped with Speedcuffs, Monadnock fixed batons and CS/PAVA Incapacitant Spray like divisional officers. TSG does, however, have its own firearms capability with some officers being trained as Authorised Firearms Officers (AFOs) on standard-issue firearms such as the Glock 17 and Heckler & Koch MP5 semi-automatic carbine, as well as less-lethal weaponry such as the L104A1 Baton Gun and X26 Taser. Officers conduct certain infrequent armed patrols within London, usually supplementing Specialist Firearms Command. Instead of TSG officers wearing standard black trousers and white shirt, when policing demonstrations they often wear fire-retardant overalls with their stab vests underneath."
"Officers in the TSG have faced criticism about their policing methods and complaints have been made against officers of the TSG. Senior officers say that the type of work that the TSG are involved with, policing protests and performing drug raids makes them more likely to have complaints made against them."
"As the result of a freedom of information request made by ""The Guardian"" newspaper, it was revealed that more than 5,000 complaints were made against the TSG in 4 years but only 9 have been upheld. Commenting on these figures, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority stated that officers in the TSG are ""practically immune"" from criticism."
"One ex-Metropolitan Police officer suggested that TSG members, ""spend (their) days waiting for action, and far too many officers join seeking excitement and physical confrontation."" Some officers are ex-military personnel and these are ""the worst bullies"" as ""the laws of the battlefield are not appropriate to the streets of our capital""."
"In 1997 a man was beaten by officers from the TSG in what was described as an ""outrageous display of brutality"", which only stopped when the man pretended to be unconscious. The man was charged with assault and threatening behaviour over the incident but was cleared after photographs of his injuries showed the officers had lied about the case under oath. After the man's acquittal the officers went on trial accused of assault in 1999 but were later cleared."
"In 2003, six officers of the TSG performed what a judge in 2009 called a ""serious, gratuitous and prolonged"" assault on a terrorist suspect, Babar Ahmad, a 34-year-old IT support analyst who was not subsequently charged with any offence. The officers involved had already been the subject of as many as 60 complaints about unwarranted assaults against other men. A number of mail sacks containing these complaints were somehow lost. The accusations were investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission but that they were found to be unsubstantiated. Five of the six officers were still members of the TSG in 2009. Babar Ahmed was later awarded £60,000 compensation, by the High Court, for the assault. In August, 2009, it was announced that the police officers accused of attacking Babar Ahmad would face criminal charges. However all four officers were found not guilty in June 2011 after a recording from listening device placed in Mr. Ahmed's home surfaced shortly before the trial which ""proved the account originally given by these officers was correct and specific details of the complaint made by Mr. Ahmad were not present"""
"In 2005 a Kurdish youth recorded an officer on his mobile phone telling him """"If you say one more fucking word, I'll smash your fucking Arab face in"""" after he was stopped near Paddington Green police station. The officer was suspended but denied the charge."
"Another investigation into six other officers of the TSG by the IPCC was launched following allegations made by three men that they were racially abused during an incident during June 2007 in Paddington. A van of officers stopped after seeing youths mouthing obscenities towards them. The officers appeared in court in December 2008 and were prosecuted; two for racially abusing the men, four of misconduct in a public office and one of racially aggravated assault. The Guardian reported that a request may have been made to restrict reporting of the trial by the media. The officer who was driving the van acted as a whistleblower during the trial. One officer, a former Royal Marine, accused in this case was also involved in the assault of Babar Ahmed and has had 31 complaints lodged against him since 1993. In November 2009 he was cleared of all offences, along with the other officers, and returned to work with the TSG."
"During the 2009 G-20 London summit protests two officers of the TSG were suspended from duty following publication of videos which recorded alleged assaults on members of the public at the 2009 G-20 London summit protests and at a subsequent memorial. In the first case, the member of the public, Ian Tomlinson, died shortly afterwards. In the second case, Sgt Delroy (Tony) Smellie was seen hitting Nicola Fisher. Following her complaint, the Crown Prosecution Service announced in September 2009, that there was sufficient evidence to charge Sgt Smellie with assault. He appeared in court on 16 November 2009 and was cleared of assault charges on 31 March 2010 at City of Westminster Magistrates' Court."
"However, he could still face misconduct proceedings over the incident."
"Video evidence shows that the officer seen hitting Ian Tomlinson had his face covered and that the officers involved in both cases were not displaying their identification numbers. Following the investigation into police handling of the protest, the human rights group Liberty called for further study of what it referred to as the """"militaristic approach"""" used by the TSG."
"The TSG and their predecessors, the SPG, have been likened to paramilitary units during riot control operations by Tony Jefferson in ""The Case against Paramilitary Policing"" (1990). He argues this because of their use of shields, batons and helmets, their centralised command structure, their willingness to use force and their squad-like formations. Peter Waddington counters this conclusion in the British Journal of Criminology by pointing out that their equipment is mainly defensive. As employees, the police force have a duty to protect them from harm, he also notes that paramedics in riot situations also wear similar helmets and armour. Jefferson argues that by the police preparing for an event, such as a march or protest where they expect there to be violence, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy and that violence will occur. Waddington responds to this by pointing out that the TSG were deployed at the Notting Hill Carnival every year and yet there was not always violence. Jefferson also believes that by controlling the ground the TSG incites violence, Waddington cites examples (including the Battle of the Beanfield) where problems were caused by the police not controlling the ground and that when they have then tried to gain control violence ensued."
"Waddington states that if the presence of the TSG caused violence, then violence would not occur if they were not deployed. Waddington uses examples from three Poll Tax Riots to illustrate that the assumption that their deployment causes violence is not correct. When the TSG were not deployed, serious disorder occurred, including a fully-fledged riot. In contrast when the TSG, including specialists in riot control, were deployed there was less violence. What is more he found that the more the police planned for the 'worst-case scenario' the less disorder there was. When they controlled the space and the crowd was at its greatest, violence was lowest. Waddington states that whilst the deployment of the TSG in a riot situation is never desirable, it is often essential to maintain order and limit violence. However, he also believes that the use of force should be as minimal as possible and that it should only be used to achieve publicly acceptable purposes."
The TSG operates from four bases located around London:
"The 1TSG unit based in Paddington Green Police Station was decommissioned in 2016 relating to poor working practices, unauthorised claiming of overtime and bullying."
= = = Midland–Odessa = = =
"Midland–Odessa is a metropolitan area located in West Texas approximately half-way between El Paso and Fort Worth, Texas. This combined statistical area (CSA) is made up of two metropolitan statistical areas (the Midland MSA and the Odessa MSA), and comprises three counties: Martin, Midland and Ector counties. The Midland–Odessa CSA is informally known as The Petroplex."
"In the past, the cities of Midland and Odessa experienced a rivalry of bitter competition and political intrigue. Since the early 1990s, the nature of the rivalry has changed into one of friendly competition and economic cooperation. The Midland–Odessa area today is marketed as ""Two Cities, no Limits."""
"The Midland–Odessa combined statistical area, informally known as The Petroplex, akin to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, is located along Interstate 20 in West Texas in a petroleum rich area called the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin extends into the South Plains region just south of Lubbock, Texas, extending westward into southeastern New Mexico."
Midland–Odessa enjoys a climate typical of the resort cities of the Southwest United States. The terrain type is described as semi-arid mesquite-mixed grassland subtropical steppe. Winters are typically mild with a few seasonable cold spells. In the spring the wind is quite strong and the summer can bring extended heat waves with many consecutive days with highs of 100 degrees or more. The average rainfall of Midland–Odessa is 14.96 inches. Midland–Odessa is located in zone 8 according to the USDA 2003 Plant Hardiness Map. On average the area experiences 316 days of sunshine a year.
"The Midland–Odessa, Texas, combined statistical area (CSA) is made up of two metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) encompassing three counties. The CSA includes Martin and Midland counties in the Midland MSA, and Ector County in the Odessa MSA. The Midland–Odessa CSA encompasses 2,720 sq mi (7,044 km) of area, of which 2,713 sq mi (7,027 km) is land and 6.6 sq mi (18 km) is water."
"As of the census of 2000, there were 237,132 people, 86,591 households, and 62,647 families residing within the CSA. The racial makeup of the CSA was 75.47% White, 5.77% African American, 0.74% Native American, 0.78% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 14.83% from other races, and 2.38% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 35.84% of the population."
"The median income for a household in the CSA was $35,117, and the median income for a family was $41,819. Males had a median income of $33,778 versus $23,013 for females. The per capita income for the CSA was $17,700."
"The economy of the area is heavily dependent on the petroleum industry and has experienced a series of booms and busts as the price of crude oil has fluctuated. The Permian Basin is the source of the New York Mercantile Exchange's benchmark West Texas Intermediate Crude. Traditionally, the core cities of Midland and Odessa have played very distinct roles in the petroleum industry. Midland is home to most of the corporate offices and has a predominantly white-collar population. Odessa by contrast is home to mostly blue-collar workers and industrial facilities. In 2003 Family Dollar constructed its seventh distribution center, in its industrial complex, since then Telvista, an incoming call center, and Coca-Cola Enterprises have relocated to this complex located on Interstate 20. In even-numbered years, Odessa hosts the Permian Basin International Oil Show—the world's largest inland petroleum exposition—at the Ector County Coliseum. In recent years, both cities have made efforts to diversify into additional industries to reduce their dependence on the petroleum industry. Midland–Odessa is well positioned to become an energy nexus for the region and for the United States as a whole. The metropolitan area is home to two major natural gas powerplants and in July 2006 it was announced that Odessa was one of four possible sites for a FutureGen zero-emissions coal-fired powerplant (which eventually was awarded to Mattoon, Illinois). The Permian Basin is also home to several windfarms and the city of Andrews is a candidate site for an experimental high temperature nuclear reactor. This focus on new sources of alternative energy in addition to petroleum has led some to refer to the Permian Basin as the Energy Basin. The recent high price of crude oil has led to a significant economic boom in the area."
"Midland–Odessa is served by Midland International Air and Space Port (MAF), located between the core cities in Terminal and has since been annexed into Midland proper. This airport serves as a regional hub for cities and towns throughout the Permian Basin and as a gateway to Big Bend National Park. Odessa Schlemeyer Airport and Midland Air Park also serve as an option for smaller jets."
"The spirit of cooperation can be seen in the Midland Odessa Transportation Alliance (MOTRAN) and its centerpiece project ""La Entrada al Pacifico"" or ""Entrance to the Pacific"". La Entrada al Pacifico is an official trade corridor that connects the Mexican port city of Topolobampo on the west coast of Mexico with major markets in the Eastern and North Eastern United States and includes an inland port facility to be located in Midland–Odessa."

"The 2014 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. The season included two very severe cyclonic storms, both in October, and one other named cyclonic storm, classified according to the tropical cyclone intensity scale of the India Meteorological Department. Cyclone Hudhud is estimated to have caused US$3.58 billion in damage across eastern India, and more than 120 deaths."
"The scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere, east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean — the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated ""ARB"" by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated ""BOB"" by the IMD. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. On average, four to six storms form in this basin every season."
"Under the influence of an active intertropical convergence zone, the season got off to one of its earliest starts on record, with a depression developing over the Andaman Sea during January 4. Over the next couple of days the system moved westwards and made landfall on Sri Lanka, where it weakened into an area of low pressure. Over the next few months the basin remained quiet, before the precursor cyclonic circulation to Depression BOB 02 developed during May 18. As the cyclonic circulation developed it helped the southwest monsoon, advance into the Andaman Sea and parts of the Bay of Bengal, before it developed into a depression during May 21. The depression was short lived and weakened into a remnant low, over the Bay of Bengal during May 23. The southwest monsoon was subsequently delayed by six days setting in over the Indian state of Kerala and eventually moved over the state during June 6. Over the next few days the monsoon set in further over the Bay of Bengal, while it was enhanced over the Arabian Sea by the formation of Cyclonic Storm Nanauk. By June 18, the monsoon covered most of the North Indian Ocean and parts of Gujarat, Konkan & Goa, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Gangetic West Bengal."
"During June 19, an eastward propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation over the maritime continent, lead to the season's first area of low pressure developing over coastal parts of Bangladesh. This helped the monsoon set in over India's north-eastern states and advance in to central India. During the final week of June the monsoon weakened, which led to the emergence of heatwave conditions over eastern parts of coastal India. The monsoon subsequently started to revive as it interacted with the mid-latitude westerlies and it advanced into parts of the Himalayas and northwest India by July 1. During the first week of July an area of low pressure and several upper air cyclonic circulations caused the monsoon to advance further, where it covered the whole of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh by July 7. Over the next two weeks a trough of low pressure and a cyclonic circulation, helped advance the monsoon into remaining parts of the Arabian Sea, central and north-western India. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) subsequently declared that the monsoon covered the whole of India on July 17, which was about two days later that normal."
"A change in the lower tropospheric circulation pattern over Rajasthan between September 16–17, from cyclonic to anti cyclonic, which indicated to forecasters that the southwest monsoon had started to withdraw from the region. During September 23, after Rajasthan had remained mainly dry since September 17, the IMD declared that the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon had commenced. Over the next couple of weeks the monsoon gradually withdrew from the Arabian Sea, north-western and central parts of India, before Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Hudhud formed on October 7. After Hudhud had moved northwards and weakened into an area of low pressure, the southwest monsoon withdrew from the rest of India, Sri Lanka and the North Indian Ocean by October 18. During October 18, northeast monsoon rains over Tamil Nadu and neighbouring peninsular India commenced."
"Under the influence of an active Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a low pressure system formed over the Bay of Bengal on January 2, slowly organizing as it moved into a favorable environment. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). On January 4, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) commenced its advisories on the storm, designating it ""Depression BOB 01"", followed by the JTWC classifying the storm a tropical cyclone. The storm intensified a little further, before it made landfall over north Sri Lanka on January 6 and degenerating into a low pressure area during the following day."
"The storm brought moderate rainfall to northern Sri Lanka. On January 6, Vavuniya reported the highest amount of rainfall of , followed by Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Trincomalee receiving each. The depression was the first storm in the North Indian Ocean to form in the month of January since Cyclonic Storm Hibaru in 2005."
"A low pressure area formed over the Bay of Bengal on May 19. It slowly consolidated, prompting IMD to classify it as a Depression on May 21, followed by JTWC issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) in the following hours. Over the following day, the depression continued moving north-northeastwards towards an area of high vertical wind shear. The JTWC cancelled the TCFA issued for the system, stating that high wind shear had caused the convection to start dissipating. The storm continued losing convection, until it weakened into a well-marked low pressure area on May 23. The remnant system persisted for several more days, moving over the Indian state of Odisha late on May 25, before dissipating on the following day."
"The depression brought much-needed relief to Odisha which had been suffering from a heat wave that claimed at least 22 lives. Coastal areas previously reporting temperatures near fell below during the system's passage. Heavy rains affected many areas, including at Bhawanipatna which experienced temperatures of days earlier. The highest 24‑hour rainfall was in Baleswar. Six districts were placed under a flood alert due to the rains. A bridge near Hatadahi in the Rayagada district was swept away by flooding."
"Under the influence of an active southwest monsoon surge, a low pressure area formed over the Arabian Sea on June 9. It slowly organized, and was classified tropical storm ""02A"" by the JTWC in the early hours of June 10. In the following hours, the IMD upgraded the storm to a depression and subsequently a deep depression, designating it ""ARB 01"". On June 11, the system was upgraded to Cyclonic Storm intensity and was named ""Nanauk"" by the IMD as it continued to intensify under favorable environmental conditions. The following day, Nanauk reached its peak intensity with a minimum central pressure of and 3-minute sustained winds of . As it tracked further northwestwards, the storm encountered moderate vertical wind shear, dry air and low sea surface temperatures, causing it to weaken rapidly into a Depression on June 13. A low-level steering flow deflected the storm to take a northward path, and the system was last noted as a well-marked low pressure area on June 14."
"On July 19, an upper level cyclonic circulation lay over the north-eastern Bay of Bengal and parts of Gangetic West Bengal and Odisha. Over the next day an area of low pressure formed, under the influence of this cyclonic circulation and rapidly concentrated into a Depression during July 21, over Odisha and West Bengal. Over the next couple of days the system moved westwards, before it weakened into an area of low pressure during July 23 over northwest Madhya Pradesh. The area of low pressure subsequently merged with the monsoon during July 25, while the cyclonic circulation persisted over Rajasthan and Punjab, before it was last noted during July 31. Under the influence of the depression, heavy to extremely heavy rainfall was recorded in the states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Vidarbha. In Odisha a total of 12 people lost their lives, while around of crops were affected and 1351 houses were damaged."
"On 3 August, a low pressure area formed over the Bay of Bengal under the influence of an upper air cyclonic circulation. The system slowly intensified into a depression the following day while being located inland over Midnapore. The depression moved further inland, underwent intensification and was upgraded to a deep depression the same day. The storm moved further westwards and weakened into a depression on August 5, and was last noted as a well marked low pressure area on August 7 over northwestern Madhya Pradesh."
"The storm activated a flood situation in Odisha, affecting 12 districts of the state. Waterlogging was reported in the cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneshwar, and nearly 200 villages were affected after the Baitarani river swelled more than two meters over its flood danger level. Sambalpur district received the highest amount of rainfall at , followed by Balasore district receiving . Seven people were reported to be missing after two trawlers capsized off the coast. The state government evacuated about 17,000 people from low-lying areas. 23 deaths were reported due to torrential rainfall."
"Under the influence of an upper air cyclonic circulation, a low pressure area formed over the Andaman Sea on October 6. The system drifted westward and intensified into a depression and subsequently into a deep depression the next day, followed by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issuing a Tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA). Owing to favorable environmental conditions, the storm intensified into a cyclonic storm on October 8 and was named ""Hudhud"". Its convection consolidated in the following hours, and Hudhud became a Severe Cyclonic Storm on October 9. Hudhud underwent rapid deepening in the following days, intensified into a Very severe cyclonic storm and developed a well-defined eye feature. Shortly before landfall near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh on October 12, Hudhud reached its peak strength with three-minute wind speeds of and a minimum central pressure of . The system drifted northwards over land and was last noted as a well-marked low pressure area over east Uttar Pradesh on October 14."
"Hudhud brought extensive damage to the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh. At least 124 deaths were reported due to the storm and damage amounted to 21,908 crore (US$3.58 billion)."
"In late October, a low pressure area formed over the Arabian Sea. It slowly consolidated and a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on October 24. The following day, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the storm as a depression, designating it ARB 02, and the JTWC estimated tropical storm winds at the storm's center, starting advisories for the system. On October 26, the system remained stationary and intensified into a Deep Depression. Subsequently, the IMD reported the storm had intensified into a cyclonic storm, and named it ""Nilofar"". The following day, the IMD upgraded the storm into a severe cyclonic storm and further to a very severe cyclonic storm, and the JTWC reported hurricane-strength winds at Nilofar's center as it meanwhile developed an eye feature. On October 28, Nilofar underwent rapid deepening throughout the day, reaching a peak strength of with wind speeds exceeding , tied with Hudhud. Over the following days, the storm recurved northeastwards and experienced high vertical wind shear, causing it to weaken rapidly into a minimal cyclonic storm on October 30. The low-level circulation center of the storm became exposed in the following hours and IMD downgraded the storm into a well-marked low pressure area on October 31, issuing its final advisory for the system."
"During November 3, an area of low pressure developed over the Bay of Bengal, under the influence of active northeast monsoon conditions. On November 5, the IMD identified the system as a depression and designated it with the identifier 'BOB 04'. This was followed by the JTWC issuing a TCFA and subsequently initiating advisories on the system. The JTWC designated it '05B' and was reporting winds around the center on November 6. Later that day, the IMD upgraded BOB 04 into a Deep Depression. The system drifted northwards over the next couple of days, maintaining its intensity. Located between two subtropical ridges, BOB 04 mostly showed quasi-stationary motion. However, albeit the adequately favorable conditions for further intensification, BOB 04 failed to intensify further. This resulted in the IMD downgrading the system into a Depression and further into an area of low pressure by November 8."

The C Wear Interactive Glasses BM20 comprises a see-through retina projection unit with an 873 x 500 full-color resolution OLED display with diagonal field of view of 47 degrees giving the impression of a ≈70-inch display at 2 meters. The transparency enables the image to be shown in the user direct line of sight.
"Navigation in the user interface is performed by a head tracking device based on 3D MEMS gyros and click commands by a soft sensor applied toward the user's own jawbone muscle. By pressing the jaw together the user ""clicks""."
"In September 2013, Fraunhofer Society announced that Penny and C Wear Interactive Glasses has been chosen as one of the partners in the LIAA project with aims creating and implementing a framework that enables humans and robots to truly work together in assembly tasks."
"At Expo 2005, Brother Industries demonstrated a stationary-type of its Imaging Display, a projection technology that focuses light, of an intensity harmless to the eyes, onto the retina and then moves the light at high speed to create afterimages that give the user the impression of viewing a 16 square inch screen from a distance of 1 meter. The company developed the system by applying optical system technologies based on their laser printing technology, and piezoelectric technologies based on their ink-jet printing technology. It was developed in order to enable users to read documents such as operation manuals at the narrow spaces, or to be hands-free when they want to use both hands."
"In 2008, Brother succeeded in developing a spectacle-type wearable RID prototype that's able to show SVGA resolution (800×600) with a 60 Hz frame rate and weights only 350 g. On 21 July 2010, it announced the AiRScouter and exhibited the device at ""Brother World JAPAN 2010"" in Tokyo on 15 September. On 24 August 2011, it announced the commercialization of the AiRScouter."
"On 17 October 2011, NEC announced in Japan the Tele Scouter, a device that is based on the AirScouter."
"At CEATEC 2006, Konica Minolta displayed a prototype of lightweight, holographic-based see-through eyewear display which uses a prism with thickness of 3.5 mm and a holographic element to reduce the weight of the display to 27 grams. Possible applications under consideration included giving workers access to an instruction manual or allowing commuters to watch a video while riding a train."
"In February 2007, the French company Optinvent was founded by Kayvan Mirza and Khaled Sarayeddine, with the mission to design and market optical projection systems that use microdisplays or electronic display slides, based on the Projection Optics work developed within the Thomson Group. The company sought to develop and market see-through eyewear displays, pico projectors, head-up displays, professional camera viewfinders, flight simulators and rear and front projection TVs, based on its unique optical technologies (Clear-Vu optics, Nano-Beam module and Slim-Chin Optical Engine). In September 2009, the company revealed that it is developing a small, lightweight optical see-through eyewear display based on its Clear-Vu technology at the cost of less than $200 per unit. The eyewear display was scheduled for release by the end of 2010 by Japanese maker."
"At Augmented World Expo 2013, Optinvent demonstrated a prototype of their ORA see-through mobile AR display platform. The demonstrator included a monocular see-through display with the patented ""Flip-Vu"" feature allowing two positions for the virtual image. The display can be positioned directly in the wearer's field of vision or below it. One position is the ""AR mode"" whereby the image is directly superimposed on the wearers central field of vision; then by flipping the display down (mechanically), the wearer can have a ""dashboard mode"" whereby the virtual display is below the wearer's field of vision. This gives the possibility of having both true AR and a ""glance at"" capability in one device. A developer's version of the device running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean called the ORA-S including an SDK was said to be released soon and will include Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, a nine-axis orientation sensor, a camera, a microphone, loudspeaker, and battery in the form of photochromic sunglasses."
"At the SPIE Optics + Photonics 2010 conference, the Engineering Services team at Optical Research Associates (ORA) demonstrated an optical see-through eyewear display with a 20-degree full diagonal field of view, 432x240 panel resolution and a distortion correction via an electronic warper. The company was said to be seeking partners to commercialize the device. On 7 October 2010, Synopsys announced that it acquires Optical Research Associates."
"In November 2007, the University of Arizona's 3DVIS Lab (3D Visualization and Imaging System Lab), led by director Dr. Hong Hua, developed a polarized head-mounted projection display where the polarization states of the light are deliberately manipulated to maximize the luminous transfer efficiency. It comprises a pair of high-resolution ferroelectric liquid-crystal-on-silicon (FLCOS) microdisplays that help to further improve theoverall light efficiency and image quality and have much higher optical efficiency than a transmissive-type LCD."
"On 19 April 2010, Augmented Vision Inc was founded by Drs. Chunyu Gao and Hong Hua to develop optical see-through eyewear displays based on the freeform optical waveguide technology which is a thin, see-through optical assembly that enables the design of a lightweight eyewear displays that look like conventional glasses and offer a high-quality video display along with unobtrusive see-through vision to the real world."
"In September 2011, the company was awarded an Army Phase I SBIR to develop an occlusion-capable optical see-through eyewear display and in April 2012 it was invited for an Army Phase II SBIR proposal submission. In May 2012, the company successfully designed the eyewear display and in June it passed the DCAA auditing for government contracting."
"At CES 2011, Vuzix unveiled the Raptyr, a see-through AR glasses prototype which use holographic optics to let the user see a virtual 70-inch screen from a distance of 10-feet. The Raptyr, which have won CES Innovation Award, feature a 6-megapixel camera, a microphone, headphones and a motion tracking system. It could be plugged into a PC, smart phone, or gaming system. Additionally, the lenses can electronically darken to compensate for brighter or darker environments."
"On 18 May 2011, Vuzix announced the STAR 1200 a see-through AR-enabled binocular glasses which is aimed for a wide variety of industrial, commercial, defense and some consumer applications. It features a native 16:9 format that offers full color WVGA (852 x 480) which provide a video viewing experience similar to a 60-inch flat panel television viewed from 10-feet along with a 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) motion tracking sensors and a built-in camera for tracking and recognizing the real world. It was released in August 2011 for $4999."
"On 13 November 2012, Vuzix announced the Smart Glasses M100. This device features a 16:9 WQVGA (428x240-pixel) resolution projector that projects a 4-inch display as if it were 14 inches away from the user's face. It has an OMAP4430 at 1 GHz processor, 1 GB of RAM, 4 GB of internal storage and runs on Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, although it can also be hosted on iOS software or other compatible devices. Its camera can shoot 720p HD video and there is a gyroscope, accelerometer and integrated compass for accurate head-tracking features. On the audio side, the M100 has an earpiece and a noise-canceling microphone. Also included are Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n and a microSD card slot. The Vuzix M100 is expected to cost under $500 and is scheduled for commercial release by late 2013. The m100 was officially released in December 2012 for $1000: double the originally announced price."
On 3 January 2015 Intel invested $25M into Vuzix in exchange taking a 30% share in the company. This investment by Intel coupled with the technology and processing horsepower they can bring will surely lead to dramatic reduction in product size and increase in processing horsepower.
"At D11 Conference 2013, the startup company Atheer Labs unveiled its 3D augmented reality glasses prototype. The prototype included a binocular lens, 3D images support, a rechargeable battery, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, accelerometer, gyro and an IR. User could interact with the device by voice commands and the mounted camera allowed the users to interact naturally with the device with gestures."
"On 19 December 2013, Atheer Labs started an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for their augmented reality systems. They raised $214,407 of their $100,000 goal. They offered two flavors of their system: the Atheer Developer Kit and the Atheer One. Both systems were augmented reality transparent eyewear display systems that contained cameras for tracking as well as a depth sensor primarily for tracking of hand gestures. The stand-alone Atheer Developer Kit was priced at $850 while the Atheer One which was intended to be connected to an Android phone or tablet was priced at $500. A SDK was made available to work with the Android OS."
"On 27 June 2014 Atheer, after shipping dozens of units, cancelled all remaining pre-orders for their Developer Kit and the Atheer One in a pivot to the enterprise market."
"On 5 December 2014, Atheer begins marketing mobile smart glasses for enterprise and industrial applications including oil, medical, construction and other field services. Atheer is shipping the AiR (Augmented interactive Reality) Smart Glasses platform developer kit, the AiR DK2, to select customers. AiR Smart Glasses are mobile 3D augmented reality see-through smart glasses with patented, touch-free gesture control that is designed to improve productivity for those who work in the field and/or with their hands."
"The Atheer AiR platform consists of the Atheer AiR Glasses and the Atheer AiR OS based on Android 4.2. Featuring the Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU, the platform includes binocular lens, 3D imaging support, a rechargeable battery, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, an accelerometer, gyro, magnetometer, an ambient light sensor and IR. External Ports include USB, HDMI Out, DC Power In, an Earphone/Microphone stereo jack and includes internal storage as well as MicroSD support."
"On 19 November 2015, Atheer launched the AiR Suite, a turn-key enterprise field worker taskflow management and collaboration platform consisting of AiR Flow, the device application for smart glasses, AiR Hub, the cloud-based console for user management and remote video, and AiR Designer, the GUI taskflow creation and editing tool."
"As of 15 June 2016, Atheer announced partnerships to bring the AiR Suite to other smart glasses such as the Epson Moverio, ODG R-7, Vuzix m100 and m300, and Recon Jet."
"By the end of 2009, Epson began the development of an eyewear display that would deliver a big-screen experience to people on the go. Thus, it was intended to be small, lightweight and comfortable to be convenient for travelers and optical see-through so that viewers could see their surroundings while watching multimedia content. On 9 November 2011, it announced in Japan the Moverio BT-100, a 3D-enabled optical see-through eyewear display which features 0.52-inch displays with 960×540 resolution that give the impression of viewing a 3D virtual 80-inch display from a distance 5 m. It is powered by Android 2.2 and packs Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11b/g/n (direct access to YouTube and a web browser) and microUSB. The Moverio was shipped to Japanese stores on 25 November and was expected to initially sell 10,000 units. In March 2012 Epson launched the Moverio in the United States."
"On 6 January 2014, Epson announced the development of the Moverio BT-200 Mobile Viewer. In addition to being 60% lighter, and having prescription inserts, it also introduces motion tracking, a camera, and more powerful (1.2 GHz) CPU. In addition to content consumption, the new Moverio is being promoted for use with full augmented reality."
"In December 2012, Meta was founded by Meron Gribetz, based on the work of a Columbia University team that began in 2011. On 17 May 2013, the company launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to manufacture the Meta 1, an augmented reality wearable display that is based on Epson's Moverio BT-100. Meta's outward-facing camera captures gestures allowing users to interact with virtual games, architectural renderings and other 3D objects by using their hands. To get one of the first-generation devices required a pledge of $650 or more to the Kickstarter campaign. The Kickstarter campaign was successful in raising $194,444, topping its pledged goal of $100,000."
= = = Confessions of an Economic Hit Man = = =
"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is a partly autobiographical book written by John Perkins published in 2004. It provides Perkins' account of his career with engineering consulting firm Chas. T. Main in Boston. According to Perkins, his job at Main was to convince leaders of underdeveloped countries to accept substantial development loans for large construction and engineering projects that would primarily help the richest families and local elites, rather than the poor, while making sure that these projects were contracted to U.S. companies. Later these loans would give the U.S. political influence and access to natural resources for U.S. companies. He characterizes his role as being an ""economic hit man."" Although he states that throughout his career he has always worked for private companies, and suggests a system of corporatocracy and greed, rather than a single conspiracy, he claims the involvement of the National Security Agency (NSA), with whom he had interviewed for a job before joining Main. According to the author, this interview effectively constituted an independent screening which led to his subsequent hiring as an economic hit man by Einar Greve, a vice president of the firm (and alleged NSA liaison)."
"The book heavily criticizes U.S. foreign policy and the widely accepted idea that ""all economic growth benefits humankind, and that the greater the growth, the more widespread the benefits."", suggesting that in many cases only a small portion of the population benefits at the expense of the rest, with the example including increasing income inequality where large U.S. companies exploit cheap labor and oil companies destroy local environment. Perkins describes what he calls a system of corporatocracy and greed as the driving force behind establishing the United States as a global empire, in which he took a role as an ""economic hit man"" to expand its influence."
"According to his book, Perkins' function was to convince the political and financial leadership of underdeveloped countries to accept enormous development loans from institutions like the World Bank and USAID. Saddled with debts they could not hope to pay, those countries were forced to acquiesce to political pressure from the United States on a variety of issues. Perkins argues in his book that developing nations were effectively neutralized politically, had their wealth gaps driven wider and economies crippled in the long run. In this capacity, Perkins recounts his meetings with some prominent individuals, including Graham Greene and Omar Torrijos. Perkins describes the role of an economic hit man as follows:"
"According to Perkins, he began writing ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" in the 1980s, but ""threats or bribes always convinced [him] to stop."""
"In the book, Perkins repeatedly denies the existence of a ""conspiracy"".I was initially recruited while I was in business school back in the late sixties by the National Security Agency, the nation’s largest and least understood spy organization; but ultimately I worked for private corporations. The first real economic hit man was back in the early 1950s, Kermit Roosevelt, Jr., the grandson of Teddy, who overthrew the government of Iran, a democratically elected government, Mossadegh’s government who was Time‘s magazine person of the year; and he was so successful at doing this without any bloodshed—well, there was a little bloodshed, but no military intervention, just spending millions of dollars and replaced Mossadegh with the Shah of Iran. At that point, we understood that this idea of economic hit man was an extremely good one. We didn’t have to worry about the threat of war with Russia when we did it this way. The problem with that was that Roosevelt was a C.I.A. agent. He was a government employee. Had he been caught, we would have been in a lot of trouble. It would have been very embarrassing. So, at that point, the decision was made to use organizations like the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. to recruit potential economic hit men like me and then send us to work for private consulting companies, engineering firms, construction companies, so that if we were caught, there would be no connection with the government.<br> — November 4, 2004 interview"
"Although the accuracy of the content has been questioned, the book did well in terms of sales, having a placement on both the New York Times' and Amazon.com's best-seller-lists."
"Columnist Sebastian Mallaby of ""The Washington Post"" reacted sharply to Perkins' book: ""This man is a frothing conspiracy theorist, a vainglorious peddler of nonsense, and yet his book, ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"", is a runaway bestseller."" This charge is brought against Perkins despite the fact that he denounces conspiracy-thinking at numerous places in the book itself. Mallaby, who spent 13 years writing for the London ""Economist"" and wrote a critically well-received biography of World Bank chief James Wolfensohn, holds that Perkins' conception of international finance is ""largely a dream"" and that his ""basic contentions are flat wrong"". For instance, he points out that Indonesia reduced its infant mortality and illiteracy rates by two-thirds after economists persuaded its leaders to borrow money in 1970. (Data by the World Bank itself shows that the decline slowed somewhat in the 70s) He also disputes Perkins' claim that 51 of the top 100 world economies belong to companies. A value-added comparison done by the UN, he says, shows the number to be 29. In fact, this report can be quoted as saying ""The results, as seen in Table 1, are striking, with only 29 countries figuring in the list of the top 100 international entities in terms of revenue."" showing how both are wrong."
"Other sources, including articles in ""The New York Times"" and ""Boston Magazine"" as well as a press release issued by the United States Department of State, have referred to a lack of documentary or testimonial evidence to corroborate the claim that the NSA was involved in his hiring to Chas T. Main. In addition, the author of the State Department release states that the NSA ""is a cryptological (codemaking and codebreaking) organization, not an economic organization"" and that its missions do not involve ""anything remotely resembling placing economists at private companies in order to increase the debt of foreign countries"". Economic historian Niall Ferguson writes in his book ""The Ascent of Money"" that Perkins's contention that the leaders of Ecuador (President Jaime Roldós Aguilera) and Panama (General Omar Torrijos) were assassinated by US agents for opposing the interests of the owners of their countries' foreign debt ""seems a little odd"" in light of the fact that in the 1970s the amount of money that the US had lent to Ecuador and Panama accounted for less than 0.4% of the total US grants and loans, while in 1990 the exports from the US to those countries accounted for approximately 0.4% of the total US exports (approximately $8 billion). According to Ferguson, those ""do not seem like figures worth killing for"". However, Perkins maintains that the motives for such actions, rather than loans, would have been the securing of the Panama canal as a permanent United States asset and gaining access to Ecuadorian oil. Einar Greve, the former vice president at Chas. T. Main who first offered Perkins a job there, at first affirmed the overall validity of the book, saying ""basically his story is true... What John's book says is, there was a conspiracy to put all these countries on the hook, and that happened. Whether or not it was some sinister plot or not is up to interpretation, but many of these countries are still over the barrel and have never been able to repay the loans."" However, on being asked by another reporter about the book, Greve re-read the book and denied the validity of some of the claims, such as the claim that the NSA had any links to Main, or that Perkins was seduced by Claudine."
"President Nixon makes some cryptic remarks that some believe bolster claims by Perkins in the book. October 8, 1971 President Nixon is in his briefing room discussing operations done by previous administrations. He refers to the plan regarding the Bay of Pigs plan, then he states, ""I know what we did in Iran, I know what we did in Guatemala"". The discussion delves into the ""dirty tricks"" concocted by the US using the US Intelligence community."
"After publishing ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,"" Perkins continued with writing three other books on the topic, focusing on other aspects. ""A Game as Old as Empire: the Secret World of Economic Hit Men and the Web of Global Corruption"" (2007), ""The Secret History of the American Empire"" (2007) and ""Hoodwinked: An Economic Hit Man Reveals Why the World Financial Markets Imploded – and What We Need to Do to Remake Them"" (2009)."
"The epilogue to the 2006 edition provides a rebuttal to the current move by the G8 nations to forgive Third World debt. Perkins charges that the proposed conditions for this debt forgiveness require countries to privatise their health, education, electric, water and other public services. Those countries would also have to discontinue subsidies and trade restrictions that support local business, but accept the continued subsidization of certain G8 businesses by the US and other G8 countries, and the erection of trade barriers on imports that threaten G8 industries."
"In 2009, the documentary film ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" featuring interviews with Perkins, was shown at film festivals around the U.S. The film is a Greek–U.S. co-production directed by Stelios Kouloglou, and was filmed in 2007 and 2008. Numerous interview-style statements by John Perkins also appear in the 2008 Internet-based documentary, """", and in the 2012 documentary, ""Four Horsemen""."
"= = = Culture of Ann Arbor, Michigan = = ="
"The culture of Ann Arbor, Michigan includes various attractions and events, many of which are connected with the University of Michigan."
"Many performing arts groups and facilities are located on the University of Michigan campus, including Hill Auditorium, the Lydia Mendelssohn Theater, and the Power Center for the Performing Arts."
"The University Musical Society (UMS) presents approximately 60 to 75 performances and over 100 free educational activities each season. One of the oldest performing arts presenters in the country, UMS is affiliated with the University of Michigan and housed on the UM campus. However, UMS is a separate not-for-profit organization that supports itself from ticket sales, grants, contributions, and endowment income."
"The University of Michigan Gilbert and Sullivan Society, affiliated with the University's School of Music, Theatre, and Dance, has put on two fully staged performances of a Gilbert and Sullivan Savoy opera every year since 1947, once in fall semester and the other in winter semester. The society is student-run. Performances take place at the Lydia Mendelssohn Theater."
"Ann Arbor has a number of performing-arts institutions that are not affiliated with the University of Michigan. They include the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre (a nonprofit community theater group), Ann Arbor Ballet Theater, Ann Arbor Civic Ballet (the first chartered ballet company in Michigan when it was founded in 1954), Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra, and Arbor Opera Theater."
Theaters in the city include:
Ann Arbor also has a number of concert halls and nightclubs serving up jazz and other live music:
"There are several religious sites in Ann Arbor, including:"
"The Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum, located in a renovated and expanded historic downtown fire station, contains more than 250 interactive exhibits featuring science and technology. Artrain, located on North Main Street, is a traveling art museum located on a train. A number of other art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus. Several buildings throughout the downtown area, like Sweetwaters Coffee and Tea and The Ark, showcase pieces of independent installation art in the form of small ""fairy doors"". Maps of their locations can be found at Sweetwaters, Peaceable Kingdom, or the Chamber of Commerce."
"Aside from a large restaurant scene in the Main Street, State Street, and South University Avenue areas, Ann Arbor has a significant beer-brewing culture. The city is home to four brewpubs located in the downtown area: Arbor Brewing Company, Grizzly Peak Brewing Company, Blue Tractor, and the nationally acclaimed Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales brewpub. Ann Arbor's West Side is also home to Wolverine State Brewing Company. Breweries in the nearby town of Ypsilanti (e.g. Corner Brewery) also contribute to Ann Arbor's brew scene."
"Among U.S. cities, Ann Arbor ranks first in the number of antiquarian booksellers and books sold per capita (although the per capita calculations may not include the large student population). The Ann Arbor District Library maintains four branch outlets in addition to its main downtown building, with a fifth branch set to open in 2008. The city is also home to the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library."
"Ann Arbor is also known within the performance poetry scene. The Neutral Zone, a local teen center, is home to the Volume Youth Poetry Project which holds a competition every year to send a team of six youth poets to the national youth competition Brave New Voices. The city hosted this competition in 2001 and 2002, and has sent a team each year across the U.S."
"Ann Arbor (or its surrounding region) is also the setting (or the presumed setting) for a number of novels and short story collections, including:"
"Ann Arbor is the setting for much of the film ""The Four Corners of Nowhere"" (1995). Parts of the film ""Jumper"" (2008) are set in Ann Arbor, using both footage shot locally and footage using Peterborough, Ontario as an Ann Arbor stand-in. Ann Arbor is also frequently mentioned in the television series Lost. Because of the Michigan Film Incentive, several major films have been shooting in and around Ann Arbor in the past two years including the Tony Goldwyn-directed film ""Conviction"" starring Hilary Swank, Sam Rockwell, and Minnie Driver. The film's offices and post-production were headquartered in Ann Arbor, using many area landmarks as backdrops. Shooting has been done around Ann Arbor as well as smaller towns like Pittsfield Township, Chelsea and Dexter. Several interior scenes were filmed on location in the neighboring town Ypsilanti at Sidetrack Bar & Grill in Depot Town. Several other films are being made with major stars including Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer and Samuel L. Jackson, who have been seen in and around downtown Ann Arbor."
"The Tea Party fielded a number of anti-establishment candidates in the 2014 Republican primaries, but scored very few notable wins. However, they managed to unseat House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in his Virginia primary race. GOP attacks on Obama's unpopular administration resonated with voters and the party posted major gains around the country. They regained control of the Senate and increased their majorities in the House to the highest total since 1929. They took control of governorships, state legislatures and Senate seats in nearly all Southern states, except Florida and Virginia."
"Great divisions in the House GOP conference were apparent after the 2014 midterm elections, with conservative members, many of them from the right-leaning Freedom Caucus, expressing dissatisfaction with congressional leadership. John Boehner's surprise announcement in September 2015 that he would step down as Speaker sent shockwaves through the House. After Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy bowed out of the race to replace Boehner due to a lack of support, House Ways and Means Chair Paul Ryan announced he would run, with the Freedom Caucus' support. Ryan was elected Speaker on October 29."
"Businessman Donald Trump won the 2016 Republican primaries, representing a dramatic policy shift from traditional conservatism to an aggressively populist ideology with overtones of cultural identity politics. Numerous high-profile Republicans, including past presidential nominees like Mitt Romney, announced their opposition to Trump; some even did so after he received the GOP nomination. Much of the Republican opposition to Trump stemmed from concerns that his disdain for political correctness, his support from the ethno-nationalist alt-right, his virulent criticism of the mainstream news media, and his expressions of approval for political violence would result in the GOP losing the presidential election and lead to significant GOP losses in other races. In one of the largest upsets in American political history, Trump went on to defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election."
"In addition to electing Donald Trump as president, Republicans maintained a majority in the Senate, in the House, and amongst state governors in the 2016 elections. The Republican Party was slated to control 69 of 99 state legislative chambers in 2017 (the most it had held in history) and at least 33 governorships (the most it had held since 1922). The party took total control of the government (legislative chambers and governorships) in 25 states following the 2016 elections; this was the most states it had controlled since 1952."
"Sources differ over the extent Trump dominated and ""remade"" the Republican Party. Some have called his control ""complete"", noting that the few dissenting ""Never Trump"" Republican elected officials retired or were defeated in primaries, that conservative media strongly supported him, and that his approval rating among self-identified Republican voters was extraordinarily high."
"According to Trump and others, his policies differed from those of his Republican predecessors (such as Reagan) in being more oriented towards the working class, more skeptical of free trade agreements, and more isolationist and confrontational with foreign allies."
"Others suggested that Trump's popularity among the Republican base did not translate into as much GOP candidate loyalty as expected. Still others opined that Republican legislation and policies during the Trump administration continued to reflect the traditional priorities of Republican donors, appointees and congressional leaders. Jeet Heer of ""New Republic"" suggested that Trump's ascendancy was the ""natural evolutionary product of Republican platforms and strategies that stretch back to the very origins of modern conservatism""; Heer and others have connected Trump to the party's use of the Southern strategy to increase support among Southern whites by appealing to racism."
"The Republican Party had a progressive element, typified in the early 20th century by Theodore Roosevelt in the 1907–1912 period (Roosevelt was more conservative at other points), Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. and his sons in Wisconsin (from about 1900 to 1946) and western leaders such as Senator Hiram Johnson in California, Senator George W. Norris in Nebraska, Senator Bronson M. Cutting in New Mexico, Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin in Montana and Senator William Borah in Idaho. They were generally progressive in domestic policy, supported unions and supported much of the New Deal, but were isolationist in foreign policy. This element died out by the 1940s. Outside Congress, of the leaders who supported Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, most opposed the New Deal."
"Starting in the 1930s, a number of Northeastern Republicans took liberal positions regarding labor unions, spending and New Deal policies. They included Mayor Fiorello La Guardia in New York City, Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York, Governor Earl Warren of California, Governor Harold Stassen of Minnesota, Senator Clifford P. Case of New Jersey, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. of Massachusetts, Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut (father and grandfather of the two Bush Presidents), Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York, Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky, Senator George Aiken of Vermont, Governor and later Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania and Governor George W. Romney of Michigan. The most notable of them all was Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York. They generally advocated a free-market, but with some level of regulation. Rockefeller required employable welfare recipients to take available jobs or job training."
"While the media sometimes called them ""Rockefeller Republicans"", the liberal Republicans never formed an organized movement or caucus and lacked a recognized leader. They promoted economic growth and high state and federal spending while accepting high taxes and much liberal legislation, with the provision they could administer it more efficiently. They opposed the Democratic big city machines while welcoming support from labor unions and big business alike. Religion was not high on their agenda, but they were strong believers in civil rights for African Americans and women's rights and most liberals were pro-choice. They were also strong environmentalists and supporters of higher education. In foreign policy they were internationalists, throwing their support to Dwight D. Eisenhower over the conservative leader Robert A. Taft in 1952. They were often called the ""Eastern Establishment"" by conservatives such as Barry Goldwater."
"The Goldwater conservatives fought this establishment from 1960, defeated it in 1964 and eventually retired most of its members, although some became Democrats like Senator Charles Goodell and Mayor John Lindsay in New York. President Richard Nixon adopted many of their positions, especially regarding health care, welfare spending, environmentalism and support for the arts and humanities. After Congressman John B. Anderson of Illinois bolted the party in 1980 and ran as an independent against Reagan, the liberal GOP element faded away. Their old strongholds in the Northeast are now mostly held by Democrats."
"The term ""Rockefeller Republican"" was used 1960–1980 to designate a faction of the party holding ""moderate"" views similar to those of Nelson Rockefeller, governor of New York from 1959 to 1974 and Vice President under President Gerald Ford in 1974–1977. Before Rockefeller, Thomas E. Dewey, governor of New York (1942–1954) and GOP presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948 was the leader. Dwight Eisenhower and his aide Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. reflected many of their views."
"An important moderate leader in the 1950s was Connecticut Republican Senator Prescott Bush, father and grandfather of Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, respectively. After Rockefeller left the national stage in 1976, this faction of the party was more often called ""moderate Republicans"", in contrast to the conservatives who rallied to Ronald Reagan."
"Historically, Rockefeller Republicans were moderate or liberal on domestic and social policies. They favored New Deal programs, including regulation and welfare. They were supporters of civil rights. They were supported by big business on Wall Street (New York City). In fiscal policy they favored balanced budgets and relatively high tax levels to keep the budget balanced. They sought long-term economic growth through entrepreneurship, not tax cuts."
"In state politics, they were strong supporters of state colleges and universities, low tuition and large research budgets. They favored infrastructure improvements, such as highway projects. In foreign policy they were internationalists and anti-communists. They felt the best way to counter communism was sponsoring economic growth (through foreign aid), maintaining a strong military and keeping close ties to NATO. Geographically their base was the Northeast, from Maine to Pennsylvania, where they had the support of major corporations and banks and worked well with labor unions."
"The moderate Republicans were top-heavy, with a surplus of high visibility national leaders and a shortage of grass roots workers. Most of all they lacked the numbers, the enthusiasm and excitement the conservatives could mobilize—the moderates decided it must be an un-American level of fanaticism that drove their opponents. Doug Bailey, a senior Rockefeller aide recalled, ""there was a mentality in [Rockefeller's] campaign staff that, 'Look, we have got all this money. We should be able to buy the people necessary to get this done. And you buy from the top down'"". Bailey discovered that the Rockefeller team never understood that effective political organizations are empowered from the bottom up, not the top down."
"Barry Goldwater crusaded against the Rockefeller Republicans, beating Rockefeller narrowly in the California primary of 1964 giving the Arizona senator, all of the California delegates and a majority at the presidential nominating convention. The election was a disaster for the conservatives, but the Goldwater activists now controlled large swaths of the GOP and they had no intention of retreating. The stage was set for a conservative takeover, based in the South and West, in opposition to the Northeast. Ronald Reagan continued in the same theme. George H. W. Bush was more closely associated with the moderates, but his son George W. Bush was firmly allied with the conservatives."
"From its inception in 1854 to 1964, when Senate Republicans pushed hard for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against a filibuster by Senate Democrats, the GOP had a reputation for supporting blacks and minorities. In 1869, the Republican-controlled legislature in Wyoming Territory and its Republican governor John Allen Campbell made it the first jurisdiction to grant voting rights to women. In 1875, California swore in the first Hispanic governor, Republican Romualdo Pacheco. In 1916, Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman in Congress—and indeed the first woman in any high level government position. In 1928, New Mexico elected the first Hispanic U.S. Senator, Republican Octaviano Larrazolo. In 1898, the first Jewish U.S. Senator elected from outside of the former Confederacy was Republican Joseph Simon of Oregon. In 1924, the first Jewish woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives was Republican Florence Kahn of California. In 1928, the Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Charles Curtis of Kansas, who grew up on the Kaw Indian reservation, became the first person of significant non-European ancestry to be elected to national office, as Vice President of the United States for Herbert Hoover."
"Blacks generally identified with the GOP until the 1930s. Every African American who served in the U.S. House of Representatives before 1935 and all of the African Americans who served in the Senate before 1979, were Republicans. Frederick Douglass after the Civil War and Booker T. Washington in the early 20th century were prominent Republican spokesmen. In 1966, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts became the first African American popularly elected to the United States Senate."
"Some critics, most notably Dan Carter, have alleged that the rapid growth in Republican strength in the South came from a secretly coded message to Wallacites and segregationists that the GOP was a racist anti-black party seeking their votes. Political scientists and historians point out that the timing does not fit the Southern strategy model. Nixon carried 49 states in 1972, so he operated a successful national rather than regional strategy, but the Republican Party remained quite weak at the local and state level across the entire South for decades. Matthew Lassiter argues that Nixon's appeal was not to the Wallacites or segregationists, but rather to the rapidly emerging suburban middle-class. Many had Northern antecedents and they wanted rapid economic growth and saw the need to put backlash politics to rest. Lassiter says the Southern strategy was a ""failure"" for the GOP and that the Southern base of the Republican Party ""always depended more on the middle-class corporate economy and on the top-down politics of racial backlash"". Furthermore, ""realignment in the South quote came primarily from the suburban ethos of New South metropolises such as Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, not to the exportation of the working-class racial politics of the Black Belt""."
"The South's transition to a Republican stronghold took decades and happened incrementally, with national politics gradually influencing state and local politics. First the states started voting Republican in presidential elections—the Democrats countered that by nominating Southerners who could carry some states in the region, such as Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. However, the strategy narrowly failed with Al Gore in 2000. The states began electing Republican senators to fill open seats caused by retirements and finally governors and state legislatures changed sides. Georgia was the last state to shift to the GOP, with Republican Sonny Perdue taking the governorship in 2002. Republicans aided the process with redistricting that protected the African-American and Hispanic vote (as required by the Civil Rights laws), but split up the remaining white Democrats so that Republicans mostly would win."
"In addition to its white middle class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities from the evangelical Christian community and from Southern pockets of traditionalist Roman Catholics in South Louisiana. The national Democratic Party's support for liberal social stances such as abortion drove many white Southerners into a Republican Party that was embracing the conservative views on these issues. Conversely, liberal voters in the northeast began to join the Democratic Party."
"In 1969, Kevin Phillips argued in ""The Emerging Republican Majority"" that support from Southern whites and growth in the South, among other factors, was driving an enduring Republican electoral realignment. In the early 21st century, the South was generally solidly Republican in state elections and mostly solidly Republican in presidential contests. In 2005, political scientists Nicholas A. Valentino and David O. Sears argued that partisanship at that time was driven by disagreements on the size of government, national security and moral issues, while racial issues played a smaller role."

Mora described his reaction to learning of the authorization for coercive interrogation techniques in these words:
"To my mind, there's no moral or practical distinction [between cruelty and torture]. If cruelty is no longer declared unlawful, but instead is applied as a matter of policy, it alters the fundamental relationship of man to government. It destroys the whole notion of individual rights. The Constitution recognizes that man has an inherent right, not bestowed by the state or laws, to personal dignity, including the right to be free of cruelty. It applies to all human beings, not just in America—even those designated as 'unlawful enemy combatants.' If you make this exception, the whole Constitution crumbles. It's a transformative issue...<br> Besides, my mother would have killed me if I hadn't spoken up. No Hungarian after Communism, or Cuban after Castro, is not aware that human rights are incompatible with cruelty. The debate here isn't only how to protect the country. It’s how to protect our values."""
"Mora and Brant met with Rear Admiral Michael Lohr, the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, and Dr. Michael Gelles, the Chief Psychologist of the NCIS, and learned more about the Guantanamo interrogation practices, and determined that they were ""unlawful and unworthy of the military services"", and that they would investigate further."
"Mora obtained a copy of a request by the commander of JT-170, Major General Michael Dunlavey, to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for authorization to apply extraordinary interrogation techniques, including ""stress positions, hooding, isolation, 'deprivation of light and auditory stimuli', and use of 'detainee-individual phobias (such as fear of dogs) to induce stress; a legal brief accompanying the request that supported the legality of such techniques, by the Senior Judge Advocate to JT-170, Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver; and an approval of the request by Rumsfeld. The legal brief held that ""cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment could be inflicted on the Guantanamo detainees with near impunity""."
"Mora found the brief to be ""a wholly inadequate analysis of the law"" and that the approved request was ""fatally grounded on these serious failures of legal analysis"" because it provided no bright line standard for what techniques would be prohibited; the techniques it approved ""could produce effects reaching the level of torture""; and that ""even if the techniques as applied did not reach the level of torture, they almost certainly would constitute 'cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and either way would be unlawful."
"In the following weeks, Mora actively argued with a large number of the most senior lawyers and officials of the military and the Defense Department that the interrogation techniques that had been approved were unlawful. On January 15, 2003, he received word from William Haynes, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, that Rumsfeld would be suspending the authority for the extraordinary interrogation techniques later that day. Mora was ""delighted"" and ""reported the news widely""."
"Two days later, Rumsfeld directed Haynes to establish a Working Group to develop a new set of guidelines for interrogation techniques, headed by Mary L. Walker, General Counsel of the Air Force. Mora worked actively to establish interrogation guidelines prohibiting coercive interrogation techniques, citing scientific evidence that they were ineffective, as well as legal arguments that they were unlawful."
"However, early in the process, the Working Group was provided with a legal brief from the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), and told they should follow its guidance. This was the same brief that later became infamous as the ""Torture Memo"", largely written by OLC deputy director John Yoo."
"Mora regarded the OLC memo as lengthy and seemingly sophisticated, but otherwise identical to the Beaver brief he had already argued against. Mora argued against the conclusions of the OLC memo, arguing that the OLC memo was ""fundamentally in error"" and ""virtually useless as guidance... and dangerous."" With Walker's encouragement to share his views, he circulated an opposing draft memo, entitled ""Proposed Alternative Approach to Interrogations""."
"But, according to Mora, contributions from members of the Working Group began to be rejected if they did not conform to what was already in the OLC memo, and Walker, the head of the Working Group, said of his arguments, ""I disagree and moreover I believe [the General Counsel of the Defense Department] disagrees."" Mora evaluated the work being prepared by the Working Group as containing ""profound mistakes in its legal analysis"" and as ""unacceptable"". Mora met with DOD General Counsel Haynes who disagreed with Mora's arguments."
"Walker invited the author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and civilian at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so for the safety of the nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put in a drawer and ""never... see the light of day again."" The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis."
"After that, Mora never saw a final report of the Working Group, and assumed that it had been abandoned. He learned otherwise only in May 2004, when he heard it referenced in televised reports on the Abu Ghraib scandal, and received confirmation from the Deputy General Counsel of the Air Force that a final draft of the Working Group's report had been signed out and delivered to the Joint Task Force Guantanamo commander, Major General Geoffrey Miller, who had also been subsequently sent to Abu Ghraib to ""Gitmo-ize"" it. Mora is a Senior Fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University."
"For his efforts, Mora was honored with the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2006, which is administered by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation."
= = = History of the United States Republican Party = = =
"The Republican Party, also referred to as the GOP (""Grand Old party""), is one of the world's oldest extant political parties. It is the second-oldest existing political party in the United States; its chief rival, the Democratic Party, is the oldest."
"The Republican Party emerged in 1854 to combat the Kansas–Nebraska Act and the expansion of slavery into American territories. The early Republican Party consisted of African-Americans, northern white Protestants, businessmen, professionals, factory workers, and farmers. The GOP was pro-business, and it supported banks, the gold standard, railroads and high tariffs; the party opposed the expansion of slavery. At its inception, Republican Party had almost no presence in the Southern United States; by 1858, however it had enlisted former Whigs and former Free Soil Democrats to form majorities in nearly every Northern state."
"With the election of Abraham Lincoln (the first Republican President) in 1860, the Party's success in guiding the Union to victory in the American Civil War, and the Party's role in the abolition of slavery, the Republican Party largely dominated the national political scene until 1932. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt formed the Progressive (""Bull Moose"") Party after being rejected by the GOP and ran unsuccessfully as a third-party presidential candidate calling for social reforms. After 1912, many Roosevelt supporters left the Party, and the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right. The GOP lost its congressional majorities during the Great Depression (1929–1940); under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democrats formed a winning New Deal coalition that was dominant from 1932 through 1964."
"After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the party's core base shifted, with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic. White voters increasingly identified with the Republican Party after the 1960s. Following the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in ""Roe v. Wade"", the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals. The Republican Party won five of the six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988. Two-term President Ronald Reagan, who held office from 1981 to 1989, was a transformative party leader whose conservative policies called for reduced government spending and regulation, lower taxes and a strong anti-Soviet Union foreign policy. Reagan's influence upon the party persisted into the next century."
"Since the 1990s, the Party's support has chiefly come from the South, the Great Plains, the Mountain States and rural areas in the North. The 21st century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism. The GOP supports lower taxes, free market capitalism, a strong national defense, gun rights, deregulation and restrictions on labor unions; it opposes abortion. In addition to advocating for conservative economic policies, the Republican Party is socially conservative. There have been 19 Republican presidents, the most from any one political party. The most recent, Donald Trump, was elected President in 2016."
"The Republican Party grew out of opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which was signed into law by President Franklin Pierce in 1854. The Act opened Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory to slavery and future admission as slave states, thus implicitly repealing the prohibition on slavery in territory north of 36° 30′ latitude that had been part of the Missouri Compromise. This change was viewed by anti-slavery Northerners as an aggressive, expansionist maneuver by the slave-owning South. Opponents of the Act were intensely motivated and began forming a new party. The Party began as a coalition of anti-slavery Conscience Whigs such as Zachariah Chandler and Free Soil Democrats such as Salmon P. Chase."
"The first anti-Nebraska local meeting where ""Republican"" was suggested as a name for a new anti-slavery party was held in a Ripon, Wisconsin schoolhouse on March 20, 1854. The first statewide convention that formed a platform and nominated candidates under the Republican name was held near Jackson, Michigan, on July 6, 1854. At that convention, the party opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and selected a statewide slate of candidates. The Midwest took the lead in forming state Republican Party tickets; apart from St. Louis and a few areas adjacent to free states, there were no efforts to organize the Party in the southern states."
"New England Yankees, who dominated that region and much of upstate New York and the upper Midwest, were the strongest supporters of the new party. This was especially true for the pietistic Congregationalists and Presbyterians among them and, during the war, many Methodists and Scandinavian Lutherans. The Quakers were a small, tight-knit group that was heavily Republican. By contrast, the liturgical churches (Roman Catholic, Episcopal and German Lutheran) largely rejected the moralism of the Republican Party; most of their adherents voted Democratic."
"The new Republican Party envisioned modernizing the United States, emphasizing expanded banking, more railroads and factories, and giving free western land to farmers (""free soil"") as opposed to letting slave owners buy up the best properties. It vigorously argued that free market labor was superior to slavery and was the very foundation of civic virtue and true republicanism; this was the ""Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men"" ideology. Without using the term ""containment"", the Republican Party in the mid-1850s proposed a system of containing slavery. Historian James Oakes explains the strategy: The federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery."
"The Republican Party launched its first national convention in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on February 22, 1856. The convention elected a governing National Executive Committee and passed resolutions calling for the repeal of laws enabling slaveholding in free territories and ""resistance by Constitutional means of Slavery in any Territory,"" defense of anti-slavery individuals in Kansas who were coming under physical attack, and a call to ""resist and overthrow the present National Administration"" of Franklin Pierce, ""as it is identified with the progress of the Slave power to national supremacy."" Its first national nominating convention held in the summer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. John C. Frémont ran as the first Republican nominee for President in 1856 behind the slogan ""Free soil, free silver, free men, Frémont and victory!"" Although Frémont's bid was unsuccessful, the party showed a strong base. It dominated in New England, New York and the northern Midwest and had a strong presence in the rest of the North. It had almost no support in the South, where it was roundly denounced in 1856–1860 as a divisive force that threatened civil war."
"The Republican Party absorbed many of the previous traditions of its members, who had come from an array of political factions, including Working Men, Locofoco Democrats, Free Soil Democrats, Free Soil Whigs, anti-slavery Know Nothings, Conscience Whigs, and Temperance Reformers of both parties. Many Democrats who joined were rewarded with governorships, or seats in the U.S. Senate, or House of Representatives."
"During the presidential campaign in 1860, at a time of escalating tension between the North and South, Abraham Lincoln addressed the harsh treatment of Republicans in the South in his famous Cooper Union speech: [W]hen you speak of us Republicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to ""Black Republicans."" [...] But you will not abide the election of a Republican president! In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, ""Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!"""
"The election of Lincoln as President in 1860 opened a new era of Republican dominance based in the industrial North and agricultural Midwest. The Third Party System was dominated by the Republican Party (it lost the presidency only in 1884 and 1892). Lincoln proved brilliantly successful in uniting the factions of his party to fight for the Union in the Civil War. However, he usually fought the Radical Republicans who demanded harsher measures. Many conservative Democrats became War Democrats who had a deep belief in American nationalism and supported the war. When Lincoln added the abolition of slavery as a war goal, the Peace Democrats were energized and carried numerous state races, especially in Connecticut, Indiana and Illinois. Democrat Horatio Seymour was elected governor of New York and immediately became a likely presidential candidate."
"Most of the state Republican parties accepted the antislavery goal except Kentucky. During the American Civil War, the party passed major legislation in Congress to promote rapid modernization, including a national banking system, high tariffs, the first temporary income tax (subsequently ruled unconstitutional in ""Springer v. United States""), many excise taxes, paper money issued without backing (""greenbacks""), a huge national debt, homestead laws, railroads and aid to education and agriculture."
"The Republicans denounced the peace-oriented Democrats as disloyal Copperheads and won enough War Democrats to maintain their majority in 1862. In 1864, they formed a coalition with many War Democrats as the National Union Party. Lincoln chose Democrat Andrew Johnson as his running mate and was easily re-elected. During the war, upper-middle-class men in major cities formed Union Leagues to promote and help finance the war effort. Following the 1864 elections, Radical Republicans Led by Charles Sumner in the Senate and Thaddeus Stevens in the House set the agenda by demanding more aggressive action against slavery and more vengeance toward the Confederates."
"Under Republican congressional leadership, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution—which banned slavery in the United States—passed the Senate in 1864 and the House in 1865; it was ratified in December 1865. In 1865, the Confederacy surrendered, ending the Civil War. Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865; following his death, Andrew Johnson took office as President of the United States."

= = = Battle of Brenta = = =
"The Battle of Brenta was fought between the cavalry of the Kingdom of Italy under king Berengar I and the Hungarians, hired by the East Francian king Arnulf of Carinthia, against him, at an unidentified location in northern Italian Peninsula along the river Brenta on 24 September 899. It was one of the earliest battles of the Hungarian invasions of Europe. The result was a crushing defeat for Berengar I, opening the following raids for the Hungarians against Italy. The Hungarian invasion resulted in the burning of many cities, like Feltre, Vercelli, Modena and monasteries like the monastery in Nonantola, and attacking even Venice, however without success."
"In the meantime Berengar's arch enemy, Arnulf of Carinthia died in December 899, as a result the Hungarians, whom he hired against the Italian king, left the kingdom in the next year with all their plunders, not before concluding peace with Berengar, who gave them many hostages and ""gifts"". On their way home the Hungarians made an ""amphibious assault"", a unique achievement from an exclusively land army in the pre-modern times, crossing the Adriatic Sea in order to attack Venice."
"In some historians' opinion the returning army had a role also in the conquering of Pannonia, as part of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin, from the Bavarians by the Hungarians in late 900."
"Many contemporary sources mention this battle, like the ""Chronicon"" of Regino of Prüm, the ""Annales Fuldenses"", the ""Chronicon Sagornini"" of John the Deacon, ""Catalogus abbatum nonantulorum"", etc. The most important source is ""Antapodosis, seu rerum per Europam gestarum"", written by Liutprand of Cremona, which gives the most detailed description of the events which led to the battle and battle itself."
"At the end of the IX. century the Carolingian Empire of Charlemagne was long gone, in its place remained three kingdoms (West Francia, East Francia, Kingdom of Italy), led by kings of Carolingian bloodline, which disputed the supremacy among them. Arnulf of Carinthia, the son of the East Francian king Carloman, who became German king in 887, wanted to recreate the Carolingian Empire, thus in 894, as result of his Italian campaign, became King of Italy, and in 896 he was even crowned as Holy Roman Emperor at Rome by the pope. To his goals in Italy he was helped by Berengar of Friuli, the grandson of Charlemagne, who after 898 started to see himself more worthy for the title of emperor, because he considered himself as a truer Carolingian than Arnulf, considering the latter to be an illegitimate son of Carloman."
"Berengar was king of Italy from 888 but lost his lands to Guy III of Spoleto who proclaimed himself king of Italy and emperor. Berengar was saved by the intervention of Arnulf of Carinthia in 894, defeating Guy of Spoleto, who died shortly after. Arnulf in 896, crowned himself as King of Italy (and emperor), but named his illegitimate son Ratold as sub-king of Italy. Ratold and Berengar agreed to divide Italy between themselves, but shortly after they started to fight for supremacy. Ratold died unexpectedly, so Berengar remained as single ruler, and started to aspire for the title of emperor. Aware of this, Arnulf, very ill, could not go personally in campaign in Italy, but concluded an alliance with the leaders of the Hungarians, who in 895-896 occupied the Eastern parts of the Carpathian Basin, convincing them to send an army to attack Berengar. Arnulf was accused by enemies that he concluded the alliance with the Hungarians by cutting a dog and a wolf in two. This was the way of making alliances by the nomadic people, the parties swearing that they will keep the alliance, and cursed themselves to die like the animals they cut in a half, if they break their oath. So, probably beside the Christian way, about which the chronicles do not write anything, Arnulf had to conclude this alliance also in the Hungarians ""pagan"" way. This shows that Arnulf was aware of the Hungarian danger for the Eastern provinces of his realm: mainly the March of Pannonia. So with this alliance had two purposes: to punish Berengar and to divert their energies far away from Pannonia, so at least for a while he could be assured that they will not attack him. And of course, maybe he hoped that these two dangerous neighbours will weaken each other."
"Hungarian armies never went to Italy before. Military intelligence was one of the most important features of nomadic warfare. Starting a war without knowing the enemies power, number of soldiers, will to fight, etc., was unimaginable in the nomadic societies. This is why in late October 898 they sent a light armored, quick moving small unit on reconnaissance, which crossed Pannonia on their way to Northern Italy, then arrived in Italy in Friuli. They camped three days with their tents near the river Brenta, sending their scouts in small groups to reconnoitre the land, its wealth, the number and the fighting spirit of the enemy troops, the routes of attack and retreat, the places which can be chosen as battlefields, where the most spoils are to find, the number of the cities, castles and the strength of their defence system. It is certain that the place of the future battle was chosen during this minor incursion. We do not know the exact numbers of this scout unit, but according to Marco Polo, in the Mongolian Empire the reconnaissance units were composed of 200 riders. So we can presume that the Hungarian scout unit, which went in 898 into Italy, had a number around 100-200. After three days the small groups they sent in every direction, returned, analyzed the information they gained, then returned home."
"As Liutprand of Cremona mentions, after returning home, the Hungarians used the winter to prepare their weapons, sharpen their arrowheads, and to teach to the youth how to fight. Then in 899, a Hungarian army, crossing Pannonia, headed to Italy. The historians do not agree about the road they took. Gyula Kristó argues that they bypassed Pannonia, and went westwards following the courses of the rivers Sava and Drava, and entering Italy near Aquileia, on the road named after them ""Strata Hungarorum"", due to the fact that they used it so often during the next decades and centuries. According to István Bóna, the Hungarian army, with the permission of Arnulf, crossed Pannonia, then headed towards Italy on the ancient road Via Gemina, which linked the ancient cities Celeia, Ljubljana and Aquileia, arrived in Italy. The historians' opinions differ also about the period of the year in which the Hungarian army arrived to Italy. According to Kristó, basing on the account of Liutprand, they arrived in February–March. Bóna believes, according to the account of ""Catalogus abbatum nonantulorum"" that they arrived in August 899."
"They entered Italy they passed next to the big walls of Aquileia, without attacking it, then scattered in smaller units, spread in many directions, attacking the surroundings of Treviso, Vicenza, Verona, Brescia, Bergamo, Milano, Pavia, destroying Feltre, one of their unit reaching in the West even the Great St Bernard Pass. Usually the Hungarian nomadic warriors did not attack the castles and big cities surrounded by walls, because they were not skilled in sieges, and having no siege machinery, so they plundered and burned monasteries, gathering spoils in the way."
"As Liutprand of Cremona mentions, hearing about the apparition of the Hungarians in his kingdom, Berengar I. was very surprised how this army from a nation, about which he never heard of, appeared so suddenly. Then he sent envoys and letters in every corners of his country demanding to everybody to send their troops to him to fight the Hungarians. After all his troops gathered his army became three times bigger than the Magyar army. According to ""Chronicon Sagornini"" of John the Deacon, the Italian army was 15,000, so we can conclude, that the Hungarians were 5,000. This number could be exaggerated, like the medieval chroniclers often did with the numbers of the armies, but the affirmation that the Italians were three times more than the Hungarians, has no reason not to be accepted, because usually the chroniclers exaggerate the number of the enemy armies and diminish the number of the troops of their own, so we can accept that the Italians heavily outnumbered the Hungarians. Noticing his superiority, Berengar started to think too much of himself, and instead of attacking the Hungarian army immediately, he spent his time in a town carousing with his men. This gave time to the Hungarian troops, scattered to plunder in every corner of the Italian kingdom, to retreat towards the gathering place, one precisely not specified place on the bank of the river Brenta, which, as shown before, probably was chosen from the beginning to be the place of the battle. Seeing this, king Berengar thought that they were frightened from the number of his troops, and started to chase them, thinking that he already won. His mounted troops even managed to surprise a Hungarian troop and force it to cross in haste the river Adda causing the drowning of many of them. But generally the retreat was a success, because the Hungarians light armors and weapons (the commoners, who usually made the pillaging raids, wear no or just leather armours, only the leaders had lamellar armours, their weapons were always composite bows, the hand-to-hand weapons were sabres, and rarely battle axes or maces) enabled their horses to be more rapid than the heavy armored and weaponed Carolingian type Italian cavalry. The Hungarians retreated on the old Roman road Via Postumia towards the future battlefield."
"The Hungarians retreat also served as was part of their psychological warfare, which had the goal to induce self-confidence in Berengar and the belief that he already won the war against them, with this lulling his vigilance. To augment this they sent envoys to Berengar, which promised that they will renounce to all of their plunders, and asked only their safe return to their homeland, but the over confident Berengar and his commanders refused this, believing that it will be an easy task to make them all prisoners. Although the chronicler Liutprand believes that the Hungarians were frightened, hopeless, and just wanted to escape alive, but the modern historians realized that this was only a clever role playing in order to induce the Italians in the mood, which eased their future defeat. The role playing of the Hungarian army was almost exposed when the Italian vanguard reached the Hungarian rearguard at the ""wide fields"" of Verona and forced it to fight, and the Magyars were forced to defeat the Italians, in order to escape, although probably it was not among the commanders' plans to expose their strength before the final battle. But when Berengar's main forces arrived, the Hungarian rearguard ran away, continuing its retreat. But Berengar did not took this sign too serious, and continued to chase the fleeing Hungarians."
"After this long pursuit, on 24 September 899, the Hungarians and the Italians arrived to the river Brenta, after the ""most ingenious planned flight of the world history"", as István Bóna points. He probably names this retreat so, because of the multiple results it produced:"
"The nomadic armies used the tactic of feigned retreat very often in the ancient and medieval times, and the Hungarians were masters of it, using it in many battles of the period of their invasions of Europe (899-970). Liutprand mentions that the horses of the Hungarians were very tired, but they had the strength to cross the river before the Italians arrived, so Brenta separated the two armies from each other. The heavily armored Italians could not pass the river so easily, so they remained on the other side, and both armies assembled their battle lines on the both sides of the river."
"Then the Hungarians again sent envoys to the Italian side, this time with even more alluring propositions for the Italians; in return for their safe return home, they promised to give them everything: prisoners, equipment, weapons, horses, keeping only one for each of them for their homecoming. To show how serious they are about this proposal, they promised that they will never return to Italy, and as guarantees for this, they will send their own sons to the Italians. With these exaggerate but still unacceptable promises (knowing that Berengar will not accept their departure after the destruction they caused, and would want to take them all prisoners), the Hungarians managed to totally convince the king that their fate depends only from his goodwill. So the Italians responded harshly, threatening them, probably wanting their total surrender."
"The Hungarians waited for this moment. The Italians assembled a fortified camp, which however was not sufficiently guarded, left their guard down, and many of them started to eat and drink, to refresh after the long and exhausting pursuit, waiting the continuation of the negotiations, because Berengar thought that the Magyars are too weak and tired to fight, so they are at his mercy. But at the other side of the Brenta river was probably not only the tired, pursued Magyar army group, but other Hungarian troops too which at the start of the campaign, were sent in other directions to plunder, and in the meantime they returned for the battle, and also those who remained in their permanent camp placed in that very place from the beginning of the campaign, because it was chosen a year ago in their reconnaissance incursion. In their campaigns in Europe, the Hungarians in every country they stayed longer, chose a place to be their permanent camp during their stay in the region (in 926 the Abbey of Saint Gall, in 937 in France the Abbey of Saint Basolus near Verzy, in the same year the meadows of Galliano near Capua, where they stood for 12 days), so knowing these, it is highly probable, that the principal camp and the rallying point of the Hungarians was on the meadows near the Brenta river. So, without Berengar's knowledge, on the other side of the river were a great number of fresh troops with fresh horses, which just waited to start the battle."
"When the Italians were totally unaware and relaxed, the Hungarians sent three troops to cross the river on some remote places, and to place themselves on different strategical points around the Italian camp. When these units took their places, the main Hungarian army crossed the river, at an area away from the detection of the Italians, and directly charged the unsuspecting Italians outside the camp, starting a massacre among them."
"The majority of the Italians were in the fortified camp, eating and drinking, when the three Hungarian units sent in ambush, encircled the camp and started to shoot arrows, and caught the Italians so off guard, that Liutprand writes that many of them still ate in the moment, when the Hungarians arrows, or lances pierced the food in their throats. Of course, Liutprand could be exaggerating when he writes that the Italians were killed with the food in their throats, but nevertheless he expresses with this image the total surprise caused by the Hungarian attack to the Italians. This simultaneous attack on the Italians inside and outside of the camp, prevented them from helping each other. The Hungarians who attacked the camp, destroyed the defences preventing the Italians from barricading themselves in the camp, shot continuously arrows on the Italians trapped in it, and probably waited for the main army to finish the Italians outside, then they stormed together inside the fortified camp, because the Italians, due to their surprise and terror, were in impossibility to organize a defence of it, and started a slaughter. The Italians were totally off guard, and was impossible for them to organize a resistance, being caught in this way, so the only option was to flee. But when some of them arrived to the place where their horses were camped, they saw that it was already taken by Hungarian warriors, so these Italians were massacred by them. Probably one of the three Hungarian units sent before to encircle the Italian camp had the duty to occupy the stables before the battle even started."
"Some Italians tried to stay away from the little pockets of fight, where groups of their fellows tried to resist, hoping that if they show themselves peaceful and friends to the Hungarians, they will be spared, but they too were massacred."
"The Hungarians, after crushing all tiny attempts of resistance, showed no mercy to the Italians, who in the course of the days spent in chasing them, then after their arriving to the Brenta river, when they sent their envoys asking for an agreement, insulted them so many times, so they killed even those who wanted to surrender."
"The number of the Italian losses was huge. Annales Fuldenses show the number of the Italians killed as 20,000 men. This is of course an exaggerated number, knowing that the Italian army composed maximum 15,000 men, but shows that the losses were really high. ""Catalogus abbatum nonantulorum"" writes about thousands of Christian deaths, the ""Chronicon"" of Regino of Prüm writes about the uncountable masses of the people killed with arrows, or ""Chronicon Sagornini"" of John the Deacon points that ""few of them [the Italians] turned back home"". The Hungarian losses were low, since they encountered almost no resistance."
"King Berengar managed to escape to Pavia, changing his dress with the clothing of one of his soldiers."
"This battle is a vivid example of the ingenuity and the multitude of methods and strategies which the armies of the nomadic societies used in order to achieve victory including choosing the right battlefield which assured superiority over the enemy days or weeks before the battle, deceiving military moves, psychological warfare, the importance of surprise attacks and preponderance of archery in the battle."
"Thousand of performances of William Shakespeare's plays have been staged since the end of the 16th century. While Shakespeare was alive, many of his greatest plays were performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men and King's Men acting companies at the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres. Among the actors of these original performances were Richard Burbage (who played the title role in the first performances of ""Hamlet"", ""Othello"", ""Richard III"" and ""King Lear""), Richard Cowley, and William Kempe."
"Shakespeare's plays continued to be staged after his death until the Interregnum (1642–1660), when most public stage performances were banned by the Puritan rulers. After the English Restoration, Shakespeare's plays were performed in playhouses, with elaborate scenery, and staged with music, dancing, thunder, lightning, wave machines, and fireworks. During this time the texts were ""reformed"" and ""improved"" for the stage, an undertaking which has seemed shockingly disrespectful to posterity."
"Victorian productions of Shakespeare often sought pictorial effects in ""authentic"" historical costumes and sets. The staging of the reported sea fights and barge scene in ""Antony and Cleopatra"" was one spectacular example. Such elaborate scenery for the frequently changing locations in Shakespeare's plays often led to a loss of pace. Towards the end of the 19th century, William Poel led a reaction against this heavy style. In a series of ""Elizabethan"" productions on a thrust stage, he paid fresh attention to the structure of the drama. In the early 20th century, Harley Granville-Barker directed quarto and folio texts with few cuts, while Edward Gordon Craig and others called for abstract staging. Both approaches have influenced the variety of Shakespearean production styles seen today."
"The troupe for which Shakespeare wrote his earliest plays is not known with certainty; the title page of the 1594 edition of ""Titus Andronicus"" reveals that it had been acted by three different companies. After the plagues of 1592–93, Shakespeare's plays were performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a new company of which Shakespeare was a founding member, at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames. Londoners flocked there to see the first part of ""Henry IV"", Leonard Digges recalling, ""Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room"". When the landlord of the Theatre announced that he would not renew the company's lease, they pulled the playhouse down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first London playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark. The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with ""Julius Caesar"" one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including ""Hamlet"", ""Othello"" and ""King Lear""."
"The Globe, like London's other open-roofed public theatres, employed a thrust-stage, covered by a cloth canopy. A two-storey facade at the rear of the stage hid the tiring house and, through windows near the top of the facade, opportunities for balcony scenes such as the one in ""Romeo and Juliet"". Doors at the bottom of the facade may have been used for discovery scenes like that at the end of ""The Tempest"". A trap door in the stage itself could be used for stage business, like some of that involving the ghost in ""Hamlet"". This trapdoor area was called ""hell"", as the canopy above was called ""heaven"""
"Less is known about other features of staging and production. Stage props seem to have been minimal, although costuming was as elaborate as was feasible. The ""two hours' traffic"" mentioned in the prologue to ""Romeo and Juliet"" was not fanciful; the city government's hostility meant that performances were officially limited to that length of time. Though it is not known how seriously companies took such injunctions, it seems likely either that plays were performed at near-breakneck speed or that the play-texts now extant were cut for performance, or both."
"The other main theatre where Shakespeare's original plays were performed was the second Blackfriars Theatre, an indoor theatre built by James Burbage, father of Richard Burbage, and impresario of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. However, neighborhood protests kept Burbage from using the theater for the Lord Chamberlain's Men performances for a number of years. After the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new court of King James. Performance records are patchy, but it is known that the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605, including two performances of ""The Merchant of Venice"". In 1608 the King's Men (as the company was then known) took possession of the Blackfriars Theatre. After 1608, the troupe performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer. The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean vogue for lavishly staged masques, created new conditions for performance which enabled Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In ""Cymbeline"", for example, Jupiter descends ""in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees."" Plays produced at the indoor theater presumably also made greater use of sound effects and music."
"A fragment of the naval captain William Keeling's diary survives, in which he details his crew's shipboard performances of ""Hamlet"" (off the coast of Sierra Leone, 5 September 1607, and at Socotra, 31 March 1608), and ""Richard II"" (Sierra Leone, 30 September 1607). For a time after its discovery, the fragment was suspected of being a forgery, but is now generally accepted as genuine. These are the first recorded amateur performances of any Shakespeare plays."
"On 29 June 1613, the Globe Theatre went up in flames during a performance of ""Henry VIII"". A theatrical cannon, set off during the performance, misfired, igniting the wooden beams and thatching. According to one of the few surviving documents of the event, no one was hurt except a man who put out his burning breeches with a bottle of ale. The event pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision. Sir Henry Wotton recorded that the play ""was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony"". The theatre was rebuilt but, like all the other theatres in London, the Globe was closed down by the Puritans in 1642."
"The actors in Shakespeare's company included Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including ""Richard III"", ""Hamlet"", ""Othello"", and ""King Lear"". The popular comic actor Will Kempe played Peter in ""Romeo and Juliet"" and Dogberry in ""Much Ado About Nothing"", among other parts. He was replaced around the turn of the 16th century by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in ""As You Like It"" and the fool in ""King Lear"". Little is certainly known about acting styles. Critics praised the best actors for their naturalness. Scorn was heaped on ranters and on those who ""tore a passion to tatters"", as Hamlet has it. Also with Hamlet, playwrights complain of clowns who improvise on stage (modern critics often blame Kemp in particular in this regard). In the older tradition of comedy which reached its apex with Richard Tarlton, clowns, often the main draw of a troupe, were responsible for creating comic by-play. By the Jacobean era, that type of humor had been supplanted by verbal wit."
"Shakespeare's plays continued to be staged after his death until the Interregnum (1642–1660), when most public stage performances were banned by the Puritan rulers. While denied the use of the stage, costumes and scenery, actors still managed to ply their trade by performing ""drolls"" or short pieces of larger plays that usually ended with some type of jig. Shakespeare was among the many playwrights whose works were plundered for these scenes. Among the drolls taken from Shakespeare were ""Bottom the Weaver"" (Bottom's scenes from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"") and ""The Grave-makers"" (the gravedigger's scene from ""Hamlet"")."
"At the Restoration in 1660, Shakespeare's plays were divided between the two newly licensed companies: the King's Company of Thomas Killigrew and the Duke's Men of William Davenant. The licensing system prevailed for two centuries; from 1660 to 1843, only two main companies regularly presented Shakespeare in London. Davenant, who had known early-Stuart actors such as John Lowin and Joseph Taylor, was the main figure establishing some continuity with earlier traditions; his advice to his actors is thus of interest as possible reflections of original practices."
"On the whole, though, innovation was the order of the day for Restoration companies. John Downes reports that the King's Men initially included some Caroline actors; however, the forced break of the Interregnum divided both companies from the past. Restoration actors performed on proscenium stages, often in the evening, between six and nine. Set-design and props became more elaborate and variable. Perhaps most noticeably, boy players were replaced by actresses. The audiences of comparatively expensive indoor theaters were richer, better educated, and more homogeneous than the diverse, often unruly crowds at the Globe. Davenant's company began at the Salisbury Court Theatre, then moved to the theater at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and finally settled in the Dorset Garden Theatre. Killigrew began at Gibbon's Tennis Court before settling into Christopher Wren's new theatre in Drury Lane. Patrons of both companies expected fare quite different from what had pleased Elizabethans. For tragedy, their tastes ran to heroic drama; for comedy, to the comedy of manners. Though they liked Shakespeare, they seem to have wished his plays to conform to these preferences."
"Restoration writers obliged them by adapting Shakespeare's plays freely. Writers such as William Davenant and Nahum Tate rewrote some of Shakespeare's plays to suit the tastes of the day, which favoured the courtly comedy of Beaumont and Fletcher and the neo-classical rules of drama. In 1681, Tate provided ""The History of King Lear"", a modified version of Shakespeare's original tragedy with a happy ending. According to Stanley Wells, Tate's version ""supplanted Shakespeare's play in every performance given from 1681 to 1838,"" when William Charles Macready played Lear from a shortened and rearranged version of Shakespeare's text. ""Twas my good fortune"", Tate said, ""to light on one expedient to rectify what was wanting in the regularity and probability of the tale, which was to run through the whole a love betwixt Edgar and Cordelia that never changed words with each other in the original""."
"Tate's ""Lear"" remains famous as an example of an ill-conceived adaptation arising from insensitivity to Shakespeare's tragic vision. Tate's genius was not in language – many of his interpolated lines don't even scan – but in structure; his Lear begins brilliantly with the Edmund the Bastard's first attention-grabbing speech, and ends with Lear's heroic saving of Cordelia in the prison and a restoration of justice to the throne. Tate's worldview, and that of the theatrical world that embraced (and demanded) his ""happy ending"" versions of the Bard's tragic works (such as ""King Lear"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"") for over a century, arose from a profoundly different sense of morality in society and of the role that theatre and art should play within that society. Tate's versions of Shakespeare see the responsibility of theatre as a transformative agent for positive change by holding a moral mirror up to our baser instincts. Tate's versions of what we now consider some of the Bard's greatest works dominated the stage throughout the 18th century precisely because the Ages of Enlightenment and Reason found Shakespeare's ""tragic vision"" immoral, and his tragic works unstageable. Tate is seldom performed today, though in 1985, the Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted a successful production of ""The History of King Lear"" at The Shakespeare Center, heralded by some as a ""Lear for the Age of Ronald Reagan."""
"Perhaps a more typical example of the purpose of Restoration revisions is Davenant's ""The Law Against Lovers"", a 1662 comedy combining the main plot of ""Measure for Measure"" with subplot of ""Much Ado About Nothing"". The result is a snapshot of Restoration comic tastes. Beatrice and Benedick are brought in to parallel Claudio and Hero; the emphasis throughout is on witty conversation, and Shakespeare's thematic focus on lust is steadily downplayed. The play ends with three marriages: Benedick's to Beatrice, Claudio's to Hero, and Isabella's to an Angelo whose attempt on Isabella's virtue was a ploy. Davenant wrote many of the bridging scenes and recast much of Shakespeare's verse as heroic couplets."
"A final feature of Restoration stagecraft impacted productions of Shakespeare. The taste for opera that the exiles had developed in France made its mark on Shakespeare as well. Davenant and John Dryden worked ""The Tempest"" into an opera, ""The Tempest, or The Enchanted Island""; their work featured a sister for Miranda, a man, Hippolito, who has never seen a woman, and another paired marriage at the end. It also featured many songs, a spectacular shipwreck scene, and a masque of flying cupids. Other of Shakespeare's works given operatic treatment included ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (as ""The Fairy-Queen"" in 1692) and Charles Gildon's ""Measure for Measure"" (by way of an elaborate masque.)"
"However ill-guided such revisions may seem now, they made sense to the period's dramatists and audiences. The dramatists approached Shakespeare not as bardolators, but as theater professionals. Unlike Beaumont and Fletcher, whose ""plays are now the most pleasant and frequent entertainments of the stage"", according to Dryden in 1668, ""two of theirs being acted through the year for one of Shakespeare's or Jonson's"", Shakespeare appeared to them to have become dated. Yet almost universally, they saw him as worth updating. Though most of these revised pieces failed on stage, many remained current on stage for decades; Thomas Otway's Roman adaptation of ""Romeo and Juliet"", for example, seems to have driven Shakespeare's original from the stage between 1680 and 1744. It was in large part the revised Shakespeare that took the lead place in the repertory in the early 18th century, while Beaumont and Fletcher's share steadily declined."
"The 18th century witnessed three major changes in the production of Shakespeare's plays. In England, the development of the star system transformed both acting and production; at the end of the century, the Romantic revolution touched acting as it touched all the arts. At the same time, actors and producers began to return to Shakespeare's texts, slowly weeding out the Restoration revisions. Finally, by the end of the century Shakespeare's plays had been established as part of the repertory outside of Great Britain: not only in the United States but in many European countries."
"In the 18th century, Shakespeare dominated the London stage, while Shakespeare productions turned increasingly into the creation of star turns for star actors. After the Licensing Act of 1737, one fourth of the plays performed were by Shakespeare, and on at least two occasions rival London playhouses staged the very same Shakespeare play at the same time (""Romeo and Juliet"" in 1755 and ""King Lear"" the next year) and still commanded audiences. This occasion was a striking example of the growing prominence of Shakespeare stars in the theatrical culture, the big attraction being the competition and rivalry between the male leads at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, Spranger Barry and David Garrick. In the 1740s, Charles Macklin, in roles such as Malvolio and Shylock, and David Garrick, who won fame as Richard III in 1741, helped make Shakespeare truly popular. Garrick went on to produce 26 of the plays at Drury Lane Theatre between 1747 and 1776, and he held a great Shakespeare Jubilee at Stratford in 1769. He freely adapted Shakespeare's work, however, saying of ""Hamlet"": ""I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act. I have brought it forth without the grave-digger's trick, Osrick, & the fencing match."" Apparently no incongruity was perceived in having Barry and Garrick, in their late thirties, play adolescent Romeo one season and geriatric King Lear the next. 18th century notions of verisimilitude did not usually require an actor to be physically appropriate for a role, a fact epitomized by a 1744 production of ""Romeo and Juliet"" in which Theophilus Cibber, then forty, played Romeo to the Juliet of his teenaged daughter Jennie."
"Some of Shakespeare's work was performed in continental Europe even during his lifetime; Ludwig Tieck pointed out German versions of ""Hamlet"" and other plays, of uncertain provenance, but certainly quite old. but it was not until after the middle of the next century that Shakespeare appeared regularly on German stages. In Germany Lessing compared Shakespeare to German folk literature. Goethe organised a Shakespeare jubilee in Frankfurt in 1771, stating that the dramatist had shown that the Aristotelian unities were ""as oppressive as a prison"" and were ""burdensome fetters on our imagination"". Herder likewise proclaimed that reading Shakespeare's work opens ""leaves from the book of events, of providence, of the world, blowing in the sands of time"". This claim that Shakespeare's work breaks though all creative boundaries to reveal a chaotic, teeming, contradictory world became characteristic of Romantic criticism, later being expressed by Victor Hugo in the preface to his play ""Cromwell"", in which he lauded Shakespeare as an artist of the grotesque, a genre in which the tragic, absurd, trivial and serious were inseparably intertwined."
"Theatres and theatrical scenery became ever more elaborate in the 19th century, and the acting editions used were progressively cut and restructured to emphasize more and more the soliloquies and the stars, at the expense of pace and action. Performances were further slowed by the need for frequent pauses to change the scenery, creating a perceived need for even more cuts in order to keep performance length within tolerable limits; it became a generally accepted maxim that Shakespeare's plays were too long to be performed without substantial cuts. The platform, or apron, stage, on which actors of the 17th century would come forward for audience contact, was gone, and the actors stayed permanently behind the fourth wall or proscenium arch, further separated from the audience by the orchestra (see image at right)."
"Victorian productions of Shakespeare often sought pictorial effects in ""authentic"" historical costumes and sets. The staging of the reported sea fights and barge scene in "" Antony and Cleopatra"" was one spectacular example. Too often, the result was a loss of pace. Towards the end of the century, William Poel led a reaction against this heavy style. In a series of ""Elizabethan"" productions on a thrust stage, he paid fresh attention to the structure of the drama."
"Through the 19th century, a roll call of legendary actors' names all but drown out the plays in which they appear: Sarah Siddons (1755–1831), John Philip Kemble (1757–1823), Henry Irving (1838–1905), and Ellen Terry (1847–1928). To be a star of the legitimate drama came to mean being first and foremost a ""great Shakespeare actor"", with a famous interpretation of, for men, Hamlet, and for women, Lady Macbeth, and especially with a striking delivery of the great soliloquies. The acme of spectacle, star, and soliloquy of Shakespeare performance came with the reign of actor-manager Henry Irving and his co-star Ellen Terry in their elaborately staged productions, often with orchestral incidental music, at the Lyceum Theatre, London from 1878 to 1902. At the same time, a revolutionary return to the roots of Shakespeare's original texts, and to the platform stage, absence of scenery, and fluid scene changes of the Elizabethan theatre, was being effected by William Poel's Elizabethan Stage Society."
"In the early 20th century, Harley Granville-Barker directed quarto and folio texts with few cuts, while Edward Gordon Craig and others called for abstract staging. Both approaches have influenced the variety of Shakespearean production styles seen today."
The 20th century also saw a multiplicity of visual interpretations of Shakespeare's plays.
"Gordon Craig's design for ""Hamlet"" in 1911 was groundbreaking in its Cubist influence. Craig defined space with simple flats: monochrome canvases stretched on wooden frames, which were hinged together to be self-supporting. Though the construction of these flats was not original, its application to Shakespeare was completely new. The flats could be aligned in many configurations and provided a technique of simulating architectural or abstract lithic structures out of supplies and methods common to any theater in Europe or the Americas."
"The second major shift of 20th-century scenography of Shakespeare was in Barry Vincent Jackson's 1923 production of ""Cymbeline"" at the Birmingham Rep. This production was groundbreaking because it reintroduced the idea of modern dress back into Shakespeare. It was not the first modern-dress production since there were a few minor examples before World War I, but ""Cymbeline"" was the first to call attention to the device in a blatant way. Iachimo was costumed in evening dress for the wager, the court was in military uniforms, and the disguised Imogen in knickerbockers and cap. It was for this production that critics invented the catch phrase ""Shakespeare in plus-fours"". The experiment was moderately successful, and the director, H.K. Ayliff, two years later staged ""Hamlet"" in modern dress. These productions paved the way for the modern-dress Shakespearean productions that we are familiar with today."
"In 1936, Orson Welles was hired by the Federal Theatre Project to direct a groundbreaking production of ""Macbeth"" in Harlem with an all African American cast. The production became known as the Voodoo Macbeth, as Welles changed the setting to a 19th-century Haiti run by an evil king thoroughly controlled by African magic. Initially hostile, the black community took to the production thoroughly, ensuring full houses for ten weeks at the Lafayette Theatre and prompting a small Broadway success and a national tour."
"Other notable productions of the 20th century that follow this trend of relocating Shakespeare's plays are H.K. Ayliff's ""Macbeth"" of 1928 set on the battlefields of World War I, Welles' ""Julius Caesar"" of 1937 based on the Nazi rallies at Nuremberg, and Thacker's ""Coriolanus"" of 1994 costumed in the manner of the French Revolution."
"In 1978, a deconstructive version of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" was performed at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The main character walked through the audience toward the stage, acting drunk and shouting sexist comments before he proceeded to tear down (i.e., deconstruct) the scenery. Even after press coverage, some audience members still fled from the performance, thinking they were witnessing a real assault."
