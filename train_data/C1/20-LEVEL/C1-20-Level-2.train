Be careful who you put Mooty with  cos Mooty
I've put her with Michelle!
"Oh that's alright, that's fine, yes."

Okay.

"`` One Joan Sedley , '' replied Matcham , colouring ."
"`` It was Sir Daniel 's doing ; he hath money to gain upon both sides ; and , indeed , I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match ."
"It seems she is of your mind , or else distasted to the bridegroom . ''"
`` Well !
"marriage is like death , it comes to all , '' said Dick , with resignation ."
`` And she bemoaned herself ?
"I pray ye now , see there how shuttle-witted are these girls : to bemoan herself before that she had seen me !"
Do I bemoan myself ?
Not I .
"An I be to marry , I will marry dry-eyed !"
"But if ye know her , prithee , of what favour is she ?"
fair or foul ?
And is she shrewish or pleasant ? ''
"`` Nay , what matters it ? ''"
said Matcham .
"`` An y ' are to marry , ye can but marry ."
What matters foul or fair ?
These be but toys .
"Y ' are no milksop , Master Richard ; ye will wed with dry eyes , anyhow . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Shelton ."
`` Little I reck . ''
"`` Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord , '' said Matcham ."
"`` She shall have the lord Heaven made her for , '' returned Dick ."
`` It trow there be worse as well as better . ''
"`` Ah , the poor wench ! ''"
cried the other .
`` And why so poor ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` To wed a man of wood , '' replied his companion ."
"`` O me , for a wooden husband ! ''"
"`` I think I be a man of wood , indeed , '' said Dick , `` to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse ; but it is good wood , I trow . ''"
"`` Good Dick , forgive me , '' cried the other ."
"He saw Matcham fall ; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived ; With a cry of pity and anger , he unslung and bent his arblast ."
"But ere he had time to shoot , the leper held up his hand ."
"`` Hold your shot , Dickon ! ''"
cried a familiar voice .
"`` Hold your shot , mad wag !"
Know ye not a friend ? ''
"And then laying down Matcham on the turf , he undid the hood from off his face , and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley ."
`` Sir Daniel ! ''
cried Dick .
"`` Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! ''"
returned the knight .
"`` Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ?"
"But here is this '' -- And there he broke off , and pointing to Matcham , asked : `` How call ye him , Dick ? ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I call him Master Matcham ."
Know ye him not ?
He said ye knew him ! ''
"`` Ay , '' replied Sir Daniel , `` I know the lad ; '' and he chuckled ."
"`` But he has fainted ; and , by my sooth , he might have had less to faint for !"
"Hey , Dick ?"
Did I put the fear of death upon you ? ''
"`` Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye did that , '' said Dick , and sighed again at the mere recollection ."
"`` Nay , sir , saving your respect , I had as lief ` a ' met the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I am yet all a-quake ."
"But what made ye , sir , in such a guise ? ''"
Sir Daniel 's brow grew suddenly black with anger .
`` What made I ? ''
he said .
`` Ye do well to mind me of it !
What ?
"I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick ."
We were ill sped at the battle ; we but got there to be swept among the rout .
Where be all my good men-at-arms ?
"Dick , by the mass , I know not !"
asked Matcham .
"`` Never a girl for me , '' returned Dick ."
`` I do abjure the crew of them ! ''
"`` Ye speak boyishly , '' said the other ."
`` Ye think more of them than ye pretend . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick , stoutly ."
`` They come not in my mind .
"A plague of them , say I !"
"Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast , and to live with jolly foresters ."
"I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service , save one only ; and she , poor shrew , was burned for a witch and the wearing of men 's clothes in spite of nature . ''"
"Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour , and appeared to pray ."
`` What make ye ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` I pray for her spirit , '' answered the other , with a somewhat troubled voice ."
`` For a witch 's spirit ? ''
Dick cried .
"`` But pray for her , an ye list ; she was the best wench in Europe , was this Joan of Arc ."
"Old Appleyard the archer ran from her , he said , as if she had been Mahoun ."
"Nay , she was a brave wench . ''"
"`` Well , but , good Master Richard , '' resumed Matcham , `` an ye like maids so little , y ' are no true natural man ; for God made them twain by intention , and brought true love into the world , to be man 's hope and woman 's comfort . ''"
`` Faugh ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Y ' are a milk-sopping baby , so to harp on women ."
"An ye think I be no true man , get down upon the path , and whether at fists , back-sword , or bow and arrow , I will prove my manhood on your body . ''"
"`` Nay , I am no fighter , '' said Matcham , eagerly ."
`` I mean no tittle of offence .
I meant but pleasantry .
"And if I talk of women , it is because I heard ye were to marry . ''"
`` I to marry ! ''
Dick exclaimed .
"`` Well , it is the first I hear of it ."
And with whom was I to marry ? ''
Let me see -- let me put on my thinking cap .
What is your name ? ''
`` Marcella Langley . ''
The older woman dropped the lingerie waist she was pretending to examine and stared at Marcella .
`` You do n't say !
"Look here , what was your mother 's name before she was married ? ''"
`` Mary Carvell . ''
"`` Well , I have heard of coincidences , but this beats all !"
Mary Carvell !
"Well , did you ever hear your mother speak of a girl friend of hers called Josephine Draper ? ''"
`` I should think I did !
You do n't mean -- '' `` I do mean it .
I 'm Josephine Draper .
"Your mother and I went to school together , and we were as much as sisters to each other until she got married ."
"Then she went away , and after a few years I lost trace of her ."
I did n't even know she was dead .
Poor Mary !
"Well , my duty is plain -- that 's one comfort -- my duty and my pleasure , too ."
Your sister is coming out to Dalesboro to stay with me .
"Yes , and you are too , for the whole summer ."
"You need n't say you 're not , because you are ."
I 've said so .
There 's room at Fir Cottage for you both .
"Yes , Fir Cottage -- I guess you 've heard your mother speak of that ."
There 's her old room out there that we always slept in when she came to stay all night with me .
It 's all ready for you .
What 's that ?
You ca n't afford to lose your place here ?
"Bless your heart , child , you wo n't lose it !"
"The owner of this store is my nephew , and he 'll do considerable to oblige me , as well he might , seeing as I brought him up ."
"To think that Mary Carvell 's daughter has been in his store for three years , and me never suspecting it !"
And I might never have found you out at all if you had n't been so patient with that woman .
Her eyes brightened when she saw the mayflowers he carried .
"She came and took them from him , and her hands touched his , sending a little thrill of joy through him ."
`` How lovely they are !
And the first I have seen this spring .
"You always bring me the first , do n't you , Jeff ?"
Do you remember the first day we spent picking mayflowers together ? ''
Jeff smiled .
Could he forget ?
But something held him back from speech .
"Sara put the flowers in a vase on the table , but slipped one starry pink cluster into the lace on her breast ."
"She came and sat down beside Jeffrey ; he saw that her beautiful eyes had been weeping , and that there were lines of pain around her lips ."
Some impulse that would not be denied made him lean over and take her hand .
She left it unresistingly in his clasp .
"`` I am very lonely now , Jeff , '' she said sadly ."
`` Father has gone .
I have no friends left . ''
"`` You have me , '' said Jeffrey quietly ."
`` Yes .
I should n't have said that .
"You are my friend , I know , Jeff ."
"But , but -- I must leave Pinehurst , you know . ''"
"`` I learned that tonight for the first time , '' he answered ."
"`` Did you ever come to a place where everything seemed ended -- where it seemed that there was nothing -- simply nothing -- left , Jeff ? ''"
she said wistfully .
"`` But , no , it could n't seem so to a man ."
Only a woman could fully understand what I mean .
That is how I feel now .
While I had Father to live for it was n't so hard .
But now there is nothing .
And I must go away . ''
`` Is there anything I can do ? ''
muttered Jeffrey miserably .
"He came upon Lynde , sitting on a grey boulder under the shadow of an overhanging fir coppice , with her dogs beside her ."
"She turned her head indifferently as Alan 's footsteps sounded on the pebbles , and then stood slowly up ."
`` Are you looking for me ? ''
she asked .
"`` I have some news for you , Lynde , '' Alan said ."
`` Has he -- has he come to himself ? ''
she whispered .
"`` Yes , he has come to himself ."
"Lynde , he is not Frank Harmon -- he is his twin brother ."
He says Frank Harmon was killed three years ago in the China seas . ''
"For a moment Lynde 's great grey eyes stared into Alan 's , questioning ."
"Then , as the truth seized on her comprehension , she sat down on the boulder and put her hands over her face without a word ."
Alan walked down to the water 's edge to give her time to recover herself .
"When he came back he took her hands and said quietly , `` Lynde , do you realize what this means for us -- for us ?"
You are free -- free to love me -- to be my wife . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` Oh , that ca n't be ."
I am not fit to be your wife . ''
"`` Do n't talk nonsense , dear , '' he smiled ."
`` It is n't nonsense .
You are a minister and it would ruin you to marry a girl like me .
Think what the Rexton people would say of it . ''
"`` Rexton is n't the world , dearest ."
Last week I had a letter from home asking me to go to a church there .
"I did not think of accepting then -- now I will go -- we will both go -- and a new life will begin for you , clear of the shadows of the old . ''"
`` That is n't possible .
"No , Alan , listen -- I love you too well to do you the wrong of marrying you ."
It would injure you .
There is Father .
I love him and he has always been very kind to me .
But -- but -- there 's something wrong -- you know it -- some crime in his past -- '' `` The only man who knew that is dead . ''
`` We do not know that he was the only man .
"Pew was that sort , and he died a beggar-man ."
"Flint was , and he died of rum at Savannah ."
"Ah , they was a sweet crew , they was !"
"On ` y , where are they ? ''"
"`` But , '' asked Dick , `` when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ? ''"
`` There 's the man for me ! ''
cried the cook admiringly .
`` That 's what I call business .
"Well , what would you think ?"
Put 'em ashore like maroons ?
That would have been England 's way .
Or cut 'em down like that much pork ?
"That would have been Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . ''"
"`` Billy was the man for that , '' said Israel . ''"
"` Dead men do n't bite , ' says he ."
"Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was Billy . ''"
"`` Right you are , '' said Silver ; `` rough and ready ."
"But mark you here , I 'm an easy man -- I 'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it 's serious ."
"Dooty is dooty , mates ."
I give my vote -- death .
"When I 'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers ."
"Wait is what I say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip ! ''"
"`` John , '' cries the coxswain , `` you 're a man ! ''"
"`` You 'll say so , Israel when you see , '' said Silver ."
`` Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney .
"I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hands , Dick ! ''"
"he added , breaking off ."
"`` You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . ''"
You may fancy the terror I was in !
"I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength , but my limbs and heart alike misgave me ."
"I heard Dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stopped him , and the voice of Hands exclaimed , `` Oh , stow that !"
"Do n't you get sucking of that bilge , John ."
"There 's always one little empty , aching spot ."
"Oh , if I had somebody of my very own to love and care for , a mother , a sister , even a cousin ."
But there 's nobody .
"I have n't a relative in the world , and there are times when I 'd give almost anything to have one ."
"Well , I must try to be satisfied with friendship , instead ."
"Margaret 's meditations were interrupted by a brisk footstep behind her , and presently Dr. Forbes came up ."
"`` Good afternoon , Miss Campbell ."
Taking a constitutional ? ''
`` Yes .
Is n't it a lovely day ?
I suppose you are on your professional rounds .
How are all your patients ? ''
`` Most of them are doing well .
But I 'm sorry to say I have a new one and am very much worried about her .
Do you know Freda Martin ? ''
`` The little teacher in the Primary Department who boards with the Wayes ?
"Yes , I 've met her once or twice ."
Is she ill ? ''
"`` Yes , seriously ."
"It 's typhoid , and she has been going about longer than she should ."
I do n't know what is to be done with her .
"It seems she is like yourself in one respect , Miss Campbell ; she is utterly alone in the world ."
"Mrs. Waye is crippled with rheumatism and ca n't nurse her , and I fear it will be impossible to get a nurse in Blythefield ."
She ought to be taken from the Wayes ' .
"The house is overrun with children , is right next door to that noisy factory , and in other respects is a poor place for a sick girl . ''"
"`` It is too bad , I am very sorry , '' said Margaret sympathetically ."
Dr. Forbes shot a keen look at her from his deep-set eyes .
"`` Are you willing to show your sympathy in a practical form , Miss Campbell ? ''"
he said bluntly .
`` You told me the other day you meant to begin work for others next year .
Why not begin now ?
Here 's a splendid chance to befriend a friendless girl .
O the lovely ! '
"she cried , though Tink 's face was still distorted with passion ."
"` Tink , ' said Peter amiably , ` this lady says she wishes you were her fairy . '"
Tinker Bell answered insolently .
"` What does she say , Peter ? '"
He had to translate .
` She is not very polite .
"She says you are a great ugly girl , and that she is my fairy . '"
He tried to argue with Tink .
"` You know you ca n't be my fairy , Tink , because I am a gentleman and you are a lady . '"
"To this Tink replied in these words , ` You silly ass , ' and disappeared into the bathroom ."
"` She is quite a common fairy , ' Peter explained apologetically ; ` she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and kettles . '"
"They were together in the armchair by this time , and Wendy plied him with more questions ."
` If you do n't live in Kensington Gardens now -- ' ` Sometimes I do still . '
` But where do you live mostly now ? '
` With the lost boys . '
` Who are they ? '
` They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way .
If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses .
I 'm captain . '
` What fun it must be ! '
"` Yes , ' said cunning Peter , ` but we are rather lonely ."
You see we have no female companionship . '
` Are none of the others girls ? '
"` Oh no ; girls , you know , are much too clever to fall out of their prams . '"
This flattered Wendy immensely . '
"I think , ' she said , ` it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls ; John there just despises us . '"
"For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed , blankets and all ; one kick ."
"This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting , and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house ."
"However , John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there ."
"` And I know you meant to be kind , ' she said , relenting , ` so you may give me a kiss . '"
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses . '
"`` Let me brush your hair now , dear , and bathe your face . ''"
`` Have you time ? ''
said Patty anxiously .
"`` Yes , I think so . ''"
Patty gave a sigh of content .
`` I 'm so glad !
Aunt Emma always hurts me when she brushes my hair -- she is in such a hurry .
"You 're so gentle , Marcella , you do n't make my head ache at all ."
But oh !
I 'm so tired of being sick .
I wish I could get well faster .
"Marcy , do you think I can be sent to the country ? ''"
"`` I -- I do n't know , dear ."
"I 'll see if I can think of any way to manage it , '' said Marcella , striving to speak hopefully ."
Patty drew a long breath .
"`` Oh , Marcy , it would be lovely to see the green fields again , and the woods and brooks , as we did that summer we spent in the country before Father died ."
I wish we could live in the country always .
I 'm sure I would soon get better if I could go -- if it was only for a little while .
It 's so hot here -- and the factory makes such a noise -- my head seems to go round and round all the time .
And Aunt Emma scolds so . ''
"`` You must n't mind Aunt Emma , dear , '' said Marcella ."
`` You know she does n't really mean it -- it is just a habit she has got into .
She was really very good to you when you were so sick .
"She sat up night after night with you , and made me go to bed ."
"There now , dearie , you 're fresh and sweet , and I must hurry to the store , or I 'll be late ."
"Try and have a little nap , and I 'll bring you home some oranges tonight . ''"
"Marcella dropped a kiss on Patty 's cheek , put on her hat and went out ."
"As soon as she left the house , she quickened her steps almost to a run ."
"She feared she would be late , and that meant a ten-cent fine ."
Ten cents loomed as large as ten dollars now to Marcella 's eyes when every dime meant so much .
"But fast as she went , her distracted thoughts went faster ."
She could not send Patty to the country .
And I go dinnerless ! ''
"In the space of a minute , some running , some walking sharply , according as their stations were nearer or farther away , the men of the Black Arrow had all disappeared from the neighbourhood of the ruined house ; and the caldron , and the fire , which was now burning low , and the dead deer 's carcase on the hawthorn , remained alone to testify they had been there ."
CHAPTER V -- `` BLOODY AS THE HUNTER '' The lads lay quiet till the last footstep had melted on the wind .
"Then they arose , and with many an ache , for they were weary with constraint , clambered through the ruins , and recrossed the ditch upon the rafter ."
"Matcham had picked up the windac and went first , Dick following stiffly , with his cross-bow on his arm ."
"`` And now , '' said Matcham , `` forth to Holywood . ''"
`` To Holywood ! ''
"cried Dick , `` when good fellows stand shot ?"
Not I !
"I would see you hanged first , Jack ! ''"
"`` Ye would leave me , would ye ? ''"
Matcham asked .
"`` Ay , by my sooth ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` An I be not in time to warn these lads , I will go die with them ."
What !
would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived among .
I trow not !
Give me my windac . ''
But there was nothing further from Matcham 's mind .
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` ye sware before the saints that ye would see me safe to Holywood ."
Would ye be forsworn ?
Would you desert me -- a perjurer ? ''
"`` Nay , I sware for the best , '' returned Dick ."
`` I meant it too ; but now !
"But look ye , Jack , turn again with me ."
"Let me but warn these men , and , if needs must , stand shot with them ; then shall all be clear , and I will on again to Holywood and purge mine oath . ''"
"`` Ye but deride me , '' answered Matcham ."
`` These men ye go to succour are the I same that hunt me to my ruin . ''
Dick scratched his head .
"`` I can not help it , Jack , '' he said ."
`` Here is no remedy .
My unkle has adopted a cat .
it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed .
he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children .
that is not right .
we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children .
this is oll I can think of so no more at present from edward blake ClaY . ' ''
"`` St. Clair Donnell 's is , as usual , short and to the point ."
St. Clair never wastes words .
I do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought .
It is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination . '' ''
` Dear Miss Shirley '' ` You told us to describe something strange we have seen .
I will describe the Avonlea Hall .
"It has two doors , an inside one and an outside one ."
It has six windows and a chimney .
It has two ends and two sides .
It is painted blue .
That is what makes it strange .
It is built on the lower Carmody road .
It is the third most important building in Avonlea .
The others are the church and the blacksmith shop .
They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts . ''
"` Yours truly , '' ` Jacob Donnell . ''"
` P.S. .
The hall is a very bright blue . ' ''
"`` Annetta Bell 's letter was quite long , which surprised me , for writing essays is not Annetta 's forte , and hers are generally as brief as St. Clair 's ."
"Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior , but there is n't a shadow of orginality in her ."
Here is her letter .
"-- '' ` Dearest teacher , '' `` I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you ."
I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind ... with all there is of me to love ... and I want to serve you for ever .
It would be my highest privilege .
That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns . ''
"` You are so beautiful , my teacher ."
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him .
It is the fairy language .
"You ordinary children can never hear it , but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before ."
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box .
"She meant the chest of drawers , and Peter jumped at the drawers , scattering their contents to the floor with both hands , as kings toss ha ` pence to the crowd ."
"In a moment he had recovered his shadow , and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer ."
"If he thought at all , but I do n't believe he ever thought , it was that he and his shadow , when brought near each other , would join like drops of water ; and when they did not he was appalled ."
"He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom , but that also failed ."
"A shudder passed through Peter , and he sat on the floor and cried ."
"His sobs woke Wendy , and she sat up in bed ."
She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor ; she was only pleasantly interested .
"` Boy , ' she said courteously , ` why are you crying ? '"
"Peter could be exceedingly polite also , having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies , and he rose and bowed to her beautifully ."
"She was much pleased , and bowed beautifully to him from the bed ."
` What 's your name ? '
he asked .
"` Wendy Moira Angela Darling , ' she replied with some satisfaction ."
` What is your name ? '
` Peter Pan . '
"She was already sure that he must be Peter , but it did seem a comparatively short name ."
` Is that all ? '
"` Yes , ' he said rather sharply ."
He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name .
"` I 'm so sorry , ' said Wendy Moira Angela ."
"` It does n't matter , ' Peter gulped ."
She asked where he lived .
"` Second to the right , ' said Peter , ` and then straight on till morning . '"
` What a funny address ! '
Peter had a sinking .
For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address .
"` No , it is n't , ' he said . '"
"I mean , ' Wendy said nicely , remembering that she was hostess , ` is that what they put on the letters ? '"
"he cried , striking his hand upon the wall so that the house rang again ."
"`` Well , and that 's true , too , '' said Alan ; `` and my friend from the Lowlands here '' -LRB- nodding at me -RRB- `` gave me a good word upon that head , if I would only have listened to him . ''"
"`` But see here , '' said James , returning to his former manner , `` if they lay me by the heels , Alan , it 's then that you 'll be needing the money ."
"For with all that I have said and that you have said , it will look very black against the two of us ; do ye mark that ?"
"Well , follow me out , and ye 'll , I 'll see that I 'll have to get a paper out against ye mysel ' ; have to offer a reward for ye ; ay , will I !"
"It 's a sore thing to do between such near friends ; but if I get the dirdum * of this dreadful accident , I 'll have to fend for myself , man ."
Do ye see that ? ''
* Blame .
"He spoke with a pleading earnestness , taking Alan by the breast of the coat ."
"`` Ay '' said Alan , `` I see that . ''"
"`` And ye 'll have to be clear of the country , Alan -- ay , and clear of Scotland -- you and your friend from the Lowlands , too ."
For I 'll have to paper your friend from the Lowlands .
"Ye see that , Alan -- say that ye see that ! ''"
I thought Alan flushed a bit .
"`` This is unco hard on me that brought him here , James , '' said he , throwing his head back ."
`` It 's like making me a traitor ! ''
"`` Now , Alan , man ! ''"
cried James .
`` Look things in the face !
He 'll be papered anyway ; Mungo Campbell 'll be sure to paper him ; what matters if I paper him too ?
"And then , Alan , I am a man that has a family . ''"
"And then , after a little pause on both sides , `` And , Alan , it 'll be a jury of Campbells , '' said he ."
"`` There 's one thing , '' said Alan , musingly , `` that naebody kens his name . ''"
"`` Nor yet they shallnae , Alan !"
"There 's my hand on that , '' cried James , for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage ."
"`` But just the habit he was in , and what he looked like , and his age , and the like ?"
I couldnae well do less . ''
"`` I wonder at your father 's son , '' cried Alan , sternly ."
`` Would ye sell the lad with a gift ?
Would ye change his clothes and then betray him ? ''
"`` No , no , Alan , '' said James ."
"`` No , no : the habit he took off -- the habit Mungo saw him in . ''"
"`` Isaac Appleby , what do you mean ? ''"
demanded Melissa wrathfully .
Isaac folded his arms and looked up .
"It would be hard to say which face was the more determined , his or the dog 's ."
"But Isaac had the advantage in point of looks , I will say that for him ."
"`` I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you agrees to marry me , '' said Isaac solemnly ."
I gasped .
"`` Isaac Appleby , you ca n't be in earnest ? ''"
I cried incredulously .
`` You could n't be so mean ? ''
`` I am in earnest .
"I want a wife , and I am going to have one ."
"You two will stay up there , and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of you makes up her mind to take me ."
"You can settle it between yourselves , and let me know when you have come to a decision . ''"
And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house .
`` The man ca n't mean it ! ''
said Melissa .
`` He is trying to play a joke on us . ''
"`` He does mean it , '' I said gloomily ."
`` An Appleby never says anything he does n't mean .
He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry him . ''
"`` It wo n't be me , then , '' said Melissa in a calm sort of rage ."
`` I wo n't marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life .
You can take him .
"It 's really you he wants , anyway ; he asked you first . ''"
I always knew that rankled with Melissa .
I thought the situation over before I said anything more .
"We certainly could n't get off that roof , and if we could , there was Julius Caesar ."
"The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove , and nobody might come near it for a week ."
"To be sure , when Melissa and I did n't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us ; but that would n't be for two or three days anyhow ."
"Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees , looking gloomily out to sea ."
I was afraid I could n't coax her into marrying Isaac .
"He seemed to muse awhile , holding his lip in his hand , and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street ."
"`` Yes , '' says he , `` that will be the best , no doubt . ''"
"And he led me back with him into his house , cried out to some one whom I could not see that he would be engaged all morning , and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents ."
"Here he sate down , and bade me be seated ; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags ."
"`` And now , '' says he , `` if you have any business , pray be brief and come swiftly to the point ."
Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo -- do you understand that ? ''
"says he , with a keen look ."
"`` I will even do as Horace says , sir , '' I answered , smiling , `` and carry you in medias res . ''"
"He nodded as if he was well pleased , and indeed his scrap of Latin had been set to test me ."
"For all that , and though I was somewhat encouraged , the blood came in my face when I added : `` I have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws . ''"
He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open .
`` Well ? ''
said he .
But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless .
"`` Come , come , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you must continue ."
Where were you born ? ''
"`` In Essendean , sir , '' said I , `` the year 1733 , the 12th of March . ''"
He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book ; but what that meant I knew not .
`` Your father and mother ? ''
said he .
"`` My father was Alexander Balfour , schoolmaster of that place , '' said I , `` and my mother Grace Pitarrow ; I think her people were from Angus . ''"
`` Have you any papers proving your identity ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"`` No , sir , '' said I , `` but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell , the minister , and could be readily produced ."
"Mr. Campbell , too , would give me his word ; and for that matter , I do not think my uncle would deny me . ''"
`` Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour ? ''
says he .
"`` The same , '' said I. `` Whom you have seen ? ''"
he asked .
"`` By whom I was received into his own house , '' I answered ."
`` Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"It was in honour of this august visitor that the windows shone with lights ; and at the hour of Dick 's arrival with his sweetheart and her friend , the whole ducal party was being entertained in the refectory with the splendour of that powerful and luxurious monastery ."
"Dick , not quite with his good will , was brought before them ."
"Gloucester , sick with fatigue , sat leaning upon one hand his white and terrifying countenance ; Lord Foxham , half recovered from his wound , was in a place of honour on his left ."
"`` How , sir ? ''"
asked Richard .
`` Have ye brought me Sir Daniel 's head ? ''
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Dick , stoutly enough , but with a qualm at heart , `` I have not even the good fortune to return with my command ."
"I have been , so please your grace , well beaten . ''"
Gloucester looked upon him with a formidable frown .
"`` I gave you fifty lances , -LCB- 3 -RCB- sir , '' he said ."
"`` My lord duke , I had but fifty men-at-arms , '' replied the young knight ."
`` How is this ? ''
said Gloucester .
`` He did ask me fifty lances . ''
"`` May it please your grace , '' replied Catesby , smoothly , `` for a pursuit we gave him but the horsemen . ''"
"`` It is well , '' replied Richard , adding , `` Shelton , ye may go . ''"
`` Stay ! ''
said Lord Foxham .
`` This young man likewise had a charge from me .
It may be he hath better sped .
"Say , Master Shelton , have ye found the maid ? ''"
"`` I praise the saints , my lord , '' said Dick , `` she is in this house . ''"
`` Is it even so ?
"Well , then , my lord the duke , '' resumed Lord Foxham , `` with your good will , to-morrow , before the army march , I do propose a marriage ."
"This young squire -- '' `` Young knight , '' interrupted Catesby ."
"`` Say ye so , Sir William ? ''"
cried Lord Foxham .
"`` I did myself , and for good service , dub him knight , '' said Gloucester ."
`` He hath twice manfully served me .
"It is not valour of hands , it is a man 's mind of iron , that he lacks ."
"He will not rise , Lord Foxham ."
"'T is a fellow that will fight indeed bravely in a mellay , but hath a capon 's heart ."
I only got home half an hour ago ... and no Dora to be seen .
Davy declares he never saw her since I left . ''
"`` Neither I did , '' avowed Davy solemnly ."
"`` She must be somewhere around , '' said Anne ."
`` She would never wander far away alone ... you know how timid she is .
Perhaps she has fallen asleep in one of the rooms . ''
Marilla shook her head .
`` I 've hunted the whole house through .
But she may be in some of the buildings . ''
A thorough search followed .
"Every corner of house , yard , and outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people ."
"Anne roved the orchards and the Haunted Wood , calling Dora 's name ."
Marilla took a candle and explored the cellar .
"Davy accompanied each of them in turn , and was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be ."
Finally they met again in the yard .
"`` It 's a most mysterious thing , '' groaned Marilla ."
`` Where can she be ? ''
"said Anne miserably `` Maybe she 's tumbled into the well , '' suggested Davy cheerfully ."
Anne and Marilla looked fearfully into each other 's eyes .
The thought had been with them both through their entire search but neither had dared to put it into words .
"`` She ... she might have , '' whispered Marilla ."
"Anne , feeling faint and sick , went to the wellbox and peered over ."
The bucket sat on the shelf inside .
Far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water .
The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea .
If Dora ... but Anne could not face the idea .
She shuddered and turned away .
"`` Run across for Mr. Harrison , '' said Marilla , wringing her hands ."
`` Mr. Harrison and John Henry are both away ... they went to town today .
I 'll go for Mr. Barry . ''
"Mr. Barry came back with Anne , carrying a coil of rope to which was attached a claw-like instrument that had been the business end of a grubbing fork ."
"Marilla and Anne stood by , cold and shaken with horror and dread , while Mr. Barry dragged the well , and Davy , astride the gate , watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment ."
"`` Oh , sir , you are too good , '' said Bertie with a choke in his voice ."
"`` Well , that is settled , '' said the doctor genially ."
`` Come on Monday then .
"And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap , William , or John , or whatever his name is ."
"Will you have some more pudding , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No , thank you , '' said Bertie ."
"Pudding , indeed !"
He could not have eaten another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune .
"After dinner they played games , and cracked nuts , and roasted apples , until the clock struck nine ; then Bertie got up to go ."
"`` Off , are you ? ''"
"said the doctor , looking up from his paper ."
"`` Well , I 'll expect you on Monday , remember . ''"
"`` Yes , sir , '' said Bertie happily ."
He was not likely to forget .
As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled .
`` Here is William John 's present .
I 've tied all the other things on so that they ca n't fall off . ''
Edith was at the door-with a parcel .
"`` Here are some nuts and candies for William John , '' she said ."
`` And tell him we all wish him a ` Happy New Year . ' ''
"`` Thank you , '' said Bertie ."
`` I 've had a splendid time .
I 'll tell William John .
Goodnight . ''
He stepped out .
It was frostier than ever .
"The snow crackled and snapped , the stars were keen and bright , but to Bertie , running down the street with William John 's sled thumping merrily behind him , the world was aglow with rosy hope and promise ."
He was quite sure he could never forget this wonderful New Year .
"Between the Hill and the Valley It was one of the moist , pleasantly odorous nights of early spring ."
"There was a chill in the evening air , but the grass was growing green in sheltered spots , and Jeffrey Miller had found purple-petalled violets and pink arbutus on the hill that day ."
"Across a valley filled with beech and fir , there was a sunset afterglow , creamy yellow and pale red , with a new moon swung above it ."
"It was a night for a man to walk alone and dream of his love , which was perhaps why Jeffrey Miller came so loiteringly across the springy hill pasture , with his hands full of the mayflowers ."
I did n't s ` pose you 'd know the difference .
I do n't see how you found out it was n't all mine .
"You must be awful clever , teacher . '"
`` I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person 's letter and pass it off as her own .
But I 'm afraid that all Annetta repented of was being found out . ''
"` And I do love you , teacher , ' she sobbed ."
"` It was all true , even if the minister wrote it first ."
I do love you with all my heart . '
`` It 's very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances .
`` Here is Barbara Shaw 's letter .
I ca n't reproduce the blots of the original . ''
"` Dear teacher , '' `` You said we might write about a visit ."
I never visited but once .
It was at my Aunt Mary 's last winter .
My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper .
The first night I was there we were at tea .
I knocked over a jug and broke it .
Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before .
When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt .
The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast .
When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed .
That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week .
I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I 'd have broken everything in the house .
When I got better it was time to go home .
I do n't like visiting very much .
"I like going to school better , especially since I came to Avonlea . ''"
"` Yours respectfully , '' `` Barbara Shaw . ' ''"
"`` Willie White 's began , '' `` Respected Miss , '' `` I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt ."
She lives in Ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard .
The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up .
Pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion ' -LRB- Query ; -- Did Willie mean a menagerie lion ? -RRB-
` that had run away from a circus .
"I 've lots of old Admiral Page 's fighting blood in me , you know ."
"The first step is to tabulate just exactly what difficulties among our many difficulties must be ravelled out first -- the capital difficulties , as it were ."
"Most important of all comes -- '' `` Leicester , '' said Mrs. Page ."
Dorinda winked her eyes as she always did when she was doubtful .
"`` Well , I knew he was one of them , but I was n't going to put him the very first ."
"However , we will ."
Leicester 's case stands thus .
"He is a pretty smart boy -- if he was n't my brother , I 'd say he was a very smart boy ."
"He has gone as far in his studies as Willowdale School can take him , has qualified for entrance into the Blue Hill Academy , wants to go there this fall and begin the beginnings of a college course ."
"Well , of course , Mother Page , we ca n't send Leicester to Blue Hill any more than we can send him to the moon . ''"
"`` No , '' mourned Mrs. Page , `` and the poor boy feels so badly over it ."
His heart is set on going to college and being a doctor like his father .
"He believes he could work his way through , if he could only get a start ."
But there is n't any chance .
And I ca n't afford to keep him at school any longer .
He is going into Mr. Churchill 's store at Willow Centre in the fall .
Mr. Churchill has very kindly offered him a place .
"Leicester hates the thought of it -- I know he does , although he never says so . ''"
`` Next to Leicester 's college course we want -- '' `` Music lessons for Jean . ''
Dorinda winked again .
`` Are music lessons for Jean really a difficulty ? ''
she said .
"`` That is , one spelled with a capital ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes , Dorinda dear ."
"At least , I 'm worried over it ."
"Jean loves music so , and she has never had anything , poor child , not even as much school as she ought to have had ."
I 've had to keep her home so much to help me with the work .
"She has been such a good , patient little girl too , and her heart is set on music lessons . ''"
"`` Well , she must have them then -- after we get Leicester 's year at the academy for him ."
That 's two .
"The third is a new -- '' `` The roof must be shingled this fall , '' said Mrs. Page anxiously ."
"`` It really must , Dorinda ."
"She is a pretty lady , but not so pretty as my mother ."
"Her mouth is full of thimbles , but not so full as my mother 's was . ''"
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother ; but he sometimes bragged about her .
"He did not know the tune , which was `` Home , Sweet Home , '' but he knew it was saying , `` Come back , Wendy , Wendy , Wendy '' ; and he cried exultantly , `` You will never see Wendy again , lady , for the window is barred ! ''"
"He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped , and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box , and that two tears were sitting on her eyes ."
"`` She wants me to unbar the window , '' thought Peter , `` but I wo n't , not I ! ''"
"He peeped again , and the tears were still there , or another two had taken their place ."
"`` She 's awfully fond of Wendy , '' he said to himself ."
He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy .
The reason was so simple : `` I 'm fond of her too .
"We ca n't both have her , lady . ''"
"But the lady would not make the best of it , and he was unhappy ."
"He ceased to look at her , but even then she would not let go of him ."
"He skipped about and made funny faces , but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him , knocking ."
"`` Oh , all right , '' he said at last , and gulped ."
Then he unbarred the window .
"`` Come on , Tink , '' he cried , with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature ; `` we do n't want any silly mothers ; '' and he flew away ."
"Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all , which of course was more than they deserved ."
"They alighted on the floor , quite unashamed of themselves , and the youngest one had already forgotten his home ."
"`` John , '' he said , looking around him doubtfully , `` I think I have been here before . ''"
"`` Of course you have , you silly ."
There is your old bed . ''
"`` So it is , '' Michael said , but not with much conviction ."
"`` I say , '' cried John , `` the kennel ! ''"
and he dashed across to look into it .
"`` Perhaps Nana is inside it , '' Wendy said ."
But John whistled .
"`` Hullo , '' he said , `` there 's a man inside it . ''"
`` It 's father ! ''
exclaimed Wendy .
"`` Let me see father , '' Michael begged eagerly , and he took a good look ."
"`` He is not so big as the pirate I killed , '' he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep ; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say ."
"Think of that , Sophia Crawford '' -- Susan shook a floury finger at Sophia -- `` not -- one -- child -- under -- eight -- years -- of -- age ! ''"
"`` I suppose the Germans has et 'em all , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` Well , no-o-o , '' said Susan reluctantly , as if she hated to admit that there was any crime the Huns could n't be accused of ."
`` The Germans have not turned cannibal yet -- as far as I know .
"They have died of starvation and exposure , the poor little creatures ."
"There is murdering for you , Cousin Sophia Crawford ."
The thought of it poisons every bite and sup I take . ''
"`` I see that Fred Carson of Lowbridge has been awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal , '' remarked the doctor , over his local paper ."
"`` I heard that last week , '' said Susan ."
`` He is a battalion runner and he did something extra brave and daring .
"His letter , telling his folks about it , came when his old Grandmother Carson was on her dying-bed ."
"She had only a few minutes more to live and the Episcopal minister , who was there , asked her if she would not like him to pray ."
"` Oh yes , yes , you can pray , ' she said impatient-like -- she was a Dean , Dr. dear , and the Deans were always high-spirited -- ` you can pray , but for pity 's sake pray low and do n't disturb me ."
I want to think over this splendid news and I have not much time left to do it . '
That was Almira Carson all over .
Fred was the apple of her eye .
"She was seventy-five years of age and had not a grey hair in her head , they tell me . ''"
"`` By the way , that reminds me -- I found a grey hair this morning -- my very first , '' said Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` I have noticed that grey hair for some time , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I did not speak of it ."
"Thought I to myself , ` She has enough to bear . '"
But now that you have discovered it let me remind you that grey hairs are honourable . ''
"`` I must be getting old , Gilbert . ''"
Mrs. Blythe laughed a trifle ruefully .
`` People are beginning to tell me I look so young .
They never tell you that when you are young .
But I shall not worry over my silver thread .
I never liked red hair .
"Gilbert , did I ever tell you of that time , years ago at Green Gables , when I dyed my hair ?"
Nobody but Marilla and I knew about it . ''
`` Was that the reason you came out once with your hair shingled to the bone ? ''
`` Yes .
I bought a bottle of dye from a German Jew pedlar .
"if old Harry the Fift were back again , he would stand and let ye shoot at him for a farthen a shoot ! ''"
"`` Nay , Nick , there 's some can draw a good bow yet , '' said Bennet ."
`` Draw a good bow ! ''
cried Appleyard .
`` Yes !
But who 'll shoot me a good shoot ?
"It 's there the eye comes in , and the head between your shoulders ."
"Now , what might you call a long shoot , Bennet Hatch ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said Bennet , looking about him , `` it would be a long shoot from here into the forest . ''"
"`` Ay , it would be a longish shoot , '' said the old fellow , turning to look over his shoulder ; and then he put up his hand over his eyes , and stood staring ."
"`` Why , what are you looking at ? ''"
"asked Bennet , with a chuckle ."
"`` Do , you see Harry the Fift ? ''"
The veteran continued looking up the hill in silence .
The sun shone broadly over the shelving meadows ; a few white sheep wandered browsing ; all was still but the distant jangle of the bell .
"`` What is it , Appleyard ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` Why , the birds , '' said Appleyard ."
"And , sure enough , over the top of the forest , where it ran down in a tongue among the meadows , and ended in a pair of goodly green elms , about a bowshot from the field where they were standing , a flight of birds was skimming to and fro , in evident disorder ."
`` What of the birds ? ''
said Bennet .
`` Ay ! ''
"returned Appleyard , `` y ' are a wise man to go to war , Master Bennet ."
Birds are a good sentry ; in forest places they be the first line of battle .
"Look you , now , if we lay here in camp , there might be archers skulking down to get the wind of us ; and here would you be , none the wiser ! ''"
"`` Why , old shrew , '' said Hatch , `` there be no men nearer us than Sir Daniel 's , at Kettley ; y ' are as safe as in London Tower ; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few chaffinches and sparrows ! ''"
`` Hear him ! ''
grinned Appleyard .
`` How many a rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either of us ?
"Saint Michael , man !"
they hate us like two polecats ! ''
"`` Well , sooth it is , they hate Sir Daniel , '' answered Hatch , a little sobered ."
"asked Jill , who kept all her questions for Frank , because she seldom alluded to the tender subject when with Jack ."
"`` No , he 's off for the summer ."
Got a place somewhere .
Hope he 'll stay there and let Bob alone . ''
`` Where is Bob now ?
"I do n't hear much about him lately , '' said Jill , who was constantly on the lookout for `` the other fellow , '' since it was not Joe ."
"`` Oh , he went to Captain Skinner 's the first of March , chores round , and goes to school up there ."
"Captain is strict , and wo n't let Bob come to town , except Sundays ; but he do n't mind it much , for he likes horses , has nice grub , and the Hill fellows are good chaps for him to be with ."
"So he 's all right , if he only behaves . ''"
`` How far is it to Captain Skinner 's ? ''
"asked Jill suddenly , having listened , with her sharp eyes on Frank , as he tinkered away at his model , since he was forbidden all other indulgence in his beloved pastime ."
"`` It 's four miles to Hill District , but the Captain lives this side of the school-house ."
"About three from here , I should say . ''"
`` How long would it take a boy to walk up there ? ''
"went on the questioner , with a new idea in her head ."
`` Depends on how much of a walkist he is . ''
"`` Suppose he was lame and it was sloshy , and he made a call and came back ."
How long would that take ? ''
asked Jill impatiently .
"`` Well , in that case , I should say two or three hours ."
"But it 's impossible to tell exactly , unless you know how lame the fellow was , and how long a call he made , '' said Frank , who liked to be accurate ."
"`` Jack could n't do it in less , could he ? ''"
"`` He used to run up that hilly road for a breather , and think nothing of it ."
"It would be a long job for him now , poor little chap , for his leg often troubles him , though he hates to own it . ''"
"Jill lay back and laughed , a happy little laugh , as if she was pleased about something , and Frank looked over his shoulder to ask questions in his turn ."
`` What are you laughing at ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
`` Why do you want to know about Hill District ?
Are you going there ? ''
`` Wish I could !
I 'd soon have it out of him . ''
`` Who ? ''
"Not just an ordinary letter ; dear me , no ."
"I took a whole day to write it , and you should have seen the postmistress 's eyes stick out when I mailed it ."
I just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went away .
I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could .
Everything bright and funny I could think of went into it .
`` The next was old Aunt Kitty .
"You know she was my nurse when I was a baby , and she 's very fond of me ."
"But , well , you know , Aunt Emmy , I 'm ashamed to confess it , but really I 've never found Aunt Kitty very entertaining , to put it mildly ."
"She is always glad when I go to see her , but I 've never gone except when I could n't help it ."
"She is very deaf , and rather dull and stupid , you know ."
"Well , I gave her a whole day ."
"I took my knitting yesterday , and sat with her the whole time and just talked and talked ."
I told her all the Greenvale news and gossip and everything else I thought she 'd like to hear .
She was so pleased and proud ; she told me when I came away that she had n't had such a nice time for years .
`` Then there was ... Florence .
"You know , Aunt Emmy , we were always intimate friends until last year ."
Then Florence once told Rose Watson something I had told her in confidence .
I found it out and I was so hurt .
"I could n't forgive Florence , and I told her plainly I could never be a real friend to her again ."
"Florence felt badly , because she really did love me , and she asked me to forgive her , but it seemed as if I could n't ."
"Well , Aunt Emmy , that was my Christmas gift to her ... my forgiveness ."
I went down last night and just put my arms around her and told her that I loved her as much as ever and wanted to be real close friends again .
`` I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning .
"I told her I was n't going to Murraybridge , that I just meant to stay home with her ."
"She was so glad -- and I 'm glad , too , now that I 've decided so . ''"
"`` Your gifts have been real gifts , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
`` Something of you -- the best of you -- went into each of them . ''
Clorinda went out and brought her cornery armful in .
"`` I did n't forget you , Aunt Emmy , '' she said , as she unpinned the paper ."
There was a rosebush -- Clorinda 's own pet rosebush -- all snowed over with fragrant blossoms .
Aunt Emmy loved flowers .
She put her finger under one of the roses and kissed it .
THANK you .
I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right .
Donnell ... accent on the last syllable ... and St. Clair ... on no account Jacob .
You 'll remember ?
THANK you . ''
When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home .
At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path .
He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called `` rice lillies . ''
"`` Please , teacher , I found these in Mr. Wright 's field , '' he said shyly , `` and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them , and because ... '' he lifted his big beautiful eyes ... `` I like you , teacher . ''"
"`` You darling , '' said Anne , taking the fragrant spikes ."
"As if Paul 's words had been a spell of magic , discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit , and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain ."
"She went through the Birch Path light-footedly , attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction ."
"`` Well , how did you get along ? ''"
Marilla wanted to know .
`` Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you .
I ca n't now ... I do n't know myself ... I 'm too near it .
My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy .
The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A .
He never knew it before .
Is n't it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost ? ''
Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement .
That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher .
"`` And every one of them said they liked you splendid , Anne , except Anthony Pye ."
I must admit he did n't .
"He said you ` were n't any good , just like all girl teachers . '"
There 's the Pye leaven for you .
But never mind . ''
"`` I 'm not going to mind , '' said Anne quietly , `` and I 'm going to make Anthony Pye like me yet ."
Patience and kindness will surely win him . ''
"`` Well , you can never tell about a Pye , '' said Mrs. Rachel cautiously ."
"`` They go by contraries , like dreams , often as not ."
"As for that DonNELL woman , she 'll get no DonNELLing from me , I can assure you ."
It 's from Doctor Forbes 's little girls -- the ones that gave me the mittens . ''
"He handed her the little note , and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove ."
"`` Well , you can please yourself , '' she said as she handed it back , `` but William John could n't go if he had ten invitations ."
He caught cold coasting yesterday .
"I told him he would , but he was bound to go , and now he 's laid up for a week ."
Listen to him barking in the bedroom there . ''
"`` Well , then , I wo n't go either , '' said Bertie with a sigh , it might be of relief , or it might be of disappointment ."
`` I would n't go there all alone . ''
`` You 're a goose ! ''
said his aunt .
`` They would n't eat you .
"But as I said , please yourself ."
"Anyhow , hold your tongue about it to William John , or you 'll have him crying and bawling to go too . ''"
The caution came too late .
"William John had already heard it , and when his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment , she found him with the ragged quilt over his head crying ."
"`` Come , William John , I want to rub you . ''"
"`` I do n't want to be rubbed -- g ` way , '' sobbed William John ."
`` I heard you out there -- you need n't think I did n't .
Bertie 's going to Doctor Forbes 's to dinner and I ca n't go . ''
"`` Well , you 've only yourself to thank for it , '' returned his mother ."
"`` If you had n't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you to stay in , you 'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes 's ."
Little boys who wo n't do as they 're told always get into trouble .
"Stop crying , now ."
"I dare say if Bertie goes they 'll send you some candy , or something . ''"
But William John refused to be comforted .
"He cried himself to sleep that night , and when Bertie went in to see him next morning , he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face ."
"`` Well , William John , how are you ? ''"
"`` I ai n't any better , '' replied William John mournfully ."
"`` I s ` pose you 'll have a great time tomorrow night , Bertie ? ''"
"`` Oh , I 'm not going since you ca n't , '' said Bertie cheerily ."
"He thought this would comfort William John , but it had exactly the opposite effect ."
"William John had cried until he could cry no more , but he turned around and sobbed ."
"`` Think out that question , too , in your thinking out , Clorinda . ''"
"`` Well , I must say bye-bye and run home ."
"I feel cheered up -- you always cheer people up , Aunt Emmy ."
How grey it is outdoors .
I do hope we 'll have snow soon .
Would n't it be jolly to have a white Christmas ?
We always have such faded brown Decembers . ''
Clorinda lived just across the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white house behind some huge willows .
"But Aunt Mary lived there too -- the only relative Clorinda had , for Aunt Emmy was n't really her aunt at all ."
Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since she could remember .
"Clorinda went home and upstairs to her little room under the eaves , where the great bare willow boughs were branching athwart her windows ."
She was thinking over what Aunt Emmy had said about Christmas gifts and giving .
"`` I 'm sure I do n't know what she could have meant , '' pondered Clorinda ."
`` I do wish I could find out if it would help me any .
I 'd love to remember a few of my friends at least .
There 's Miss Mitchell ... she 's been so good to me all this year and helped me so much with my studies .
And there 's Mrs. Martin out in Manitoba .
If I could only send her something !
She must be so lonely out there .
"And Aunt Emmy herself , of course ; and poor old Aunt Kitty down the lane ; and Aunt Mary and , yes -- Florence too , although she did treat me so meanly ."
I shall never feel the same to her again .
"But she gave me a present last Christmas , and so out of mere politeness I ought to give her something . ''"
Clorinda stopped short suddenly .
She had just remembered that she would not have liked to say that last sentence to Aunt Emmy .
"Therefore , there was something wrong about it ."
Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to be something wrong in anything that could not be said to Aunt Emmy .
So she stopped to think it over .
Clorinda puzzled over Aunt Emmy 's meaning for four days and part of three nights .
Then all at once it came to her .
"Or if it was n't Aunt Emmy 's meaning it was a very good meaning in itself , and it grew clearer and expanded in meaning during the days that followed , although at first Clorinda shrank a little from some of the conclusions to which it led her ."
"`` I 've solved the problem of my Christmas giving for this year , '' she told Aunt Emmy ."
`` I have some things to give after all .
"Marilla promised ; but the promise was quite unnecessary , for Mrs. Lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said , `` I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was coming home from Carmody ."
I thought he looked pretty mad .
Did he make much of a rumpus ? ''
Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles .
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde .
"It was only that morning Anne had said , `` If you went to your own room at midnight , locked the door , pulled down the blind , and SNEEZED , Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was ! ''"
"`` I believe he did , '' admitted Marilla ."
`` I was away .
He gave Anne a piece of his mind . ''
"`` I think he is a very disagreeable man , '' said Anne , with a resentful toss of her ruddy head ."
"`` You never said a truer word , '' said Mrs. Rachel solemnly ."
"`` I knew there 'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man , that 's what ."
"I do n't know what Avonlea is coming to , with so many strange people rushing into it ."
It 'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds . ''
"`` Why , what other strangers are coming in ? ''"
asked Marilla .
`` Have n't you heard ?
"Well , there 's a family of Donnells , for one thing ."
They 've rented Peter Sloane 's old house .
Peter has hired the man to run his mill .
They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them .
Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from White Sands and they 'll simply be a burden on the public .
He is in consumption ... when he is n't stealing ... and his wife is a slack-twisted creature that ca n't turn her hand to a thing .
She washes her dishes SITTING DOWN .
"Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband 's orphan nephew , Anthony Pye ."
"He 'll be going to school to you , Anne , so you may expect trouble , that 's what ."
"And you 'll have another strange pupil , too ."
Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother .
"You remember his father , Marilla ... Stephen Irving , him that jilted Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton ? ''"
`` I do n't think he jilted her .
There was a quarrel ... I suppose there was blame on both sides . ''
"`` Well , anyway , he did n't marry her , and she 's been as queer as possible ever since , they say ... living all by herself in that little stone house she calls Echo Lodge ."
"And she said I was always to be kind to Dora and stand up for her , and I 'm going to . ''"
`` Do you call pulling her hair being kind to her ? ''
"`` Well , I ai n't going to let anybody else pull it , '' said Davy , doubling up his fists and frowning ."
`` They 'd just better try it .
I did n't hurt her much ... she just cried 'cause she 's a girl .
I 'm glad I 'm a boy but I 'm sorry I 'm a twin .
"When Jimmy Sprott 's sister conterdicks him he just says , ` I 'm oldern you , so of course I know better , ' and that settles HER ."
"But I ca n't tell Dora that , and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me ."
"You might let me drive the gee-gee for a spell , since I 'm a man . ''"
"Altogether , Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard , where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves ."
Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out .
"Dora submitted calmly to be kissed , but Davy responded to Anne 's welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement , `` I 'm Mr. Davy Keith . ''"
"At the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady , but Davy 's manners left much to be desired ."
"`` I 'm so hungry I ai n't got time to eat p ` litely , '' he said when Marilla reproved him ."
`` Dora ai n't half as hungry as I am .
Look at all the ex ` cise I took on the road here .
That cake 's awful nice and plummy .
"We have n't had any cake at home for ever 'n ever so long , 'cause mother was too sick to make it and Mrs. Sprott said it was as much as she could do to bake our bread for us ."
And Mrs. Wiggins never puts any plums in HER cakes .
Catch her !
Can I have another piece ? ''
Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice .
"However , she reminded Davy that he ought to say `` Thank you '' for it ."
Davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite .
"When he had finished the slice he said , `` If you 'll give me ANOTHER piece I 'll say thank you for IT . ''"
"`` No , you have had plenty of cake , '' said Marilla in a tone which Anne knew and Davy was to learn to be final ."
"Davy winked at Anne , and then , leaning over the table , snatched Dora 's first piece of cake , from which she had just taken one dainty little bite , out of her very fingers and , opening his mouth to the fullest extent , crammed the whole slice in ."
Dora 's lip trembled and Marilla was speechless with horror .
"Anne promptly exclaimed , with her best `` schoolma'am '' air , `` Oh , Davy , gentlemen do n't do things like that . ''"
"`` I know they do n't , '' said Davy , as soon as he could speak , `` but I ai n't a gemplum . ''"
`` But do n't you want to be ? ''
said shocked Anne .
"I thought Miss Bat did the sewing , '' said Mr. Bemis , as he smiled at the funny little garment , it looked so like Boo himself ."
"`` No , sir ; only yours ."
I do mine and Boo 's .
"At least , I 'm learning how , and Mrs. Pecq says I get on nicely , '' answered Molly , threading her needle and making a knot in her most capable way ."
"`` I suppose it is time you did learn , for you are getting to be a great girl , and all women should know how to make and mend ."
"You must take a stitch for me now and then : Miss Bat 's eyes are not what they were , I find ; '' and Mr. Bemis looked at his frayed wristband , as if he particularly felt the need of a stitch just then ."
"`` I 'd love to , and I guess I could ."
"I can mend gloves ; Merry taught me , so I 'd better begin on them , if you have any , '' said Molly , much pleased at being able to do anything for her father , and still more so at being asked ."
"`` There 's something to start with ; '' and he threw her a pair , with nearly every finger ripped ."
"Molly shook her head over them , but got out her gray silk and fell to work , glad to show how well she could sew ."
`` What are you smiling about ? ''
"asked her father , after a little pause , for his head felt better , and it amused him to question Molly ."
`` I was thinking about my summer clothes .
"I must get them before long , and I 'd like to go with Mrs. Grant and learn how to shop , if you are willing . ''"
`` I thought Miss Bat did that for you . ''
"`` She always has , but she gets ugly , cheap things that I do n't like ."
"I think I am old enough to choose myself , if there is someone to tell me about prices and the goodness of the stuff ."
Merry does ; and she is only a few months older than I am . ''
"`` How old are you , child ? ''"
"asked her father , feeling as if he had lost his reckoning ."
`` Fifteen in August ; '' and Molly looked very proud of the fact .
`` So you are !
"Bless my heart , how the time goes !"
"Well , get what you please ; if I 'm to have a young lady here , I 'd like to have her prettily dressed ."
"It wo n't offend Miss Bat , will it ? ''"
"Molly 's eyes sparkled , but she gave a little shrug as she answered , `` She wo n't care ."
She never troubles herself about me if I let her alone .
`` Hey ?
what ?
Not trouble herself ?
"If she does n't , who does ? ''"
and Mr. Bemis sat up as if this discovery was more surprising than the other .
"Then she came over , sat down beside me , and took me in her arms . ''"
"` Do n't cry , dear little Rilla-my-Rilla ."
"You have nothing to reproach yourself with in regard to Fred ; and if Leslie West 's son asked you to keep your lips for him , I think you may consider yourself engaged to him ."
"But -- oh , my baby -- my last little baby -- I have lost you -- the war has made a woman of you too soon . '"
`` I shall never be too much of a woman to find comfort in mother 's hugs .
"Nevertheless , when I saw Fred marching by two days later in the parade , my heart ached unbearably ."
`` But I 'm glad mother thinks I 'm really engaged to Ken ! ''
"CHAPTER XXII LITTLE DOG MONDAY KNOWS `` It is two years tonight since the dance at the light , when Jack Elliott brought us news of the war ."
"Do you remember , Miss Oliver ? ''"
Cousin Sophia answered for Miss Oliver .
"`` Oh , indeed , Rilla , I remember that evening only too well , and you a-prancing down here to show off your party clothes ."
Did n't I warn you that we could not tell what was before us ?
Little did you think that night what was before you . ''
"`` Little did any of us think that , '' said Susan sharply , `` not being gifted with the power of prophecy ."
"It does not require any great foresight , Sophia Crawford , to tell a body that she will have some trouble before her life is over ."
I could do as much myself . ''
"`` We all thought the war would be over in a few months then , '' said Rilla wistfully ."
`` When I look back it seems so ridiculous that we ever could have supposed it . ''
"`` And now , two years later , it is no nearer the end than it was then , '' said Miss Oliver gloomily ."
Susan clicked her knitting-needles briskly .
"`` Now , Miss Oliver , dear , you know that is not a reasonable remark ."
"You know we are just two years nearer the end , whenever the end is appointed to be . ''"
"`` Albert read in a Montreal paper today that a war expert gives it as his opinion that it will last five years more , '' was Cousin Sophia 's cheerful contribution ."
"`` It ca n't , '' cried Rilla ; then she added with a sigh , `` Two years ago we would have said ` It ca n't last two years . '"
But five more years of this ! ''
"`` If Rumania comes in , as I have strong hopes now of her doing , you will see the end in five months instead of five years , '' said Susan ."
"`` I 've no faith in furriners , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` The French are foreigners , '' retorted Susan , `` and look at Verdun ."
And think of all the Somme victories this blessed summer .
The Big Push is on and the Russians are still going well .
"Why , General Haig says that the German officers he has captured admit that they have lost the war . ''"
"`` You ca n't believe a word the Germans say , '' protested Cousin Sophia ."
says he .
`` This is nae kind of time of night for decent folk ; and I hae nae trokings * wi ' night-hawks .
What brings ye here ?
I have a blunderbush . ''
* Dealings .
"`` Is that yoursel ' , Mr. Balfour ? ''"
"returned Alan , stepping back and looking up into the darkness ."
`` Have a care of that blunderbuss ; they 're nasty things to burst . ''
`` What brings ye here ?
and whae are ye ? ''
"says my uncle , angrily ."
"`` I have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the country-side , '' said Alan ; `` but what brings me here is another story , being more of your affair than mine ; and if ye 're sure it 's what ye would like , I 'll set it to a tune and sing it to you . ''"
`` And what is ` t ? ''
asked my uncle .
"`` David , '' says Alan ."
`` What was that ? ''
"cried my uncle , in a mighty changed voice ."
"`` Shall I give ye the rest of the name , then ? ''"
said Alan .
"There was a pause ; and then , `` I 'm thinking I 'll better let ye in , '' says my uncle , doubtfully ."
"`` I dare say that , '' said Alan ; `` but the point is , Would I go ?"
Now I will tell you what I am thinking .
"I am thinking that it is here upon this doorstep that we must confer upon this business ; and it shall be here or nowhere at all whatever ; for I would have you to understand that I am as stiffnecked as yoursel ' , and a gentleman of better family . ''"
"This change of note disconcerted Ebenezer ; he was a little while digesting it , and then says he , `` Weel , weel , what must be must , '' and shut the window ."
"But it took him a long time to get down-stairs , and a still longer to undo the fastenings , repenting -LRB- I dare say -RRB- and taken with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar ."
"At last , however , we heard the creak of the hinges , and it seems my uncle slipped gingerly out and -LRB- seeing that Alan had stepped back a pace or two -RRB- sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his hands ."
"`` And , now '' says he , `` mind I have my blunderbush , and if ye take a step nearer ye 're as good as deid . ''"
"`` And a very civil speech , '' says Alan , `` to be sure . ''"
"`` Na , '' says my uncle , `` but this is no a very chanty kind of a proceeding , and I 'm bound to be prepared ."
"And now that we understand each other , ye 'll can name your business . ''"
"`` Why , '' says Alan , `` you that are a man of so much understanding , will doubtless have perceived that I am a Hieland gentleman ."
"My name has nae business in my story ; but the county of my friends is no very far from the Isle of Mull , of which ye will have heard ."
"I should think you ought to be able to , with that imagination you 're always talking of . ''"
"`` But punishments are so horrid and I like to imagine only pleasant things , '' said Anne , cuddling Davy ."
`` There are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more . ''
"In the end Davy was sent to bed , as usual , there to remain until noon next day ."
"He evidently did some thinking , for when Anne went up to her room a little later she heard him calling her name softly ."
"Going in , she found him sitting up in bed , with his elbows on his knees and his chin propped on his hands ."
"`` Anne , '' he said solemnly , `` is it wrong for everybody to tell whop ... falsehoods ?"
I want to know ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed . ''"
`` Is it wrong for a grown-up person ? ''
`` Yes . ''
"`` Then , '' said Davy decidedly , `` Marilla is bad , for SHE tells them ."
"And she 's worse 'n me , for I did n't know it was wrong but she does . ''"
"`` Davy Keith , Marilla never told a story in her life , '' said Anne indignantly ."
`` She did so .
She told me last Tuesday that something dreadful WOULD happen to me if I did n't say my prayers every night .
"And I have n't said them for over a week , just to see what would happen ... and nothing has , '' concluded Davy in an aggrieved tone ."
"Anne choked back a mad desire to laugh with the conviction that it would be fatal , and then earnestly set about saving Marilla 's reputation ."
"`` Why , Davy Keith , '' she said solemnly , `` something dreadful HAS happened to you this very day . ''"
Davy looked sceptical .
"`` I s ` pose you mean being sent to bed without any supper , '' he said scornfully , `` but THAT is n't dreadful ."
"Course , I do n't like it , but I 've been sent to bed so much since I come here that I 'm getting used to it ."
"And you do n't save anything by making me go without supper either , for I always eat twice as much for breakfast . ''"
`` I do n't mean your being sent to bed .
I mean the fact that you told a falsehood today .
"And , Davy , '' ... Anne leaned over the footboard of the bed and shook her finger impressively at the culprit ... `` for a boy to tell what is n't true is almost the worst thing that could HAPPEN to him ... almost the very worst ."
So you see Marilla told you the truth . ''
"`` But I thought the something bad would be exciting , '' protested Davy in an injured tone ."
`` Marilla is n't to blame for what you thought .
Bad things are n't always exciting .
They 're very often just nasty and stupid . ''
"`` It was awful funny to see Marilla and you looking down the well , though , '' said Davy , hugging his knees ."
There could n't be a better child and you 'd hardly know she was in the house . ''
"`` Dora is too good , '' said Anne ."
`` She 'd behave just as well if there was n't a soul to tell her what to do .
"She was born already brought up , so she does n't need us ; and I think , '' concluded Anne , hitting on a very vital truth , `` that we always love best the people who need us ."
Davy needs us badly . ''
"`` He certainly needs something , '' agreed Marilla ."
`` Rachel Lynde would say it was a good spanking . ''
"XI Facts and Fancies `` Teaching is really very interesting work , '' wrote Anne to a Queen 's Academy chum ."
`` Jane says she thinks it is monotonous but I do n't find it so .
"Something funny is almost sure to happen every day , and the children say such amusing things ."
"Jane says she punishes her pupils when they make funny speeches , which is probably why she finds teaching monotonous ."
This afternoon little Jimmy Andrews was trying to spell ` speckled ' and could n't manage it .
"` Well , ' he said finally , ' I ca n't spell it but I know what it means . ' ''"
` What ? '
I asked . ''
"` St. Clair Donnell 's face , miss . '"
"`` St. Clair is certainly very much freckled , although I try to prevent the others from commenting on it ... for I was freckled once and well do I remember it ."
But I do n't think St. Clair minds .
It was because Jimmy called him ` St. Clair ' that St. Clair pounded him on the way home from school .
"I heard of the pounding , but not officially , so I do n't think I 'll take any notice of it ."
`` Yesterday I was trying to teach Lottie Wright to do addition .
"I said , ` If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other , how many would you have altogether ? ' '"
"A mouthful , ' said Lottie ."
"And in the nature study class , when I asked them to give me a good reason why toads should n't be killed , Benjie Sloane gravely answered , ` Because it would rain the next day . '"
"`` It 's so hard not to laugh , Stella ."
"I have to save up all my amusement until I get home , and Marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild shrieks of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent cause ."
She says a man in Grafton went insane once and that was how it began .
`` Did you know that Thomas a Becket was canonized as a SNAKE ?
Rose Bell says he was ... also that William Tyndale WROTE the New Testament .
Claude White says a ` glacier ' is a man who puts in window frames !
"`` I think the most difficult thing in teaching , as well as the most interesting , is to get the children to tell you their real thoughts about things ."
One stormy day last week I gathered them around me at dinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if I were one of themselves .
said Nat innocently .
"`` Well , I do n't know about that , '' began Mrs. Bhaer , rather startled by the coolness of the proposition ."
"`` Why , I thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you , and be kind to 'em as you were to me , '' said Nat , looking surprised and alarmed ."
"`` So I do , but I like to know something about them first ."
"I have to choose them , because there are so many ."
I have not room for all .
I wish I had . ''
"`` I told him to come because I thought you 'd like it , but if there is n't room he can go away again , '' said Nat , sorrowfully ."
"The boy 's confidence in her hospitality touched Mrs. Bhaer , and she could not find the heart to disappoint his hope , and spoil his kind little plan , so she said , `` Tell me about this Dan . ''"
"`` I do n't know any thing , only he has n't got any folks , and he 's poor , and he was good to me , so I 'd like to be good to him if I could . ''"
"`` Excellent reasons every one ; but really , Nat , the house is full , and I do n't know where I could put him , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , more and more inclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her ."
"`` He could have my bed , and I could sleep in the barn ."
"It is n't cold now , and I do n't mind , I used to sleep anywhere with father , '' said Nat , eagerly ."
"Something in his speech and face made Mrs. Jo put her hand on his shoulder , and say in her kindest tone : `` Bring in your friend , Nat ; I think we must find room for him without giving him your place . ''"
"Nat joyfully ran off , and soon returned followed by a most unprepossessing boy , who slouched in and stood looking about him , with a half bold , half sullen look , which made Mrs. Bhaer say to herself , after one glance , `` A bad specimen , I am afraid . ''"
"`` This is Dan , '' said Nat , presenting him as if sure of his welcome ."
"`` Nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us , '' began Mrs. Jo , in a friendly tone ."
"`` Yes , '' was the gruff reply ."
`` Have you no friends to take care of you ? ''
`` No . ''
"`` Say , ` No , ma'am , ' '' whispered Nat ."
"`` Sha n't neither , '' muttered Dan ."
`` How old are you ? ''
`` About fourteen . ''
`` You look older .
What can you do ? '' ''
` Most anything . ''
"`` If you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do , work and study as well as play ."
Are you willing to agree to that ? ''
`` Do n't mind trying . ''
"`` Well , you can stay a few days , and we will see how we get on together ."
"Take him out , Nat , and amuse him till Mr. Bhaer comes home , when we will settle about the matter , '' said Mrs. Jo , finding it rather difficult to get on with this cool young person , who fixed his big black eyes on her with a hard , suspicious expression , sorrowfully unboyish ."
"It seems there was a ship lost in those parts ; and the next day a gentleman of my family was seeking wreck-wood for his fire along the sands , when he came upon a lad that was half drowned ."
"Well , he brought him to ; and he and some other gentleman took and clapped him in an auld , ruined castle , where from that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends ."
"My friends are a wee wild-like , and not so particular about the law as some that I could name ; and finding that the lad owned some decent folk , and was your born nephew , Mr. Balfour , they asked me to give ye a bit call and confer upon the matter ."
"And I may tell ye at the off-go , unless we can agree upon some terms , ye are little likely to set eyes upon him ."
"For my friends , '' added Alan , simply , `` are no very well off . ''"
My uncle cleared his throat .
"`` I 'm no very caring , '' says he ."
"`` He wasnae a good lad at the best of it , and I 've nae call to interfere . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Alan , `` I see what ye would be at : pretending ye do n't care , to make the ransom smaller . ''"
"`` Na , '' said my uncle , `` it 's the mere truth ."
"I take nae manner of interest in the lad , and I 'll pay nae ransome , and ye can make a kirk and a mill of him for what I care . ''"
"`` Hoot , sir , '' says Alan ."
"`` Blood 's thicker than water , in the deil 's name !"
"Ye cannae desert your brother 's son for the fair shame of it ; and if ye did , and it came to be kennt , ye wouldnae be very popular in your country-side , or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` I 'm no just very popular the way it is , '' returned Ebenezer ; `` and I dinnae see how it would come to be kennt ."
"No by me , onyway ; nor yet by you or your friends ."
"So that 's idle talk , my buckie , '' says he ."
"`` Then it 'll have to be David that tells it , '' said Alan ."
`` How that ? ''
"says my uncle , sharply ."
"`` Ou , just this way , '' says Alan ."
"`` My friends would doubtless keep your nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it , but if there was nane , I am clearly of opinion they would let him gang where he pleased , and be damned to him ! ''"
"`` Ay , but I 'm no very caring about that either , '' said my uncle ."
`` I wouldnae be muckle made up with that . ''
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
`` And what for why ? ''
asked Ebenezer .
"`` Why , Mr. Balfour , '' replied Alan , `` by all that I could hear , there were two ways of it : either ye liked David and would pay to get him back ; or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him , and would pay for us to keep him ."
"It seems it 's not the first ; well then , it 's the second ; and blythe am I to ken it , for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket and the pockets of my friends . ''"
"`` I dinnae follow ye there , '' said my uncle ."
`` No ? ''
said Alan .
"I know I used to be a selfish , thoughtless creature -- how selfish and thoughtless I am ashamed to remember now , so I ca n't be quite so bad as I was ."
`` I wish I could help Miranda .
It would be very romantic to contrive a war-wedding and I should dearly love to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
But at present the oracle has not spoken . ''
"CHAPTER XVIII A WAR-WEDDING `` I can tell you this Dr. dear , '' said Susan , pale with wrath , `` that Germany is getting to be perfectly ridiculous . ''"
They were all in the big Ingleside kitchen .
Susan was mixing biscuits for supper .
"Mrs. Blythe was making shortbread for Jem , and Rilla was compounding candy for Ken and Walter -- it had once been `` Walter and Ken '' in her thoughts but somehow , quite unconsciously , this had changed until Ken 's name came naturally first ."
"Cousin Sophia was also there , knitting ."
"All the boys were going to be killed in the long run , so Cousin Sophia felt in her bones , but they might better die with warm feet than cold ones , so Cousin Sophia knitted faithfully and gloomily ."
"Into this peaceful scene erupted the doctor , wrathful and excited over the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa ."
And Susan became automatically quite as wrathful and excited .
`` What will those Huns do next ? ''
she demanded .
`` Coming over here and burning our Parliament building !
Did anyone ever hear of such an outrage ? ''
"`` We do n't know that the Germans are responsible for this , '' said the doctor -- much as if he felt quite sure they were ."
`` Fires do start without their agency sometimes .
And Uncle Mark MacAllister 's barn was burnt last week .
"You can hardly accuse the Germans of that , Susan . ''"
"`` Indeed , Dr. dear , I do not know . ''"
Susan nodded slowly and portentously .
`` Whiskers-on-the-moon was there that very day .
The fire broke out half an hour after he was gone .
So much is a fact -- but I shall not accuse a Presbyterian elder of burning anybody 's barn until I have proof .
"However , everybody knows , Dr. dear , that both Uncle Mark 's boys have enlisted , and that Uncle Mark himself makes speeches at all the recruiting meetings ."
So no doubt Germany is anxious to get square with him . ''
"`` I could never speak at a recruiting meeting , '' said Cousin Sophia solemnly ."
"`` I could never reconcile it to my conscience to ask another woman 's son to go , to murder and be murdered . ''"
`` Could you not ? ''
said Susan .
"`` Well , Sophia Crawford , I felt as if I could ask anyone to go when I read last night that there were no children under eight years of age left alive in Poland ."
"`` There is no sense in believing a thing just because you 'd like to believe it , Susan Baker ."
The British have lost millions of men at the Somme and how far have they got ?
"Look facts in the face , Susan Baker , look facts in the face . ''"
`` They are wearing the Germans out and so long as that happens it does not matter whether it is done a few miles east or a few miles west .
"I am not , '' admitted Susan in tremendous humility , `` I am not a military expert , Sophia Crawford , but even I can see that , and so could you if you were not determined to take a gloomy view of everything ."
The Huns have not got all the cleverness in the world .
"Have you not heard the story of Alistair MacCallum 's son Roderick , from the Upper Glen ?"
He is a prisoner in Germany and his mother got a letter from him last week .
"He wrote that he was being very kindly treated and that all the prisoners had plenty of food and so on , till you would have supposed everything was lovely ."
"But when he signed his name , right in between Roderick and MacCallum , he wrote two Gaelic words that meant ` all lies ' and the German censor did not understand Gaelic and thought it was all part of Roddy 's name ."
"So he let it pass , never dreaming how he was diddled ."
"Well , I am going to leave the war to Haig for the rest of the day and make a frosting for my chocolate cake ."
And when it is made I shall put it on the top shelf .
The last one I made I left it on the lower shelf and little Kitchener sneaked in and clawed all the icing off and ate it .
We had company for tea that night and when I went to get my cake what a sight did I behold ! ''
`` Has that pore orphan 's father never been heerd from yet ? ''
asked Cousin Sophia .
"`` Yes , I had a letter from him in July , '' said Rilla ."
"`` He said that when he got word of his wife 's death and of my taking the baby -- Mr. Meredith wrote him , you know -- he wrote right away , but as he never got any answer he had begun to think his letter must have been lost . ''"
"`` It took him two years to begin to think it , '' said Susan scornfully ."
`` Some people think very slow .
"Jim Anderson has not got a scratch , for all he has been two years in the trenches ."
"A fool for luck , as the old proverb says . ''"
"`` He wrote very nicely about Jims and said he 'd like to see him , '' said Rilla ."
"`` So I wrote and told him all about the wee man , and sent him snapshots ."
Jims will be two years old next week and he is a perfect duck . ''
"`` You did n't used to be very fond of babies , '' said Cousin Sophia ."
"`` I 'm not a bit fonder of babies in the abstract than ever I was , '' said Rilla , frankly ."
"`` But I do love Jims , and I 'm afraid I was n't really half as glad as I should have been when Jim Anderson 's letter proved that he was safe and sound . ''"
`` You was n't hoping the man would be killed ! ''
cried Cousin Sophia in horrified accents .
`` No -- no -- no !
"""Well! well!"" said Boots; ""but now that I am here, I may as well try what I can do with him; and I will see if I can't free my brothers, who are standing turned to stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that I will."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said the Princess; ""and so let us see if we can't hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to what he and I talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a mouse."""
"So he crept under the bed, and he had scarce got well underneath it, before the Giant came."
"""Ha!"" roared the Giant, ""what a smell of Christian blood there is in the house!"""
"""Yes, I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out, but all one can do, the smell doesn't go off so soon."""
"So the Giant said no more about it, and when night came, they went to bed. After they had lain a while, the Princess said:"
"""There is one thing I'd be so glad to ask you about, if I only dared."""
"""What thing is that?"" asked the Giant."
"""Only where it is you keep your heart, since you don't carry it about you,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah! that's a thing you've no business to ask about; but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill,"" said the Giant."
"""Ho! ho!"" said Boots to himself under the bed, ""then we'll soon see if we can't find it."""
"Next morning the Giant got up cruelly early, and strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house before Boots and the Princess set to work to look under the door-sill for his heart; but the more they dug, and the more they hunted, the more they couldn't find it."
"""He has baulked us this time,"" said the Princess, ""but we'll try him once more."""
"So she picked all the prettiest flowers she could find, and strewed them over the door-sill, which they had laid in its right place again; and when the time came for the Giant to come home again, Boots crept under the bed. Just as he was well under, back came the Giant."
"Snuff snuff, went the Giant's nose. ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here,"" said he."
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as I could to get it out, but I daresay it's that you smell."""
"So the Giant held his peace, and said no more about it. A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the door-sill."
"""Oh, I, of course,"" said the Princess."
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this?"" said the Giant."
"""Ah!"" said the Princess, ""I'm so fond of you that I couldn't help strewing them, when I knew that your heart lay under there."""
"""You don't say so,"" said the Giant; ""but after all it doesn't lie there at all."""
"So when they went to bed again in the evening, the Princess asked the Giant again where his heart was, for she said she would so like to know."
"""Well,"" said the Giant, ""if you must know, it lies away yonder in the cupboard against the wall."""
"""So, so!"" thought Boots and the Princess; ""then we'll soon try to find it."""
"Next morning the Giant was away early, and strode off to the wood, and so soon as he was gone Boots and the Princess were in the cupboard hunting for his heart, but the more they sought for it, the less they found it."
"""Well,"" said the Princess, ""we'll just try him once more."""
"So she decked out the cupboard with flowers and garlands, and when the time came for the Giant to come home, Boots crept under the bed again."
Then back came the Giant.
"Snuff snuff! ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here!"""
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess; ""for a little while since there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out of the house again; but after all my pains, I daresay it's that you smell."""
"When the Giant heard that, he said no more about it; but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers and garlands; so he asked who it was that had done that? Who could it be but the Princess?"
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this tomfoolery?"" asked the Giant."
"Then the tiger called the Raja's son, and when he came the tiger and his wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good dinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at the tiger's foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said good-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, ""If ever you are in trouble, think of me, and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he found four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four things, a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished to go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food, or clothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he wanted, no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war on him, ""Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,"" and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up."
"The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, ""I want this;"" another said, ""You cannot have it, for I want it;"" and so on."
"The Raja's son said to them, ""Do not quarrel for these things. I will shoot four arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets to my first arrow, shall have the first thing the bed. Whosoever gets to the second arrow, shall have the second thing the bag. He who gets to the third arrow, shall have the third thing the bowl. And he who gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things the stick and rope."" To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow."
"Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he shot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he shot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot off the fourth."
"While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja's son let his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl, the stick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, ""Bed, I wish to go to the Princess Labam's country."" The little bed instantly rose up into the air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to the Princess Labam's country, where it settled on the ground. The Raja's son asked some men he saw, ""Whose country is this?"""
"""The Princess Labam's country,"" they answered. Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman."
"""Who are you?"" she said. ""Where do you come from?"""
"""I come from a far country,"" he said; ""do let me stay with you to-night."""
"""No,"" she answered, ""I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has ordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You cannot stay in my house."""
"""You are my aunty,"" said the prince; ""let me remain with you for this one night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the wild beasts will eat me."""
"""Well,"" said the old woman, ""you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow morning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the night in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison."""
"Then she took him into her house, and the Raja's son was very glad."
"The old woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, ""Aunty,"" he said, ""I will give you food."" He put his hand into his bag, saying, ""Bag, I want some dinner,"" and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner, served up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja's son then dined together."
"When they had finished eating, the old woman said, ""Now I will fetch some water."""
"""Don't go,"" said the prince. ""You shall have plenty of water directly."" So he took his bowl and said to it, ""Bowl, I want some water,"" and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince cried out, ""Stop, bowl,"" and the bowl stopped filling. ""See, aunty,"""
"he said, ""with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want."""
"By this time night had come. ""Aunty,"" said the Raja's son, ""why don't you light a lamp?"""
"""There is no need,"" she said. ""Our king has forbidden the people in his country to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter, the Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she shines so that she lights up all the country and our houses, and we can see to do our work as if it were day."""
"When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the moon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat on the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her house; she only came out at night. All the people in her father's country then went about their work and finished it."
"The Raja's son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He said to himself, ""How lovely she is!"""
"At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed. ""Bed,"" he said to it, ""I want to go to the Princess Labam's bed-room."" So the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep."
"The young Raja took his bag and said, ""I want a great deal of betel-leaf,"" and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he laid near the princess's bed, and then his little bed carried him back to the old woman's house."
"Next morning all the princess's servants found the betel-leaf, and began to eat it. ""Where did you get all that betel-leaf?"" asked the princess."
"""We found it near your bed,"" answered the servants. Nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there."
"In the morning the old woman came to the Raja's son. ""Now it is morning,"" she said, ""and you must go; for if the king finds out all I have done for you, he will seize me."""
"""I am ill to-day, dear aunty,"" said the prince; ""do let me stay till to-morrow morning."""
"""Good,"" said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner out of the bag, and the bowl gave them water."
"When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve o'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was soon fast asleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed, and it carried him to the princess. He took his bag and said, ""Bag, I want a most lovely shawl."" It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman's house and slept till morning."
"In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted."
"""See, mother,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is so beautiful."" Her mother was very glad too."
"""Yes, my child,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl."""
"Turning their backs with snippy glee, that Pig said, ""Not I,"""
"and that Cat said, ""Not I,"" and that Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the good Little Red Hen could do nothing but say, ""I will then."""
And she did.
"Carrying the sack of Wheat, she trudged off to the distant mill. There she ordered the Wheat ground into beautiful white flour. When the miller brought her the flour she walked slowly back all the way to her own barnyard in her own picketty-pecketty fashion."
"She even managed, in spite of her load, to catch a nice juicy worm now and then and had one left for the babies when she reached them. Those cunning little fluff-balls were so glad to see their mother. For the first time, they really appreciated her.After this really strenuous day Mrs. Hen retired to her slumbers earlier than usual indeed, before the colors came into the sky to herald the setting of the sun, her usual bedtime hour."
"She would have liked to sleep late in the morning, but her chicks, joining in the morning chorus of the hen yard, drove away all hopes of such a luxury."
"Even as she sleepily half opened one eye, the thought came to her that to-day that Wheat must, somehow, be made into bread."
"She was not in the habit of making bread, although, of course, anyone can make it if he or she follows the recipe with care, and she knew perfectly well that she could do it if necessary."
"So after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day, she hunted up the Pig, the Cat and the Rat."
"Still confident that they would surely help her some day she sang out, ""Who will make the bread?"""
"Alas for the Little Red Hen! Once more her hopes were dashed! For the Pig said, ""Not I,""the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen said once more, ""I will then,"" and she did."
"Feeling that she might have known all the time that she would have to do it all herself, she went and put on a fresh apron and spotless cook's cap. First of all she set the dough, as was proper. When it was time she brought out the moulding board and the baking tins, moulded the bread, divided it into loaves, and put them into the oven to bake."
"All the while the Cat sat lazily by, giggling and chuckling.And close at hand the vain Rat powdered his nose and admired himself in a mirror."
In the distance could be heard the long-drawn snores of the dozing Pig.
At last the great moment arrived. A delicious odor was wafted upon the autumn breeze. Everywhere the barnyard citizens sniffed the air with delight.
The Red Hen ambled in her picketty-pecketty way toward the source of all this excitement.
"Although she appeared to be perfectly calm, in reality she could only with difficulty restrain an impulse to dance and sing, for had she not done all the work on this wonderful bread?"
Small wonder that she was the most excited person in the barnyard!
"She did not know whether the bread would be fit to eat, but joy of joys! when the lovely brown loaves came out of the oven, they were done to perfection."
"Then, probably because she had acquired the habit, the Red Hen called:"
"""Who will eat the Bread?"""
"All the animals in the barnyard were watching hungrily and smacking their lips in anticipation, and the Pig said, ""I will,"" the Cat said, ""I will,"" the Rat said, ""I will."""
"But the Little Red Hen said,"
"""No, you won't. I will."""
And she did.
OLD TALES FROM THE NORTH
EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
"Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so many children that he hadn't much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness."
"And the friends said to each other, ""Well, let us be thankful he is. We have been bothered enough by her coming to us for advice which she never followed."""
THE QUARRELSOME MOLE
"When the first hillock of fresh brown earth was thrown up in the edge of the Forest, the People who lived there said to each other. ""Can it be that we have a new neighbor?"""
"Perhaps the Rabbits, the Ground Hogs, and the Snakes cared the most, for they also made their homes in the ground; yet even the Orioles wanted to know all about it. None of them had ever been acquainted with a Mole."
"They had seen the ridges in the meadows beneath which the Moles had their runways, and they knew that when the Moles were making these long streets under ground, they had to cut an opening through the grass once in a while and throw the loose earth out. This new mound in the forest looked exactly like those in the meadow, so they decided there must be a Mole in the neighborhood."
"If that were so, somebody should call upon him and get acquainted; but how could they call? Mrs. Red Squirrel said: ""Why can't some of you people who are so clever at digging, burrow down and find him?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" twittered the birds; ""that is a good plan."""
"But Mr. Red Squirrel smiled at his wife and said: ""I am afraid, Bushy-tail (that was his pet name for her) that none of our friends here could overtake the Mole. You know he is a very fast runner. If they were following they could never catch him."""
"""Let them burrow down ahead of the place where he is working, then,"""
said she.
"""And the Mole would turn and go another way, not knowing it was a friend looking for him."""
"""Well, why not make an opening into one of his runways and go into it, hunting until he is found?"" said Mrs. Red Squirrel, who was like some other people in not wishing to give up her own ideas."
"""Yes,"" cried a mischievous young Woodpecker; ""let the Ground Hog go. You surely don't think him too fat?"""
"Now there was no denying that the Ground Hog was getting too stout to look well, and people thought he would be angry at this. Perhaps he was angry. The little Rabbits were sure of it. They said they knew by the expression of his tail. Still, you know, the Ground Hog came of a good family, and well-bred people do not say mean things even if they are annoyed. He combed the fur on his face with both paws, and answered with a polite bow: ""If I had the slender and graceful form of my charming friend, Mrs. Red Squirrel, I should be delighted to do as she suggests."""
"That was really a very clever thing for Mr. Ground Hog to say. It was much more agreeable than if he had grunted out, ""Much she knows about it! We burrowing people are all too large."" And now Mrs. Red Squirrel was pleased and happy although her plan was not used."
"That night Mrs. Ground Hog said to her husband: ""I didn't know you admired Mrs. Red Squirrel so much."" And he answered: ""Pooh! Admire her?"
"She is a very good-looking person for one of her family, and I want to be polite to her for her husband's sake. He and I have business together. But for my part I prefer more flesh. I could never have married a slender wife, and I am pleased to see, my dear, that you are stouter than you were."" And this also shows how clever a fellow Mr."
Ground Hog was.
"The very next night, as luck would have it, the Mole came out of his runway for a scamper on the grass. Mr. Ground Hog saw him and made his acquaintance. ""We are glad to have you come,"" said he. ""You will find it a pleasant neighborhood. People are very friendly."""
"""Well, I'm glad of that,"" answered the Mole. ""I don't see any sense in people being disagreeable, myself, but in the meadow which I have just left there were the worst neighbors in the world. I stood it just as long as I could, and then I moved."""
"""I am sorry to hear that,"" said the Ground Hog, gently. ""I had always supposed it a pleasant place to live in."" He began to wonder what kind of fellow the Mole was. He did not like to hear him say such unkind things before a new acquaintance. Sometimes unpleasant things have to be said, but it was not so now."
"""Umph!"" said the Mole. ""You have to live with people to know them. Of course, we Moles had no friends among the insects. We are always glad to meet them in the ground, but they do not seem so glad to meet us. That is easily understood when you remember what hungry people Moles are."
"Friendship is all very well, but when a fellow's stomach is empty, he can't let that stand in the way of a good dinner. There was no such reason why the Tree Frog or the Garter Snake should dislike me."""
"""Are you sure they did dislike you?"""
"""Certain of it. I remember how one night I wanted to talk with the Garter Snake, and asked him to come out of his hole for a visit in the moonlight. He wouldn't come."""
"""What did he say?"" asked the Ground Hog."
"""Not a word! And that was the worst of it. Think how provoking it was for me to stand there and call and call and not get any reply."""
"""Perhaps he was not at home,"" suggested the Ground Hog."
"""That's what he said when I spoke to him. Said he was spending the night down by the river. As though I'd be likely to believe that! I guess he saw that he couldn't fool me, though, for after I told him what I thought of him he wriggled away without saying a word."""
"""Still he is not so disagreeable as the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole, after a pause in which the Ground Hog had been trying not to laugh. The Ground Hog said afterward that it was the funniest sight imaginable to see the stout little Mole scampering back and forth in the moonlight, and stopping every few minutes to scold about the Meadow People. The twitching of his tiny tail and the jerky motions of his large, pink-palmed digging hands, showed how angry he grew in thinking of them, and his pink snout fairly quivered with rage."
"""I will tell you about the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole. ""He is one of these fellows who are always just so good-natured and polite. I can't endure them. I say it's putting on airs to act that way. I was telling him what I thought of the Garter Snake, and what should he do but draw himself up and say: 'Excuse me, but the Garter Snake is a particular friend of mine, and I do not care to hear him spoken of in that way.' I guess I taught him one good lesson, though. I told him he was just the kind of person I should expect the Garter Snake to like, and that I wished them much joy together, but that I didn't want anything to do with them."
How did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway of course.
"And was the nation grateful? Well the nation was very wet. And by the time the nation had gotten dry again it was interested in the new invention for toasting muffins by electricity, and all the dragons were almost forgotten. Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead and gone, and, you know, there never was a reward offered."
And what did Father and Mother say when Effie and Harry got home?
"My dear, that is the sort of silly question you children always will ask. However, just for this once I don't mind telling you."
"Mother said: ""Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe you're safe!"
"You naughty children how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at once!"""
"And their father the doctor said: ""I wish I had known what you were going to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away the one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect specimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the species."""
"The professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands. He had kept his specimen the one the size of an earwig that he gave Harry half a crown for and he has it to this day."
You must get him to show it to you!
"IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told"
"This is the tale of the wonders that befell on the evening of the eleventh of December, when they did what they were told not to do. You may think that you know all the unpleasant things that could possibly happen to you if you are disobedient, but there are some things which even you do not know, and they did not know them either."
Their names were George and Jane.
"There were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day, because the heir to the throne was not well. He was cutting his first tooth, and that is a very anxious time for any person even for a Royal one. He was really very poorly, so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible taste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in Forest Hill, which was the home of Jane and George, anything of the kind was quite out of the question. Even the Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is, felt that this was no time for Catherine-wheels."
"But when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were not only admissible but correct, and the eleventh of December was proclaimed firework day. All the people were most anxious to show their loyalty, and to enjoy themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and torchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal Palace, with ""Blessings on our Prince"" and ""Long Live our Royal Darling"" in different-colored fires; and the most private of boarding schools had a half holiday; and even the children of plumbers and authors had tuppence each given them to spend as they liked."
"George and Jane had sixpence each and they spent the whole amount on a golden rain, which would not light for ever so long, and when it did light went out almost at once, so they had to look at the fireworks in the gardens next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which were very glorious indeed."
"All their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and George were allowed to go out into the garden alone to let off their firework. Jane had put on her fur cape and her thick gloves, and her hood with the silver fox fur on it that was made out of Mother's old muff; and George had his overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and Father's sealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come down over your ears."
"It was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about made it seem very gay, and though the children were cold they were quite sure that they were enjoying themselves."
"They got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see better; and then they saw, very far away, where the edge of the dark world is, a shining line of straight, beautiful lights arranged in a row, as if they were the spears carried by a fairy army."
"""Oh, how pretty,"" said Jane. ""I wonder what they are. It looks as if the fairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them with liquid light."""
"""Liquid fiddlestick!"" said George. He had been to school, so he knew that these were only the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he said so."
"""But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?"" asked Jane. ""Who lights it, and what's it there for?"""
George had to own that he had not learned that.
"""But I know,"" said he, ""that it has something to do with the Great Bear, and the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain."""
"""And what are they?"" asked Jane."
"""Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a jolly rocket,"" answered George, and Jane felt as if she almost understood about the star families."
"The fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They were much prettier than the big, blaring, blazing bonfire that was smoking and flaming and spluttering in the next-door-but-one garden prettier even than the colored fires at the Crystal Palace."
"""I wish we could see them nearer,"" Jane said. ""I wonder if the star families are nice families the kind that Mother would like us to go to tea with, if we were little stars?"""
"""They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly,"" said her brother, kindly trying to explain. ""I only said 'families' because a kid like you wouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've forgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky, so you can't go to tea with them."""
"""No,"" said Jane. ""I said if we were little stars."""
"""But we aren't,"" said George."
"""No,"" said Jane, with a sigh. ""I know that. I'm not so stupid as you think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't we go and see them?"""
"Once, a wise and good preacher, named Gregory, was walking through the market-place in Rome, when he saw a group of slaves standing there, waiting to be bought. Among these slaves were some pretty boys with long yellow hair, and blue eyes, and white skin. This was a strange sight to Gregory, for most of the people in his land had dark hair, and brown skin."
"""Who are these boys?"" asked he of a man who was standing by."
"""They are Angles from over the sea,"" replied the man."
"""Surely not Angles, but Angels,"" said the preacher, looking kindly into the boys' faces. ""Do they come from England?"""
"""From heathen England, where men do not know the true God,"" said the man."
"""Some day they shall be taught to know God, and then indeed they shall be angels,"" said Gregory."
"Now Gregory did not go away and forget this. When he became a great man and Bishop of Rome, he sent a good preacher, named Augustine, to England, to preach to the people there, and to teach them to be Christians."
Hereward the Wake
"When William of Normandy came over the sea, and took the crown of England, many English people would not call him king. The young lord Hereward was one of these. He and his men made for themselves a ""Camp of Refuge"" among the reeds and rushes on the marshes. All day they lay there, hidden from view by the mists which rose from the watery ground, and at night they came out, and attacked the Normans in their tents, and burned their towns."
"Hereward was called ""the Wake"" because he was so watchful and wide-awake that the Normans could not catch him. They were always trying to find him, but they did not know the safe paths over the marshes which he and his men used, and when they tried to cross, they sank with their horses in the soft muddy ground, and had to turn back."
"But at last a false friend of the English showed them the way to the ""Camp of Refuge"", and then Hereward had to flee to save his life. He went with a few friends to the sea-shore, and there he found some fishermen who were going to sell fish to the Norman guards in an English town."
"The fishermen took Hereward and his men into their boats, and covered them with straw; then they set sail. The Norman guards bought the fish as usual, and had it served for dinner. While they were eating it, the English soldiers came quietly from the boats, and killed most of them before they could get their swords to defend themselves. When the English people in the place saw this, they gladly joined Hereward and made him master of their town."
Canute
"There was once a king of England, named Canute, who was a brave and clever man. But he had many lords in his court who were very foolish."
"They feared their master, and wished to please him, and because they knew that he was somewhat vain of his strength and cleverness, they thought he would like to be told that he was great, and wise, and powerful."
"So they praised him every day, and told him that all he did and all he said was good. They said he was the greatest king on earth, and there was nothing in the world too hard for him to do if he chose. At last King Canute tired of their vain words."
"One day, as he walked with his lords on the sea-shore, one of them told him that even the waves would obey him."
"""Bring a chair,"" said Canute, ""and place it close to the water."""
"The chair was brought, and set upon the sand, and the king sat down and spoke to the waves."
"""I command you to come no farther,"" cried he."
"But the waves came on and on, until they wetted Canute's feet, and splashed his chair."
"Then the king rose and went to his lords, who were standing a little way off, staring at their master, and talking in low tones about his strange conduct."
"""Learn from this to keep your tongues from idle praise,"" said he sternly. ""No king is great and powerful but God. He only can say to the sea: 'Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.'"""
The Brave Men of Calais
"Many years ago, King Edward III of England took the town of Calais from the French king. He could not take it by force, for the walls were very strong, but he succeeded by another plan. He placed his soldiers all round the walls, and would let no one go into the town to take food to the people. Inside the walls, the people waited bravely, but at last all their food was eaten, and then they knew that if they tried to hold the town any longer they would starve."
"So the governor sent word to King Edward that he would give up the city, and begged him to have mercy on the people."
"But Edward was angry. ""Tell your masters,"" said he to the messenger, ""that I will not spare the people unless six of the chief men come out to me, with their feet bare, and ropes around their necks."""
"At this sad news, the poor starving people cried aloud. But soon six brave men were found who were ready to die for their countrymen, and, with their feet bare and ropes around their necks, they went out to the place where King Edward was waiting, with Queen Philippa and the English nobles."
"""Great king!"" said the men, ""we bring you the keys of our town, and we pray you to have mercy on us."""
"Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till he had told his father, who said, ""That must be the fruit; go and gather it."" So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and he said to his father, ""Come with me to my room while I open it; I am afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that will eat me."""
"""No,"" said King Dantal; ""remember, Laili will be naked; you must go alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit, for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to eat you."""
"Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor."
"Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari (for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal, and said to him sadly, ""Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen me so many, many times."""
"King Dantal answered, ""It is because you are so beautiful. You are far, far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy directly."" Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun's face and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again."
"Then Laili said, ""Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?"""
"""Oh!"" said Prince Majnun, ""I see you are Laili come back to me, but your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I saw them."" Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs."
"After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden."
"""We must go into that garden and see it,"" said Majnun."
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very wicked man."" But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her. So she said to Majnun, ""Come, come, let us go; do not go near that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he will kill you to seize me."""
"""What nonsense,"" said Majnun. ""I believe he is a very good Raja."
"Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away."""
"""Well,"" said Laili, ""it is better that you should be killed than I, for if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed."" Now Chumman Basa had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and cut off the prince's head at one blow."
"Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her she said, ""Why did you kill my husband?"""
"""Because I want to take you,"" he answered."
"""You cannot,"" said Laili."
"""Yes, I can,"" said the Raja."
"""Take me, then,"" said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant till it was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her arm and her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa's head at one touch."
"Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun's dead body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like healing medicine. Then she put Majnun's head on his shoulders, and smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and said, ""What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had slept for years!"" Then he got up and saw the Raja's dead body by Laili's horse."
"""What's that?"" said Majnun."
"""That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he would."""
"""Who killed him?"" asked Majnun."
"""I did,"" answered Laili, ""and it was I who brought you to life."""
"""Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,"" said Majnun."
"""No,"" said Laili, ""for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you harm."" But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to bring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, ""Jump up on the horse, then, and go far away with the groom."""
"""What will you do,"" said Majnun, ""if I leave you? I cannot leave you."""
"""I will take care of myself,"" said Laili; ""but this man is so wicked, he may kill you again if you are near him."" So Majnun got up on the horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili."
"Then she set the wicked Raja's head straight on his shoulders, and she squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine came out of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife had passed, and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began to run, and she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who tried to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband, and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal's palace."
"There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified and angry. ""How lucky for you that you have such a wife,"" he said."
"""Why did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead."" Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son's safety, and gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he built a splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of ground about it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and heaps of servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their servants to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to go out of them, nor Laili; ""for,"" said King Dantal, ""Laili is so beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away."""
"The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal"
"""Just this one,"" cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly."
"""I must look at this one,"" Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: The Book of Beasts."
"The Chancellor said, ""Don't be a silly little King."""
"But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive."
"""There,"" said Lionel, ""Isn't that lovely? Why """
"But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window."
"""Well!"" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, ""that's magic, that is."""
"But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him."
"Under him was written, ""Blue Bird of Paradise,"" and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book."
"Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:"
"""You're a naughty, disobedient little King!"" and was very angry indeed."
"""I don't see that I've done any harm,"" said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped."
"""No harm?"" said the Chancellor. ""Ah but what do you know about it?"
"That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."""
"""Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,"" said Lionel. ""Come, let's kiss and be friends."" So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts."
"But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of Beasts."
"He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with ""Butterfly"""
"and ""Blue Bird of Paradise"" underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written ""Dragon."" The Dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed."
"But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with ""Dragon"" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon."
"And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!"
Lionel began to cry.
"The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running to see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor said: ""You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and let him think over what he's done."""
"""Perhaps, my Lord,"" said the Prime Minister, ""we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done."""
"Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: ""It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"""
"But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by."
"""You are a naughty little King,"" she said, ""and nobody will love you."""
"Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws."
"And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: ""There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"" he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half the grown-up half pretended to think he was quite right."
Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.
And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse:
"""People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for them."""
"Since the above was written, the account of the death of Governor      Andros is flashed across the wires to us. Verbum sap. Also In      hoc signo vinces."
"The author wishes to express by this means his grateful      acknowledgments to his friends and the public generally for the      great turn-out and general sympathy bestowed upon his relative, the      late Peter B. Stuyvesant, on the sad occasion of his funeral, which      was said to be one of the best attended and most successful      funerals before the war. Should any of his friends be caught in the      same fix, the author will not only cheerfully turn out himself, but      send all hands from his place that can be spared, also a six-seated      wagon and a side-bar buggy."
CHAPTER IX.
SETTLEMENT OF THE MIDDLE STATES.
"The present State of New Jersey was a part of New Netherland, and the Dutch had a trading-post at Bergen as early as 1618. After New Netherland passed into the hands of the Dutch, the Duke of York gave the land lying between the Hudson and the Delaware to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret for Christmas."
"The first permanent English settlement made in the State was at Elizabethtown, named so in honor of Sir George's first wife."
"Berkeley sold his part to some English Quakers. This part was called West Jersey. He claimed that it was too far from town. It was very hard for a lord to clear up land, and Berkeley missed his evenings at the Savage Club, and his nose yearned for a good whiff of real old Rotten Row fog."
"So many disputes arose regarding the title to Jersey that the whole thing finally reverted to the crown in 1702. When there was any trouble over titles in those days it was always settled by letting it revert to the crown. It has been some years now, however, since that has happened in this country."
"Thirty-six years later New Jersey was set apart as a separate royal province, and became a railroad terminus and bathing-place."
"Delaware was settled by the Swedes at Wilmington first, and called New Sweden. I am surprised that the Norsemen, who it is claimed made the first and least expensive summer at Newport, R. I., should not have clung to it."
"They could have made a good investment, and in a few years would have been strong enough to wipe out the Brooklyn police."
"The Swedes, too, had a good foothold in New York, Jersey, and Delaware, also a start in Pennsylvania. But the two nations seemed to yearn for home, and as soon as boats began to run regularly to Stockholm and Christiania, they returned. In later years they discovered Minneapolis and Stillwater."
"William Penn now loomed up on the horizon. He was an English Quaker who had been expelled from Oxford and jugged in Cork also for his religious belief. He was the son of Admiral Sir William Penn, and had a good record. He believed that elocutionary prayer was unnecessary, and that the acoustics of heaven were such that the vilest sinner with no voice-culture could be heard in the remotest portion of the gallery."
"The only thing that has been said against Penn with any sort of semblance of truth was that he had some influence with James II. The Duke of York also stood in with Penn, and used to go about in England bailing William out whenever he was jailed on account of his religious belief."
"Penn was quite a writer (see Appendix). He was the author of ""No Cross, No Crown,"" ""Innocency with her Open Face,"" and ""The Great Cause of Liberty of Conscience."""
"From his father he had inherited a claim against the government for sixteen thousand pounds, probably arrears of pension. He finally received the State of Pennsylvania as payment of the claim. The western boundary took in the Cliff House and Seal Rocks of San Francisco."
"Penn came to America in 1682 and bought his land over again from the Indians. It is not strange that he got the best terms he could out of the Indians, but still it is claimed that they were satisfied, therefore he did not cheat them."
"The Indian, as will be noticed by reading these pages thoughtfully, was never a Napoleon of finance. He is that way down to the present day. If you watch him carefully and notice his ways, you can dicker with him to better advantage than you can with Russell Sage."
"Take the Indian just before breakfast after two or three nights of debauchery, and offer him a jug of absinthe with a horned toad in it for his pony and saddle, and you will get them. Even in his more sober and thoughtful moments you can swap a suit of red medicated flannels with him for a farm."
"Penn gathered about him many different kinds of people, with various sorts and shades of belief. Some were Free-Will and some were Hard-Shell, some were High-Church and reminded one of a Masonic Lodge working at 32°, while others were Low-Church and omitted crossing themselves frequently while putting down a new carpet in the chancel."
"But he was too well known at court, and suspected of knowledge of and participation in some of the questionable acts of King James, so that after the latter's dethronement, and an intimation that Penn had communicated with the exiled monarch, Penn was deprived of his title to Pennsylvania, for which he had twice paid."
"Penn was a constant sufferer at the hands of his associates, who sought to injure him in every way. He rounded out a life of suffering by marrying the second time in 1695."
"In 1708 he was on the verge of bankruptcy, owing to the villany and mismanagement of his agent, and was thrown into Fleet Street Prison, a jail in which he had never before been confined. His health gave way afterwards, and this remarkable man died July 30, 1718."
"Philadelphia was founded in 1683 and work begun on a beautiful building known as the City Hall. Work has steadily progressed on this building from time to time since then, and at this writing it is so near completion as to give promise of being one of the most perfect architectural jobs ever done by the hand of man."
"In two years Philadelphia had sprung from a wilderness, where the rank thistle nodded in the wind, to a town of over two thousand people, exclusive of Indians not taxed. In three years it had gained more than New York had in fifty years. This was due to the fact that the people who came to Philadelphia had nothing to fear but the Indians, while settlers in New York had not only the Indians to defend themselves against, but the police also."
Penn and his followers established the great law that no one who believed in Almighty God should be molested in his religious belief.
"Even the Indians liked Penn, and when the nights were cold they would come and crawl into his bed and sleep with him all night and not kill him at all. The Great Chief of the Tribes, even, did not feel above this, and the two used frequently to lie and talk for hours, Penn doing the talking and the chief doing the lying."
"It is said that, with all the Indian massacres and long wars between the red men and the white, no drop of Quaker blood was ever shed. I quote this from an historian who is much older than I, and with whom I do not wish to have any controversy."

LADY DEDMOND.  Well! it would be better for you and Clare to be
"supposed to be out together, than for her to be out alone.  Go"
quietly into the dining-room and wait for her.
SIR CHARLES.  Good!  Leave your mother to make up something.  She'll
do it!
LADY DEDMOND.  That may be he.  Quick!

LADY DEDMOND.  Don't say anything about your master and mistress
being out.  I'll explain.
"PAYNTER.  The master, my lady?"
"LADY DEDMOND.  Yes, I know.  But you needn't say so.  Do you"
understand?
"PAYNTER.  [In polite dudgeon]  Just so, my lady."
[He goes out.]
SIR CHARLES.  By Jove!  That fellow smells a rat!
"LADY DEDMOND.  Be careful, Charles!"
LADY DEDMOND.  Without letting you know?
GEORGE.  I believe she did tell me.
LADY DEDMOND.  But surely----
GEORGE.  I don't want to discuss it.  There's never anything in
"particular.  We're all anyhow, as you know."
"LADY DEDMOND.  I see.  [She looks shrewdly at her son]  My dear,"
"I should be rather careful about him, I think."
SIR CHARLES.  Who's that?
LADY DEDMOND.  That Mr. Malise.
SIR CHARLES.  Oh!  That chap!
GEORGE.  Clare isn't that sort.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know.  But she catches up notions very easily.  I
think it's a great pity you ever came across him.
SIR CHARLES.  Where did you pick him up?
GEORGE.  Italy--this Spring--some place or other where they couldn't
speak English.

1. Definition of a Hymn.
"St. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been"
widely accepted:
A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song embodying the
praise of God. If there is merely praise but not praise of God it is
"not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of God, but not sung, it is"
"not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is needful, therefore, for it to"
"have three things—praise, praise of God, and these sung."
"A recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that of"
the late Carl F. Price:
"surprise, then with offence, then almost with horror.  GEORGE is"
"about to go up to her, but HUNTINGDON heads him off."
"HUNTINGDON.  Bring the tray along, old man."
"GEORGE takes up the tray, stops to look at CLARE, then allows"
HUNTINGDON to shepherd him out.
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Without looking at CLARE]  Well, if we're going to"
"play, Charles? [She jerks his sleeve.]"
SIR CHARLES.  What?  [He marches out.]
LADY DEDMOND.  [Meeting MALISE in the doorway]  Now you will be able
to have your music.

MALISE.  Never apologize for being fey.  It's much too rare.
CLARE.  On the door-mat!  And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully!
Poor dears!  I wonder if I ought----[She looks towards the door.]

"MORRIS, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"One of the pirates of New Providence, Bahamas, who, on pardon being"
"offered by King George in 1717, escaped, and for a while carried on piracy"
in the West Indian Islands. Caught and hanged a few years afterwards.
"MORRIS, JOHN."
One of Captain Bartholomew Roberts's crew. When the _Royal Fortune_

"Harrison’s view as expressed _op. cit._ p. 594, ‘Here the symbolism"
"seems to be of birth rather than of marriage,’ and again ‘this rite of"
birth or adoption ...’: and indeed this view seems hardly to tally with
"that which she suggests later (p. 600), “Burial itself may well have"
been to them (the Pythagoreans) as to Antigone a mystic marriage: ‘I
"have sunk beneath the bosom of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld.’”"

"THE NAVAL PRIZE ACT, 1864"
"27 & 28 VICT., CHAPTER 25"
An Act for regulating Naval Prize of War.
[_23rd June 1864._]
"Whereas it is expedient to enact permanently, with Amendments, such"
"Provisions concerning Naval Prize, and Matters connected therewith, as"
have heretofore been usually passed at the Beginning of a War:
"Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and"

"""Hurrah!"" said the crowd."
"""I spike Engelish,"" nodded the stranger."
"""How'd you come 'ere?"" asked the eager chorus."
The Frenchman nodded.
"""Goddam!"" he said, smiling.  ""Ship!  Por'smout'--London!  I spick"
"En'lish."""
"""Well, then,"" said Hart desperately, ""just dry up with your mixed"
"hogwash, and spit it all out free as to 'ow you came 'ere, and wot"
"the name o' this bally rock is, and who's its in'abitants.  Now, give"
"it lip!"""
"""Hart's a nateral born speaker, and 'as a clear 'ead,"" said the"
"crowd.  ""'E puts it in a nutshell, and don't run to waste in words."""
But the Frenchman looked puzzled.
"""Comb wiz,"" he said; ""spik En'lish besser,"" and he pointed over the"
low rise.
"""Steady!"" said Hart; ""boys, I'm not clear as to whether we hain't"
bein' led hinto a hambush.  It hain't nateral for shipwrecked
"Englishmen to find Frenchies shipwrecked too!"""

“Why?” asked the old man.
There was a titter....
"Ffolliott, thinking he saw someone he knew, went up to Lovegood and"
slapped the big man on the back:
"“Hullo, old chap!” cried he."
Blank consternation came upon him as Lovegood slowly turned and

nervously:
"“Oh, er--er--I thought you were someone else,” he drawled."
Lovegood nodded gloomily.

Ffolliott tittered confusedly:

had previously taken out of prizes in the West Indies.

"withholding the non-essentials. But, above all, let us fill the scrip"
"with gifts that the child need never reject, even when he passes"
through “the gate of sleep.”

"This Dutch South Sea pirate owned a small plantation in Madagascar, and"
was joined there by the pirate Williams after he had escaped from slavery.
Both were taken prisoner by an English frigate. In a fight with the
"natives, the pirate crew was defeated, but Pro and Williams managed to"
"escape and to reach some friendly natives. Procuring a boat, they sailed"
away to join some other pirates at Methulage in Madagascar.

"A Devon man, a noted sea captain, and a terror to the Spaniards. Was"
imprisoned by King James I. at the instance of the King of Spain for

"The original texts of German hymns found throughout the _Handbook_,"
"especially in the section of Chorales, Book IV, are the versions used in"
"one or more of the following works: _Gesangbuch mit Noten_, (Berne,"
"Ind., 1890); _Gesangbuch der Mennoniten_, (Canadian, 1942); _The"

Liederschatz_. Many variations occur in the texts as found in these
"versions, the explanation of which would require a much greater"
knowledge of German hymnody than the author possesses. An effort has
been made to bring the spelling into conformity with the modern German
practice of omitting the “h” where it was formerly used with the “th”;
the use of “ss” instead of “sz”; and printing the initial letter of the
"pronouns referring to Deity, in lower case rather than with capitals."
AN INTRODUCTION TO OUR HYMNS AND TUNES
With Illustrations From the _Hymnary_
1. Definition of a Hymn.
2. The Beginnings of Christian Song.
3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.
"In a few cases, chiefly of artists, a universally-used sobriquet"
"is to be taken in place of the family or forename, as _Tintoretto_"
(whose real name was Giacomo _Robusti_). Similar cases are _Canaletto_
"(Antonio _Canale_ and also B. _Belotto_), _Correggio_ (Ant. _Allegri_),"
"_Garofalo_ (Benvenuto Piero _Tisi_), Il _Sodoma_ (Giov. Ant. _Bazzi_),"
"_Spagnoletto_ (Jusepe _Ribera_, now however oftener called _Ribera_),"
_Uccello_ (Paolo _Doni_). Always cross-reference from the family name.
"(_b_) In particular, ecclesiastical dignitaries: e.g., _Kaye_, John,"
"Bishop of Lincoln. _Lincoln_, John, Bishop of. See _Kaye_."
"Bishops usually omit their family name, canons their forename: e.g.,"
"_Canon Liddon_, _Bishop of Ripon, Henry Edward_, _Archbishop of"
"Westminster_, i.e., _H. E. Manning_. Care must be taken not to treat"
Canon as a forename or Edward as a family name.
"(_c_) Married women, using the known form:"
"Wives often continue writing, and are known in literature only under"
"their maiden names (as _Miss Freer_ or _Fanny Lewald_), or after a"
second marriage retain for literary purposes the first husband's name.
"Enclose the maiden name in parenthesis: e.g., _Ward, Mrs. Elizabeth"
"(Phelps)_. Use the form _White, Mrs. Julia Charlotte, wife of J. C._,"
"when the husband's name is used: e.g., _Hopkins, Mrs Sarah (Drake)"
"Garretson_. _Stowe, Mrs. Emily Howard (Jennings)_. _Soyaux, Frau Frieda"
"(Schanz)_. _Gasparin, Valérie (Boissier) Comtesse de_."
Women known under their husbands' names are to be entered as follows:
"_Hinkson, Mrs. Katherine (Tynan), Mrs. H. A. Hinkson_. Cross-reference"
to be made from the latter form.
"MRS. FULLARTON, taken aback, cannot refrain from her glance at"
FULLARTON automatically gazing at CLARE while he talks with
HUNTINGDON.
MRS. FULLARTON.  Of course--the only thing is that----
"CLARE.  [With a faint smile]  It's all right, Dolly.  I'm not coming."
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Oh!  don't do anything desperate, Clare--you are so"
desperate sometimes.  You ought to make terms--not tracks.
CLARE.  Haggle?  [She shakes her head]  What have I got to make terms
with?  What he still wants is just what I hate giving.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  But, Clare----"
"CLARE.  No, Dolly; even you don't understand.  All day and every day"
"--just as far apart as we can be--and still--Jolly, isn't it?  If"
you've got a soul at all.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  It's awful, really."
"CLARE.  I suppose there are lots of women who feel as I do, and go on"
"with it; only, you see, I happen to have something in me that--comes"
"to an end.  Can't endure beyond a certain time, ever."
"She has taken a flower from her dress, and suddenly tears it to"
bits.  It is the only sign of emotion she has given.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [Watching]  Look here, my child; this won't do.  You"
must get a rest.  Can't Reggie take you with him to India for a bit?

"(_c_) In all other languages, under the name following the prefix, with"
cross-references whenever the name has been commonly used in English
"with the prefix, as _Del Rio_, _Vandyck, Van Ess_: e.g. _Gama, Vasco"
"da_, _Goethe, J. W. von_."
"But when the name is printed as one word, entry is made under the"
"prefix, as _Vanderhaeghen_."
(_d_) Naturalized names with prefixes are to be treated by the rules of
the nation adopting them.
"Thus German names preceded by _von_, when belonging to Russians, are to"
"be entered under _Von_, as this is the Russian custom. So when Dutch"
names compounded with _van_ are adopted into French or English (as _Van
Laun_) the _Van_ is treated as part of the family name.
"Prefixes are _d', de, de La_ (the name goes under _La_ not _de_),"
"_Des, Du, L', La, Le, Les, St, Ste_ (to be arranged as if written"
"_Saint, Sainte_), _da, dal, dalla, dalle, dai, dagli, del, della,"
"delle, dei_ (_dé_ or _de_), _degli, da, dos_, _das, ten, ter, thor,"
"Van, vander, van't, ver, am, auf, auf'm, aus, aus'm, in, im, von, vom,"
"zu, zum, zur, A', Ap, O', Fitz, Mac_ (which is to be printed as it is"
"in the title, whether _M'_, or _Mc_, or _Mac_, but to be arranged as if"
written _Mac_).
"Index names of capes, lakes, mountains, rivers, forts, etc.,"
"beginning with _Cape_, _Lake_, _Mt._, etc., under the word"
"following the prefix, but when the name is itself used as a"
"prefix, do not transpose _Cape_, etc., nor in such names as _Isle"
"of the Woods_, _Isles of Shoals_; but there is more reason for"
"for chapter sinkages, giving us a volume of about 344 pages. As the"
"presswork is usually done in forms of 32 pages, an effort is always"
made not to exceed even forms by a small number of pages. Striking out
the bastard-title will often save a form of press-work.
Various short-cuts have been suggested for estimating the number of
"words in a printed page, but the old-fashioned method of counting is"
the safest. Here is a table which is as accurate as any short-cut can
be:
Words in
sq. in.
"18-Point (Great Primer), solid     7"
"14-Point (English), solid         10"
"12-Point (Pica), solid            14"
"12-Point (Pica), leaded[35]       11"
"11-Point (Small Pica), solid      17"
"11-Point (Small Pica), leaded     14"
"10-Point (Long Primer), solid     21"
"10-Point (Long Primer), leaded    16"
"9-Point (Bourgeois), solid        26"
"9-Point (Bourgeois), leaded       20"
"8-Point (Brevier), solid          30"
"8-Point (Brevier), leaded         21"
"7-Point (Minion), solid           38"
"7-Point (Minion), leaded          27"
"6-Point (Nonpareil), solid        47"
"6-Point (Nonpareil), leaded       33"
"5-Point (Pearl), solid            69"
"5-Point (Pearl), leaded           50"
"of a foreign compound name has been used alone, as _Merle d'Aubigné_"
(index under _Merle_ with a cross-reference from _Aubigné_).
"In French, a forename is sometimes joined to a surname by a hyphen. In"
"such cases make the entry under the family name, with a cross-reference"
"from the forename: e.g., entry, _Rochette, Désiré Raoul_;"
"cross-reference, _Raoul-Rochette, Désiré_. See _Rochette_."
"(_c_) In foreign compound names of women also, although the first part"
"is usually the maiden name and the second the husband's name, the entry"
"should generally be under the first, with a cross-reference from the"
"second[51]: e.g., _Rivé-King_, with cross-reference from _King, born"
Rivé_.
Index surnames preceded by prefixes:
"(_a_) In French and Belgian, under the prefix when it is or contains"
"an article, _Le, La, L', Du, Des_; under the word following when the"
"prefix is a preposition, _de, d'_: e.g., _Des Essarts, Du Cange,"
"La Fontaine, Le Sage, L'Estoille_; but _Charlevoix, P. F. X. de_;"
"_Estrées, Mme d'_."
"_La_ and _Le_ are often, _Des_ is usually, and _Les_ is almost without"
"exception printed as one word with the name following, as _Lafontaine,"
"Lesage, Lesdiguières_; _de_ and _d'_ are sometimes so printed; when"
"they are, enter under the _D_: e.g., _Debucourt, Decamps, Delisle_; but"
"_Bucourt, A. de_, _Camps, C. de_, _Lisle, J. de_."
"(_b_) In English, under the prefix, no matter from what language the"
"name is derived, with cross-references when necessary: e.g., _De"
"Quincey_, _Van Buren_."
_Vice-Admiralty Prize Courts._
"[Sidenote: Enforcement of Orders of High Court, &c.]"
9. Every Vice-Admiralty Prize Court shall enforce within its
Jurisdiction all Orders and Decrees of the Judicial Committee in Prize
Appeals and of the High Court of Admiralty in Prize Causes.
[Sidenote: Salaries of Judges of Vice-Admiralty Prize Courts.]
10. Her Majesty in Council may grant to the Judge of any Vice-Admiralty
"Prize Court a Salary not exceeding Five Hundred Pounds a Year, payable"
"out of Money provided by Parliament, subject to such Regulations as seem"
meet.
A Judge to whom a Salary is so granted shall not be entitled to any
"further Emolument, arising from Fees or otherwise, in respect of Prize"
Business transacted in his Court.
"An Account of all such Fees shall be kept by the Registrar of the Court,"
and the Amount thereof shall be carried to and form Part of the
Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom.
"[Sidenote: Retiring Pensions of Judges, as in 22 & 23 Vict. c. 26.]"
"11. In accordance, as far as Circumstances admit, with the Principles"
"and Regulations laid down in the Superannuation Act, 1859, Her Majesty"
in Council may grant to the Judge of any Vice-Admiralty Prize Court an
"annual or other Allowance, to take effect on the Termination of his"
"Service, and to be payable out of Money provided by Parliament."
Index under the highest title:
"British and foreign noblemen, with cross-reference from earlier titles"
"by which they have been known, and, in the case of British noblemen,"
"from the family name: e.g., _Chesterfield, 4th Earl of (Philip"
"Dormer Stanhope)_. _Chesterfield, 5th Earl of (Philip Stanhope)_."
"Cross-reference from _Stanhope_. _Saint-Simon, Louis de Rouvroi, Duc"
de_.
Authors should be put under their names. The definition of a name is
"""that by which a person or thing is known."" Noblemen are known by their"
"titles, not by their family names."
In the few cases in which the family name[50] or a lower title is
"decidedly better known, index under that and cross-reference from"
"the title: e.g., _Francis Bacon, Baron Verulam_; _Robert Curzon,"
"14th Baron Zouche_; _John Napier, Baron of Merchiston_; _Horace"
"Walpole, 4th Earl of Oxford_; likewise the military nobles and"
"princes of the French Empire: e.g., _Lucien Bonaparte, Prince de"
"Canino_; _McMahon, Duc de Magenta_."
Englishwomen's titles-of-honor are to be treated by the following
rules. In the matter of titles an Englishwoman in marrying has
everything to gain and nothing to lose. If she marries above her
"own rank she takes her husband's title in exchange for her own,"
if below her own rank she keeps her own title.
(_a_) The wife of a peer takes her husband's style.
"That is, she is Baroness, Viscountess, Marchioness, etc. In indexing,"
"say _Brassey, Annie (Allnutt), Baroness_; not _Brassey, Annie"
"(Allnutt), Lady_."

waking life. It may be worth while to bring forward a few dreams which
incidentally illustrate the moral attitude of the dreamer.
A lady narrated the following dream immediately on awakening: 'I had
murdered a woman from some moral or political motive--I forget what--and
had come in great agony to my husband with her shoes and watch-chain. He
"promised to help me, and while I was wondering what could be done for"
"the benefit of the woman's family, some one came in and announced that a"
"lecture was about to be given on the beauty of nakedness. I then went,"
with several prim and respectable ladies of my acquaintance [the names
"were given], into a crowded hall. The lecturer who--so far as appearance"
"is concerned--was a well-known Member of Parliament, then entered and"
"gave a most eloquent address on Whitman, nakedness, ugly figures, etc."
He especially emphasised the fact that the reason people are shocked at
nakedness is that they usually only see unbeautiful bodies which repel
"them because they are unlike their ideals. Then he put out his hand, and"
"writing _France, Isle de_; _Man, Isle of_; _Wight, Isle of_:"
"e.g., _Cod, Cape_; _George, Lake_; _Washington, Mt._; _Moultrie,"
Fort_; but _Cape Breton Island_. When the name of a fort becomes
"the name of a city, of course the inversion must be abandoned, as"
_Fort Wayne_.
"Forenames are to be used in the form employed by their owners,"
"however unusual, as _Will Carleton, Sally (Pratt) McLean, Hans"
"Droysen, Fritz Reuter_."
Give names of places in the English form. (Cross-reference from
"the vernacular, if necessary): e.g., _Munich_ not _Muenchen_ or"
"_München_, _Vienna_ not _Wien_, _Austria_ not _Oesterreich_."
But if both the English and the foreign forms are used by English
"writers, prefer the foreign form: e.g., _Dauphiné_ rather than"
_Dauphiny_.
Use the modern name of a city and cross-reference to it from the
"ancient, provided its existence has been continuous and there is"
no doubt as to the identity.
Distinctive epithets are to be in the same language as the name:
"e.g.,"
"_Kniaz, fürst von, Freiherr zu, duc de Magenta, Bishop of Lincoln,"
"évêque de Meaux_; but _Emperor of Germany, King of France_, not"
"_kaiser_ and _roi_, when names of sovereign princes are given in"
English. Treat in the same way patronymics habitually joined with a
"person's name; as, _Clemens Alexandrinus_."
"Prefixes (i.e., titles which in speaking come before the name), as"
"_Hon., Mrs., Rev._, etc., should in the heading be placed before"
"the Christian name (as _Smith, Capt. John_), and suffixes as"
"_Jr., D.D., LL.D._, after it (as _Channing, James Ellery, D.D._)."
"Hereditary titles generally follow the Christian name, as _Derby,"
"Thomas Stanley, 1st earl of_; but British courtesy titles (i.e.,"
"those given to the younger sons of dukes and marquesses) precede,"
"as _Wellesley, Lord Charles (2d son of the Duke of Wellington)_. In"
"other languages than English, French, and German the title usually"
"precedes the forename; as, _Alfieri, Conte Vittorio_. Occasionally a"
"French nobleman uniformly places his title before his forenames; as,"
"_Gasparin, Comte Agénor de_."
_Lord_ should be replaced by the exact title in the names of English
"noblemen: e.g., Lord Macaulay should be entered as _Macaulay, 1st"
baron_. _Lord_ in the title of Scotch judges follows the family name;
"as, _Kames, H. Home, afterwards Lord_."
"The title Baronet is given in the form _Scott, Sir Walter, bart._"
"Patronymic phrases, as _of Dedham_, follow all the names; but they must"
immediately follow the family name when they are always used in close
"connection with it, as _Girault de St. Farjeau, Eusèbe_; similarly"
"_aîné_, _fils_, _jeune_, as _Dumas fils, Alexandre_; _Didot fils,"
Ambroise_. Latin appellatives should not in general be separated from
"their nouns by a comma; as, _Caesar Heisterbacensis_."
"The name of a king's wife should be written thus: _Charlotte, Queen,"
"consort of George III of England_. _Anne Boleyn Queen, 2d consort of"
Henry VIII of England._

8. Psalm Versions.
"The use of the psalms in singing, first on the Continent, then in"
"England and Scotland, and later in America, brought forth many metrical"
"versions of the psalter, the principal ones being the following:"
"a. _The Genevan Psalter_, begun 1539, published complete in 1562. It was"
"made at the request of John Calvin by Clément Marot, court poet of"
"France, and Theodore Beza, a French scholar. It became the psalm book"
"for the Reformation churches on the continent, and is spoken of as the"
most famous book of praise the Christian Church ever produced. It was
issued in at least one thousand editions and translated into a number of
"tongues. Some of the original tunes are still in use, e.g., “Old"
Hundredth.”
"b. _The Anglo-Genevan Psalter_, Geneva, 1556. This was used by John"
"Knox, the Scottish reformer, and his followers who fled the persecutions"
"of “Bloody Mary,” and formed a congregation at Geneva. The book"
incorporated some of the Sternhold and Hopkins versions which were in
"use in England, and added others."
"c. _The Old Version_, Sternhold and Hopkins, completed in 1562. Used in"
"England for 134 years. It is entitled, _The Whole Booke of Psalmes_, but"
"Spriggs's part, for as he was sailing off the west end of Cuba he again"
met the man-of-war which had so nearly caught him before in the bay.
"Spriggs clapped on all sail, but ran his ship on Rattan Island, where she"
"was burnt by the _Spence_, while Captain Spriggs and his crew escaped to"
the woods.
"SPRINGER, CAPTAIN."
He fought gallantly with Sawkins and Ringrose in the Battle of Perico off
"Panama on St. George's Day in 1680. He gave his name to Springer's Cay,"
one of the Samballoes Islands. This was the rendezvous chosen by the
"pirates, where Dampier and his party found the French pirate ship that"
rescued them after their famous trudge across the Isthmus of Darien.
"STANLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
With a few other buccaneers in their stronghold at New Providence Island
"in 1660, withstood an attack by a Spanish fleet for five days. The three"
"English captains, Stanley, Sir Thomas Whetstone, and Major Smith, were"
carried to Panama and there cast into a dungeon and bound in irons for
seventeen months.
"STEDMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"In 1666, with Captain Searle and a party of only eighty men, he took and"
"plundered the Dutch island of Tobago. Later on, after the outbreak of war"
"with France, he was captured by a French frigate off the Island of"
"Guadeloupe. Stedman had a small vessel and a crew of only 100 men, and"
"found himself becalmed and unable to escape, so he boldly boarded the"
zair in de field--zey plenty drunk dis morning--ve lose everysing--ve

"Besides the windows, the till and the shelves had been cleared, and"
empty drawers and boxes had been thrown on to the floor. We went down
into the cellar. All the cases had been opened and the stone floor was
littered with empty and broken bottles. The girl began to sob again when
she saw the ruin that had been inflicted:
"""All gone, all gone--ve poor now."""
"""Why don't you complain to the Town Major?"" one of us suggested."
"""Complain?--vat's de use complain?--de Town Major, he nice man, he kind"
"to us, but he no find de soldiers dat come, and if he find zem he punish"
zem but ve get nussing. Vat's de use punish zem if ve get nussing? All

"and ve all killed--ah, dis var, dis var! Vat's de use fighting? All for"

"We ascended the cellar stairs. The mother was in the main room, wiping"
"her eyes. We said good-bye to her and her daughter, feeling ashamed of"
"our uniforms, and walked out into the street."
A mass of French cavalry were galloping past. It was growing dark. The
cannonade had become deafening. Over the town a few miles off there was
a crimson glare in the sky.

"history of the Low Countries, some have a special and general scientific"
interest. Among these is the research of M. Alphonse Wauters on _Les
"libertés communales_ (Bruxelles, 1878). Barante's _Histoire des Ducs de"
Bourgogne_ (4th ed. 1838-40) contains much interesting matter on the
"Burgundian period. The assiduous research of M. Lefèvre Pontalis, _Jean"
"de Witt, Grand Pensionnaire de Hollande_ (2 tom. 1884; Eng. trans. 2"
"vols.), throws a full light on one of the most critical periods of Dutch"
history.
"Dutch works on the history of the Low Countries in general, and the"
"United Provinces in particular, are many and voluminous; indeed, no"
history has been more amply written. The good general history of the
"Netherlands by N.G. van Kampen, which appeared in German in the series"
"of Heeren and Uckert (1831-33), is only partially superseded by the"
"_Geschichte der Niederlande_ of Wenzelburger (Bd. i, 1879; ii, 1886),"
which is not completed. But the most readable general history of the
"Netherlands yet produced is that of P.J. Blok, _Geschiedenis van het"
"Nederlandsche Volk_ (1892, etc.), of which there is a competent but"
"unfortunately abridged English translation (Putnams, vol. i, 1898)."
"Standard modern Dutch works are those of J.A. Vijnne, _Geschiedenis van"
"het Vaderland_, and J. van Lennep, _De Geschiedenis van Nederland_. For"
Belgian history in particular the authorities are similarly numerous.
"The _Manuel de l'histoire de Belgique_, by J. David (Louvain, 1847),"
"will be found a good handbook of authorities, episodes, and chronology,"
though without any sociological element. The _Histoire de Belgique_ of
"Th. Juste (Bruxelles, 1895, 3 tom. 4to) is comprehensive, but disfigured"
by insupportable illustrations.
§ 1. _The Rise of the Netherlands_
The case of Holland is one of those which at first sight seem to flout
"[Footnote 151: Freud states (_Die Traumdeutung_, p. 233) that he knows a"
case in which (as in the _Song of Songs_) columns and pillars appear in
"dreams as symbols of the legs, and doors as symbols of the openings of the"
body.]
"[Footnote 152: Freud, _Die Traumdeutung_, p. 66. This work, published"
"in 1900, is the chief and most extensive statement of Freud's views. A"
shorter statement is embodied in a little volume of the 'Grenzfrägen'
"Series, _Ueber den Traum_, 1901. A brief exposition of Freud's position"
is given by Dr. A. Maeder of Zurich in 'Essai d'Interpretation de
"Quelques Rêves,' _Archives de Psychologie_, April 1907; as also by"
"Ernest Jones ('Freud's Theory of Dreams,' _Review of Neurology and"
"Psychiatry_, March 1910, and _American Journal of Psychology_, April"
"1910). For Freud's general psychological doctrine, see Brill's translation"
"of 'Freud's Selected Papers on Hysteria,' 1909. There have been many"
"serious criticisms of Freud's methods. As an example of such criticism,"
"accompanying an exposition of the methods, reference may be made to Max"
"Isserlin's 'Die Psychoanalytische Methode Freuds,' _Zeitschrift für die"
"Gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie_, Bd. 1. Heft i. 1910. A judicious"
and qualified criticism of Freud's psychotherapeutic methods is given by
"Löwenfeld ('Zum gegenwärtigen Stande der Psychotherapeutie,' _Münchener"

"almost epoch-making in character, in _Studies of the Psychology of Sex_,"

"[Footnote 154: This is supported by the fact that in waking reverie, or"
"day-dreams, wishes are obviously the motor force in building up visionary"
"structures. Freud attaches great importance to reverie, for he considers"
that it furnishes the key to the comprehension of dreams (_e.g._ _Sammlung

THE SAMPLE PAGE
"With these details settled, the sample page is next in order. Knowing"
that the book is to be a 12mo (size of leaf 5⅛ × 7⅝) or a 10mo (size
"of leaf 5½ × 8¼), the printer must ""lay out"" the page so as to leave"
margins of proper size and proportion. A 12mo type page may vary from
"3 × 5¼ inches to 4 × 6¾ inches. Somewhere within this area, in the"
"given example, the page must contain about 280 words. If the manuscript"
"is long, then the type page must be large, the type itself small (never"
"smaller than long primer[36] nor larger than pica[36]), the leads[36]"
reduced or omitted altogether. This is where the printer's taste and
skill is given an opportunity for expression: he is the architect
"of the book, and must not combine types or decorations which are"
"inharmonious, and his proportions must be kept correct."
"Two centuries later, the Brethren, known now as the Moravians, settled"
"on Count Zinzendorf’s estates in Saxony, spreading rapidly from thence"
into other countries in Europe and to the United States. One of
"England’s foremost hymn writers and hymnologists, James Montgomery, was"
an adherent to their faith.
Bohemian Brethren and Moravian Hymns in the Hymnary
"Michael Weisse, 1480-1534, “Christ, the Lord, is ris’n again” (544)"
"Tunes: “Mit Freuden Zart” (512), “Ravenshaw” (292)"
"von Zinzendorf, Nikolaus L., 1700-60, “Jesus, still lead on” (574)"
"von Zinzendorf, Christian R., 1724-62, “Man of sorrows” (537)"
"Henriette Luise von Hayn, 1724-82, “I am Jesus’ little lamb” (430)"
"James Montgomery, 1771-1854, “Hail to the Lord’s Anointed” (65)"
“Angels from the realms of glory” (81)
“Go to dark Gethsemane” (107) and many others
6. Hymns of the Reformation: the German Chorales.
"The movement toward congregational singing, inaugurated by the Bohemian"
"Brethren, was soon to be merged into the greater Reformation movement."
Luther’s influence on the worship and music of the church was
revolutionary. For a thousand years the laymen had had no part in church
song. Congregational singing was unknown. Ambrosian music had at first
been introduced for congregational use but it became more and more
"liturgical, thrusting the laity into the background. The Gregorian Chant"
which followed was never intended for use except by the priests and
trained choirs. The followers of Hus pioneered in congregational
singing; but it was Luther and his followers who brought it into full
fruition.
"Clement of Alexandria, 170-220, “Shepherd of tender youth” (398)"
"Candle Lighting Hymn, “O gladsome light” (34)"
"Synesius, c. 375-430, “Lord Jesus, think on me” (196)"
"St. Germanus, 634-734, “A great and mighty wonder” (526)"
"St. John of Damascus, 8th century, “The day of resurrection” (115)"
"“Come, ye faithful, raise the strain” (113)"
"St. Stephen the Sabaite, 725-94, “Art thou weary, heavy-laden” (143)"
"Candle Lighting Hymn, “Darkening night, the land doth” (32)"
4. Hymns of the Western Church: Latin.
Two great names are associated with the music of the Western Church:
"Ambrose, c. 340-97, known as the “Father of Hymnody in the Western"
"Church;” and Gregory the Great, 540-604, the missionary-minded pope, and"
reformer of church music.
"Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, not only composed hymns and music but"
stimulated others to do the same. Under his leadership there developed a
"large body of church music based upon four scales, which came to be"
"known as Ambrosian Chant. Although widely known as a scholar,"
"theologian, and preacher, Ambrose’s most lasting influence was upon the"
music of the church. None of his hymns are found in our collection.
"Gregory the Great, two centuries later, carried forward the work of"
"Ambrose. He added four more scales or modes to the Ambrosian system,"
thus giving to the repertory of church music more definiteness and
variety. The music that developed during the papacy of Gregory came to
"be known as Gregorian Chant, or plainsong, or plainchant. It is “plain”"
"because unadorned, unharmonized and unmeasured. Its rhythm is the free"
"rhythm of speech, the beats falling irregularly. The Gregorian Chant"
remained the music of the church for a thousand years and forms the

"any Order in Council or Royal Proclamation, or of any Breach of Her"
"Majesty's Instructions relating to Prize, or of any Act of Disobedience"
"to the Orders of the Lords of the Admiralty, or to the Command of a"
"Superior Officer, committed by the Captors in relation to any Ship or"
"Goods taken as Prize, or in relation to any Person on Board any such"
"Ship, may, on Condemnation, reserve the Prize to Her Majesty's Disposal,"
notwithstanding any Grant that may have been made by Her Majesty in
favour of Captors.

the Purchase for the Service of Her Majesty of the Stores on board the
Ship appears to the Lords of the Admiralty expedient without the
"Condemnation thereof in a Prize Court, in that Case the Lords of the"
"Admiralty may purchase, on the Account or for the Service of Her"
"Majesty, all or any of the Stores on board the Ship; and the"
Commissioners of Customs may permit the Stores purchased to be entered

contribution to Christian hymnody has not been only the Gospel Songs
"represented by the writings of Fanny Crosby, but the more permanent"
"works of Whittier, George W. Doane, Hosmer, Samuel Longfellow,"
"Washington Gladden, S. F. Smith, and many others. Our musical"
"contributions have been less conspicuous, but the tunes of Mason are"
coming into their own again and many of them will doubtless survive for
"a long time, as will also those of Bradbury, Hastings, and others."
The tendency today in American hymnbooks is to unite the best in English
and German traditions. The _Hymnary_ illustrates this trend. It makes
large use of the English hymns while at the same time preserving a
"considerable body of the German chorales. In keeping with this trend,"
"the recent hymnbooks of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist and other"
"churches of English origin, incorporate some of the German chorale tunes"
and in some cases the translations of the words. The hymn books of our
time have become the channels through which flow the rich contributions
to the stream of Christian hymnody from Christian people of all times
and places.

"the English expeditions of discovery fitted out by him (Schanz,"
"_Englische Handelspolitik_, i, 321), but private voyages were"
"successfully made by traders (_id._ pp. 321, 327)."
"In the seventeenth century, however, and until far on in the"
"eighteenth, all Dutch shipping was more economically managed than"
the English. In all likelihood the Dutch traders knew and improved
upon the systematic control of ship-construction which the
"Venetians and Genoese had first copied from the Byzantines, and in"
"turn developed. (Above, p. 197.) Raleigh was one of the first to"
point out that the broad Dutch boats carried more cargo with fewer
hands than those of any other nation (_Observations touching
"Trade_, in _Works_, ed. 1829, viii, 356). Later in the century"
Petty noted that the Dutch practised freight-economies and
"adaptations of every kind, having different sorts of vessels for"
different kinds of traffic (_Essays in Political Arithmetic_
"[1690], ed. 1699, pp. 179, 180, 182, 183). This again gave them the"
primacy in shipbuilding for the whole of Europe (_Mémoires de Jean
"De Witt_, ptie. i, ch. vi), though they imported all the materials"
"for the purpose. When Colbert began navy-building, his first care"
"was to bring in Dutch shipwrights (Dussieux, _Étude biographique"
"sur Colbert_, 1886, p. 101). Compare, as to the quick sailing of"
"the Dutch, Motley, _United Netherlands_, ed. 1867, iv, 556. In the"
next century the English marine had similar economic advantages
"over the French, which was burdened by royal schemes for"
"multiplying seamen (see Tucker, _Essay on Trade_, 4th ed. p. 37)."
"The frugality which pervaded the whole of Dutch life may, however,"
have had one directly disastrous effect. Sir William Temple noted

"746, _note_, as to possible exaggeration. Cp. Burke, ii, 113;"
"Hume's ed. ii, 84). In the early Lutheran period the spread of"
scholarly Protestantism in Spain was extremely rapid (La
"Rigaudière, _Histoire des persécutions religieuses en Espagne_,"
"1860, p. 245 sq.), and in the early years of Philip II it needed"
"furious persecution to crush it, thousands leaving the kingdom"
"(Prescott, _Philip II_, bk. ii, ch. iii; M'Crie, _Reformation in"
"Spain_, ch. viii; De Castro, _History of the Spanish Protestants_,"

in Seville alone in one day; and the Venetian ambassador in 1562
"testifies to the large number of Huguenots in Spain (Ranke, _Hist."
"of the Popes_, bk. v, Eng. tr. 1-vol. ed. p. 136)."
Had Philip II had Flemish sympathies and chosen to make Brussels
"his capital, the stress of the Inquisition could have fallen on the"
Netherlands as successfully as it actually did on Spain. His
"father's reign had proved as much. According to Motley, not only"
"multitudes of Anabaptists but ""thousands and tens of thousands of"
"virtuous and well-disposed men and women"" had then been ""butchered"
"in cold blood"" (_Rise_, p. 43), without any sign of rebellion on"
"the part of the provinces, whose leading men remained Catholic. In"
"1600 most of the inhabitants of Groningen were Catholics (Davies,"
"ii, 347). A Protestant historian (Grattan, p. 93) admits that the"
"Protestants ""never, and least of all in these days, formed the"
"mass."" Another has admitted, as regards those of Germany, that"
"""nothing had contributed more to the undisturbed progress of their"
"opinions than the interregnum after Maximilian's death, the long"

It's Mr. Travis.
"Looking for his girl, no doubt."
"That's the thing, George."
"He's quite purposefully walking the opposite direction, towards his campsite."
That's odd for sure.

"Come on, honey, we have to get going."
She doesn't remember any of it.
That's good.
-All done.
-Okay.
"Honey, this is Father Dyer."
"-Hi, Father."
-Hello.
"Ready, missus."
"-Goodbye, Father."
-Goodbye.
I'll call you.
Bye.
"-Bye, Father."
-I hope I see you again.
I hope so too.
Father Dyer?
I thought you'd like to keep this.
Why don't you keep it?
Lieutenant.
"Marin, Claire, Lisa..."
Come visit me in Korea.
Definitely.
Promise.
Promise!
Do you eat spicy food?
Yeah.
Really?
"Let me guess, was it your sister?"
My sister's a por...
It was my girlfriend.
The phone.
Front desk speaking.
What?
No hot water in the bath?
"I'm sorry, we'll send someone right away."
Excuse me?
"Oh, sure, we'll bring one."
Sorry about that.
Room 311 has no hot water in the bath.
Room 311?
"Hurry, go."
You go instead.
"It's your job to deal with customer complaints, no?"
"Please, go for me."
And you call yourself a man?
"Wait, take a condom."
The room was missing one.
No hot water?
Asshole.
"Ow, what the hell?"
Why aren't you angry?
Right.
"girls, this is your new coach."
Iwai.
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to the team!
Where do we start?
It's training time!
Training time!
Bon appetit!
Where's Iwai?
I don't know.
Me neither.
I see.
What's going on?
"You gave up ShaoIin Kung Fu, and for what?"
To cook Chinese food.
I didn't come back even when Grandpa died.
I trained hard.
Was it all in vain?
What's so great about ShaoIin Kung Fu?
What can you do?
I don't...
You can break logs?
You're strong.
It's just more violence.
Found it.
Good.
Who's there?
Rin.
What are you doing?
"You'II teach me Shaolin Kung Fu, right?"
But the Teacher said I shouldn't.
( chatter continues )
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.
Is your mom back?
Not yet.
Is that your own money?
No.
- Will your mom be OK with this?
"- Yes, I'm sure she will."
She always gives that much.
We don't want any trouble.
You realize that...
We usually don't accept money from children.
That's a lot of money.
"No, we're allowed."
"Well, it is a nice house."
Just look.
I guess they can afford it.

"As a thank-you for the donation, here's a Band-Aid."

Who was he?
I don't know.
"Something to eat, please?"
Food comes at a price.
I have no money.
Then you don't eat.
Give back some of them stolen pelts you buy from the Injuns.
"Not now, Jones."
Huh?
Silver.
How is this?
Silver.
This all you got?
We was nine.
"My friend, he die in the snow."
And the other was kill by wolf.
I see it.
"By wolf, yeah, kill."
Where'd you get this?
Can't deal with the old man.
You're useless.
My God!
The mirror!
I got it.
Watch out.
"- Look, the giant thing..."

Sick.
That sounds like...
The Studio 54 disco ball.
"God, I hate disco."
"Myka, you okay?"
- What's going on?
"- Myka, you okay?"
What's going on?
Ask him.
You can't...
This is...
Projet-SG (1.00)
I know you're feeling lost.
What?
"Artie's past, MacPherson..."
It can be a bit disorienting.
I know.
I feel pretty clear actually.
Things are the way they are.
Don't fight it.
Just go with it.
"Whenever I don't, I always end up right back in the same place."
Not a good one.
Thank you for the tea.
Find a way to stall that wedding!
Stall the wedding.
W-What am I?

"Eric, no!"
You're too late!
For what?
I was trying to help you get pumped up.
"- Okay, let's do it."
- It's too late.
"Meemaw, we're leaving right now, okay?"
"Okay, mister serious man."
Hit me.

"Can we get the cookies, please?"

"- It's cute, isn't it?"
"- Oh, it is."
"- Yeah, Reagan."
- I loved your daughters.
"- Oh, yeah."

"[Laughs] Yeah, I'm a very lucky man."
Especially with Darla with all her troubles over the years.
"Well, thank you."
And you're such a gentleman.
Thank you.
"Mind if we make your bed, sir?"
All right.

I'm starting to like the idea.
"And I feel sorry for you, Dean."
"You feel sorry for me, huh?"
Don't feel sorry for me.
You don't know anything about me.
I save lives.
I'm a hero.

He said you used to work the Wiki-Wiki Club on Hotel Street during the war.

Great club.
Lot of action.

Even to hear my music.
Times sure have changed.

Nice girl.
I remember when she died.
Lot of people cried.
She died?
That's right.
During the war.
The big one.

- You sure it was Diane Westmore?
What do you think?
I don't know.
What do you think?
"Oh, I think it sounds like fun."
"I know, but here's the thing."
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

Someone else got there first.
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-And you will learn....
-Excuse me.
I can't talk about it now.
"What do you mean, you can't talk about it now?"
"Four days already, you can't talk about it."
"Yeah, and you don't understand."
"I can't do it anymore, Frank."
You understand?
Why can't you do it anymore?
What does that mean?
You can't do it anymore?

I shot him first.
What was his name?
I can't.
What was his name?
Will.
I killed Will.
'Cause that's what happens to people when they get close to me.
They get hurt or they die.
I can't forgive myself.
Thank you for your candor.

Simon says.
Can I turn around now?
Why don't you just stay like that?
You don't know?
[raucous laughter]
"Robin, you're crazy!"
I like this girl.
Normal.
Everything's normal.
Ahh!
Is this the new futon?
"- Yes, it is, in fact."
"- Yeah, yeah."
We just bought it together.
It's my new favorite thing.
And... and you know it turns into a bed?
"So really, it's like two things."
A couch that turns into a bed?
"Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it."
"Yeah, right?"
"All right, watch this."
"Oh, oh, oh, okay."
- Okay.
"- All right, ready?"
- All right.
- Okay?
- On three.
- Yep.
- One...
- One... both:
"Two, three!"
[all cheering]
- Very nice!

Jimmy...
Your father and I need to talk to you.
"Come on, Jimmy."
Hey.
Jimmy.
"Hey, partner."
How you doing?
Hey.
"Hey, Dad."
Jimmy.
Hmm?
I had a good game -- 13 strikeouts.
Did you win?
I just found out there's a chance we may be restationed again.
-
- How much of a chance?
-
- It's in West Texas.
The Navy wants me to be a recruiter there.
Texas?
When?
Three weeks.
"But, Dad..."
We still got half our season to play.
I'm aware of that.
"Well, maybe I could stay with the Johnsons."
Unh-unh.
We move as a family.
I don't have a choice in this.
What kind of baseball do they have?
They don't.
I hear they might be starting some summer ball.
All right.
- Ok.
- All right.
Lay her down gently now.
- Real easy.
Yeah.
- Let her down gently.
There you go.
- That's a girl.
- Yes.
- That's right.
- There we go.
- There.
- There we are.
"Now, how do you feel, Sally?"
(CHATTERING)
"Oh, we just wanna take your helmet off so you'll be more comfortable."
All right.
"All right, Sally."
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
"Sergeant, start the tape recorder."
Wanna get a complete record of this.
"Yes, sir."
"Now, Sally, I want you to breathe in and out."
(CAMERA CLICKS)
(VEHICLE APPROACHES)
"- Sergeant, stop that car."
"- Yes, sir."
- Hi.
- Shh!
"Now, is fine."
Was that one of our aircraft?
"Yes, it just flew over."
Has it crashed?
-The crew taken prisoner.
"Okay, we'll go right away."
Let's go men.
Thank you.
Catherine.
"Say 'good day', my love."
Bon jour.
Are you all Americans?
Good.
"Well, welcome and I will prepare something to eat."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Thank you, Catherine."
Hello.
Bread...

"Oh, Sophie!"
A woman so beautiful ...
You're a beautiful woman.
"Come on, there's nothing here."
I'm going down this road!

"Great idea, Doc."
Now the road will never get done.
Luigi?
"On your mark, get set..."
"Uno for the money, due for the show, tre to get ready, and quattro to..."
I can't believe it.
Go!
Huh?
Doc... the flag means go.
Remember the fl...
Here we go.
Go.
"Doc, what are you doing, man?"
"Oh, dear."
It would seem I'm off to a poor start.
"Well, better late than never."
"Come on, Mater."
I might change the title.
You should totally record it.
"No, it's not there yet."
Still needs some tweaks.
Not from what I've just heard.
Let's do it.
Olivia does all the recording.
I don't know how to work the equipment.
It's easy.
"All you do is press ""Record,"""
this button right here.
I guess.
It'll be fun.
We need to capture the moment.
The world needs to hear Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Exactly.
Okay.

Oh.
Out of sight.
Really?
Let's play it back.

"No, no!"
"Mom, this is for Casey's own good!"
Casey?
"Take my hand, Casey, I'm right here."
Here they come!
"Rule number two, no blood suckers on my boat!"
Damn it.
Out of ammo!
Damn!
(LAUGHING)
We heard you were on your way.

You won't set foot on Philippine soil.
Hold it!
Damn!

"Your friends can't help you now, half-breed."
Now die!

You were great.
(NOAH YELLING)
(SCREAMS)
She's got to be French.
I'm parked on Kattegat Road.
A red Ferrari.
- You called for some company?
- You're Chinese.
"- I'm French, honey."
- Say something in French.
- Je t'aime.
- Fucking tart.
That was school French.
You're not from France.
Do you want company or not?
"300, cash in advance."
- What's that?
- 1500.
Say your name is Michelle and say you love me in French.
- And then I'll break your arm.
- Like hell you will.
- 3000.
"- No, I said."
4500.
That's more than you make in a week.
- You're sick.
- I own you.
I'II do anything I want.
Fucking cow.
"I'll get you, bitch."
Hey!
- Let me go.
- I'm going to kill you.
Michelle...
Michelle...
Where is it?
Let go of me!
"Let go of me, bastard!"
"If you dare to touch me, Xiaotian will kill you."
I always get all what I want.
No!
Please don't.
I beg you.
No!
Yawang!

What happened to you?
Yawang!

Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

I don't like this.
You can have it.
Hey!

Stop screaming.
He didn't pay!
Forget it!
Prepare for the lion dance contest!
"Yes, Master."
"""Henan Club"""
Fire!
Ladies and gentlemen.
"To celebrate the opening of the club, we've invited Huang Fei-hung to perform a lion dance with his students."
Great!
"Master, is this an easy one?"
No!
You'll hurt yourself if not careful.
What does it call?
The Gold and Silver Rosette!
You'll have to cross the bridge first.
"- Let's go, Ah Foon!"
- Yes!
Roll the drum!
Go!
Hurry!
Come on!
Hold on!
Jump!
What's wrong with you?
Shut up!
The Bridge!
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
"My name... is Indrid Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
It's a Iittle...
Have a look.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
Yes?
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?
"I know I sounded crazy the other day, but things are getting weird out here."
"Slow down, Gordon."
- He's here.
- Who's here?
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.
"Gordon, let me talk to him."
Sure.
Hang on.
Water's fine.
[Sink runs]
[Rustling]
AUDREY:
"If you're hungry, I could make you a sandwich."
Give me something to do.
Maybe you haven't eaten.
OTIS:
No thanks.
I had something.
I do appreciate it.
[Greta growling]
"Oh boy, this is a real sick headache."
Better wait a while.
It's still bubbling a lot.
OTIS:
"Well, I like it best."
[Gasps]
[Gagging]
"My god, what's wrong?"
[Audrey screaming]
What happened?
What's wrong with him?
AUDREY:
The do...
"Damn it, I want to know what happened here."
"Now, what's wrong with her?"
[Audrey sobbing]
You get on the phone.
Call an ambulance now!
Do it!
[Growling]
It smells good.
I'll just go get the clothes.
That machine's thunking again.
Paulie!
"How are you, Frank?"
"-l'm good, considering."
"-Yeah, of course."
Of course.
Coffee?
Nettie's down with the laundry.
Stay for lunch?
Osso buco.
Osso buco.
Nettie fixes it piemontese.
Peppers and everything.
"No, that's all right. I had my lunch."
-Can I get coffee?
"-No, thanks."
So.
What do you think?
"Well, same old thing."
This time it's this Calhoun guy.
I never liked him.
-He's a cracker.
-Of the worst kind.
He's out of here tomorrow.
"No, I don't think so."
What are you talking about?
He's a reed.
You push him and he bends.
Not this one.
This one's a terrier.
"Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase."
"Me, you, dinner."
Pi-cha-kow!
- What the...?
Ow!
Oh!
- Ka-chow!
- Please!
- I know.
I get that reaction a lot.
I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand.
Agh!
Ow!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Did I scare you?
"A little bit, but I'll be all right."
OK.
I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
"Do what you gotta do, baby."
But listen.
Be careful.
"Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean."
Ka-ching!
Ah!
I'll keep that in mind.
"- Hey there, Mater."
"- Howdy, Sally."
"- Hi, folks!"
- Good morning!
You know her?
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.
What?
I think I'll stay here for a while.
It's peaceful.
Go home.
It was good to meet you.
Thank you.
"Don't look back, Tony."
"Hey, Tone."
Where are Sid and Michelle?
No idea.
"You're a terrible liar, Jal."
Anybody can see you've got something going on.
- Shit!
- Christ!
What the fuck?
!
Tony!
- What the fuck are you...?
- Shut up!
"- Sid, are you gonna let him?"
"- Tony, I'm objecting to..."
You're always fucking objecting!
Can't you do something?
OK.
"OK, Jesus."
"Tony, what?"
"Are you trying to scare me, because it's not working?"
I love you.
I'm saying it again.
OK?
And you.
"I love you too, you little fucker."
This is wrong.
Is it like I feel with you and Mom?
Is there anyone in particular?
No.
"Well, if there ever is, you just let me know."
I'm always here for you.
"- Okay, Dad."
- Okay.
"- Good night, Mikey."
"- Good night, Dad."
"- I love you, boy."
"- Love you, too."
Oooh!
Tomorrow I'll tell you a bedtime story.
- Okay.

( Glass Shattering )
What the hell?
"Hey, come out here!"
Come on!
"David, forget it."
I'm gonna kick some ass!
( Cat Screeching )
"David, leave Rosie alone!"
She scared the hell out of me.
She's just a cat.
"David, come inside."
So who's out here?
"Huh, Jess?"
Don't start that again.
Wait!
You're not gonna answer me?
I don't know!
There it is!
"It'll soon be a steak, poor ostrich."
Let's scare it off.
-With what?
With these.
Here it comes...
We'll make you run for your feathers.
Senna.
The firefighters said that a cigar started the fire.
I don't buy it.
It was an accident.
Let me make you feel better.
Think.
-No.
"Please, think."
All grown-ups suck.
-Right.
Let me at least hold you.
"I'm hurting, Jemina."
Jemina speaking.
-What are you doing there?
Taking care of this fool.
-Good.
I want to talk to him.
-He's sleeping.
Taisto is in the hospital.
He's about to die.
It's high time to come see him.
I'll come right away.
"-Not you, honey."
"Calm down, Mom."
I've got an idea.
- Oh!
- [Laughing]
- Albert!
- [Claire] Forget it!
Forget it!
- Why?
I need a bigger man.
- Bigger?
- Yeah.
- What do you -
- He's -
- Bigger in what way?
- He's too short for me.
- I need a tall man.
- He's too -
He's too...
He's too short?
When do we take off all our clothes?
"Ah, Helen."
Helen!
[Claire] I don't care what you say.
"Lfhe's good-looking, I don't give him to anybody."
So you mean we don't have a chance around you.
Is that what we're saying?
"- Oh, no."
I don't say that at all.
- Oh.
I take him fast and whisk him away.
- l...
I don't give any other woman a chance.
- I've noticed that.
"You know what, Helen?"
I know.
"- Well, we got 'em."
- Yeap.
- Yours look awesome on you.
"- Yea, so did yours."
"Hey, I know we never really talked about stuff... since that day."
Are we cool?
Yea.
Course.
Precious.
"Hey, you hungry or anything?"
Not really.
I'm just gonna take a walk.
"Yea, screw food."
I could use a nap if you wanna know the truth.
You want me take your bag home?
No?
This better not be Russ.
It's my Dad.
Really?
"I've tried to get the pizza place, but I..."
I pressed his number instead.
Long story.
"Hang on a sec, Phil."
See you Daze!
Hey Dad.
April?
"Are you... uhm, April?"
Hi.
Hi.
I was a friend of your father's.
I just want to let you know that...

"Bring Chang Seventh in, dead or alive!"
Right!
"Hello, Brother Chin!"
You have some more orders?
Get Chang Seventh out there!
Your timing's bad-he's on the mountain!
Search the place!
"What're you doing, Brother Chin?"
He really isn't here!
"Mr. Wang, Master wants to build a house here"

"Come on, don't be afraid."
Hit it.
Harder.
"Huang Fei-hung, you dare to hit me?"
You want to use weapon?
Marshal?
What to do?
Have a rest.
I'll get someone for you.
"""Fu Xing Lou"""
"Master, this is Mousy I told you about."
Where's he?
Come out!
Speak to Master!
Say it.
I want you to be my student.
No...
I want to be your master.
He said he wanted to be your student.
He wants you to be his master.
I'm your admirer!
No!
This is hopeless!
What are you trying to do?
Kill my son?
Ignore him!
Let's go!
Well...
Mousy!
Come over here!
"Master Huang, I'm innocent!"
Have you learnt kung fu before?
BISSEL:
I'll get it.
"-Your uniform, Sergeant."
-Take it back.
It's a sloppy job.
Do it over again.
Sloppy?
Look at the way those stripes shine.
"Well, press them some more."
"-You're all right, kid."
-Thank you.
-What was your number again?
-82.
-I'm writing it down real big.

-Change for what?
-Get dressed for dinner.
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"What are we going to wear,"

Doesn't matter.
I brought both.

-Both?
"Boys, we're traveling in fast company again."
"-Yeah, too fast for a hillbilly like me."

He just prefers the violin.

My presidential suite.
I'll take the roof.
-Which one?
-This house in the Valley on Greenleaf.
Right there.
Okay.
Were you in the studio for a long time?
"-No, not long."
-Just taking a break?
Yeah.
-Did you get much work done?
-Yeah.
I think they're pretty close to finishing.
"No, on your dissertation."
Oh.
"Yeah, it's going really well."
-Did you enjoy yourself?
-Where?
In the studio.
"Yeah, I did, actually."
-It was stimulating.
-Good.
Jesus.
I don't know how you two stand getting up so early.
That totally burned me out.
-Hello.
-Hi.
You're right on time.
"Oh, he's very friendly."
He's a pussycat.
You see that?
He likes you already.
Come on in.
I'll show you the house.
You think a doctor's gonna make me healthy?
I'm healthy when I'm livin' my life.
- Yeah.
- Right?
"Hey, Esther, do that little dance you do."
- Come on.
"- Hey, you should..."
- You should have seen her.
"- No, no."
"- Yeah, do it."
- She was really something.
- Esther.
"- Get up there, Esther."
"- Get up there, Esther."
- I can't.
"Come on, Esther, do it."
I can't walk.
How am I gonna dance?
- Get outta here.
- Okay.
Do the dance.
All right?
Then we gotta do.
"- Get up there, Esther."
"- For you, kid, anything."
- Get up.
- Oh boy.
[Laughing]
"And a five, six, seven, eight."
- [Cracking]
- Whoa!
[Police radio chatter]
- Turn it on!
"- Oh, my god!"
And the first number is... 25.
My mother's birthday.
The next number... 52!
52... cards in a deck.
The next number is... 7.
The seven dwarves.
Seven dwarves.
32.
32 teeth.
"And... 10, my boss'absolute favorite number."
Crap.
Apparently not everybody's favorite.
And the final number is 17.
My daughter's age.
"Hi, Julie!"
"Once again, the gold rush numbers are 25, 52,"
"7, 32, 10, and 17, so that's it for now."
Keep playing Lotto.
You'll thank me later.
You'll thank me later.
That's my line.
I say that.
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
"You know, I might as well flush 20 bucks down the toilet once a week."
God!
I was terrible.
Wasn't I terrible?
- Yes.
- You were great.
"God, I don't know what happened."
This fellow...
"Hello, Sir."
- Where are you?
"I am chasing an accused in high speed, Sir!"
I'll talk later.
I can't even catch such a slow-runner!
I...
Varun!
Idiot!
Will you keep breaking rules just because you are a cop?
You are always interfering a responsible cop on duty!
Get lost!
Leave me!
I said leave me!
Why are you after me?
What do you want?
"Sir, leave me!"
"Leave me, Sir!"
What wrong did I do?
Sir...
- Got it?
Sir!
There's nothing in it.
Please give it.
Stay quiet.
Unlock it.
- Leave me!
Give me the phone!
- Hey...
Unlock it!
Sir!
- Stay quiet!
"Goodbye, but I hope we don't meet again."
But that's the other one!
- It's not him.
And then?
- What about the bail?
"Counselor, it's not fair!"
- This is a mistake!
"One moment, stop!"
You arrest me again?
"- Come on, come on!"
Why did I have to..

I'm not a guppy. [grunts]
This is great.
"I mean, I really love this."
"Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around every corner... [screams] Ariel!"
"[Grunts] Oh, are you OK?"
"Yeah, sure."
No problem.
I'm OK.
Shh!
"Oh, my gosh."
"Oh, my gosh!"
Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Wow!
Cool!
"But, uh, what is it?"
"I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will."
Because this sleeping in all day till you go to work at night is not gonna fly on my day off.

Honey?
What?
You okay?
I'm...
Yeah.

Peed all over the floor.

MAC:
Heh-heh.
Harry. listen to this.
I have a chance to get in on the ground floor of a condo conversion.
"If I play my cards right. my 2000 could turn into $20,000 by Christmas."
I'm only $400 short of my goal.
I'll take anything. a buck. spare change.

-That's the spirit.
Okay. fine.
-What rhymes with perpendicular?
-Why?
No. that's not it.

"Come on, get the meatball."
"God, what have I done to you?"
"I broke the dog, Pheebs!"
I broke the dog!
Thanks.
I'm going to pick up Mona.
What are you doing tonight?
"Oh, I got big Valentine's plans."
"I got my Chinese food on the way, and your saltwater taffy."
"Interestingly, it isn't made with seawater.."
We actually watched the documentary together.
"Oh, my Chinese food."
I'll get my cash.

Step aboard.
Now.
[BOTH GRUNTING]
Appreciate the help .
You handled it.
"Besides, we're here to investigate."
"Poetic justice, remember?"
-There was something in the....
-Elevators should be locked down.
This is wrong.
Thought so.
This is a high-speed express elevator.
It doesn't belong in a two-story building.
Neither does what I saw.
[GRUNTING]
And that's why they need an express elevator.
I'm at the end of my rope.
Bypassing security.
There.
Go.
[GRUNTING]
ROBIN:
Welcome to Project Cadmus.

A.S.U. Arizona State fans?
"Oh, no, man."
U.S.A!
Of course.
"If you're here to see the U.S. Snowboarding team, they don't arrive until tomorrow."
But you gotta have your shirts on inside the casino.
Those are the rules.
Okay.
What a babe.
I love Vegas!
[Whistles]
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Hot date?
"Yeah, you could say that."
"Well, who's the lucky fella?"
James Harpel.
One of the whales from J.W. McKeller's black book.
I've been trying to get him as a client for years.
You are so dead!
-my Apologies.
Excuse?
It certainly helps.
Still hurts here!
You could have broken my nose.
"Relax, he has apologized."
"He fought for you, Henning."
"Mia talked shit about you, then Phillip slapped her."
Heroic.
You are so ...
She said that ...
-Not care.
-Henning ...
-No Understand anything?
Stay away from me.
I brought clothes for you.
It may then be exchanged.
You left me locked.
And I have a choice?
Tell the Dad what happened before you came here.
And why are you dressed like that.
Zana?
The beginning.
A friend and I ...
-Zana ...
Listen to me.
We came out and we were ambushed.
Not at all!
Liar!
-it's True!
-You Have no shame?
- Oh!

"Time to go, time to go."
- Okay.
Horace:
Let's go.
"- Okay, I'm going."
- Let's go.
"- Hey, wait, wait, wait."
Where's my twenty?
- Look under Pete's watch.
- Holy shit.
- All right.
That's enough.
- Fucking scumbag!
What the-- Horace:
That's enough of your shit.
"Let's go, goodbye."
"- What the fuck was that, huh?"
- Yeah.
Mary Ann: (quietly) Iâm just gonna go.
- Where are you going?
- I'm-
"- See my sister, I told you."
- Why are you going there?
- Iâm just gonna go to my sister's house.
I can go where I want.
"- No, you're not."
"- I don't need your permission, Horace."
"- No, you're not."
- You have no right to keep me here like a fucking prisoner.
"Just let me go, please."
- Talkative.
- Mm-hmm.
- Rambling.
Is that a problem?
People sometimes talk more when they're afraid.
Helps compensate for the fear.
"- Masks it, too."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Similar to when you've got the TV on late at night.
The voices make you feel less alone.
Even though you are alone.
"You aren't scaring me, Katie."
Pity.
Is there like a refrigerator here?
There's some snacks in the cupboard.
Alrighty.
"Eenie meenie, miney..."
Mo!
Alright.
"Okay, ginger snaps."
Let's see.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
This'll do.
Now... um...
"He's gonna be right behind this door when I close it, isn't he?"
"Yeah, that's how this works."

"What does that mean, ""Dad's back""?"
It means I saw him.
We talked.
You saw him here?
In Lakewood?
Yeah.
"We're, uh... having breakfast."
Wow.
Did he... what did he say?
Not much.
"You know, that he's sorry."
That...
That he wants to be here for me now.
"Oh, honey..."
"I know you love your dad, and he loved us, he did, but he had his own difficulties."
No!
"Uh, maybe..."
"uh, ye... no, ye... ahh...!"
Mm.
I like this one.
Ugh!
"You think you do, but you don't."
What do I think of this wine?
Great question.
Here's what you think.
"Hey, Ethan."
How's Rudy?
How's Beanbag?
"Uh, they're great."
Beanbag's great.
Rudy's such a delight.
I just dropped off some juice for them.
Can I get a cranberry juice?
Uh-oh...
Coming right up.
"Um, who's Rudy?"
- He's my son.
- You have a son?
"Mandy, you know, I might have left a little information off my E-Kiss profile, but that was just for readability."
"So, you look nothing like your profile picture and you have a son?"
Uh-huh.
Okay.
"So, your face is saying one thing..."
No.
No.
I love kids.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
"Hey, bring back some beers."
Okay.
Hello.
Hello?
Hello?
You're Ben's friend; right?
"You shouldn't be out here, kid."
"You shouldn't be out here, either."
Yeah?
Why not?
Who is that?
( Video Playing Through Telephone )
Is this a joke?
- You killed Rosie.
- That was an accident; okay?
Life is full of accidents.
What are you talking about?
- The radio.
It's not safe.
- Why not?
'Cause you could die.
"David, you wouldn't..."
David.
David!
"David, I am in no mood for this kind of joke!"
David.
David.
"David, if you don't come out right now,"
"I'm going inside, and I'm locking all the doors, and I'm never speaking to you again!"
David!
David!
That's so not you.
Why'd you do it?
Because you didn't say goodbye.
"Goodbye, Rory."
"Bye, Jess."
- Great.
I'm Woody Allen in Annie Hall.

Smart.
The mirror.
Yeah.
I never leave home without all the essentials:

I looked better.
I had to run here straight from work.

- Sure.
We're breaking up'cause we're transferring to different schools.
He's going to Florida State.

"Next, there was the bag of recipe taxi company."
A knife would have fallen too.
His weapon was not found.
It's hot chestnuts...
Mr. Mogi!
We are informed that a gunman retreated to a residence.
Dirt!
It is impossible that it could kill...

They've got no right dropping bombs!

You talk to Carlo.

Um... who... hurt... this man?
Perhaps using her own experience of pain may help to convey the question you're trying to ask.
Fen.
Hurt.

Hurt.
Hurt.
Pff!
Pfff!
Hurt?
Hurt.
(Fen moaning loudly)
"Yes, hurt."
Fen... this man.
Who hurt... this man?
Pa!
Pa!
That's the same gesture and sound she made
- when she saw you with Roland!
- Is she saying father?
- She could be.
- Paaaaa!
Ah!
I think she's trying to tell us who hurt Mr. de Jaager.
- (Fen):
Pa!
- You were feeding Roland when she became so animated.
Perhaps she's referring to the man who feeds her?
"Her keeper, Mick Travis."
Is she trying to tell us he is the killer?
(Fen grunts once.)
(Fen grunting)
"Oh, but this is very important."
"I'm sure it is, and I want to hear all about it."
"Well, I'd like to start from the beginning."
After breakfast.
But this is very important!
"Now, what would you like?"
"How about some oatmeal and a nice big glass of milk, huh?"
That'll build up your strength.

One of my patients put a marble in his nose?
Not exactly.

- You want to know if there was tongue.
"I can tell you, decidedly there was not."
"- No, Jake."
Figgis is here.
"- Okay, well, good talk."
Don't die.
Holt had very soft lips.
Wish I hadn't said that one either.
We should get into positions.
"- Yeah, okay."
"- Hey, kill the lights!"
Figgis is here!
"- Excuse me, ma'am, this dolly's being used."
- Broccoli che visto?

Let's do this.
- And how am I supposed to get all the way up there?
- Gracefully.
- Boost my bottom!
- I'm boosting!
- Boost my bottom!
- For who?
"- For, like, it's an app."
You can kind of...
"like, I've used it all over when funds were low, so..."
"- Oh, there's some interesting ones."
- Pretty cool.
"- ""Thrillseekers wanted."""
- Ooh.
- This looks right up your street.
- Okay.
"Okay, four pound signs."
That's a biggie.
That's good.
It's a little out of town.
And some kind of play test deal for a company called Saitoo...
Saitogoo...
- SaitoGemu?
- SaitoGemu.
Yeah.
They're huge.
- They're really big.
- Really?
- Horror games?

"Well, that's Shou Saito."
It's his company.
Illingworth.
"Ah, yes."
I see.
And then up there.
"Yep, yep."
And that leaves...
May.
"May, that sounds plausible."
And that gives...
Stewart.
Yes.
Alec Stewart.
You've got it.
You were on fire!
"Marianne, are you the big cricket fan?"
Yeah.
"Cos they were, ""Come on, Marianne - say some names!"""
"You were coming out with them, one after the other."
Very well done for a full ten points.
You certainly know your cricket.
Let's go through the names as you put them in.
"First of all you put in Cowdrey, Colin Cowdrey."
And you spotted you hadn't got that quite in the right order.
"Brearley, Mike Brearley, captain during Botham's famous Headingley Ashes."
"Hussain, Nasser Hussain."
"Pietersen, Kevin Pietersen."
"Illingworth, Ray Illingworth."
"May, Peter May."
"And finally Stewart, Alec Stewart."
And you didn't fall for any of our red herrings -
"Botham, Gower, Strauss, Willis."
Didn't go for any of those.
"Hello, this is..."
"Hello, I'm Gregory Larkin."
Professor Gregory Larkin.
Answer the phone.
I'm sleeping.
- Hello.

Who's this?
- This is Gregory Larkin.
I'm a professor in the math department at Columbia.
I was just calling to see
- how you are tonight.
- I'm fine.
How you are?
Fine.
"I hope it wasn't presumptuous of me, but I sat down in one of your classes."
And I was very impressed.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
Hold on.
- Wait.
Could you talk louder please?
- I sat in on your class.
- Hold on.
Don't go away.
- I was impressed with your teaching.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
I can do this!

I think she collects them.
"National ink, the mother's milk of politics."

It hurts!
It`s stuck.
Cut it out!
"I know what you`re trying to do, and I think it`s sick!"
The wheeI`s stuck!
That was a dirty trick!
The damn wheel is all screwed up.
You`re tired.

Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me on his own accord
Gave it to you?
"It's true, you don't believe me?"
Grab him
"Hey, don't move!"
You really want to fight?
"Kid, you do know some kung fu!"

"Master, I...they..."
What exactly has happened?
"Master, these three assholes"
"I told them I'm your apprentice, they ignored me"
It's the box step.
LAUGHTER
And the third one is my own personal favourite - the knee bounce.

Oh...
Familiar Loneliness.
You really are showing off!
"Now, now..."
What kind of book is it?
Sevigne de...
You have to read it the other way!
"Oh, yeah!"
Um...
The Letters od The Marquis de Sevigne!
"It really seems like an old book, Shizuru!"
Yeah.
"Shizuru, did you always read that type of book?"
"Oh yeah, Shizuru!"
"You went to the library with Saho-san, didn't you?"
Eh?
"You're still meeting up with Saho-san, Shizuru?"
!
You are the one that introduced them!
Yeah!
"That's true, but just listening to Saho-san makes me tired!"
It's so hard that I just can't keep up.
"You are too good, Shizuru."

You called her your teacher!
That was then!
I just want her to calm down a little!

"Oh, hey."
You're home.

"Well, I was, and then I thought that sounded like a good errand for you."

"Ok, honey, I told you before."
"If it's empty by the time you get home, leave the cup in the car."
Don't come in here showboatin' with it.
Sorry.
So did you get me anything?
"Um, as a matter of fact, yes, I did."
Ah!
Oh!
Look at this.
"Hi, shirt."
You get to be draped across my nipples.
Congrats!
"Ok, well, you two get acquainted."
I'm gonna go put this stuff away.
"Hey, dad."
In one moment.
I'm just dealing with this gentleman.
"- Yes, Mr. Thurston..."
- What?
- I was wondering...
- I need change for this!
In a moment.
I'm dealing with this gentleman.
But I have a taxi driver waiting.
Surely this gentleman wouldn't mind if you just gave me change.
- Do you?
"- No, no."
Go ahead.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Can you tell me how to get to Glendower Street?
"Now, I've booked a room and bath with a sea view for three nights."
- Glendower Street?
- Yes.
You haven't finished with me.
Missus...?
Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Alice Richards.
"Mrs. Richards, Mr. Thurston."
"Mr. Thurston, Mrs. Richards."
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending to at the moment.
What?
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending...
Don't shout.
I'm not deaf.
"Mr. Thurston was here before you, Mrs. Richards."
But you were serving me!
And are still talking.
"We're still here for you, brother."
-Go ahead.
-All right.
It starts with a loss ...
"No, no, no."
Sorry for the moment passed.
"I forgot what I was going to say, maybe tomorrow."
"No, I'm sorry!"
"Is not flowing, the show is over!"
"-Please, sir."
What?
Their story is about flight?
-Where are you?
-From the land of the emperors.
And what's your name?
Erik.
In Insvelândia had many brave warriors
Erik called.
-Seriously.
"Yes, of course."
Everyone!
"Your attention, please."
"I dedicate my comforting much celebrated saga to my brave friend, Erik."

"He is a rich merchant, and is the council member."
He owns many properties in Western District.

"Yes, Sai."
"Hearing this word ""Sai"", I..."
Did it ring your bell?

"- Excuse me, sir?"
- Every time I come across...
- Sir?
- It was off...
Gotta call you back.
"Hey, bro."
Where did you get the uniform?
Traded for it.
Not really my style.
But the guy threw in a phone too.
"- Pretty sweet deal, huh?"
- We're gonna need that phone.
"So, what are you gonna trade for it?"
How about a pair of handcuffs?
"Yes, thank you very much."
Okay.
So Dana Thorpe and her fiancé Craig Ellers landed at Honolulu International this morning.
Checked into a hotel ten minutes ago.
- Chin.
"- Hey, H.P.D. found the car."
Dawkins abandoned it about 15 minutes ago.
"- Parking lot, Kaka'ako Beach Park."
- Got it.
That's three blocks away from where Craig and Dana are staying.
- Whoa.
- Ha-ha-ha.
"Oh, my God."
I couldn't stand it.
"Oh, my God."
Me neither.
Look who's here?
I'm Rick.
"I love Italian wines, German cars and Japanese women."
I'm Linda!
I love showers and mornings and bologna and turtles.
And wine!
I'm Bob.
"Well, it looks like we are going to be a tasting trio for the afternoon."
Jambo.
It means cheers.

"Come on, Bob."
"If we don't clink, it's not a real Jambo."
Mm-hmm.

"Uh, okay."
- Jambo...!

No more Jambo.
"Usually I'm by myself, but since you guys are here, maybe we could take turns sitting on Beanbag."

"Rudy, how can you just sit there, when there's a chocolate fountain behind this door being unappreciated by a bunch of drunk adults?"

You always gotten grades like this?
Yes sir.
"We need more kids in our school like you, Brian."
All the schools need more kids like you.
"You're on a valedictorian path, M r."

All your teachers give you an unqualified thumbs-up.
So.
What happened yesterday?

Right. I was leaving the bathroom and I heard a shot--
And you were in the bathroom because?
Because?
I had to go to the bathroom--
Which one?
Da Ran...
It's me.
Yoon Jae...
I...
"I was so very, very worried!"
I felt like this all happened because I got angry and threw a fit...
I was so very worried because I thought it was all my fault!
Because I...
Because I needlessly said those words...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
The words I was going to say to you...
I'll say them now.
Ppuing-ppuing.

Does this...
All seem like a child's joke to you right now?
Is it fun?
Why is an adult crying at a child's joke?
Being fooled by a kid like you...
I'm the one at fault.
Is it my fault that we didn't switch back?
Why is she getting mad at me?
Where are my belongings?

"Um, I'm sorry again, Abby, about missing your Halloween party."
"Oh, that's okay-- I'm sure you had some... super big, top secret emergency NSA meeting that you couldn't miss."
"Uh, we were being audited, actually."
"But yes-- once again, my job forced a last-minute change of plans."
But not tonight.

"We are spending the holiday in Turks and Caicos with Jake's family, no matter what."
"You better get going, then."

"Um, listen, I can't thank you enough for what you've meant to Ellie this past year."
All of you.
She's earned it.
"Turks, huh?"

Where is this young man from New York?
Have him come closer.
I can't see him so good.
"My respects, Don Ciccio."
Give me your blessing.
Bless you!
What's your name?
You took the name of this town!
And what's your father's name?
His name was...
Antonio Andolini.
"Louder, I don't hear so good."
My father's name was Antonio Andolini and this is for you!
"Michael, say goodbye."
"Hi, Al."
"Can I speak with you for a second, Tom?"
"Tom, where's Mike?"
Waiting for you to leave.

No chance.

"Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
"Lock the doors, the windows, close the shades."
-Most important--
-Watch out for Sammy.

I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.
-It's called being a good son.
"-Dad's gonna be here, right?"
"He'll be here, promise."
"-Where is he, anyway?"
-On business.
-That's why you ran away.
-I was going to college.
"It was Dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
"Your brother and me, we needed you."
"You walked away, Sam."
-You walked away.
DEAN:
Stop it.
You're the one who said don't come back.
"You closed that door, not me!"
This isn't the life I wanted for you.

"BUT NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO SAY ""I TOLD YOU SO."""
"THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU, MICHAEL."
I KNOW.
"FIONA,I NEED YOUR HELP."
"OH,SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HANDLE THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN."
"YOU JUST COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF, COULD YOU?"
"SADLY,NO."
TAKE DOUG BACK TO THE LOFT.
LOCK HIM DOWN TIGHT.
"YOU CAN HANDLE THAT,RIGHT?"
HAVE I EVER LET YOU DOWN?
"BE CAREFUL,FI."
"DON'T WORRY,MICHAEL."
I NEVER LET MY GUARD DOWN.
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T GET AHOLD OF HER?
SHE DOESN'T HAVE SOME KIND OF A --

I'm afraid!
"Please,Michael!"""
You changed.
This is more my style.
"Come, come, come."
You must be famished.
"Let me help you, my dear."
There we go.
That's better.
"Now, quite comfy, hmm?"
"Ha, ha."
"It's not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?"

- Sure.
I need a laugh.

Lau's PIN was one-two-three-four.
"Why are you texting a dead man, Harry?"
This is not going to affect our investigation.
- No.
That's not good enough.
"- You have to trust me on this, Suri."
"Jesus, Harry, we can't investigate a murder if you're considered a suspect."
You know I'm not a suspect.

Well done.
Half a point for knowing Woody Allen's real name.
- (Alan) A tiny fragment of a point.
"- (Stephen) Yeah, a fragment."
A pebble.
A little pebble.
An Alan of a point.
But Woody Allen is by no means the Alan with the worst reputation in Hollywood.
"Who is, Rich, would you say?"
The Alan with the worst reputation in Hollywood.
"It's Alan ""Big Al"" Allinson, who was so taken by his Celtic Breton background that he killed a lot of people with rocks."
No.
Would it help if I told you his name?
- (Peter) I think I know what it is.
- Yeah?
- Is it Alan Smithee?
- Yes!
Oh!
Ten points to you.

Absolutely right.

"Yeah, they done it."
They took their sweet time with it.
"At the start, I didn't feel nothing."
I just heard the sound of the knife scraping against my skull and them all laughing and whooping and hollering and whatnot.
Then the blood came.
It was cold.
"It started streaming down my face, in my eyes, and breathing it in."
Choking on it.
That's when I felt it.

Exactly 11 :37.
"Got to run, sweetheart."
Keep an eye on the Dynamic Duo.
While my Batman and Robin do their stuff.
"Ta-da, darling."
"Well, Chief O'Hara, Black Widow's caper should be just about over."
And I should be hearing from Batman now.
"Yes, right on schedule."
Why isn't he calling on the Batphone?
Commissioner Gordon.
"Ah, ha-ha-ha."
Ro-
"- Robin did what, Mr. Irving?"
Oh.
I'm really embarrassed.
Grandma puts her hands together to worship what I cooked.
-And it was really delicious.
-That's true!
We're all counting on you from now on.
Look at this.
What is this?
"To convince her to agree to go to Hawaii, I talked about Suzujiro today."
Then Grandma started to remember the names of her brothers.
"""Tetsutaro."
"""Dozaburo."
"""Jushiro."
"""Shogoro."
"""Kuginosuke."
"""Natakichi."
"""Kuwata."
"""Suzukichi."
"""Nabe."
"""Kane."
"Kyoko."""
These names have the Chinese symbol for metal.
"Grandma's father, our great-grandfather, seems to have been a real weirdo."
"""Kane."" So this is our Grandma, right?"
-eleven!
-eleven?
"And she says there must have been two or three more, but she can't remember them."
And Suzujiro is among the ones she can't remember?
"But you know, Tetsutaro, Dozaburo, there, is number two."
I think the brother between those two is Suzujiro.
I'm pretty sure of it.
"First, the Chinese character for Suzu has the symbol for metal."
"Even if she could remember, Grandma won't go to Hawaii."
I'm gonna go poop now
"Yep, go pump it out"
Yes ma'am
"Me, the hunter..."
Bon...
"Don't scare me like that, I almost peed my pants"
Bon...
Yes?
Bon...
I love you!
"Ever since we met on ""Monster Hunter"" online"
I'm a gross Otaku but I love you
With my spearing soul
I think Miyu is being physically and mentally abused
I am taking Miyu home
Miyu looks her best when she is smiling
She doesn't deserve to be sad
Yeah
"Also, you are being watched"
He's asleep
"No, I mean that"
What?
It's Lin's smartphone
It's out of the box
What's this?
This is being broadcast online
"There should be some people watching, including Lin's younger sister"
Is that a joke?
I'm serious
Which website?
"Hey, Bon?"
Which website?
"YEAH,YOU CAN THANK ME"
"BY KEEPING YOUR HEAD DOWN AND STAYING AWAY FROM WINDOWS,OKAY?"
"THERE ARE WAYS TO LESSEN THE RISK AN ARMED ESCORT,"
"TAKING AN UNPREDICTABLE ROUTE TO YOUR DESTINATION,"
HAVING BACKUP IN A TRAIL CAR.
"BUT ULTIMATELY,"
"AS LONG AS THE ASSASSIN KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE GOING,"
THEY HAVE THE UPPER HAND.
THE POINT IS THE THING WORKS.
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN MY LIFE THAT'S NEVER LET ME DOWN.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP A GOOD ASSASSIN
FROM FINDING AN OPENING AND TAKING A SHOT.
THE BEST YOU CAN DO IS CONTROL WHERE THE BEST OPENING IS.
"AND SOMETIMES,THAT'S ENOUGH."
Michael:
DROP IT.
YOU SET ME UP.
BRAVO.
"PUT IT DOWN,EVELYN."
"HEY,I CAN STILL DO THIS."
DID I TELL YOU HOW MUCH THIS JOB PAYS?
"YOU COULD BUY SOMEPLACE DECENT TO LIVE,"
EVEN AT MIAMI PRICES.
PUT THE RIFLE DOWN.
HOW DID YOU KNOW I'D BE HERE?
I FIGURED YOU HAD A SOURCE IN THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

"Struck by Kwon Joon's arrow, Gurujima met his demise that day."
"In Yi Soon-shins 5th sea battle, the Battle of Dang-po, 21 Japanese ships were destroyed and 2.820 Japanese soldiers died in action."

This is my house.
"It is located in Trnje, in 87 Paromlinska street."
"It was built by my granddad who was a railwayman, back in 1909."
"It was where my father was born, and so was I."
But we haven't been living here permanently.
My father was a teacher.
"I've spent most of my childhood in Dalmatia, and when I got back to my old house at the age of 17, boys from the hood kept calling me ""Dalmo"" for a while."
I'm a loner.
I teach history and geography at elementary school nearby.
"Circumstancially, I never got married, and I wouldn't find easy to move away from here since the house, like the rest of this street, is to be demolished soon."
I haven't been disturbed when I heard about this.
"For quite some time, I wasn't even paying attention to it."
"What do I need, anyway?"
"I begun serious thinking about the house, my departing and the whole neighborhood only when Fabian shown up."
"One day, he just rang my doorbell."

AND HE WAS KEEPING HIS MOUTH SHUT.
"AND THE MINUTE HE DECIDED TO DEFEND HIMSELF,"
THEY WOULD CALL HIM UPPITY;
THEY WOULD CALL HIM A LOUD MOUTH TO DISCREDIT HIM.
NARRATOR:
"AFTER BASEBALL, HE WOULD SPEAK OUT TIRELESSLY,"
USING HIS IMMENSE FAME TO PROMOTE EQUALITY
AND CREATE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES
FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS EVERYWHERE.
BUT IN AN AGE OF PROFOUND SOCIAL UPHEAVAL
"AS HIS INFLUENCE DIMINISHED AND HIS HEALTH DECLINED,"
HE WOULD SOMETIMES STRUGGLE TO FIND HIS PLACE
IN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
HE HAD ONCE SYMBOLIZED.
"AND HIS HOME, ONCE A HAVEN FROM THE FIGHT OUTSIDE,"
WOULD SEE UNIMAGINABLE SORROW.
RACHEL ROBINSON:
JACK NEVER TALKED ABOUT CARRYING
THE ASPIRATIONS OF OUR RACE AS A BURDEN.
HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT IT AS...
AS KIND OF OPPORTUNITY.
"AND HE WAS PROUD, VERY PROUD, WHEN HE SUCCEEDED IN SOME WAY"
AND DEVASTATED WHEN HE DIDN'T.
BUT HE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO HAVE RACIAL EQUALITY IN AMERICA.
"AND IF WE DIDN'T, IF HE DIDN'T DO HIS PART"
"AND DIDN'T ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THEIR PART,"
NO CHANGE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE.
ALTON WALDON:
You girls are strange
You only speak half of what you want to say what are you doing?
Eating a bun
I never expected in this evil cult there could be such a beautiful place
Jiu Jun
Yes
Didn't we arrange to meet the wu Dong School here?
"Yes, teacher we did arrange to meet in this famous"

Yes
Hero Sung
Miss Chau
"Master, the letter brought by the pigeon messenger"
It said we've reached the foot of the hill
So you're the Five Emissaries from the Ming Cult
I suppose most of their men have returned we're here to deal with the troubles
Good
However before you
If we've to massacre a group of Ming Cult followers... who are unarmed and seriously wounded we are no different from evil cults
"Alright, heroes"
Let the matter rest today wait
I have a personal grudge to be settled
I am here to challenge
Yang Siu from the Ming Cult
I hope that one of us will die in the fight here today
Yan Lei Hang
"That's right, I am the fiance of Ji Shiau Fu wu Dong's 6th Master, Yan Lei Hang"
In fact... you could have looked for me a long time ago
"Father, don't kill my father"
Your father?
"That's right, I am the daughter of Ji Shiau Fu"
Yang Bu Huei
Bu Huei?
Ji Shiau Fu didn't regret to do such things
"Yang Siu, why do you get hurt today?"
why don't you kill me first today?
Shiau Fu...
Brother wu Ji...
"Brother wu Ji, your medication is here"
Alright
"Do as I say, use the medicine internally  externally"

- Whoa!
"- What do you got, Tony?"
"Right here on these rocks, I've got a triangle."
This thing's amazing.
Thereisan island in the North Atlantic wherepeoplehavebeenlooking for an incredible treasure formorethan200 years.
"Sofar,theyhavefound bits of gold chain, astoneslabwithstrange symbols carved into it, evena 17thcentury Spanish coin."
"Todate,sixmen havedied  trying to solve the mystery."
"And,accordingto legend, onemorewillhavetodie beforethetreasure can be found."
"Jack,whydon'tyou hack that tree out of the way."
Wow.
-That's my big discovery.
"Well, honestly, David, that is quite odd."
"Afewdaysago , duringa meeting in the war room,"
"Rick,Martyandmembersofthe Oak Island team were introduced toNewYorkbasedwriter and researcher Zena Halpern by area historian Doug Crowell."
Hello?
"-Hi, Zena, it's Doug."
"I just gave everyone here a little overview on what your research involves, and that you have some pretty interesting documents."
"Duringtheirmeeting, Halpern shared withtheteamher discoveryof three ancient documents, whichshebelievesprove a connection between theKnightsTemplar and activities on Oak Island goingbackas far as the 12th century."
We have a map that shows Nova Scotia.
We have a map of Oak Island.
And then we have the cipher.
"Oneofthemaps,dated1347,  showedvarioussites and landmarks on Oak Island thatmatchseveralof the places well known to Rick,"
Martyandtheteam.
The hand-drawn map is clearly Oak Island.
"Andthenthereare several things, named in French, whichhavebeentranslated for us."
Oneiscalledthe basin.
"Well,thatclearlycorrelates to the swamp."
Andthenthere'ssomething on the map which points rightaboutto where the Money Pit is.
And then we have two or three things that we don't know anything about.
"One'scalled""TheAnchors,"" one's called ""The Valve,"""
"andone'scalled""TheHatch."""
"Oh, fuck it."
I should have this figured out by now.
"Well, thank you for listening to the sentimental, and frustrated, ramblings of an old man."
You've done a lot for me.
I didn't do much.
No.
But your work did.
That's true.

I wonder what type of style we should be working on for these exercises.
I'm not sure I can answer that question.
"In fact, I'm certain I cannot."
I don't have a very academic relationship with form or style.
So...
What is your advice?
"The best thing I can offer is what I do, which is to kinda goof around until you find what works."
"Besides, in my experience, more than half of you will probably abandon writing, creative or the other kind, very shortly after graduating."

Will takes... down his second target.
He's slightly in the lead of Paul.
Paul:
I can't see it.
NARRATOR:
Missed.
Paul:
"Sheez, I can't see."
NARRATOR:
Looks like he has some problems with his safety classes fogging up.
And it's a miss.
Will has a miss on his third target again.
Let's see how Paul's going to catch up.
Paul:

Everyone with cancer dies.
Why?
Does someone have it?
No...
Mom...

"Mom, are you okay?"
Of course!
Why wouldn't I be?

You shouldn't let him talk to you like that.
James:
He's only messing around.
Matt:

"If you play around with a sick kid like this, what would happen?"
I'm sorry.
Please be cautious.
- Michelle.
- O-Okay.
"Michelle, um-- [ Chuckles ]"
Do you want to be my date for the prom ?
Really ?
You seriously want to go with me ?
Yes.
Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards ?
Because that would be so cool.
"- Sure, whatever you want."
- Cool !
We're gonna have such a good time.
It'll be like this one time at band camp when we all had a campfire--
[ Knocking At Door ]
"[ Siren Wailing, Distant ]"
Hi.
- How'd you know I was here ?
- Stifler told me.
- Talked to Stifler ?
"- Well, I needed to find you."
We're gonna have to work on that song.
Okay.
I'm glad you came by.
So you work nights ?
- My dad's the manager.
- Really ?
Cool.
Tell him the subs are great.
-So you're going to Michigan next year ?
-Yeah.
"My parents want me to go to Northwestern, but..."
"I'm behind, but I'm thinking, ""You know,"
"I can lash pretty good, and I can lash fast."
"I'm going to catch up."""
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Here he comes, Rob."
Here he comes.
Paul finally made it.
Come on.
Let's go.
You need to get those lashings night and tight.
"Great job, dude."
Keep it up.
Keep it up.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" Done."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Done."
All right.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" So now I have to get my ammo, get my slingshot, and hit those three targets."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Rob's a champion archer."
That should help him with the slingshots.
Paul:
Okay.
I'm behind.
And I'm trying not to think about that.
"Because I knew if I was going to be able to take this,"
I had to tie my lashings tight.
Then I'm going to get up on the tower.
I really want to win this competition.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" All right, come on, dude."
Paul's almost done.
You got this.
Aw!
Paul:
I got one more to go.
I hope nothing is wrong here.
- No.
How long have you planned to stay here?
Now I'm planning to settle down.
Jimmy!
Hey!
What's the reason of my friend's worry?
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
I've gone mad today.
Many girls came in my life and I forgot them.
But this one has impressed me.
Wow!
"Excuse me, Jaikishan!"

Senior sir has come from Delhi.
Hello!

I had told you about him.
Oh!
Congratulations!

"In a short time, you became a hero of our company."
I read your suggestions about Rajdoot motorcycle
I liked it.

"So, mister."
"You got promotion, right?"
I never say anything wrong.
"Aunt, where's Radha?"
"Aunt, where's Radha?"
She has gone to visit a motorbike factory... ...with her Jimmy.

NARRATOR:
Both these dishes are time-honored Boy Scout classics.
"The Chili Mac consists of ground beef, chopped onions, diced tomatoes, macaroni, cheese, and water."
"Train Wreck is a one-dish breakfast with bacon, sausage links, hash browns, and eggs, all mixed together with plenty of syrup."

Paul:
He has also sent few of yours photographs together.
See!
God!
I look so fat.
Read what he says.
"Dear Damodar, many thanks for your help... you gave me in India."
India's police and custom are very suspicious.
That's why I don't like there.
My business is well spread here.
Now it's not possible for me to come... to India before 2 or 3 years.
I'm also planning to get married here.
I'm sending few photographs of ours together.
I hope you'll like it.
Uma!
- Yes.
I got an idea of postponing Radha's marriage.
What idea?
- Fantastic!
"Mister, there are kids in the house."
"Whatever you want to do, do it slowly."
"Bittu, go to sleep."
It's none of your concern.
Sleep!

I don't know.
But he wants to see you.
Send him in.

"I knew you could do it, Twilight!"
Twilight:
"I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bog, and  I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy."
"I mean, that hydra- (theremin music, Pinkie Pie shudders)"
Twilight:
Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie:
That wasn't it.
Twilight:

2NE1- Falling in Love.
Ju:
"Even though I like ""Do you love me?"" and I listen to it a lot."
FlL has something different; it's more unforgettable than DYLM.
"So I love it, every time I listen to it I feel like I'm on the beach..."
I don't know ... it cheers me up.
Jana:
"I feel like Falling in love and touch me over here, touch over there."
Ju:
Exactly.
That's the feeling.
So 1st place Infinite- Destiny!
Ju:
"In our MV Reaction, when I saw the video and listen to this song, I..."
Jana:
Fell in love.
Ju:
I did.
"The only that listened from them were ""The Chaser"", that we like very much."
"""Be Mine"" and ""She's Back""."
"So after ""Destiny"" I'm listening to everything, watching variety shows with them."
Jana:
She became a stalker.
Ju:
Yes.
"I'm now 5% Inspirit, because I'm still a V.I.P , Shawol..."

"OK, OK."
I admit it.
"I was dishonest, selfish and wrong."
"Now, can I please just have my stories?"
"Jessica, you're on now."
But the stories!
No time to proof them.
I'll just have to trust you.
"Now, go, all right?"

- And his grandma?
- Look out!
"- Back to beds, you lot!"
- You're right.
Kostya's grandma will be here tomorrow.
- Where's my grandson?
Is he putting on weight?
- But he's not here.
Can you imagine what happens next?
"- Hey, guys!"
We need to cancel the Parents' Day!
- Do what?
- Cancel it!
"- Yeah, like you can cancel it."
"- We can claim that, since it's ""Parents' Day,"" only parents are allowed."
- Right.
"- No, seriously!"
"Right now it's grandpas, grandmas, uncles, aunts, and what have you!"
Like they have no other place to go.

"-The one and only, brother."
-You don't look very French.
"-You gettin' racist on me, brother?"
"-No, no, I guess I've just never seen a real French person before."
"-Ha-ha, well, we're a fun bunch."

Have you never seen a real French person before?
"-Well, I guess not, but, okay, not that there's anything wrong with it, but is Pierre gay?"
He plays very well.
"And he seems very friendly. yes, Julio, my best friend is very friendly and"
likes all the girls.
Sorry if I missed some chunks.
I've only been learning Spanish for 2 years!
"So here x is 0, y is 2."
So let's see.
3 times 0 plus 6 times 2 is equal to 0 plus 12.
"Doesn't equal 2, it equals 12."
This one doesn't work.
I'm just taking 3 times x plus 6 times y and seeing what it equals.
"In this case, we have 3 times 0 plus 6 times y."
Plus 6 times 6.
Well that's 0 plus 36.
That doesn't equal 2.
Can't be that choice.
"This one, we have 3, this 3, times 1."
Plus 6 times this y.
6 times minus 1/6.
So let's see.
That's 3.
That's equal to 3.
"And then, 6 times 1/6 is 1, but we have a negative out there."
So it's minus 1.
That is equal to 2.
So that works.
3 times 1 plus 6 times negative 1/6 is equal to 2.
So our answer is C.
Problem 29.
Let me see if I need to cut and paste this one in.
All right.
"So yeah, I think it's a good idea."

After a long time you have remembered your friend!

Fool! can a friend forget a friend?
"Why didn""t you contact me for so many days?"
DDT!
"Bring sir""s luggage from the jeep.. shekhar, listen!"
"I can""t stay with you."
I have come on government duty.
I will have to stay at the government guest house.
Government!
"Duty! sP, I think you can""t sleep in a poor man""s house."
"It is very close, downtown."
"(Carmen) The school Benito Juarez, is it very far from the hotel?"
Tomorrow I have to go there.
(Berta) Not at all.
It's very close.
My kids study there.
(Berta) Un momento.
"(Roberto, her son) Mom, I need to use the car, remember?"
"Pardon me, this is my son Roberto and his friend Julio."
"These ladies come from San Antonio, they are going to Hotel San Diego."
Why don't you take them to their hotel?
"No problem, Mrs...Toledo and Ms. Toledo."
We're named Toledo too!
True!
"Is this the last name of everyone here, Toledo?"
"All, no."
But it's a very common name here.
I'm not named Toledo.
"I'm Julio Lovero, at your service (pleased to meet you)."
"(Roberto) Let's take the suitcases to the car.(Julio) Ok, I'll take this one."
This one is mine.
I'll take it.
"(Julio) Allow me, Linda."
"Great, ok."
Thank you very much Mrs. Toledo!
"No, thank you."
It has been a pleasure.
I hope you have a good trip.
Hi!

They're from San Antonio.
JULlE KLAUSNER:

TED LEO:
Yeah.
Donatacci.
That's right.
BETH HOYT:
"OK, you guys."
I've watched plenty myself.
"One thing I've learned, I mean, you guys can back me up on this is that bitches be crazy, right?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
In general.
BETH HOYT:
Yep.
"So we're going to play in general, Bitches Be Crazy."
"OK, I'm going to give you guys a quote from either ""Real"
"Housewives of New York City"" ""Girl, Interrupted,"" the"
Winona Ryder movie about women in an insane asylum.
You have to guess which crazy bitch said what.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
BETH HOYT:
"Julia and Ted, you use your paddle to show us which one you think the quote is from."
"And you get a point for each one you get correct, and you drinks for each one you get wrong."
I'm just going to be drinking throughout.
TED LEO:
OK.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
That makes me more comfortable.
BETH HOYT:
That's what we're looking for.
OK.
Type in a new card for Elizabeth.
"You got it. *the superintendent of schools,*"
*this money* *will now be redirected*
*to Sweet Valley High* *Activities Committee...*
Great.
"You're up next, Bruce."
(mutters) Bruce.
And that's all the news you need to know.
"Till next time, Sweet Valley."
"And now, with his... unique take on Sweet Valley,"
Bruce Patman.
"Thank you, Jess..."
"*I mean, Elizabeth.*"
Where's his card?
It's coming right up.
"*Hello, fellow Gladiators.*"
"*And as if you didn't know,* *I'm Bruce Patman,*"
*and this is* *the Patman perspective...*
(giggling)
I'm really sorry.
This has to be done.
What did Collins say?
I have to talk to the principal.
Can't say you don't deserve it.
"Hey, nice move back there."
You really got me.
"Yeah, I did, didn't I?"
I'm impressed.
You're a nightmare.
*But I say there's nothing wrong* *with having money.* (Patty) Winston!
*I love the way money feels.* *I love the way money smells.*
I love what money does for me.
"-(dispatcher) Uh, please say again."
-I said we have an orange with the hiccups.
-(dispatcher) Oh no!
You're screwed!
"[screams, dial tone]"
-Ugh.
"All right, I'm out of ideas."
-[whimpers]
"-Look, everybody."
The important thing right now is to just remain calm.
-[hiccup]
[all screaming]
"-No, no, no!"
Everybody just shut up!
We're not going to freak out.
-That's easy for [hiccup] you to say.
You don't have an exploding [hiccup] hippo in your tummy.
"-Dude, it's not a hippo."
-It's an exploding hippo.
"-Listen to me, Orange."
Do you want to get rid of your hiccups?
-Duh.
"-Then you have to do exactly what I tell you, okay?"
-Okay.
"-Okay, it's really simple."
All you have to do is take a deep breath and hold it for 30 seconds.
-Okay.
[inhales] -(Pear) What?
"No, that never works."
-[groans]
-I always heard you have to stand on your head and cross your eyes.
-Mmm!
It was a wonderful experiment until we burned the church down.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Fair enough.
OK.
Let's talk about collaboration.
"If you could work with anyone in the biz, who would it be?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I would love to work with Tina Fey.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Really?
Wow.
"Are you a fan of ""30 Rocks?"""
TlLDA SWlNTON:
Tina Fay is an ice flow in the north Atlantic that I astral project to every third Sunday in Ramadan.
I sit on the ice.
On my bottom.
In my mind.
And let the fear of a dying world snake its way up my vagina.
Through my pelvis.
To create a crystal of ecstasy.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Wow.
"Well, thank you so much for joining us today, Tilda."
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"You're very welcome, Julie."
I'm ready to begin the interview whenever you are.
BETH HOYT:
Wow.
I thought that went great.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Yeah.
BETH HOYT:

"Our house has been broken into a couple times by some people, mainly dudes."
SPEAKER 19:
I've taken self-defense classes.
SPEAKER 16:
"I know how to fight, so I'll kick some ass."
SPEAKER 20:
Good question.
SPEAKER 21:
"Oh, man."
Uh.
SPEAKER 22:
Shoot.
"Uh, I don't know."
SPEAKER 23:
[LAUGHS]
SPEAKER 24:
Have you ever felt like you're in danger of sexual violence?
SPEAKER 25:
"No, I haven't."
No.
SPEAKER 26:
"I mean, I've never really felt at risk."
SPEAKER 27:
Sexual violence?
"Well, I don't know."
It's not really something that I think about a whole lot.
SPEAKER 25:
It's not really something I think about that much.
SPEAKER 21:
"I mean, when you think of sexual violence, you usually think of a woman walking down a street at night."
Hey...
Hit anywhere.
Nothing happens.
My God!
"- Sorry, Mr. Jimmy."
Your car's metal was no doubt from foreign.
"But I'm sorry, the hand was Indian."
That's why your car got injured.
Thank you for bringing Radha here.
Now it's upto Radha.
She can hop in any vehicle she wants.
"Come, darling."
"- Stop, Kishan!"
- Car is waiting for you.
"Bye, Jimmy!"
"Call me in the morning, okay?"
Thank you.
Rogue!
"If your intentions are pure, even the God supports you."
Good morning sir.
This morning is really very good.
"Why, sir?"
There's good news for you.
Good news?
- Yes.
There's going to be a motorcycle race from Mumbai to Poona.
Many big models of motorcycle are coming to take part.
Our company has selected you to take part... ...in the competition with Rajdoot 350.
Wow!

Do you had to interrupt?
First prize is worth Rs50000.

"By the end, I'm gonna try to get the commander to do the jerk. man #2:"
Aah! man:
Why you always got to stick your tongue out?
Punch Eason in the face right now. man #3:
"Oh, my God! man:"
That's the Rebel Alliance.
And there's the Empire.
Masood:
Hi.
This is my room.
And this is our garden.
So my name is Masood...
"I live in Afghanistan, Kabul, and I'm a news photographer."
Here is my house.
"And he's my father, drinking tea."
My mother is praying.
"Farid, my brother, is just-- again is staring in the refrigerator, as always."
"Right now I'm in my car, going to Kabul's old city, to take some pictures."
Sometimes I like to just walk around there
looking for a good shot.
These are like my two babies.
I carry them everywhere.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Oh yeah."
Give me some love.
"Give me some love, dude."
Teenager #15:
Whoo!
Teenager #16:
"Keep it up, keep it up."
There we go.
Teenager #17:
Whoo!
Here comes Paul!
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"Come on, Paul."
Paul:
"I know I've lost, but you know?"
I don't really feel that bad.
I feel pretty good about actually finishing.
NARRATOR:
"Paul, congratulations on making it back, man."
How has this whole experience been for you?
Paul:
I wouldn't trade it for the world.
"I mean, these guys are Eagles, and they're the best ones in the country."
And they've certainly proved it today.
You showed your true colors.
"Starting with ""Big South."""
With him trying to help me with the shooting.
I got to the tower.
You guys were cheering me on.
"When I got here, you guys were cheering me on."
You showed yourself true Scouts.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Paul, we know this has been hard."

Deceivers! - sir!

Mummy!
- Let go of my child!
"You! come, son! seema.. seema, you are here."
"I searched for you everywhere. seema.. seema, believe me."
This separation has tormented me a lot.
"Even my life has not been smooth, shekhar."
"I don""t know for which sin I am paying the price."
"For God""s sake leave!"
"Don""t force me to get you arrested."
"Don""t give people the chance to say.. ..that for 50,000 rupees a wife got her husband arrested."
"Leave! - seema, give me my child!"
Leave him!
"Don""t remind me that I am the mother of a smuggler""s son!"
"Mother, is he my daddy?"
Your daddy is dead!
He has ruined our happiness and peace!
What are you doing?
BETH HOYT:
I am demonstrating some different ways to sit.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I love sitting.
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I have a way to sit.
BETH HOYT:
Great.
Julie Klausner is adding to the more ways to sit on chairs.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"So this is a cool way to sit on a chair if you have like, a classroom full of students."
"And you want to maybe like, learn from their life lessons."
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"You kind of lean over the front of the chair, and you--"
BETH HOYT:
This is assertive.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Want to-- it's both.
It's submissive and assertive.
BETH HOYT:
I see what you're saying.
Because you're putting up a barrier.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, exactly."
But you're also open.
"So you lean into it, and then I like to steeple my fingers at first, and rest my chin on my thumbs."
And then just nod until I unsteep-- steepling.
I only bought the fish!
From where did you buy the fish?
"I bought it from my boss""s company truck.. ..that delivers fishes everyday."
I am so sorry! - so sorry!
"Hello, shekhar!"
This is for you!
Thank you very much!
Bye-bye!
Bye!
ls she the girl who dropped the beer?
Why did she come here? she came to apologise!
- Apologise?
And in this room? she is a mad girl!
And she left a present for you.
lf she had got it for me.. then why did she give it to you?
"Darling, we are in Europe!"
You should have a generous heart.
"I don""t understand anything, shekhar! on the first night you left me alone."
And now.. now this girl came in our bedroom.
What does this mean?
This means that you doubt me!
"You are making me doubt you, shekhar!"
"I don""t know why I feel afraid."
"Now unnecessarily you are scared. come in the bedroom! oh God! ln the morning, bedroom!"
"ln the afternoon, bedroom!"
"At night, bedroom!"
Always bedroom!
I am fed up of this place!
"Let""s go home, shekhar!"
Please!
Are you really fed up?
"- Yes! okay, darling!"
"Reporter Han, search the portals more."
Reporter Song!
"Reporter Song, check if anything has come up in the gallery."
Yes &amp;lt;I&amp;gt;[ in French ]
Did you understand?
"If I don't give orders at the office, nothing works here."
Excuse me.
This is a non-smoking section.
Yes.
What?
What?
What!!!
Why?
Why?
What is this?  &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take 1's Won Kang Hwi is Gay...
"What to do, Ga Ryeong?"
Yes.
Hello?
Hello.
"No, he isn't here."
"I'm sorry. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be linked to voice mail after the beep."
What's this?
Is the broadcast still not over?
It looks like I have to leave even without saying bye.
"What time is the flight? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Announcement. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Boarding Korean Air TK009,  which was scheduled to leave at 13:50, will be delayed due to sudden problems with the plane."
What?
Why problems with the plane?
Omo!
Omo!
What is this about Won Kang Hwi?
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Now we're literally playing with power.
"Come on, jump."
Jump!
"Come on, Mario, jump!"
"God, how do I jump?"
"Come on, jump!"
Ass!
"Oh, jump is over here."
"Alright, here we go."
"Get the mushroom, oh-"
"Aw, now that's assy."
"Yeah, I know I use the word ""ass"" a lot."
I guess you can say I'm an assaholic.
Let's try Kung Fu.
"Yeah, I'm honestly surprised."
This thing kinda works.
"Looking at the instructions, each game has a specific setup and a switch combination."
Kinda like the codes with the Power Glove.
"Punch-Out!! uses an upright position and a ""Power Bar""."
"Everything's always ""power""."
"What's so ""power"" about it?"
"It's only a plastic bar, and why do you need it?"
"Yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about!"
This actually works!
I'm punching somebody with the U-Force!
"Oh, watch out, oh-"
"Get up, get up, get up!"
Alright.
Alright.
One more game.
I can't believe we gotta touch this one again.
Top Gun has an option of using this weird joystick thing.
"And when you finally, finally think you do have something that matches customer needs, you get to the next step, which is customer validation."
An Advaita Song
Satsang with Mooji
[Mooji:]
Hari Om.
[Questioner:]
When I came to Lucknow in '96
[M:]
They want you to put the microphone more close.
[Q:]
Yes.
"When I came to Lucknow in '96, it was a little... scary for me."
and I had the great grace to meet Papaji at that time and you remind me very much of him.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
He's here you know?
[Q:]
"Yes, I do."
And so at that time I wasn't quite ready to sing for him.
So I wondered if maybe I could  sing for you just a little bit.
[M:]
Oh yes.
[Q:]
A song that was in my heart  but never made it to my mouth.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
"Oh yes, please."
[Q:]
It seemed childish and simplistic.
"It was embarassing, and I felt I just wasn't ready at that time."
"So, we go."
"Row, row, row, your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,"
Where's he now?
Guess he's gone back home with Xiang Yaocha
Who's Xiang Yaocha?
Mu Wanqing.
Mu Wanqing?
Tuan Zhengchun &amp;amp; Qin Hongmian's bastard child!
She's his daughter.
What's the story?
"Qin Hongmian tried to avoid being a laughingstock, by changing her daughter's name to Mu."
Xiang Yaocha as alias.
Who would have guessed that her daughter... has found Tuan Zhengchun's son?
"I was there, when Mu Wanqing... promised herself to Tuan Yu."
Really?
That's good news.
"In other words,"
I'll be using those two... to get even with Tuan Zhengchun.
"Hurry, follow me to Wanjie valley."
Not going after Tuan Yu?
Of course we will.
"But first, we need to solicit help... of the Chief of Wanjie valley."
I get it.
I heard that Chief Zhong's wife had... an affair with Tuan Zhengchun once.
He bears a bitter hatred for Tuan Zhengchun.
"And because of that,"
I'm sure he'll be more than happy to help.
We shouldn't waste any more time.
We'll leave right away.
My father.
Are you well?
Well?
I'm almost halfdead being mad at you!
"Father, this is Miss Mu."
"Mackers, you ready?"
Joe Perry.
James.
"Crumpets, yeah?"
"Okay, tap turning - ready, go."
"And easy, just bowside backing down, arms only"
Didn't even try!
"2, blade in"
Check your gates.. 2 and 4 tap
Easy there.
(tapping the side of the boat)
Ffwwoooaaarrr!

"Louis - ""Doesn't matter if it goes to 34"""
Tap on Dave

"Do you get, like, half a pip higher than I do?"
"Louis - ""Don't know"""
Mackers gently
Easy
"Okay, stern 4 rowing on."
"Just stern 4, we're just tapping up the gap"
"Ready, go"
Bowside squeeze
"One more light, easy there."
Drop
35's just gone off
"Crumpton - ""Aaah, Yeah!"""
"Louis - ""If the weather gets shit, just fucking hang off it"""
"Back it down stern pair gently, stern pair back."
"Louis, back it"
"Easy there 36 are just going, 37 are just going"
"I mean, no one really knows."
TED LEO:
Ryan Gosling and James Franco.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, I'm done with Ryan Gosling."
"I'm done with like, girls being like, isn't it interesting that I have a crush on Ryan Gosling?"
Because I'd kill him just to get those girls to shut up.
"And then James Franco, why not?"
It would be a project.
It would be an art project.
BETH HOYT:
Absolutely.
"That's the way he would see it, too."
"Not that [INAUDlBLE] it's just, you know, his view on everything, right?"
It's all art.
TED LEO:
"He's an indicator for me of how old I am, because I really don't know who, like--"

You don't get him?

"No, I just don't know, I don't know, I don't think I've seen anything he's been in."
You know what I mean?
"Like, it's that kind of, I feel like it's, I'm on some other side of some line."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Ryan Gosling, or James Franco?"
TED LEO:
James Franco.
BETH HOYT:
You will.
"He's like all the little, a bunch of things."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
He'll show up at your house one day.

"Oh, good."
Okay.
Bobby:
"Dad, can I come down?"
Cathy:
"Bobby, can we have a talk, though?"

"(Energetic) ""Hurricane"" MV THE END!"
This is Washington D.C.
After a little break some members will get ready.
I heard Him Chan and Jong Up will be filming first.
I didn't want to waste time in the hotel.
I heard the set is near here so I came out to skateboard.
I like it here so much.
"Hi, I'm Him Chan."
"""Hurricane"" MV is over."
We were filming for a real long time.
There were many different places we went to.
"And today, we came over to Washington D.C."
"As soon as we got here, Jong Up and I had to film for the ""Coffee Shop"" MV."
So we're out here and it's pretty nice.
Zelo is here too.
Zelo seems to like America a lot.
Look at him.
But I'm a little worried about something.
L.A. and San Francisco were very natural and free cities.
Washington D.C. seems like a noble place.
I'm worried that Zelo will get scolded.
We're at the MV shooting set.
Wish us luck.
Goodbye.
We're heading to New York now.
New York is the final destination.
We'll try our best in NY too and head back safely.
We're finally in NYC.
Honestly we wanted to go to JFK airport.
We'll go to Korea from JFK.
"Go on, do not want to see you,leaving."
What happened?
"No, leave"
"Ayten, open,I'm gonna blow the doorsif you do not open!"
Ayten!
Open the door!Open!
Ayten?!
Are you okay?
"Ayten, answer me,are you okay?"
Ayten!
Ayten!Ayten!
Ayten!Open your eyes!Ayten!
"Ayten!Come on, answer me!Ayten!"
Come on!
Ayten!Open your eyes!Ayten!
"Ayten!Do you hear me, open your eyes?Ayten!"
"She fainted,help me!"
Get a stretcher!
Fast!
What happened?
"I do not know,I found her like this."
Help her!
Ayten!
We'll help her!
Mother?What happened?
Why do not you stayher brother?
"I could not, was arrested and I will not allow it to stay with him."
"What are you talking about?I do not understand... is not possible you understand, my daughter. he is Arrestedand they do not allowto visit him. what do we do?"
"Do not say that, my mother .."
We'll get through it.
"Forgive me, Mother."
"God... keep telling myselfit will pass, but I can not anymore."
She liked it.
And you get to know the people.
Both my sisters lived in Grand Rapids there.
Janet O'Donnell and who else?
Eleanor McDonough.
She's got the place in Charlevoix now.
Her husband died a couple years ago so she's got - her parents own a house over there.
"So what was the island like back then when you came back you rented first, right?"
"Oh yeah, I rented for years."
"It was okay, it was good."
"A little busy, like you say, all the time."
But you still knew more people.
"Now, know more up at the hill at the cemetery."
"Like I said, nine of us graduated in '59."
Threw a 50th party here in July.
Who were those nine that graduated together?
Four of us lived here.
"Eleanor Moony, O'Donnell's wife."
"And Beverly Cantwell, now."
"That's Richie's sister by the way, the fireman."
Myself.
And Loretta Slader.
All four of us lived here.
Then we have Caroline [?].
She was Johnny Paul's sister.
Next to another Johnny in my class.
Jeanie [?] lived next to Archie's place.
And Sally Martin
"She would be Margie, up at the old convent there."
Be Little Ernie's aunt.
"Let's see who - Jeanie, and Sally, and"
Caroline
Otherwise I have no hope.

This is what is necessary for us.

This is a question I've asked once or twice

I'm asking it for...

We're encouraging everyone to chant Hare Krishna mantra
"Q: yet we're seeing now there's one quote in Padma-purana, the sa that same, without proper initiation, the mantra received is wihout effect."
So is it that those without proper connection they're not getting any benefit from chanting the mantra?

Q2:

"Definitely, it is one of the best songs of the year."

"The best song for me is still ""Smoky Girl""  Jana:"
And one of Exo's best songs.
Ju:
Third Place F(x)- Rum Pum Pum Pum.
Ju:
"We did a MV Reaction, and I wanted to listen to again to see if I could like this song."
"And that's what happened, I really like it."
"The choreography is weird and cool, the song too."
"The lyrics are weird, it's about the wisdom tooth, and I mean they compare the wisdom tooth to their first love."
I thought that the lyrics were so crazy that that's why I liked Rum Pum Pum Pum.

Hi
I am Roberto Toledo
I'm 19 years old.
I live in the city of Guanajuato.
In Mexico!
Guanajuato is north of Mexico City.
And it's a city of much culture and history.
This is my family.
"My Dad, Tomás"
He is a doctor.
Everyone says he's very serious.
"My mom, Berta who is in a travel agency here, en Guanajuato."
"My sister, Daniela."
"And Julio, my best friend."
"In this city, there's always many tourists."
"Last year, two North American tourists from San Antonio,"
Texas
"Good afternoon, and how can I help you?"
"Good afternoon, I am Carmen Toledo, and my daughter Linda."
"Venimos de San Antonio, Tejas."

"Oh, yes of course."
Welcome to Guanajuato.
"I am Berta Toledo, at your service."
Pleased to meet you.
(Berta) Everything is ready.
I have a reservation for all of you in one of the best hotels.
I sure know that.
I would like to ask you something.
But tell the truth.
The whole truth.
What did you use before this performance?
"Rolls with meat pie,... and green tea."
Some meat pies are good dopes.
"All right, where's the talent?"
She has something strange...
"I don't think you had to use something, you're just that kind of type."
"You have no extreme talent, but you enjoy the singing, and I wanted to see it to the end."
A lot of energy comes out of her!
- Certainly!
"- It's strange, Paľo."
Yes for me!
- Strange.
- I felt good.
Something painful.
Mournful.
The singing grobian here just wants some notes...

"Even the mythical creature he's based on, the Tsuchinoko, is typically described as around 10 to 30 inches long- tops!"
"But in the official games, little Dunsparse is- er-"
WHAT?!
4 foot 11 inches???
But. . .uh
Why you make him so little?
I-I don't understand.
"Joining Dunsparce in the things-that-are-way-longer than-you'd-think club is Dratini, another serpant like Pokémon."
He's the first pokémon in his line so I've always thought of him to be the little guy.
WRONG!
5 foot 11 inches.
Longer than the average height of humanity.
"Also, this was always weird to me."
Dratini:
6ft long.
Dragonaire:
13ft long.
Dragonite:
7ft long.
Where?
Where does it all go???
Let's check out some spherical pokémon.
"I've always pictured guys like Glalie, Fortess and Gastly to be around a foot long or a little bit bigger than a basketball."
NOPE!
These guys are actually all 4 to 5 ft long.
See this guy?
See that giant ball?
That's a 5ft beach ball! and THAT is what your Glalie is gonna look like in real life.
"And yes, It is terrifying!"
"At last, at almost 48 feet long, Wailord is by far the longest pokémon in existence- over 17 ft longer than the second longest, Steelix."
"But weight-wise, Wailord doesn't make ANY sense."

It is.
Win Phippen: ...and my research program.
I'm quite excited about it.
It's very unique.

Hi today I am going to tell you about three different kinds of pasta.
The first pasta I am going to tell you about is capellini.
"CAP-A-LEAN-E, also known as angel hair."
This pasta is long and thin.
The second pasta I am going to tell you about is spaghetti.
"SPA-GET-EE, spaghetti is similar to capellini in that it is long and thin, but it is a little bit thicker than capellini."
The third pasta I am going to tell you about is linguini.
LlN-GEEN-EE.
Linguini also means little tongues.
Linguini is flat and long and thin.
So next time you're ordering pasta you will know just what to ask for.

"Good morning,"

But you already had breakfast?
available today in US English and they're coming pretty soon in many other languages.
I hope you enjoy that.
Let's talk about another Cloud Computing Application; this is one of my favorite demonstrations.
"It's called Google Translate, which Eric called summation earlier."
"So the Google Translate App that's available today from Google Apps in the Android Market, allows you to type or even speak a phrase in one language, and then have it immediately translated and even spoken back to you in one of 50 other languages."
So that's pretty cool and you can try it out.
But what I want to do today is I actually want to show you a preview of a feature that we've been working on for a little while--it won't be out for a few months--it's called Conversation Mode in Google Translate.
"And for that, I'm going to invite my colleague Kyle over back on stage to help me out."
"Please keep in mind this is experimental, so it may or may not work perfectly."
"Nice to see you, Kyle. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
Were going to be in Germany in a second. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"Hold on, it says French. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
We're in Germany. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"So--I know, yes, so Kyle, I'm a tourist and you're a salesman at a local shoe store here in Berlin."
"So we're going to start conversation mode here, and you'll notice that I have a button in English and you have a button in German."
"So, our conversation would probably go something like this."
Do you have these shoes in size 41? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which cable? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Try that again. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:

Black or Brown would be fine. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have black and brown. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Can you give me a discount if I take both? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:

Cold pan.
Cold pan.
"Felix, what's going on?"
Are you gonna try to pan-roast this and get the fat rendered?

I think that's good.

- Yeah.
- Definitely.
"- Very interesting indeed. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Becky, I mean,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; she's going for dessert. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;A rhubarb tart.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So, look, working with both&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;hands at the same time.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- I love the way she's multitasking."

"Profiteroles are a dessert, and they remain dessert. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And they shouldn't be tampered with.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Absolutely.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Now, you should be working on your finesse &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and making sure everything&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you put on the plate&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;has a reason.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"

I hope that works out well.
"Yeah,"
it's a big change.

I'm working on a bachelor's degree.
It'll be
Hope it's a good program there.

yeah.
Huh-uh.
Yeah.
"Swimming is for swimming, pool."
Yeah.
That's why they call them swimming pools
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's where you swim.
You do not swim in the ocean.
No.
No.
No.
Not anymore.
"I've seen what comes out of the ocean,"

I mean incredibly large sharks.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night"

Wow.
the next morning they would have them strung up across the getties
Uh-huh.
"and it, you know,"
"so, just strung up,"
their tails would still hang on the bottom of the getties
"yeah,"
"just,"
"But, that is God's country,"
it has to be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Do they still have the, uh, the scenic, uh, roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees?"

"they,"
"the last one, well,"

Okay.
Yeah.
"But, they are huge."
"If you've never seen them, it's, it's very awe inspiring."
"No,"
"so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten. Well, New Orleans and, uh, Minneapolis."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
"well, there is lots of pretty country further west."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"and you just need to take the little one. Show them all the, all the pretties before they go away."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
Yeah.
They seem to be trailing out quickly.
Yeah
because there is lots to see
"Let me see,"
Houston's north.
Yeah?
Okay.
Dallas is south.
"Oh, okay,"
all right.
"Well, that sounds pretty good."
"Does, uh,"
"I guess the weather,"
does that stay pretty constant there
"or,"
"It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons."
Yeah?
"Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon."
"Okay,"
"well, that's pretty temperate."
"Yeah,"
that's not too bad.
"But, uh, yeah,"
"have you done, uh, any other boating then"
"or,"
"No,"
"I hadn't done any in a uh, lately,"
"but that's all,"
"I used to uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop."
Yeah?
"And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about."
"Oh, that's great."
"Yeah,"
"I,"
And we had a different boat every day.
"Uh, audiology."
Okay.
Fantastic. Uh
Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida.
"Oh, really."
"Yeah,"
I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell.
Oh really?
"Uh, yeah."
Neat.
"But, uh, I don't know."
"It's, it's an interesting issue."
"There's, like you say, in Texas there's been quite a few"
"and, and in Florida in the last few years, I think there's been a lot."
"I can't, I, you know, I can't give you figures"
"but, uh,"
Yeah.
"I just,"
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California.
Uh-huh.
"So, I think it,"
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what
"Oh, is that right?"
they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then .
Okay.
"Yeah,"
"I, I kind of,"
"yeah, I've heard things about that."
I've heard that they don't mess around very much.
Yeah.
"so,"
"Yeah,"
right.
And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET.
"Oh, I do, too"
"Oh, I do, too,"
"but I just seem to, to miss a lot of these programs."
I don't know why.
"I just,"
"if I can catch them, I do. Or if I remember."
"Well, there's very few that, you know, my life would stop if I didn't catch."
"But, uh, now I do,"
"before I go to work, I tape my soap opera."
"Oh, yeah."
I watch one
"and,"
"Well, I watch two,"
but one's a half-hour
and one's an hour
"and, and they lead into each other."
Oh.
And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS.
"Oh, okay."
"And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl"
"Yeah,"
that's been on for years.
"So it's just, you know,"
"it's, it's, something I've done for the last probably twenty-five years."
"Oh, and so you get to come home and watch them"
"Yes,"
"and I don't have anyone else at home,"
so I have freedom to watch whatever I want.
Yeah.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But I like, I like every, I like the, uh, the information shows"
and I like the comedies
"and you know, and I, I do like good movies."
Uh-huh.
"I prescribed, subscribe to H B O."
Yeah
"well, we,"
So I can get some of the movies.
"Yeah,"
that's a good idea.
"We did have H B O,"
"but it, we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, you know."
It is.
"It's just,"
But I don't sleep a whole lot
"and I, you know,"
"at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V"
"and,"
Oh.
"Oh, yes,"
if you're up then
and you don't get good reception without cable
"and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels,"
Yeah.
Right.
so that's primarily why I have it right now.
Right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"and, uh,"
"Oh yeah,"
that's right.
"It, it might have one best picture, too."
Yes
"it did,"
yes
it did.
Yeah.
"Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman, uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise."
"That was,"
"yeah,"
"I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,"
"but, uh."
"Yes,"
"uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman."
"Yeah,"
"it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff."
Yeah
"and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just forty-five miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton."
Oh.
"Is, is the Kmart there?"
"Oh, we do have Kmart here,"
you better believe it.
Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?
"That was, that was so funny,"
"he had to,"
or was it Kmart.
Yes.
He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.
"Right,"
right
"Yeah,"
"But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that."
"Oh yeah,"
"yeah,"
we like that.
Yeah.
"That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too."
Yeah.
"My son's getting to be a, a real good cook"
"so, uh,"
"Oh, neat."
sometimes he fixes me breakfast
"Oh, wow, that's great"
"Yeah,"
"I like it,"
I like it a lot.
How old is he?
He's eleven.
"Eleven,"
"wow, that's good."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
so
Do you cook like you cook a breakfast every morning
"or,"
"Uh, not every morning, uh,"
mostly during the summer it's hit and miss
"and, we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Um, during the during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son."
Um. What kind of
"It's, uh,  It's, uh, it's, uh, plywood, uh, face, I guess."
pine?
But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
"and then I painted, uh, about eight different, uh, colors, uh, you know,"
"the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard"
Uh-huh.
I guess he's young.
"and then,"
yes
He's about five and a half years old.
"Oh, he'll be delighted."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Now I just have to finish it though.
"I got, uh, it got delayed for a little bit and, uh, because of work"
"and now, uh, I've got to jump back in and finish the,"
"because I've got it all cut out,"
"it's all, uh,"
I've done most of the coloring
but I've got to go a second layer with the yellow.
Did you do it with a jigsaw
"or do you have powered, you know, a,"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, I did, uh, jigsaw, uh, and the, uh, regular straight saw for some of it."
Um.
So yeah.
"to do the, uh, the turn cut."
"Uh, how about yourself?"
"Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking."
I don't have lots of tools.
Uh-huh.
"and the, the, the, third daughter fell in love with, uh, uh, Vermont."
Vermont.
"So,"
So they wanted to make their homes there.
"Yeah,"
that's where they've gone to make their homes.
My goodness.
"Are they, are those two married?"
No.
"They, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?"
"Well, uh, let's see,"
"yeah,"
"I guess you'd say J R is working, going to trying to go to school."
Uh-huh.
I wish to God he would go back.
"Oh, they do. Especially if they, if they're meant to, I think."
Yeah.
"Well, I certainly hope so."
"I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T"
"and I'm, I'm going to U T A right now myself"
so it's never too late.
Uh-huh.
"Well, it's, oh, I agree it's never too late."
Right.
"And,"
"Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students."
"Yeah,"
"and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up."
"Oh, yeah,"
I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties
Uh-huh.
"There is, course, the the Grand Canyon"
"and, uh, the Painted Desert is, is real pretty, in a different sort of way."
Yes.
"And, course, the, the Sequoias and the Redwoods and and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone"
"and, uh, the Grand Tetons are gorgeous, too."
I imagine.
"Yeah,"
I would imagine they are.
"Course, I, I guess I'm partial to big tree country."
Yeah.
I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now
"I think it's called a job,"
I don't know
"Uh, not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there?"
No
not around here.
Oh.
Not around here
Place is forested with with those concrete trees.
"Uh-huh,"
"lot, lot of concrete and glass, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, I guess that's God's place, too."
"Anyway, Uh, what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping?"
Yeah.
"Uh, probably the, the last one that I went to California"
"I took, uh, three weeks."
Three weeks.
And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks.
"Yeah,"
"the whole family, then, was in on this?"
Uh-huh.
"It worked out particularly well, especially considering she was, what, six months pregnant."
Uh-huh.
"So I don't know,"
it worked pretty well.
"It was one of those, uh, those, dome type pop up tents."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Nice and quick and easy to put up.
Yeah.
Packs away nice and small
"and, about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto."
"Well, that's true,"
that's true.
It was a lot of fun.
"I guess the last real, uh, camping trip I took was, has been a couple years ago."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Uh, I went to California up to the Sequoias."
"Wow,"
that's got to be beautiful territory.
"Yeah,"
"it's gorgeous,"
I love the big trees.
"Just, just the drive up through, uh, up the coast line and then cut over in, into the, into the parks, it's gorgeous, though."
Yeah.
"What, like, Sequoia National Park?"
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I had been there before when I lived in California,"
"but that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe"
Yeah.
That's what my mother said one time.
"You know, right,"
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays.
Right.
"No,"
"that's true,"
"and if they force them to, you know that's not good either."
Yeah.
That becomes a drudgery
"Well, do they all live in the area?"
"got, of the six, we've got four around here."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, wow."
"Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas."
Uh-huh.
"And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont"
Golly.
"and the other one is in Everett, Washington."
How did they end up so far away?
"Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair. And my second marriage."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh,"
Those are the youngest ones?
"Yeah,"
"well, the"
"the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the of the, of the, uh, six are the two that are scattered like that."
Uh-huh.
"Boy, that's, those are a long way."
"And, Well, they wanted to go, uh,"
"How,"
"J R, my, my, my last son or my middle son, excuse me, fell in love with Washington state"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
It's nice.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life."
Uh-huh.
Around in Texas
"and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.
"I'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do."
I know.
"I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that."
"Uh, tell me where that is, uh,"
Okay.
"I, I probably do know,"
"Uh, you,"
but I don't know it by that name.
"This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross."
Okay.
Sure.
"We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake."
"Oh, okay,"
"yeah,"
I know that area.
"That's a nice area. Oh, that's quite a range."
"Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area."
"Uh, my particular,"
"I guess they want us to describe the area,"
"so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million."
"Yes,"
"uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller."
"Yep, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself."
I have in the past.
"I haven't done recently,"
"but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals."
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?
"Uh, just at home."
Uh-huh.
"I, I enjoyed the food"
"and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,"
and I've been following through on that.
"When you find the right cookbook, why it works out."
Uh-huh.
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?
"Okay,"
"well, that one's a good question."
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it
"Oh, boy."
"I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
"But we enjoy trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant."
One of this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.
"Uh, it's a paperback"
and I think it's by someone named Chang.
"Yeah,"
Isabelle Chang.
"Okay,"
"thanks for that, uh, reference."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Okay,"
Gene
"So, it's nice to talk with you"
"and, um, food is a very intriguing thing."
"Our lives are, are built around foods that we like and, nutritionally good for us."
"Yes, sir."
What kind of dining out do you like?
"Well, there is two kinds."
"One I guess I'd say is with my wife where we enjoy, uh oh, I guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant."
Oh.
"Uh, you know, something nice."
Yeah.
"And the other is with my whole family whom we, uh, go somewhere that the kids will enjoy"
"Uh, recently we have been hitting Pancho's up."
It's a local Mexican restaurant.
Uh-huh.
"because they have got a good rate on, you know, good prices and everything."
"Pancho's, that's,  a new one."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it's a chain down uh,"
it goes up into Colorado and down here.
I don't know where else it is.
What about you?
We have one called Chi Chi's in in our area.
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, we had a restaurant called La Bamba"
"but it's just, it closed recently."
"But Chi Chi's is a national restaurant, I think."
Isn't it Mexican?
"I think,  think it might be."
"yeah,"
"I see what you're saying,"
"there's less character development, rather just the, the, the funniness of the gag,  rather than"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Did you go with kids though?
"and how it fits with the character , right."
Did you go with kids?
Excuse me?
Did you take kids along?
"No,"
"we went, uh, without the kids,"
"it's was a night out, away from the children."
"Oh, I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them. especially to come home"
Oh.
"and, you know, I would have gotten in trouble the next day,"
I'm sure.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"I, I was thinking about that too,"
"I saw that, um,"
"that's why I watched another silly movie, um, um, with my cousin, was uh, uh, the one about the, um, the turtles,"
"Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES."
Right
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"I saw that with my cousin, just to see what, you know, what the kids are into"
"And your cousin's a kid,"
"and that is,"
"yeah,"
he's a little
"Okay,"
what kind of dinner parties have you had?
"Well, I've had them, uh, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and I had help with them."
"Uh, and part of them I did were like a buffet"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it,"
"I had, uh, just different, uh, side dishes and appetizers"
"and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, uh, some, uh, sausage hors d'oeuvres"
"and, uh, anyhow, uh, you take, uh, a couple of, uh, cups of Bisquick and, uh, sausage, oh, like a, a Owens mild,"
Uh-huh.
"you can, I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to."
"Whatever you like, huh?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh, you put that in"
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy
Uh-huh.
"and then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes"
Um.
and they are so good.
"Oh, that sounds delicious."
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's making me hungry for them right now.
Yeah.
"You know, I've made like little Swedish meatballs,"
"but they're just made out of the beef, you know. And, uh, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick."
Have you?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Okay,"
"well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well"
"Okay,"
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
"Uh, not too bad really."
"Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it,"
but I got it anyway
"and, uh, it was a Braun"
and they were real good about taking it back.
"It wasn't a problem at all,"
"so, uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I really haven't returned a whole lot lately.
Have you?
I haven't had to.
"It's, uh, the,"
"every so often,"
"I mean, I, I, I'm almost pushing it myself."
Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's
and it shrinks too much
"and say, well, I should have known better,"
"I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's"
Um.
and it was probably made in China by slaves.
Right
"But, uh, they, uh,"
"most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff."
Yeah.
"I think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized"
Right
"like,"
"in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania"
Uh-huh.
Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown.
Uh-huh
"Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting."
"So it's really up north in the country, really, ."
"Yeah,"
I guess so.
yeah.
"It's,"
"well, um, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far."
Gosh.
I see.
"So,"
It's pretty nice country up there?
"Oh, it's beautiful."
"Hills, or what?"
"Uh, well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, uh,  type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops."
Uh-huh
Is it farmland?
"Um, not a lot of farmland there."
"Mostly it's, uh,"
"I mean, you know, there's, you know, individuals with their own, own uh, growing their own food."
"Uh, most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, uh, sheep and cattle."
"Oh, yes."
"And even that's, you know, small time mostly."
Sure.
"Uh, the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, uh, industry."
Uh-huh.
It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.
"wait a minute,"
we bought one in ninety.
"We've got three cars, of all things."
Uh-huh.
"So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan."
Okay.
What kind do you have now?
"Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,"
"we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have"
Uh-huh.
"and then, of course, we look into the prices."
Yeah.
"And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted"
"because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time."
"Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"So, uh,"
And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,"
"and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they, they, uh,"
"I've been extremely,"
we've had three Mazdas.
We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles."
"uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years"
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas.
Oh.
"Uh, so, uh, the first foreign car that we had was a, a seventy-seven M G, M G B"
"Oh the,"
"Was British racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top."
"Ooh, boy."
"And, uh, I drove it mostly."
I'll bet it was hard to part with that.
"And,"
"Yeah,"
it really was.
My husband was in the Air Force
and we got transferred to Okinawa.
Oh.
"So, uh, we had to sell it."
which really tore me up
"Oh, yeah."
"Because, uh, it, it it was great fun."
"And then, uh, when we got to Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand,"
"we, uh, we decided that, uh,"
"we had this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile"
"and it, and it was just too big,"
"so we, we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States"
"and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan."
Oh.
So what do you think about caring for older folks Dale?
"Well, I think, uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for."
Uh-huh.
They've got a lot of special needs
"and at the same time, uh, the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have."
"Right,"
Right.
"Well ,"
"You know, and also, the whole, whole thing with noise."
"My mother, oh, she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, we we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had, uh, Brittany Spaniels"
"and they're very high strung animals to begin with,"
"but, uh,"
Okay.
How do you get your news mostly?
"Generally, I get most of my news from, uh, the radio."
"And then sometimes, uh, if I've got time, I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper  and just fall off on the articles that I like."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, also, since my wife likes to watch T V, sometimes, uh, having just being there I get, uh, you know, I have to watch the news late at night with T V."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come."
Uh-huh
So that's the first thing I want is the headlines.
"It's really funny because because, uh, uh, my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines"
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and then when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news."
Um.
It's really weird.
"Uh, I don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long."
"But, uh, I love to watch the five o'clock news"
"and I, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper"
Um.

Félix Torres Amat or Félix Torres i Amat de Palou (6 August 1772 – 29 December 1849) was a Spanish Bishop. He translated the Sagrada Bible into vernacular Spanish and published a record of leading authors in Catalan.
"Torres Amat was born in Barcelona in 1772 the son of Joseph Torres and Teresa Amat. He studied languages before joining his uncle Felix Amat in Tarragona where he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy. He then taught philosophy, mathematics and theology becoming Canon of the Collegiate Church of San Ildefonso on 5 May 1806."
In 1824 he published a translation of the Bible in vernacular Spanish which had been entrusted to him by the Spanish kings Carlos IV and Fernando VII. This caused some criticism as both he and his father had become associated with Jansenism and he had to retire to a monastery for some time. On 1 May 1834 he was ordained as the Bishop of Astorga and in the following year he met William Harris Rule from Gibraltar as they both shared a common interest in distributing the bible in people's first languages. Torres Amat had had difficulty publishing his translation and he had relied on money from Anglicans in London.
"Torres Amat was elected to the prestigious Real Academia Española where he briefly held the ""T Seat"". Torres Amat's bible known as the Sagrada Bible was published with illustrations by Gustave Doré."
"Apart from the translation of the bible his best known work is ""Reports to help form a critical dictionary of Catalan writers and give some idea of the ancient and modern literature of Catalonia"" This was based on the work of his brother who had been a leading librarian in Barcelona and he had started to record notable Catalan authors."

"Thomas Ellis was born in Ireland but left for British Columbia when he was nineteen. In January 1865, Ellis sailed for British Columbia and arrived in Victoria in March 1865. It was in the late 1860s that Ellis began to accumulate large acreages in the South Okanagan. His original holding had 642.35 acres and was located on a large piece of land in modern-day Penticton."
"Ellis returned to Ireland and married Wilhemina Wade on February 10, 1873. Ellis and his wife would have nine children together. Wilhemina would become well known for her nursing skills in the Okanagan."
"After his marriage, Ellis returned to the Okanagan and by the 1890s he had 20,000 heads of cattle and 31,000 acres of land from the South Okanagan all the way to the Canada–US border. Mining companies provided a good market for his beef. Although Ellis claimed all of that land as his own, much of the land that his cattle roamed on was not actually owned by him, but he built up his empire based on grazing rights."
"In the 1890s, Ellis arrived in the Mission Valley and purchased a pioneer ranch. Ellis' ranch had three stacks of premium hay in the yard. When he brought up his cattle he found two-thirds of his premium hay had burned. In the following investigation and trial, Arthur Booth (A.B.) Knox was found guilty of arson, although there was much doubt from early Kelowna residents as to whether he actually burned the hay."
"Ellis later entered into a partnership with Captain Thomas Shorts and he invested in Shorts' next business venture; a large ferry boat which was to be called the ""Penticton"". The boat only lasted a short time before Ellis and Thomas Shorts sold the boat to Leon Lequime for five thousand dollars in 1892."
"In the early half of the 1890s, Ellis started to think about selling his empire. He entered an agreement with the Penticton Townsite Company. he sold his land and it became part of the City of Penticton. Ellis also sold some of his land to Southern Okanagan Land Company who then sold to the Okanagan Falls Townsite for development."

Regional champions and, from 1925 onwards, runners-up played a series of playoff matches for the right to compete in a final game for the national championship. On 28 January 1900, a national association, the Deutscher Fussball-Bund (DFB) was founded in Leipzig with 86 member clubs. From the start, the DFB was – and still is – a federation of regional associations.

She became a child prostitute at the age of 12 while she was staying at a group home and an older girl there persuaded her to become a runaway in order to sell sex to a pedophile named Charlie. She had a son, Tanner, who developed cancer as an infant and died at the age of five with the dying wish that his mother get out of the sex industry. In 2000, she moved to Toronto from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. She is the stepmother of Angel, whose biological mother was Brenda Wolfe, one of Robert Pickton's murder victims. In 2009, Perrier accompanied Angel at Toronto's Native Women's Resource Centre for the Sisters in Spirit vigil in remembrance of Wolfe and the other more than 500 Canadian Aboriginal women who have been murdered or gone missing over the past 30 years. In 2010, Perrier picketed a courthouse in downtown Toronto in recognition of International Day of No Prostitution.

Perrier opposed the legalization of brothels as proposed in ""Bedford v. Canada"", saying, ""Having a legal bawdy house is not going to make it any safer. You are still going to attract serial killers, rapists, perverts."" Bridget shared her story in the ground breaking article by Dr. Vincent J.

Artists who have produced Brain Multiples with Butler include John Baldessari, Rachel Khedoori, Paul McCarthy, Jorge Pardo, Philippe Parreno, Jason Rhoades, Katy Schimert, Diana Thater and Rirkrit Tiravanija, among others."
"The original incarnation of 1301PE was as 1301, which was located at Butler’s apartment, 1301 Franklin Street, Santa Monica, CA. The founding principle was to present world class exhibitions of artists primarily based in Los Angeles. The first show at 1301 was ""Raw Material"" by Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler, which opened on 29 April 1992. Shows at 1301 featured work by artists Jamey Bair, Angela Bulloch, Meg Cranston, Sarah Seager and Thaddeus Strode, as well as a group show called ""Into the Lapse"" which presented video work by artists General Idea, Sean Landers, Jim Shaw, Diana Thater, Bruce and Norman Yonemoto and others."
"In 1996, 1301 became 1310PE, standing for Projects and Editions.

= = = Thomas Rede = = =
"Thomas Rede (c. 1390– c. 1455) was a merchant, landholder, knight and public official of Roche Castle near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire."
"He was the son of William Rede and Jonet Wirriot. His father was born about 1370, the bastard son of Thomas Rede, a wealthy merchant of Carmarthen and Bristol. His mother was the daughter of Sir Wilcock Wirriot of Orielton in Pembrokeshire."
"Thomas was closely associated with Gruffudd ap Nicholas, a powerful figure in South Wales in the mid-15th century, as well as being Thomas’ father-in-law. In 1446 Thomas and Gruffudd farmed part of Cockmill in Carmarthen, and in 1449 they were involved together in a lease of the town. While not nearly as prominent in politics as his father-in-law, father or grandfather, Thomas did serve as beadle in Widigada from 1451 to 1452, and he was apparently knighted."
"Thomas married as his second wife Margred Dwnn, the cousin of his first wife, and daughter of another prominent Carmarthenshire family. By these two wives, and others, he had at least nine children."
"Thomas Rede, knight, was buried in Grey Friars church in Carmarthen, along with his father-in-law Gruffudd ap Nicholas and other members of the family. Thomas’ tomb lay on the south side of the choir. His coat of arms is described as: “Thomas Rede of Ye Roche -- quarterly, argent 3 pipes (elsewhere reeds) in fess, banded azure; and on a chief azure a lion passant sable.” The quartered coat of arms is for Wirriot, his mother’s family."
"Thomas’ principal estate was The Roche, near Talacharn (Laugharne) in Carmarthenshire, which appears on maps today as the ruin of Roche Castle. Later heralds in England rendered it “Rodes Court,” undoubtedly due to the confusion of the distance of time and place."
"The Roche was originally known as Machrells Walles, built in the 13th century by John de la Roche. Over the course of the ensuing century the property passed from one family member to another until in 1392 it came into the possession of David Fleming, who immediately granted it to Sir Thomas Fleming, knight and other Irish land owners. Subsequently, according to a successful 16th-century petition of James Reede, gentleman of London it became the property of Gruffudd Nicholas (Gruffudd ap Nicholas) and Thomas Nicholas, who granted it to William Rede and Jonet Wirriot as part of their marriage settlement."
"Decades later, in 1439, perhaps at the death of William who would have been 69 years old, Richard Rede conveyed the property to Thomas Nicoll (Thomas ap Gruffudd ap Nicholas?), “as of the gift of William Rede brother of the said Richard”. A conveyance by fine implies an agreed exchange, so it may have been by previous agreement that Thomas Nicoll conveyed Machrells Walles to William’s son, Richard. In 1452 Richard Rede, esquire and his wife Maud transferred Machrells Walles and other properties by quitclaim to Richard’s brother, Thomas Rede, esquire. The Roche remained in the family for an additional 120 years until James Rede sold it to Sir John Perrot in 1572."

Their sizes vary from 4 MiB (32 Mibit, such as ""Automobili Lamborghini"" and ""Dr. Mario 64"") to 64 MiB (512 Mibit, such as ""Resident Evil 2"" and ""Conker's Bad Fur Day""). The Game Pak's design tradeoffs were intended to achieve maximal system speed and minimal system cost, with a lesser storage space and a higher unit cost per game."
"Launched in 1996, the Nintendo 64 was the last major home console to use a cartridge as its primary storage format until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Portable systems such as the PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS also use cartridges."
"Nintendo's data storage strategy with the Nintendo 64 had always been to develop a complementary higher-capacity peripheral to accompany the Nintendo 64 Game Pak. This strategy resulted in 1999's 64DD, an aftermarket peripheral which was launched years late and only in Japan as a commercial failure, leaving the Game Pak as the Nintendo 64's sole storage medium."
"To complement the company's two previous high-speed cartridge-based console generations, Nintendo had already developed high-capacity secondary storage devices such as the Famicom Disk System and the cancelled SNES-CD. The company had always intended to do likewise with this generation. In a 1994 interview, Nintendo summarized its analysis of the continued advantages of cartridges for its upcoming console, eventually known as the Nintendo 64."
Even the main dimensions of the two UIC standard wagons are identical with those of the open goods wagons (Fcs and Fals):
"The wagons are normally reserved for one type of commodity in order to avoid having to clean them after use, but also because certain goods require the loading space to be lined in order to avoid them sticking to the walls or, with chemicals, to protect the walls from corrosion. Many Td wagons are exclusively used for the transport of foodstuffs and therefore bear the index letter ""g""."
"In addition there are special types for specific purposes, for example those with low-level apertures for gravity discharging (Class ""T…oo…"")."
"The distinction with UIC Class U wagons is fluid. Especially when wagons do not conform to the UIC standard wagon or only have a roof hatch for loading instead of a movable roof, they count as special wagons. Many French grain wagons therefore have a 9 instead of a 0 in their wagon numbers."
