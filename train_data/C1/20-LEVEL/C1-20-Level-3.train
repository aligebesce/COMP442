"No that were my mistake, which er, is a genuine mistake, I mean sh you paid me two quid, as I say, I don't know who's whose now"
And then you

Tracey didn't pay that did she?
No.
Tracey didn't pay.
"But I took Li Tracey's book in  and probably I've seen the Tracey and marked it down there you see  on Tracey's instead of Linda's, which, I mean that's a genuine mistake int it?"
"Well, who put that"

Cos I gotta get booze and food and all that stuff in.
"So, Andy's gonna hire a video camera  to, to film er  Stuart and Phil, and that stuff."
"Mm, yeah,."
Right any other future events that ought to be mentioned.
"Erm, I suppose I don't know whether we ought, whether we should mention it here, erm, the, the National A G M is a future event really isn't it?"
"Yes,."

Three last year.
"Yes, erm, and, and we, were prepared to subsidise as far as our finances would allow, you know people who are going, but Ex Exeter is quite a long way, so the travel is going to be something isn't it?"

What did Shrimpy do on Friday night?
"Oh, he told Richard  Richard  that he was, he was gonna se , he wanted to smack Pete's face in!"
Oh yeah!
So what did Richard do?
"Course, Richard who keeps everything to himself !"
Richard  not known as Mersey Tunnel Gob  or anything !
Oh dear  !
Oh dear I couldn't believe it though!
I mean that is sad!
Ahhh no!
I can't believe it!
But  Pete reckoned it was because like  cos like  Pete's seeing Susan
Mm.
and like
Then he was with you.
and he was with me
Yeah.
and he reckoned Pete was a total bastard and everything!
Even though he doesn't know Susan he a
Yeah.
"he reckons  Pete's cheating on Susan, he's been really bad to Helena as well he's just using them and all"
Yeah.
this business.
"But, in a way I mean like, I thought that as well, but then I thought  well that's stupid that is because  you weren't as  as bad as Pete was were you?"
"I mean, let's face it"
"I mean, who's taking advantage of him"
"You were ta , you were taking advantage, not him!"
"I mean, on both times it's been me taking advantage of him, it really"
Yeah.
because
I mean he
he's been  both times and I haven't.
"Oh yeah, oh that's what that bird."
Yuk.
"And our Colin was to be off t' fair, and that, so, me dad sort of went on to our John and pushed our Colin out a little bit."
Yeah.
"But er, me and our Colin's never been me mum's favourite."
It's always been our Margaret.
"Mind you, did you see that photo that"
Yeah.
"You are, I mean, I could just work out,I said, your Margaret and John are a lot like you."
"She is  'cos she's got Margaret's lips and your nose, but out of all of you, I think your your Jo you can see your John in it, can't you, more than anybody."
"I always think our John looks more like a Prescott, 'cos he al every time I see him, I see me Uncle Bill more and more."
"Yeah, John  used to say, years ago about how much that you're, John looks like your Brian, and I don't think he looks anything like it."
"No, I don't."
"And she  again now, she says like somebody  your John look like that bloke next door."
"What a load of rubbish, I thought well."
No.
He looks more and more
Aye.
our Colin's getting more and more like me dad.
"Well, Brian  ain't it."
"Brian , Brian I think don't like, er,"
"they are, they're all like that."
All of them.
And I think our John looks like me Uncle Bill.
"Yeah, I think he does."
"But then again, he did look like that photo, I think he does look like that photo, but you were younger then,"
Yeah.
but he does look like Uncle Bill.
Mind you  Colin's getting more like your dad every day.
I know he is.
"black welding glasses on, and he turned round and he made me jump."
"Like oh, Colin, and then he go like this, you know,isn't it."
Aah!
"I just don't know what was wrong with it, I've work, Jason said  Ja we a subject turned to what he wore in bed  Ja and Jason said nothing, right  but he said when it's winter I wear my t-shirt and the pants  and I cuddle up to my  glow worm   and we was all taking the mickey out of his glow worm, right  so I've come home and I read the paper and I'll see glow worm in it, so I cut it out and give it to him and he stuck it up  in the factory !"
So every time everybody goes past and goes   how's your glow worm boy today   and takes the mickey out of him!
Mm.
"I said, and Roy was being rude though  cos I said to Roy, I said, haven't you got a glow worm, he said no mine's got eyes on the end of it!"
"Mine don't light up,it's got eyes on the end of it !"
What did our Jason say?
"Stroke him nicely, her nicely  whatever it is."

That's a nose.
Coco the clown.
"mummy, mummy!"

Woooh!

Tell mummy.
I said yeah but I mean
"But there was to be  Norman Lamont and a tr and treasury ministers, three or four of them."
"And there was to be the big industrialists, three or four of them."
Same as labour was done the other day.
But the tories
but the tories have scrapped agreed plans claiming the panel is not politically balanced.
The B B C two programme is regularly pr presented by Peter Jay who's Panorama Special on the slump was controversially axed last week .
"They're not willing to stand up  see erm  er what's it, Richard Dimbleby  was it Richard  or the other one?"
Was
Jonathon.
Richard's dead.
"No the boy, the other boy."
"Jonathon, Dick"
No.
What's his name?
The other boy.
There's two boys alive.
David?
Mm.
I don't know one from the other  by name.
"But the one was at him yesterday and he, well he didn't know what to say next."
He did quiz him.
That's David.
Is it?
On a Sunday.
"Well  And, and er  Lamont even said  that er unemployment would get higher."
He even said so yesterday
Can't get no bloody higher can it?
Oh it could.
Twenty two percent VAT if the tories get back.
Mm.
Jobless er tory jobless figures were exposed yesterday as a fraud.
The official unemployment total of  two  two million six hundred  and four thousand one hundred  is more than a million short of the real figure  because the tories have found  thirty ways not to count jobless people .
it's a road that goes through there to Swingdale Road  and there's a little place in there.
Little blue and white wooden hut.
Mhm.
It was.
I dunno.
Over  my uncle er  old Harry   he had a house around Clarendon Road  er  oh I dunno!
There wasn't many houses there at that time.
Mm mm.
We built our house there.
Mm?
Erm  it was meant to be the oldest house in erm  Broadstone
Ah?
"and we built our hou , not, bought the plot of land and built our own house on it."
"Well  old Harry  shared with my uncle  he had his house and he bought a piece of land on the bottom of his garden  and he built wall on  his  or this piece along the bottom of his garden, but er  I couldn't tell you, it wasn't very far up the road."
But er  yeah I know.
But I haven't been up to cla Clarendon Road for some time now.
Er  ha!
"There used to be a  a house on the end of the common up at Clarendon Road, the opposite side  oh!"
"Er  old Mrs   I dunno, but th , anyway there was  only this one old house up in the common and er  I went up there one time with  horse and   take a couple of pigs from there down to Wimborne market."
But I suppose the old house has pulled down under pressure and built on now but  that was the only house going up through there in them days.
That was a very old house!
Wimborne market's supposed to be old.
Mm?
Wimborne market must be very old!
"Oh Lord, yes!"
"Course  we , Wimborne cattle market is finished now isn't it?"
I went to a cattle market in
Mm.
Devon
Mm.
with my aunt.
Ah yeah.
Because I'm because John Gummer's responsibilities extend a long way into things like housing and stuff as well don't they?
Whereas Robert Atkins has more specific responsibility perhaps for getting this area.
People of one
I don't know that's what I imagine.
people of one  of the environment and the other's Secretary of State for the Environment.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
It's just bizarre rules of procedure.
There are more Ministers of State that there are Secretaries of State.
Yeah.
To be honest I think we should be grateful they don't have to have the court magician come in
Wave their wand and recite the Lords Prayer.
Fair enough.
I assumed there would be a reason  assume there was going to be a good reason.
Erm so who else was on your  list of people we ought to write to
South East Cambridgeshire who's the Parl Parliamentary Secretary to John Gummer.
Who's the sorry your  and I can't
Sorry.
Erm
Garry  was Robert Atkins
Parliamentary Private Secretary.
And
And
And James Paice  P A I C E
P A I C E
Yes.
Of
MP for South East Cambridgeshire  and he's P P S to John Gummer.
and these people are erm unpaid helpers to Ministers and Secretaries of State it says here.
Unpaid.
So
They're they're the eyes and ears of their boss and they have to report any political pressure so we have to  find something for them  to report basically.
Who's the nineteen ninety three Channel Four racing personality of the year?
It is  Mary Reevley who polled twenty percent.
Just as successful on the flat or over jumps I think this is a very very worthy winner our congratulations to Mary Reevley and I'm gonna get her on the show and present the prize to her.
If we get her on the show that really will be something cos I know she's shy but well done.
Ling Dell can be proud of her up in  North Yorkshire.
"Charity bets twenty five pounds and we came down in the car from Newmarket she had the she had the post out the light everything, now what's what's it going on?"
Exactly.
"I've not, Alastair accused me of being topical because of a member of the royal family this week this is not the reason but I've gone for Leotard in the one twenty five at Cheltenham."
Could  a lot fitter than it did
ah
I love it.
Oakes what are you going for?
Mm.
Ballasarly I'm going for.
Ballasarly?
There's a slight I mean over hurdles there's a doubt about his stamina
Mm.
but erm he won at  a huge long was it the er Queen Alexandra
Yeah.
at Royal Ascot erm so that I'm confident he will stay and Mr Pipe is not dead yet.
That's true.
And Alastair what do you fancy?
What's your ?
Er Front Street in a small race at Nottingham.
Small prize big chance.
Cor blimey.
I haven't heard of that one.
General Pershing is the one to be on at the big race.
That's mine let's check it out.
"Oakes is going for Ballasarly in the two thirty five Cheltenham, Leslie's going for Leotard that's the top weight in the first at one twenty five  er oh in the second."
"Alastair's going for Front Street at Nottingham number five in the two twenty, Thomo's going for General Pershing in the two o'clock at Cheltenham."
Picture puzzle.
"I promised to care for you as far as Holywood , and , by the rood , Jack , y ' are more capable to care for me . ''"
"`` Well , Dick , we 're friends now , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I never was unfriends , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Y ' are a brave lad in your way , albeit something of a milksop , too ."
I never met your like before this day .
"But , prithee , fetch back your breath , and let us on ."
Here is no place for chatter . ''
"`` My foot hurts shrewdly , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I had forgot your foot , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Well , we must go the gentlier ."
I would I knew rightly where we were .
"I have clean lost the path ; yet that may be for the better , too ."
"An they watch the ferry , they watch the path , belike , as well ."
I would Sir Daniel were back with two score men ; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind sweeps leaves .
"Come , Jack , lean ye on my shoulder , ye poor shrew ."
"Nay , y ' are not tall enough ."
"What age are ye , for a wager ?"
-- twelve ? ''
"`` Nay , I am sixteen , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are poorly grown to height , then , '' answered Dick ."
`` But take my hand .
"We shall go softly , never fear ."
"I owe you a life ; I am a good repayer , Jack , of good or evil . ''"
They began to go forward up the slope .
"`` We must hit the road , early or late , '' continued Dick ; `` and then for a fresh start ."
By the mass !
"but y ' ` ave a rickety hand , Jack ."
"If I had a hand like that , I would think shame ."
"I tell you , '' he went on , with a sudden chuckle , `` I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for a maid . ''"
"`` Nay , never ! ''"
"cried the other , colouring high ."
"`` A ' did , though , for a wager ! ''"
John paled .
"` It is this , if we meet Hook in open fight , you must leave him to me . ' '"
"I promise , ' John said loyally ."
"For the moment they were feeling less eerie , because Tink was flying with them , and in her light they could distinguish each other ."
"Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they , and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo ."
"Wendy quite liked it , until Peter pointed out the drawback ."
"` She tells me , ' he said , ` that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came , and got Long Tom out . '"
` The big gun ? '
` Yes .
"And of course they must see her light , and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly . '"
` Wendy ! '
` John ! '
` Michael ! '
"` Tell her to go away at once , Peter , ' the three cried simultaneously , but he refused ."
"` She thinks we have lost the way , ' he replied stiffly , ` and she is rather frightened ."
You do n't think I would send her away all by herself when she is frightened ! '
"For a moment the circle of light was broken , and something gave Peter a loving little pinch ."
"` Then tell her , ' Wendy begged , ` to put out her light . '"
` She ca n't put it out .
That is about the only thing fairies ca n't do .
"It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep , same as the stars . '"
"` Then tell her to sleep at once , ' John almost ordered ."
` She ca n't sleep except when she 's sleepy .
It is the only other thing fairies ca n't do . '
"` Seems to me , ' growled John , ` these are the only two things worth doing . '"
"Here he got a pinch , but not a loving one ."
"` If only one of us had a pocket , ' Peter said , ` we could carry her in it . '"
"However , they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them ."
He had a happy idea .
John 's hat !
Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand .
"John carried it , though she had hoped to be carried by Peter ."
"A creek ran up to meet the path , and close under the bank the ferryman 's hut lay snugly ."
"It was of wattle and clay , and the grass grew green upon the roof ."
Dick went to the door and opened it .
"Within , upon a foul old russet cloak , the ferryman lay stretched and shivering ; a great hulk of a man , but lean and shaken by the country fever ."
"`` Hey , Master Shelton , '' he said , `` be ye for the ferry ?"
"Ill times , ill times !"
Look to yourself .
There is a fellowship abroad .
Ye were better turn round on your two heels and try the bridge . ''
"`` Nay ; time 's in the saddle , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Time will ride , Hugh Ferryman ."
I am hot in haste . ''
`` A wilful man ! ''
"returned the ferryman , rising ."
"`` An ye win safe to the Moat House , y ' have done lucky ; but I say no more . ''"
"And then catching sight of Matcham , `` Who be this ? ''"
"he asked , as he paused , blinking , on the threshold of his cabin ."
"`` It is my kinsman , Master Matcham , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Give ye good day , good ferryman , '' said Matcham , who had dismounted , and now came forward , leading the horse ."
"`` Launch me your boat , I prithee ; we are sore in haste . ''"
The gaunt ferryman continued staring .
`` By the mass ! ''
"he cried at length , and laughed with open throat ."
"Matcham coloured to his neck and winced ; and Dick , with an angry countenance , put his hand on the lout 's shoulder ."
"`` How now , churl ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Fall to thy business , and leave mocking thy betters . ''"
"Hugh Ferryman grumblingly undid his boat , and shoved it a little forth into the deep water ."
"Then Dick led in the horse , and Matcham followed ."
"`` Ye be mortal small made , master , '' said Hugh , with a wide grin ; `` something o ' the wrong model , belike ."
"Nay , Master Shelton , I am for you , '' he added , getting to his oars ."
`` A cat may look at a king .
"`` Lion-driver , '' she said , at length , `` ye do not admire a maid in a man 's jerkin ? ''"
The moon was now up ; and they were only waiting to repose the wearied horses .
"By the moon 's light , the still penitent but now well-fed Richard beheld her looking somewhat coquettishly down upon him ."
"`` Madam '' -- he stammered , surprised at this new turn in her manners ."
"`` Nay , '' she interrupted , `` it skills not to deny ; Joanna hath told me , but come , Sir Lion-driver , look at me -- am I so homely -- come ! ''"
And she made bright eyes at him .
"`` Ye are something smallish , indeed '' -- began Dick ."
"And here again she interrupted him , this time with a ringing peal of laughter that completed his confusion and surprise ."
`` Smallish ! ''
she cried .
"`` Nay , now , be honest as ye are bold ; I am a dwarf , or little better ; but for all that -- come , tell me !"
"-- for all that , passably fair to look upon ; is ' t not so ? ''"
"`` Nay , madam , exceedingly fair , '' said the distressed knight , pitifully trying to seem easy ."
`` And a man would be right glad to wed me ? ''
she pursued .
"`` O , madam , right glad ! ''"
agreed Dick .
"`` Call me Alicia , '' said she ."
"`` Alicia , '' quoth Sir Richard ."
"`` Well , then , lion-driver , '' she continued , `` sith that ye slew my kinsman , and left me without stay , ye owe me , in honour , every reparation ; do ye not ? ''"
"`` I do , madam , '' said Dick ."
"`` Although , upon my heart , I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight 's blood . ''"
`` Would ye evade me ? ''
she cried .
"`` Madam , not so ."
"I have told you ; at your bidding , I will even turn me a monk , '' said Richard ."
"`` Then , in honour , ye belong to me ? ''"
she concluded .
"`` In honour , madam , I suppose '' -- began the young man ."
`` Go to ! ''
she interrupted ; `` ye are too full of catches .
"In honour do ye belong to me , till ye have paid the evil ? ''"
He wished she had not mentioned letters .
"` Do n't get any letters , ' he said contemptuously ."
` But your mother gets letters ? '
"` Do n't have a mother , ' he said ."
"Not only had he no mother , but he had not the slightest desire to have one ."
He thought them very overrated persons .
"Wendy , however , felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy . '"
"O Peter , no wonder you were crying , ' she said , and got out of bed and ran to him . '"
"I was n't crying about mothers , ' he said rather indignantly . '"
I was crying because I ca n't get my shadow to stick on .
"Besides , I was n't crying . '"
` It has come off ? '
` Yes . '
"Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor , looking so draggled , and she was frightfully sorry for Peter ."
` How awful ! '
"she said , but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap ."
How exactly like a boy !
"Fortunately she knew at once what to do ` It must be sewn on , ' she said , just a little patronisingly ."
` What 's sewn ? '
he asked .
` You 're dreadfully ignorant . '
"` No , I 'm not . '"
But she was exulting in his ignorance . '
"I shall sew it on for you , my little man , ' she said , though he was as tall as herself ; and she got out her housewife , and sewed the shadow on to Peter 's foot . '"
"I daresay it will hurt a little , ' she warned him ."
"` Oh , I sha n't cry , ' said Peter , who was already of opinion that he had never cried in his life ."
"And he clenched his teeth and did not cry ; and soon his shadow was behaving properly , though still a little creased ."
"` Perhaps I should have ironed it , ' Wendy said thoughtfully ; but Peter , boylike , was indifferent to appearances , and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee ."
"Alas , he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy ."
He thought he had attached the shadow himself .
"` How clever I am , ' he crowed rapturously , ` oh , the cleverness of me ! '"
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities .
"Just when it seemed absolutely finished , ` There 's no knocker on the door , ' he said ."
"They were very ashamed , but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe , and it made an excellent knocker ."
"Absolutely finished now , they thought ."
Not a bit of it .
"` There 's no chimney , ' Peter said ; ` we must have a chimney . '"
"` It certainly does need a chimney , ' said John importantly ."
This gave Peter an idea .
"He snatched the hat off John 's head , knocked out the bottom , and put the hat on the roof ."
"The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that , as if to say thank you , smoke immediately began to come out of the hat ."
Now really and truly it was finished .
Nothing remained to do but to knock .
"` All look your best , ' Peter warned them ; ` first impressions are awfully important . '"
He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are ; they were all too busy looking their best .
"He knocked politely ; and now the wood was as still as the children , not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell , who was watching from a branch and openly sneering ."
"What the boys were wondering was , would any one answer the knock ?"
"If a lady , what would she be like ?"
The door opened and a lady came out .
It was Wendy .
They all whipped off their hats .
"She looked properly surprised , and this was just how they had hoped she would look ."
` Where am I ? '
she said .
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in .
"` Wendy lady , ' he said rapidly , ` for you we built this house . '"
"` Oh , say you 're pleased , ' cried Nibs ."
"` Lovely , darling house , ' Wendy said , and they were the very words they had hoped she would say ."
"` And we are your children , ' cried the twins ."
"Then all went on their knees , and holding out their arms cried , ' O Wendy lady , be our mother . '"
` Ought I ? '
"Wendy said , all shining ."
"` Of course it 's frightfully fascinating , but you see I am only a little girl ."
I have no real experience . '
he cried .
"`` Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen ` lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that ."
"No , that 's your friends ."
"There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint ."
"Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint !"
"Barring rum , his match were never seen ."
"He were afraid of none , not he ; on ' y Silver -- Silver was that genteel . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . ''"
"`` Nay , mate , '' returned Ben , `` not you ."
"You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on ' y a boy , all told ."
"Now , Ben Gunn is fly ."
"Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going -- not rum would n't , till I see your born gen ` leman and gets it on his word of honour ."
"And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight -LRB- that 's what you 'll say -RRB- , a precious sight more confidence ' -- and then nips him . ''"
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness .
"`` And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim ."
Just wheer you found him today .
"And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone ."
Oh !
"And you 'll say this : ` Ben Gunn , ' says you , ` has reasons of his own . ' ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I believe I understand ."
"You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you ."
Is that all ? ''
`` And when ?
"says you , '' he added ."
"`` Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . ''"
"`` Good , '' said I , `` and now may I go ? ''"
`` You wo n't forget ? ''
he inquired anxiously .
"`` Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you ."
Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man .
"Well , then '' -- still holding me -- `` I reckon you can go , Jim ."
"And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ?"
"The front door stood hospitably open , flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks ."
"Harrington paused on the step , with his hand outstretched to knock ."
Somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing .
"Forgetting all about knocking , he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sitting-room ."
Bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but Harrington did not see him .
"He was looking at Mary Hayden , who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them ."
She was crying softly in a hopeless fashion .
Harrington put down his strawberries .
`` Mary ! ''
he exclaimed .
"Mrs. Hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him , her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
said Harrington anxiously .
`` Is anything wrong ? ''
"`` Oh , nothing much , '' Said Mrs. Hayden , trying to recover herself ."
"`` Yes , there is too ."
But it is very foolish of me to be going on like this .
I did n't know anyone was near .
And I was feeling so discouraged .
The colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and Hiram had to shoot him .
It was Ted 's colt .
"But there , there is no use in crying over it . ''"
"And by way of proving this , the poor , tired , overburdened little woman began to cry again ."
She was past caring whether Harrington saw her or not .
The woman-hater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous .
He sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley .
"`` Do n't cry , Mary ."
Listen to me .
You were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry .
You ought to be looked after and petted .
I want you to marry me and then everything will be all right .
I 've loved you ever since that day I came over here and made you cry .
I asked .
`` Do ? ''
"said Melissa , snappishly ."
"`` Why , stay here till Isaac Appleby comes out and takes that brute away ?"
What else can we do ? ''
`` What if he is n't at home ? ''
I suggested .
`` We 'll stay here till he comes home .
"Oh , this is a nice predicament ."
This is what comes of cushioning churches ! ''
"`` It might be worse , '' I said comfortingly ."
`` Suppose the roof had n't been flat ? ''
"`` Call Isaac , '' said Melissa shortly ."
"I did n't fancy calling Isaac , but call him I did , and when that failed to bring him Melissa condescended to call , too ; but scream as we might , no Isaac appeared , and that dog sat there and smiled internally ."
"`` It 's no use , '' said Melissa sulkily at last ."
`` Isaac Appleby is dead or away . ''
Half an hour passed ; it seemed as long as a day .
The sun just boiled down on that roof and we were nearly melted .
"We were dreadfully thirsty , and the heat made our heads ache , and I could see my muslin dress fading before my very eyes ."
As for the roses on my best hat -- but that was too harrowing to think about .
Then we saw a welcome sight -- Isaac Appleby coming through the yard with a hoe over his shoulder .
He had probably been working in his field at the back of the house .
I never thought I should have been so glad to see him .
"`` Isaac , oh , Isaac ! ''"
"I called joyfully , leaning over as far as I dared ."
Isaac looked up in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks over the edge of the roof .
Then he saw the dog and took in the situation .
The creature actually grinned .
"`` Wo n't you call off your dog and let us get down , Isaac ? ''"
I said pleadingly .
Isaac stood and reflected for a moment or two .
"Then he came slowly forward and , before we realized what he was going to do , he took that ladder down and laid it on the ground ."
He looked real careworn and worried today . ''
The Rexton gossip soon ceased with the cessation of the young minister 's visits to Four Winds .
"A month later it suffered a brief revival when a tall grim-faced old woman , whom a few recognized as Captain Anthony 's housekeeper , was seen to walk down the Rexton road and enter the manse ."
"She did not stay there long -- watchers from a dozen different windows were agreed upon that -- and nobody , not even Mrs. Danby , who did her best to find out , ever knew why she had called ."
"Emily looked at Alan with grim reproach when she was shown into his study , and as soon as they were alone she began with her usual abruptness , `` Mr. Douglas , why have you given up coming to Four Winds ? ''"
Alan flinched .
"`` You must ask Lynde that , Miss Oliver , '' he said quietly ."
`` I have asked her -- and she says nothing . ''
`` Then I can not tell you . ''
Anger glowed in Emily 's eyes .
"`` I thought you were a gentleman , '' she said bitterly ."
`` You are not .
You are breaking Lynde 's heart .
She 's gone to a shadow of herself and she 's fretting night and day .
"You went there and made her like you -- oh , I 've eyes -- and then you left her . ''"
Alan bent over his desk and looked the old woman in the face unflinchingly .
"`` You are mistaken , Miss Oliver , '' he said earnestly ."
`` I love Lynde and would be only too happy if it were possible that I could marry her .
I am not to blame for what has come about -- she will tell you that herself if you ask her . ''
His look and tone convinced Emily .
`` Who is to blame then ?
Lynde herself ? ''
"`` No , no . ''"
`` The Captain then ? ''
`` Not in the sense you mean .
I can tell you nothing more . ''
A baffled expression crossed the old woman 's face .
`` There 's a mystery here -- there always has been -- and I 'm shut out of it .
Lynde wo n't confide in me -- in me who 'd give my life 's blood to help her .
Perhaps I can help her -- I could tell you something .
Have you stopped coming to Four Winds -- has she made you stop coming -- because she 's got such a wicked old scamp for a father ?
Is that the reason ? ''
"` Oo , ' and her arms went out to him ."
"` And you could darn our clothes , and make pockets for us ."
None of us has any pockets . '
How could she resist .
` Of course it 's awfully fascinating ! '
she cried .
"` Peter , would you teach John and Michael to fly too ? '"
"` If you like , ' he said indifferently ; and she ran to John and Michael and shook them ."
"` Wake up , ' she cried , ` Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly . '"
John rubbed his eyes .
"` Then I shall get up , ' he said ."
Of course he was on the floor already .
"` Hallo , ' he said , ' I am up ! '"
"Michael was up by this time also , looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw , but Peter suddenly signed silence ."
Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world .
All was as still as salt .
Then everything was right .
"No , stop !"
Everything was wrong .
"Nana , who had been barking distressfully all the evening , was quiet now ."
It was her silence they had heard .
` Out with the light !
Hide !
Quick ! '
"cried John , taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure ."
"And thus when Liza entered , holding Nana , the nursery seemed quite its old self , very dark ; and you could have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept ."
They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains .
"Liza was in a bad temper , for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen , and had been drawn away from them , with a raisin still on her cheek , by Nana 's absurd suspicions ."
"She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment , but in custody of course ."
"` There , you suspicious brute , ' she said , not sorry that Nana was in disgrace , ` they are perfectly safe , are n't they ?"
Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed .
Listen to their gentle breathing . '
"O , a great stroke ! ''"
"he sobbed , and rattled off a leash of prayers ."
Hatch meanwhile reverently doffed his salet and knelt down .
"`` Ay , Bennet , '' said the priest , somewhat recovering , `` and what may this be ?"
What enemy hath done this ? ''
"`` Here , Sir Oliver , is the arrow ."
"See , it is written upon with words , '' said Dick ."
"`` Nay , '' cried the priest , `` this is a foul hearing !"
John Amend-All !
A right Lollardy word .
"And black of hue , as for an omen !"
"Sirs , this knave arrow likes me not ."
But it importeth rather to take counsel .
Who should this be ?
"Bethink you , Bennet ."
"Of so many black ill-willers , which should he be that doth so hardily outface us ?"
Simnel ?
I do much question it .
The Walsinghams ?
"Nay , they are not yet so broken ; they still think to have the law over us , when times change ."
"There was Simon Malmesbury , too ."
"How think ye , Bennet ? ''"
"`` What think ye , sir , '' returned Hatch , `` of Ellis Duckworth ? ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , never ."
"Nay , not he , '' said the priest ."
"`` There cometh never any rising , Bennet , from below -- so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion ; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above ; and when Dick , Tom , and Harry take them to their bills , look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby ."
"Now , Sir Daniel , having once more joined him to the Queen 's party , is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords ."
"Thence , Bennet , comes the blow -- by what procuring , I yet seek ; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture . ''"
"`` A n't please you , Sir Oliver , '' said Bennet , `` the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire ."
"So did this poor sinner , Appleyard ."
"And , by your leave , men 's spirits are so foully inclined to all of us , that it needs neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on ."
"Hear my plain thoughts : You , that are a clerk , and Sir Daniel , that sails on any wind , ye have taken many men 's goods , and beaten and hanged not a few ."
"`` Nay , y ' are the best heart in England ; I but laughed ."
"Forgive me now , sweet Dick . ''"
"`` Nay , no fool words , '' returned Dick , a little embarrassed by his companion 's warmth ."
`` No harm is done .
"I am not touchy , praise the saints . ''"
"And at that moment the wind , which was blowing straight behind them as they went , brought them the rough flourish of Sir Daniel 's trumpeter ."
`` Hark ! ''
"said Dick , `` the tucket soundeth . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Matcham , `` they have found my flight , and now I am unhorsed ! ''"
and he became pale as death .
"`` Nay , what cheer ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Y ' have a long start , and we are near the ferry ."
"And it is I , methinks , that am unhorsed . ''"
"`` Alack , I shall be taken ! ''"
cried the fugitive .
"`` Dick , kind Dick , beseech ye help me but a little ! ''"
"`` Why , now , what aileth thee ? ''"
said Dick .
`` Methinks I help you very patently .
But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow !
"And see ye here , John Matcham -- sith John Matcham is your name -- I , Richard Shelton , tide what betideth , come what may , will see you safe in Holywood ."
The saints so do to me again if I default you .
"Come , pick me up a good heart , Sir White-face ."
The way betters here ; spur me the horse .
Go faster !
faster !
"Nay , mind not for me ; I can run like a deer . ''"
"So , with the horse trotting hard , and Dick running easily alongside , they crossed the remainder of the fen , and came out upon the banks of the river by the ferryman 's hut ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE FEN FERRY The river Till was a wide , sluggish , clayey water , oozing out of fens , and in this part of its course it strained among some score of willow-covered , marshy islets ."
"It was a dingy stream ; but upon this bright , spirited morning everything was become beautiful ."
The wind and the martens broke it up into innumerable dimples ; and the reflection of the sky was scattered over all the surface in crumbs of smiling blue .
"`` Well , I must run up to MacPhersons ' ."
Moody Spurgeon came home from Queen 's today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me . ''
`` And I must get Marilla 's tea .
She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening and she will soon be back . ''
"Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home ; the fire was crackling cheerily , a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves adorned the table , and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air ."
But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh .
`` Are your eyes troubling you ?
Does your head ache ? ''
queried Anne anxiously .
`` No .
I 'm only tired ... and worried .
It 's about Mary and those children ... Mary is worse ... she ca n't last much longer .
"And as for the twins , I do n't know what is to become of them . ''"
`` Has n't their uncle been heard from ? ''
"`` Yes , Mary had a letter from him ."
"He 's working in a lumber camp and ` shacking it , ' whatever that means ."
"Anyway , he says he ca n't possibly take the children till the spring ."
He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to ; but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter .
She says she ca n't bear to ask any of them .
Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that 's a fact .
"And the long and short of it is , Anne , that I 'm sure Mary wants me to take those children ... she did n't say so but she LOOKED it . ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"Anne clasped her hands , all athrill with excitement ."
"`` And of course you will , Marilla , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` I have n't made up my mind , '' said Marilla rather tartly ."
"`` I do n't rush into things in your headlong way , Anne ."
Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim .
"And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after ... twins , at that . ''"
Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children .
"`` Twins are very interesting ... at least one pair of them , '' said Anne ."
`` It 's only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous .
And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I 'm away in school . ''
They discussed the matter at the tea table .
"`` I 'll be glad when the auction is over , '' said Marilla ."
`` It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them .
He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I 'd give him the day off to go to his aunt 's funeral .
"I do n't know how many aunts he has got , I am sure ."
That 's the fourth that 's died since he hired here a year ago .
I 'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes over the farm .
"We 'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes , for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed ."
"I declare , it is a world of trouble , as Rachel says ."
Here 's poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know .
"She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them , but she has n't heard from him yet . ''"
`` What are the children like ?
How old are they ? ''
`` Six past ... they 're twins . ''
"`` Oh , I 've always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs. Hammond had so many , '' said Anne eagerly ."
`` Are they pretty ? ''
"`` Goodness , you could n't tell ... they were too dirty ."
Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in .
"Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then , because she cried , he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about ."
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief .
He has never had any bringing up you might say .
His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since . ''
"`` I 'm always sorry for children that have no bringing up , '' said Anne soberly ."
`` You know I had n't any till you took me in hand .
I hope their uncle will look after them .
Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you ? ''
`` Mary ?
None in the world .
It was her husband ... he was our third cousin .
There 's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard .
I thought she 'd be up to hear about Mary . ''
"`` Do n't tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow , '' implored Anne ."
"cried Alan , and he stood for a moment , wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity ."
"`` It 's the bare truth , '' he said , and drew his sword ."
"But before I could touch his blade with mine , he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground ."
"`` Na , na , '' he kept saying , `` na , na -- I cannae , I cannae . ''"
"At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me ; and I found myself only sick , and sorry , and blank , and wondering at myself ."
"I would have given the world to take back what I had said ; but a word once spoken , who can recapture it ?"
"I minded me of all Alan 's kindness and courage in the past , how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days ; and then recalled my own insults , and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend ."
"At the same time , the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble , and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness ."
I thought I must have swooned where I stood .
This it was that gave me a thought .
"No apology could blot out what I had said ; it was needless to think of one , none could cover the offence ; but where an apology was vain , a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side ."
I put my pride away from me .
`` Alan ! ''
"I said ; `` if ye cannae help me , I must just die here . ''"
"He started up sitting , and looked at me ."
"`` It 's true , '' said I. `` I 'm by with it ."
"O , let me get into the bield of a house -- I 'll can die there easier . ''"
"I had no need to pretend ; whether I chose or not , I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone ."
`` Can ye walk ? ''
asked Alan .
"`` No , '' said I , `` not without help ."
This last hour my legs have been fainting under me ; I 've a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron ; I cannae breathe right .
"If I die , ye 'll can forgive me , Alan ?"
"In my heart , I liked ye fine -- even when I was the angriest . ''"
"`` Wheesht , wheesht ! ''"
cried Alan .
`` Dinna say that !
"David man , ye ken -- '' He shut his mouth upon a sob ."
"`` Let me get my arm about ye , '' he continued ; `` that 's the way !"
Now lean upon me hard .
Gude kens where there 's a house !
"We 're in Balwhidder , too ; there should be no want of houses , no , nor friends ' houses here ."
"But you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to admire ; if Maimie began by thinking this , she soon found she was very much mistaken ."
"Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of his adventures , especially of how he went to and fro between the island and the Gardens in the Thrush 's Nest ."
` How romantic ! '
"Maimie exclaimed , but this was another unknown word , and he hung his head thinking she was despising him . '"
I suppose Tony would not have done that ? '
he said very humbly .
"` Never , never ! '"
"she answered with conviction , ` he would have been afraid . '"
` What is afraid ? '
asked Peter longingly .
He thought it must be some splendid thing . '
"I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid , Maimie , ' he said . '"
"I believe no one could teach that to you , ' she answered adoringly , but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid ."
"She had told him about Tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him -LRB- she knew quite well that it was wicked -RRB- , but Peter misunderstood her meaning and said , ` Oh , how I wish I was as brave as Tony ! '"
It quite irritated her .
"` You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony , ' she said ; ` you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew . '"
"He could scarcely believe she meant it , but when he did believe he screamed with joy ."
"` And if you want very much to give me a kiss , ' Maimie said , ` you can do it . '"
Very reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger .
He thought she wanted it back . '
"I do n't mean a kiss , ' she said hurriedly , ' I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
Peter asked .
"` It 's like this , ' she said , and kissed him . '"
"I should love to give you a thimble , ' Peter said gravely , so he gave her one ."
"He gave her quite a number of thimbles , and then a delightful idea came into his head ."
"` Maimie , ' he said , ` will you marry me ? '"
"-LSB- Illustration : ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love ' -RSB- Now , strange to tell , the same idea had come at exactly the same time into Maimie 's head . '"
"I should like to , ' she answered , ` but will there be room in your boat for two ? '"
"` If you squeeze close , ' he said eagerly ."
` Perhaps the birds would be angry ? '
"He assured her that the birds would love to have her , though I am not so certain of it myself ."
"`` Are all the children chained , so that they can not fly away ? ''"
"`` Ay , ay . ''"
`` Then hoist them up . ''
"The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold , all except Wendy , and ranged in line in front of him ."
For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence .
"He lolled at his ease , humming , not unmelodiously , snatches of a rude song , and fingering a pack of cards ."
Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face .
"`` Now then , bullies , '' he said briskly , `` six of you walk the plank to-night , but I have room for two cabin boys ."
Which of you is it to be ? ''
"`` Do n't irritate him unnecessarily , '' had been Wendy 's instructions in the hold ; so Tootles stepped forward politely ."
"Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man , but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person ; and though a somewhat silly boy , he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer ."
"All children know this about mothers , and despise them for it , but make constant use of it ."
"So Tootles explained prudently , `` You see , sir , I do n't think my mother would like me to be a pirate ."
"Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Slightly ? ''"
"He winked at Slightly , who said mournfully , `` I do n't think so , '' as if he wished things had been otherwise ."
"`` Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Twin ? ''"
"`` I do n't think so , '' said the first twin , as clever as the others ."
"`` Nibs , would -- '' `` Stow this gab , '' roared Hook , and the spokesmen were dragged back ."
"`` You , boy , '' he said , addressing John , `` you look as if you had a little pluck in you ."
"Didst never want to be a pirate , my hearty ? ''"
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths .
prep. ; and he was struck by Hook 's picking him out .
"`` I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack , '' he said diffidently ."
`` And a good name too .
"We 'll call you that here , bully , if you join . ''"
"`` What do you think , Michael ? ''"
asked John .
`` What would you call me if I join ? ''
Michael demanded .
`` Blackbeard Joe . ''
Michael was naturally impressed .
"`` What do you think , John ? ''"
Miss Susan deigned no reply .
Old John strode out to the turnip field .
"Burton saw him coming and looked for another outburst of wrath , but his father 's first words almost took away his breath ."
"`` See here , Burt , I take back all I said this afternoon ."
"I want you to marry Madge Oliver now , and the sooner , the better ."
That old cat of a Susan had the face to come up and tell me you were n't good enough for her niece .
I told her a few plain truths .
Do n't you mind the old crosspatch .
I 'll back you up . ''
"By this time Burton had begun hoeing vigorously , to hide the amused twinkle of comprehension in his eyes ."
"He admired Miss Susan 's tactics , but he did not say so ."
"`` All right , Father , '' he answered dutifully ."
"When Miss Susan reached home she told Madge to bathe her eyes and put on her new pink muslin , because she guessed Burton would be down that evening ."
"`` Oh , Auntie , how did you manage it ? ''"
cried Madge .
"`` Madge , '' said Miss Susan solemnly , but with dancing eyes , `` do you know how to drive a pig ?"
Just try to make it go in the opposite direction and it will bolt the way you want it .
"Remember that , my dear . ''"
Fair Exchange and No Robbery Katherine Rangely was packing up .
"Her chum and roommate , Edith Wilmer , was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer ."
"`` It does seem too provoking , '' said Katherine , as she tugged at an obstinate shawl strap , `` that Ned should be transferred here now , just when I 'm going away ."
The powers that be might have waited until vacation was over .
Ned wo n't know a soul here and he 'll be horribly lonesome . ''
"`` I 'll do my best to befriend him , with your permission , '' said Edith consolingly ."
"`` Oh , I know ."
"You 're a special Providence , Ede ."
"Ned will be up tonight first thing , of course , and I 'll introduce him ."
Try to keep the poor fellow amused until I get back .
Two months !
Just fancy !
And Aunt Elizabeth wo n't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay with her .
"Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull , too . ''"
Anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached .
"`` I wish you 'd tell me the joke , '' said Marilla , a little grimly ."
`` I have n't seen much to laugh at today . ''
"`` You 'll laugh when you hear this , '' assured Anne ."
"And Marilla did laugh , which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of Anne ."
But she sighed immediately afterwards .
"`` I suppose I should n't have told him that , although I heard a minister say it to a child once ."
But he did aggravate me so .
It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed .
He said he did n't see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God .
"Anne , I do not know what we are going to do with that child ."
I never saw his beat .
I 'm feeling clean discouraged . ''
"`` Oh , do n't say that , Marilla ."
Remember how bad I was when I came here . ''
"`` Anne , you never were bad ... NEVER ."
"I see that now , when I 've learned what real badness is ."
"You were always getting into terrible scrapes , I 'll admit , but your motive was always good ."
Davy is just bad from sheer love of it . ''
"`` Oh , no , I do n't think it is real badness with him either , '' pleaded Anne ."
`` It 's just mischief .
"And it is rather quiet for him here , you know ."
He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it .
Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boy 's playmate .
"I really think it would be better to let them go to school , Marilla . ''"
"`` No , '' said Marilla resolutely , `` my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old , and Mr. Allan says the same thing ."
The twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they sha n't till they 're seven . ''
"`` Well , we must try to reform Davy at home then , '' said Anne cheerfully ."
`` With all his faults he 's really a dear little chap .
I ca n't help loving him .
"Marilla , it may be a dreadful thing to say , but honestly , I like Davy better than Dora , for all she 's so good . ''"
"`` I do n't know but that I do , myself , '' confessed Marilla , `` and it is n't fair , for Dora is n't a bit of trouble ."
And we must make other things too .
I 'll help you in the morning .
"But I ca n't help you in the afternoon for I have to make a wedding-dress and time is the essence of the contract , Susan . ''"
Susan felt that she was really too old to be subjected to such shocks .
"`` Who are you going to marry , Rilla ? ''"
she asked feebly .
"`` Susan , darling , I am not the happy bride ."
Miranda Pryor is going to marry Joe Milgrave tomorrow afternoon while her father is away in town .
"A war-wedding , Susan -- is n't that thrilling and romantic ?"
I never was so excited in my life . ''
"The excitement soon spread over Ingleside , infecting even Mrs. Blythe and Susan ."
"`` I 'll go to work on that cake at once , '' vowed Susan , with a glance at the clock ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , will you pick over the fruit and beat up the eggs ?"
If you will I can have that cake ready for the oven by the evening .
Tomorrow morning we can make salads and other things .
I will work all night if necessary to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon . ''
"Miranda arrived , tearful and breathless ."
"`` We must fix over my white dress for you to wear , '' said Rilla ."
`` It will fit you very nicely with a little alteration . ''
"To work went the two girls , ripping , fitting , basting , sewing for dear life ."
By dint of unceasing effort they got the dress done by seven o'clock and Miranda tried it on in Rilla 's room .
"`` It 's very pretty -- but oh , if I could just have a veil , '' sighed Miranda ."
`` I 've always dreamed of being married in a lovely white veil . ''
Some good fairy evidently waits on the wishes of war-brides .
"The door opened and Mrs. Blythe came in , her arms full of a filmy burden ."
"`` Miranda dear , '' she said , `` I want you to wear my wedding-veil tomorrow ."
"It is twenty-four years since I was a bride at old Green Gables -- the happiest bride that ever was -- and the wedding-veil of a happy bride brings good luck , they say . ''"
"`` Oh , how sweet of you , Mrs. Blythe , '' said Miranda , the ready tears starting to her eyes ."
The veil was tried on and draped .
Susan dropped in to approve but dared not linger .
"`` I 've got that cake in the oven , '' she said , `` and I am pursuing a policy of watchful waiting ."
The evening news is that the Grand Duke has captured Erzerum .
I ca n't begin to tell you how unhappy I am .
"Truly , my heart is breaking . ''"
Rilla sat down on the lounge beside her .
"Sir Wilfrid squatted on his haunches before them , with his impertinent pink tongue stuck out , and listened ."
"`` What is the trouble , Miranda ? ''"
`` Joe is coming home tonight on his last leave .
"I had a letter from him on Saturday -- he sends my letters in care of Bob Crawford , you know , because of father -- and , oh , Rilla , he will only have four days -- he has to go away Friday morning -- and I may never see him again . ''"
`` Does he still want you to marry him ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` Oh , yes ."
He implored me in his letter to run away and be married .
"But I can not do that , Rilla , not even for Joe ."
My only comfort is that I will be able to see him for a little while tomorrow afternoon .
Father has to go to Charlottetown on business .
At least we will have one good farewell talk .
"But oh -- afterwards -- why , Rilla , I know father wo n't even let me go to the station Friday morning to see Joe off . ''"
`` Why in the world do n't you and Joe get married tomorrow afternoon at home ? ''
demanded Rilla .
Miranda swallowed a sob in such amazement that she almost choked .
"`` Why -- why -- that is impossible , Rilla . ''"
`` Why ? ''
briefly demanded the organizer of the Junior Red Cross and the transporter of babies in soup tureens .
"`` Why -- why -- we never thought of such a thing -- Joe has n't a license -- I have no dress -- I could n't be married in black -- I -- I -- we -- you -- you -- '' Miranda lost herself altogether and Sir Wilfrid , seeing that she was in dire distress threw back his head and emitted a melancholy yelp ."
Rilla Blythe thought hard and rapidly for a few minutes .
"Then she said , `` Miranda , if you will put yourself into my hands I 'll have you married to Joe before four o'clock tomorrow afternoon . ''"
"`` Oh , you could n't . ''"
`` I can and I will .
But you 'll have to do exactly as I tell you . ''
"`` Oh -- I -- do n't think -- oh , father will kill me -- '' `` Nonsense ."
He 'll be very angry I suppose .
But are you more afraid of your father 's anger than you are of Joe 's never coming back to you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Miranda , with sudden firmness , `` I 'm not . ''"
"Each wore a sword , and by a movement of his haunch , thrust clear the hilt of it , so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn ."
"`` Mr. Stewart , I am thinking , '' says Robin ."
"`` Troth , Mr. Macgregor , it 's not a name to be ashamed of , '' answered Alan ."
"`` I did not know ye were in my country , sir , '' says Robin ."
"`` It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the Maclarens , '' says Alan ."
"`` That 's a kittle point , '' returned the other ."
`` There may be two words to say to that .
But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your sword ? ''
"`` Unless ye were born deaf , Mr. Macgregor , ye will have heard a good deal more than that , '' says Alan ."
"`` I am not the only man that can draw steel in Appin ; and when my kinsman and captain , Ardshiel , had a talk with a gentleman of your name , not so many years back , I could never hear that the Macgregor had the best of it . ''"
"`` Do ye mean my father , sir ? ''"
says Robin .
"`` Well , I wouldnae wonder , '' said Alan ."
`` The gentleman I have in my mind had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name . ''
"`` My father was an old man , '' returned Robin ."
`` The match was unequal .
"You and me would make a better pair , sir . ''"
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
"I was half out of bed , and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fighting cocks , ready to intervene upon the least occasion ."
"But when that word was uttered , it was a case of now or never ; and Duncan , with something of a white face to be sure , thrust himself between ."
"`` Gentlemen , '' said he , `` I will have been thinking of a very different matter , whateffer ."
"Here are my pipes , and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers ."
It 's an auld dispute which one of ye 's the best .
Here will be a braw chance to settle it . ''
"`` Why , sir , '' said Alan , still addressing Robin , from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes , nor yet Robin from him , `` why , sir , '' says Alan , `` I think I will have heard some sough * of the sort ."
"Have ye music , as folk say ?"
Are ye a bit of a piper ? ''
* Rumour .
`` I can pipe like a Macrimmon ! ''
cries Robin .
"`` And that is a very bold word , '' quoth Alan ."
"`` I have made bolder words good before now , '' returned Robin , `` and that against better adversaries . ''"
"`` You see , I was little for fourteen years and I 've only been grown-uppish for scarcely three ."
I 'm sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods .
These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming ... except the half-hour or so before I go to sleep .
I 'm so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I have n't another moment for imagining things .
You do n't know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night .
I always imagine I 'm something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid ... a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen .
Last night I was a queen .
It 's really splendid to imagine you are a queen .
"You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to , which you could n't in real life ."
"But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things ... I 'm a dryad living in an old pine , or a little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf ."
That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine .
"The only difference is , she 's a tree and I 'm a girl , but that 's no real difference ."
"Where are you going , Diana ? ''"
`` Down to the Dicksons .
I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress .
"Ca n't you walk down in the evening , Anne , and come home with me ? ''"
"`` I might ... since Fred Wright is away in town , '' said Anne with a rather too innocent face ."
"Diana blushed , tossed her head , and walked on ."
"She did not look offended , however ."
"Anne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons ' that evening , but she did not ."
When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind .
Marilla met her in the yard ... a wild-eyed Marilla .
"`` Anne , Dora is lost ! ''"
`` Dora !
Lost ! ''
"Anne looked at Davy , who was swinging on the yard gate , and detected merriment in his eyes ."
"`` Davy , do you know where she is ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't , '' said Davy stoutly ."
"`` I have n't seen her since dinner time , cross my heart . ''"
"`` I 've been away ever since one o'clock , '' said Marilla ."
`` Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once .
When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn .
"So when the man woke , there was a poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved ."
"Well , it seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things ; and for greater security , he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it , and there was his bairn dead ."
"I am thinking to myself , Mr. Balfour , that you and the man are very much alike . ''"
* Bag .
`` Do you mean you had no hand in it ? ''
"cried I , sitting up ."
"`` I will tell you first of all , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , as one friend to another , '' said Alan , `` that if I were going to kill a gentleman , it would not be in my own country , to bring trouble on my clan ; and I would not go wanting sword and gun , and with a long fishing-rod upon my back . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that 's true ! ''"
"`` And now , '' continued Alan , taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon it in a certain manner , `` I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art nor part , act nor thought in it . ''"
`` I thank God for that ! ''
"cried I , and offered him my hand ."
He did not appear to see it .
`` And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell ! ''
said he .
"`` They are not so scarce , that I ken ! ''"
"`` At least , '' said I , `` you can not justly blame me , for you know very well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are different , I thank God again for that ."
"We may all be tempted ; but to take a life in cold blood , Alan ! ''"
And I could say no more for the moment .
`` And do you know who did it ? ''
I added .
`` Do you know that man in the black coat ? ''
"`` I have nae clear mind about his coat , '' said Alan cunningly , `` but it sticks in my head that it was blue . ''"
"`` Blue or black , did ye know him ? ''"
"said I. `` I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him , '' says Alan ."
"`` He gaed very close by me , to be sure , but it 's a strange thing that I should just have been tying my brogues . ''"
"`` Can you swear that you do n't know him , Alan ? ''"
"I cried , half angered , half in a mind to laugh at his evasions ."
"`` Not yet , '' says he ; `` but I 've a grand memory for forgetting , David . ''"
"`` And yet there was one thing I saw clearly , '' said I ; `` and that was , that you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers . ''"
"`` It 's very likely , '' said Alan ; `` and so would any gentleman ."
You and me were innocent of that transaction . ''
"`` The better reason , since we were falsely suspected , that we should get clear , '' I cried ."
It mattered nothing to me that the world may have thought there was some social difference between us .
"There , Jeff , you can not accuse me of not making my meaning plain . ''"
"`` Sara , '' he whispered , wondering , bewildered , half-afraid to believe this unbelievable joy ."
"`` I 'm not half worthy of you -- but -- but '' -- he bent forward and put his arm around her , looking straight into her clear , unshrinking eyes ."
"`` Sara , will you be my wife ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
She said the word clearly and truly .
"`` And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so , Jeff ."
"Oh , I do n't shrink from telling you the truth , you see ."
You mean too much to me for me to dissemble it .
"I 've hidden it for eighteen years because I did n't think you wanted to hear it , but I 'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now . ''"
"She lifted her delicate , high-bred face , fearless love shining in every lineament , to his , and they exchanged their first kiss ."
"Clorinda 's Gifts `` It is a dreadful thing to be poor a fortnight before Christmas , '' said Clorinda , with the mournful sigh of seventeen years ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"Aunt Emmy was sixty , and spent the hours she did n't spend in a bed , on a sofa or in a wheel chair ; but Aunt Emmy was never heard to sigh ."
"`` I suppose it is worse then than at any other time , '' she admitted ."
That was one of the nice things about Aunt Emmy .
She always sympathized and understood .
"`` I 'm worse than poor this Christmas ... I 'm stony broke , '' said Clorinda dolefully ."
`` My spell of fever in the summer and the consequent doctor 's bills have cleaned out my coffers completely .
Not a single Christmas present can I give .
And I did so want to give some little thing to each of my dearest people .
"But I simply ca n't afford it ... that 's the hateful , ugly truth . ''"
Clorinda sighed again .
"`` The gifts which money can purchase are not the only ones we can give , '' said Aunt Emmy gently , `` nor the best , either . ''"
"`` Oh , I know it 's nicer to give something of your own work , '' agreed Clorinda , `` but materials for fancy work cost too ."
That kind of gift is just as much out of the question for me as any other . ''
"`` That was not what I meant , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` What did you mean , then ? ''"
"asked Clorinda , looking puzzled ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"`` Suppose you think out my meaning for yourself , '' she said ."
"Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today , trying to reach down to the dark . ''"
"`` He 's a limb , '' declared Mr. Harrison ."
`` He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger 's tail before I could get in from the barn .
The poor bird has been moping ever since .
Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks . ''
"`` Everything that 's worth having is some trouble , '' said Anne , secretly resolving to forgive Davy 's next offence , whatever it might be , since he had avenged her on Ginger ."
"Mr. Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr. Joshua Pye , a surly , taciturn man , began painting the next day ."
He was not disturbed in his task .
The hall was situated on what was called `` the lower road . ''
"In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet , and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer `` upper '' road ."
The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it .
Mr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart .
Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody .
"Soon after his departure Mrs. Rachel Lynde drove by , having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint ."
When she rounded the spruce curve she saw .
The sight affected Mrs. Lynde oddly .
"She dropped the reins , held up her hands , and said `` Gracious Providence ! ''"
She stared as if she could not believe her eyes .
Then she laughed almost hysterically .
`` There must be some mistake ... there must .
I knew those Pyes would make a mess of things . ''
"Mrs. Lynde drove home , meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall ."
The news flew like wildfire .
"Gilbert Blythe , poring over a text book at home , heard it from his father 's hired boy at sunset , and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables , joined on the way by Fred Wright ."
"They found Diana Barry , Jane Andrews , and Anne Shirley , despair personified , at the yard gate of Green Gables , under the big leafless willows ."
"`` It is n't true surely , Anne ? ''"
exclaimed Gilbert .
"`` It is true , '' answered Anne , looking like the muse of tragedy ."
`` Mrs. Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me .
"Oh , it is simply dreadful !"
What is the use of trying to improve anything ? ''
`` What is dreadful ? ''
"But although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself , they had made no change in the usual list of guests ."
"`` It must just be the time-honoured family affair , '' Frances had declared ."
"`` If we begin inviting other folks , there is no knowing when to draw the line ."
"We ca n't have more than fourteen , and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted . ''"
So the same old list it was .
"But now Aunt Clara -- dear , jolly Aunt Clara , whom everybody in the connection loved and admired -- could not come , and her place must be filled ."
"`` We ca n't invite the new minister , because we would have to have his sister , too , '' said Frances ."
`` And there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another . ''
"`` Mother , you will have to help us out , '' said Alma ."
`` Ca n't you suggest a substitute guest ? ''
"Mrs. Allen looked down at the two bright , girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly , `` I think I can , but I am not sure my choice will please you ."
Why not ask Miss Price ? ''
Miss Price !
They had never thought of her !
"She was the pale , timid-looking little teacher in the primary department of the Hazelwood school ."
`` Miss Price ? ''
repeated Frances slowly .
"`` Why , Mother , we hardly know her ."
"She is dreadfully dull and quiet , I think . ''"
"`` And so shy , '' said Alma ."
"`` Why , at the Wards ' party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her ."
I believe she would be frightened to come here for Thanksgiving . ''
"`` She is a very lonely little creature , '' said Mrs. Allen gently , `` and does n't seem to have anyone belonging to her ."
I think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boarding-house where she lives . ''
"`` Of course , if you would like to have her , Mother , we will ask her , '' said Frances ."
"`` No , girls , '' said Mrs. Allen seriously ."
"`` You must not ask Miss Price on my account , if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake ."
"I had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little Thanksgiving cheer in a truly Thanksgiving spirit to a lonely , hard-working girl whose life I do not think is a happy one ."
"But there , I shall not preach ."
"This is your dinner , and you must please yourselves as to your guests . ''"
"Frances and Alma had both flushed , and they now remained silent for a few minutes ."
Then Frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother .
"At first Edith 's letters had been full of Ned , but in her last two or three she had said little about him ."
Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled .
"Edith wrote back and said , `` What nonsense . ''"
"She and Ned were as good friends as ever , but he was getting acquainted in Riverton now and was n't so dependent on her society , etc. ."
Katherine sighed and went on a fern hunt with Professor Keith .
It was getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more .
They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she mentioned this fact inconsequently .
The professor prodded the harmless dust with his cane .
"Well , he supposed she would find a return to work pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends again ."
"`` I 'm dying to see Edith , '' said Katherine ."
`` And Ned ? ''
suggested Professor Keith .
`` Oh yes .
"Ned , of course , '' assented Katherine without enthusiasm ."
There did n't seem to be anything more to say .
"One can not talk everlastingly about ferns , so they got up and went home ."
Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night .
Then she went to bed and cried .
"When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve of her departure from Harbour Hill , he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy ."
But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects .
"After all , it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye ."
"She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short , and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver ."
The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him .
"His hat dropped under their feet and was trampled on , but I doubt if Professor Keith knows the difference to this day , for he was fully absorbed in kissing Katherine 's hair ."
"When she became cognizant of this fact , she drew herself away ."
"`` Oh , Sidney , do n't !"
-- think of Edith !
I feel like a traitor . ''
`` Do you think she would care very much if I -- if you -- if we -- '' hesitated the professor .
"`` Oh , it would break her heart , '' cried Katherine with convincing earnestness ."
`` I know it would -- and Ned 's too .
They must never know . ''
"`` The dog is mine , and I shall do with him as I think fit ."
"He is sold , and that is all there is about it ."
Go on with your dinner . ''
But Ernest for the first time did not obey .
"He snatched his cap from the back of his chair , dashed it down over his eyes , and ran from the kitchen with a sob choking his breath ."
"Uncle Richard looked angry , but Aunt Kate hastened to soothe him ."
"`` Do n't be vexed with the boy , Richard , '' she said ."
`` You know he is very fond of Laddie .
"He 's had to do with him ever since he was a pup , and no doubt he feels badly at the thought of losing him ."
I 'm rather sorry myself that you have sold the dog . ''
"`` Well , he is sold and there 's an end of it ."
I do n't say but that the dog is a good dog .
"But he is of no use to us , and twenty dollars will come in mighty handy just now ."
"He 's worth that to Bob , for he is a good watch dog , so we 've both made a fair bargain . ''"
Nothing more was said about Ernest or Laddie .
"I had taken no part in the discussion , for I felt no great interest in the matter ."
"Laddie was a nice dog ; Ernest was a quiet , inoffensive little fellow , five years younger than myself ; that was all I thought about either of them ."
I was spending my vacation at Uncle Richard 's farm on the Nova Scotian Bay of Fundy shore .
"I was a great favourite with Uncle Richard , partly because he had been much attached to my mother , his only sister , partly because of my strong resemblance to his only son , who had died several years before ."
"Uncle Richard was a stern , undemonstrative man , but I knew that he entertained a deep and real affection for me , and I always enjoyed my vacation sojourns at his place ."
"`` What are you going to do this afternoon , Ned ? ''"
"he asked , after the disturbance caused by Ernest 's outbreak had quieted down ."
"`` I think I 'll row out to Island Rock , '' I replied ."
`` I want to take some views of the shore from it . ''
Uncle Richard nodded .
He was much interested in my new camera .
"`` If you 're on it about four o'clock , you 'll get a fine view of the ` Hole in the Wall ' when the sun begins to shine on the water through it , '' he said ."
`` I 've often thought it would make a handsome picture . ''
"`` After I 've finished taking the pictures , I think I 'll go down shore to Uncle Adam 's and stay all night , '' I said ."
"`` Jim 's dark room is more convenient than mine , and he has some pictures he is going to develop tonight , too . ''"
I started for the shore about two o'clock .
"Ernest was sitting on the woodpile as I passed through the yard , with his arms about Laddie 's neck and his face buried in Laddie 's curly hair ."
"Slightly married a lady of title , and so he became a lord ."
You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door ?
That used to be Tootles .
The bearded man who does n't know any story to tell his children was once John .
Wendy was married in white with a pink sash .
It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns -LSB- formal announcement of a marriage -RSB- .
"Years rolled on again , and Wendy had a daughter ."
This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash .
"She was called Jane , and always had an odd inquiring look , as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions ."
When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan .
"She loved to hear of Peter , and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place ."
"It was Jane 's nursery now , for her father had bought it at the three per cents -LSB- mortgage rate -RSB- from Wendy 's father , who was no longer fond of stairs ."
Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten .
"There were only two beds in the nursery now , Jane 's and her nurse 's ; and there was no kennel , for Nana also had passed away ."
"She died of old age , and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with ; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself ."
Once a week Jane 's nurse had her evening off ; and then it was Wendy 's part to put Jane to bed .
That was the time for stories .
"It was Jane 's invention to raise the sheet over her mother 's head and her own , thus making a tent , and in the awful darkness to whisper : `` What do we see now ? ''"
"`` I do n't think I see anything to-night , '' says Wendy , with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation ."
"`` Yes , you do , '' says Jane , `` you see when you were a little girl . ''"
"`` That is a long time ago , sweetheart , '' says Wendy ."
"`` Ah me , how time flies ! ''"
"`` Does it fly , '' asks the artful child , `` the way you flew when you were a little girl ? ''"
`` The way I flew ?
"Do you know , Jane , I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly . ''"
"`` Yes , you did . ''"
`` The dear old days when I could fly ! ''
"`` Why ca n't you fly now , mother ? ''"
"`` Because I am grown up , dearest ."
When people grow up they forget the way . ''
`` Why do they forget the way ? ''
`` Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless .
"Yes , they did , they went round Wendy and John and Michael , who had slipped out of bed and run to her ."
"`` George , George ! ''"
"she cried when she could speak ; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss , and Nana came rushing in ."
There could not have been a lovelier sight ; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window .
He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know ; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred .
Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP I hope you want to know what became of the other boys .
They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them ; and when they had counted five hundred they went up .
"They went up by the stair , because they thought this would make a better impression ."
"They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling , with their hats off , and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes ."
"They said nothing , but their eyes asked her to have them ."
"They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also , but they forgot about him ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them ; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed , and they saw that he considered six a rather large number ."
"`` I must say , '' he said to Wendy , `` that you do n't do things by halves , '' a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them ."
"The first twin was the proud one , and he asked , flushing , `` Do you think we should be too much of a handful , sir ?"
"Because , if so , we can go away . ''"
`` Father ! ''
"Wendy cried , shocked ; but still the cloud was on him ."
"He knew he was behaving unworthily , but he could not help it ."
"`` We could lie doubled up , '' said Nibs ."
"`` I always cut their hair myself , '' said Wendy ."
`` George ! ''
"Mrs. Darling exclaimed , pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light ."
"Then he burst into tears , and the truth came out ."
"He was as glad to have them as she was , he said , but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers , instead of treating him as a cypher -LSB- zero -RSB- in his own house ."
"`` I do n't think he is a cypher , '' Tootles cried instantly ."
"`` Do you think he is a cypher , Curly ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ."
"Do you think he is a cypher , Slightly ? ''"
`` Rather not .
"Twin , what do you think ? ''"
"It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher ; and he was absurdly gratified , and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in ."
"`` We 'll fit in , sir , '' they assured him ."
"`` It is the ruin of this kind land , '' a woman said ."
"`` If the barons live at war , ploughfolk must eat roots . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` every man that follows shall have sixpence a day , and archers twelve . ''"
"`` If they live , '' returned the woman , `` that may very well be ; but how if they die , my master ? ''"
"`` They can not better die than for their natural lord , '' said Dick ."
"`` No natural lord of mine , '' said the man in the smock ."
"`` I followed the Walsinghams ; so we all did down Brierly way , till two years ago , come Candlemas ."
And now I must side with Brackley !
It was the law that did it ; call ye that natural ?
"But now , what with Sir Daniel and what with Sir Oliver -- that knows more of law than honesty -- I have no natural lord but poor King Harry the Sixt , God bless him !"
-- the poor innocent that can not tell his right hand from his left . ''
"`` Ye speak with an ill tongue , friend , '' answered Dick , `` to miscall your good master and my lord the king in the same libel ."
But King Harry -- praised be the saints !
"-- has come again into his right mind , and will have all things peaceably ordained ."
"And as for Sir Daniel , y ' are very brave behind his back ."
But I will be no tale-bearer ; and let that suffice . ''
"`` I say no harm of you , Master Richard , '' returned the peasant ."
"`` Y ' are a lad ; but when ye come to a man 's inches , ye will find ye have an empty pocket ."
"I say no more : the saints help Sir Daniel 's neighbours , and the Blessed Maid protect his wards ! ''"
"`` Clipsby , '' said Richard , `` you speak what I can not hear with honour ."
"Sir Daniel is my good master , and my guardian . ''"
"`` Come , now , will ye read me a riddle ? ''"
returned Clipsby .
`` On whose side is Sir Daniel ? ''
"`` I know not , '' said Dick , colouring a little ; for his guardian had changed sides continually in the troubles of that period , and every change had brought him some increase of fortune ."
"`` Ay , '' returned Clipsby , `` you , nor no man ."
"For , indeed , he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York . ''"
"Just then the bridge rang under horse-shoe iron , and the party turned and saw Bennet Hatch come galloping -- a brown-faced , grizzled fellow , heavy of hand and grim of mien , armed with sword and spear , a steel salet on his head , a leather jack upon his body ."
"He was a great man in these parts ; Sir Daniel 's right hand in peace and war , and at that time , by his master 's interest , bailiff of the hundred ."
"`` Clipsby , '' he shouted , `` off to the Moat House , and send all other laggards the same gate ."
Bowyer will give you jack and salet .
We must ride before curfew .
It is no better than a sieve .
We are nearly drowned every time it rains .
But I do n't know where the money to do it is going to come from . ''
"`` Shingles for the roof , three , '' said Dorinda , as if she were carefully jotting down something in a mental memorandum ."
"`` And fourth -- now , Mother Page , I will have my say this time -- fourthly , biggest capital of all , a Nice , New Dress and a Warm Fur Coat for Mother Page this winter ."
"Yes , yes , you must have them , dearest ."
It 's absolutely necessary .
We can wait a year or so for college courses and music lessons to grow ; we can set basins under the leaks and borrow some more if we have n't enough .
"But a new dress and coat for you we must , shall , and will have , however it is to be brought about . ''"
"`` I would n't mind if I never got another new stitch , if I could only manage the other things , '' said Mrs. Page stoutly ."
"`` If your Uncle Eugene would only help us a little , until Leicester got through !"
He really ought to .
But of course he never will . ''
`` Have you ever asked him ? ''
said Dorinda .
"`` Oh , my dear , no ; of course not , '' said Mrs. Page in a horrified tone , as if Dorinda had asked if she had ever stolen a neighbour 's spoons ."
"`` I do n't see why you should n't , '' said Dorinda seriously ."
"`` Oh , Dorinda , Uncle Eugene hates us all ."
He is terribly bitter against us .
"He would never , never listen to any request for help , even if I could bring myself to make it . ''"
"`` Mother , what was the trouble between us and Uncle Eugene ?"
I have never known the rights of it .
I was too small to understand when I was home before .
"All I remember is that Uncle Eugene never came to see us or spoke to us when he met us anywhere , and we were all afraid of him somehow ."
I used to think of him as an ogre who would come creeping up the back stairs after dark and carry me off bodily if I was n't good .
What made him our enemy ?
And how did he come to get all of Grandfather Page 's property when Father got nothing ? ''
"`` Well , you know , Dorinda , that your Grandfather Page was married twice ."
"Eugene was his first wife 's son , and your father the second wife 's ."
Eugene was a great deal older than your father -- he was twenty-five when your father was born .
"He was always an odd man , even in his youth , and he had been much displeased at his father 's second marriage ."
"But he was very fond of your father -- whose mother , as you know , died at his birth -- and they were good friends and comrades until just before your father went to college ."
He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook .
Just beyond was another home-made gate of poles .
"Lincoln opened it , or rather he had his hand on the hasp of twisted withes which secured it , when he was suddenly arrested by the apparition of a girl , who flashed around the curve of young birch beyond and stood before him with panting breath and quivering lips ."
"`` I beg your pardon , '' said John Lincoln courteously , dropping the gate and lifting his hat ."
`` I am looking for the house of Mr. James Conway -- ` The Evergreens . '
Can you direct me to it ? ''
"`` That is Mr. James Conway 's house , '' said the girl , with the tragic air and tone of one driven to desperation and an impatient gesture of her hand toward the yellow nightmare above them ."
"`` I do n't think he can be the one I mean , '' said Lincoln perplexedly ."
"`` The man I am thinking of has a niece , Miss Richmond . ''"
"`` There is no other James Conway in Plainfield , '' said the girl ."
`` This is his place -- nobody calls it ` The Evergreens ' but myself .
I am Sidney Richmond . ''
"For a moment they looked at each other across the gate , sheer amazement and bewilderment holding John Lincoln mute ."
"Sidney , burning with shame , saw that this stranger was exceedingly good to look upon -- tall , clean-limbed , broad-shouldered , with clear-cut bronzed features and a chin and eyes that would have done honour to any man ."
"John Lincoln , among all his confused sensations , was aware that this slim , agitated young creature before him was the loveliest thing he ever had seen , so lithe was her figure , so glossy and dark and silken her bare , wind-ruffled hair , so big and brown and appealing her eyes , so delicately oval her flushed cheeks ."
"He felt that she was frightened and in trouble , and he wanted to comfort and reassure her ."
But how could she be Sidney Richmond ?
"`` I do n't understand , '' he said perplexedly ."
`` Oh ! ''
Sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest .
"`` No , and you never will understand -- I ca n't make you understand . ''"
"`` I do n't understand , '' said John Lincoln again ."
`` Can you be Sidney Richmond -- the Sidney Richmond who has written to me for four years ? ''
`` I am . ''
"`` Then , those letters -- '' `` Were all lies , '' said Sidney bluntly and desperately ."
`` There was nothing true in them -- nothing at all .
This is my home .
We are poor .
Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination . ''
`` Then why did you write them ? ''
he asked blankly .
`` Why did you deceive me ? ''
"They were not only new trousers , but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them , and he had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him , but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse ."
"` George , Nana is a treasure . '"
"` No doubt , but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies . '"
"` Oh no , dear one , I feel sure she knows they have souls . ' '"
"I wonder , ' Mr. Darling said thoughtfully , ' I wonder . '"
"It was an opportunity , his wife felt , for telling him about the boy ."
"At first he pooh-poohed the story , but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow ."
"` It is nobody I know , ' he said , examining it carefully , ` but he does look a scoundrel . '"
"` We were still discussing it , you remember , ' says Mr. Darling , ` when Nana came in with Michael 's medicine ."
"You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again , Nana , and it is all my fault ."
"Strong man though he was , there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine ."
"If he had a weakness , it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly ; and so now , when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana 's mouth , he had said reprovingly , ` Be a man , Michael . '"
"` Wo n't ; wo n't , ' Michael cried naughtily ."
"Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him , and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness ."
"` Mother , do n't pamper him , ' he called after her ."
"` Michael , when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur ."
"I said `` Thank you , kind parents , for giving me bottles to make me well . '' '"
"He really thought this was true , and Wendy , who was now in her night-gown , believed it also , and she said , to encourage Michael , ` That medicine you sometimes take , father , is much nastier , is n't it ? '"
"` Ever so much nastier , ` Mr. Darling said bravely , ` and I would take it now as an example to you , Michael , if I had n't lost the bottle . '"
He had not exactly lost it ; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there .
"What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it , and put it back on his wash-stand . '"
"I know where it is , father , ' Wendy cried , always glad to be of service ."
"` I 'll bring it , ' and she was off before he could stop her ."
Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way .
"` John , ' he said , shuddering , ` it 's most beastly stuff ."
"It 's that nasty , sticky , sweet kind . '"
"` It will soon be over , father , ' John said cheerily , and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass . '"
"I have been as quick as I could , ' she panted ."
"` You have been wonderfully quick , ' her father retorted , with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her ."
"` Michael first , ' he said doggedly ."
"` Father first , ' said Michael , who was of a suspicious nature . '"
"cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the announcement , `` I 'm going to stay . ''"
`` Hooray ! ''
"bawled Tommy from the wall on which he was perched , for Nan was a kindred spirit , and he foresaw `` larks '' in the future ."
"`` I can bat ; let me play , '' said Nan , who could turn her hand to any thing , and did not mind hard knocks ."
"`` We ai n't playing now , and our side beat without you . ''"
"`` I can beat you in running , any way , '' returned Nan , falling back on her strong point ."
`` Can she ? ''
asked Nat of Jack .
"`` She runs very well for a girl , '' answered Jack , who looked down upon Nan with condescending approval ."
`` Will you try ? ''
"said Nan , longing to display her powers ."
"`` It 's too hot , '' and Tommy languished against the wall as if quite exhausted ."
`` What 's the matter with Stuffy ? ''
"asked Nan , whose quick eyes were roving from face to face ."
"`` Ball hurt his hand ; he howls at every thing , '' answered Jack scornfully ."
"`` I do n't , I never cry , no matter how I 'm hurt ; it 's babyish , '' said Nan , loftily ."
`` Pooh !
"I could make you cry in two minutes , '' returned Stuffy , rousing up ."
`` See if you can . ''
"`` Go and pick that bunch of nettles , then , '' and Stuffy pointed to a sturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall ."
"Nan instantly `` grasped the nettle , '' pulled it up , and held it with a defiant gesture , in spite of the almost unbearable sting ."
"`` Good for you , '' cried the boys , quick to acknowledge courage even in one of the weaker sex ."
"More nettled than she was , Stuffy determined to get a cry out of her somehow , and he said tauntingly , `` You are used to poking your hands into every thing , so that is n't fair ."
"Now go and bump your head real hard against the barn , and see if you do n't howl then . ''"
"`` Do n't do it , '' said Nat , who hated cruelty ."
"But Nan was off , and running straight at the barn , she gave her head a blow that knocked her flat , and sounded like a battering-ram ."
"Dizzy , but undaunted , she staggered up , saying stoutly , though her face was drawn with pain , `` That hurt , but I do n't cry . ''"
"`` Do it again , '' said Stuffy angrily ; and Nan would have done it , but Nat held her ; and Tommy , forgetting the heat , flew at Stuffy like a little game-cock , roaring out , `` Stop it , or I 'll throw you over the barn ! ''"
and so shook and hustled poor Stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head or his heels .
"`` She told me to , '' was all he could say , when Tommy let him alone ."
"`` Never mind if she did ; it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl , '' said Demi , reproachfully ."
`` Ho !
"`` Well , all our men folk have gone now -- Jem and Walter and Shirley and Jerry and Carl ."
And none of them had to be driven to it .
So we have a right to be proud .
But pride -- '' Susan sighed bitterly -- `` pride is cold company and that there is no gainsaying . ''
"The moon sank lower into a black cloud in the west , the Glen went out in an eclipse of sudden shadow -- and thousands of miles away the Canadian boys in khaki -- the living and the dead -- were in possession of Vimy Ridge ."
Vimy Ridge is a name written in crimson and gold on the Canadian annals of the Great War .
"`` The British could n't take it and the French could n't take it , '' said a German prisoner to his captors , `` but you Canadians are such fools that you do n't know when a place ca n't be taken ! ''"
So the `` fools '' took it -- and paid the price .
"Jerry Meredith was seriously wounded at Vimy Ridge -- shot in the back , the telegram said ."
"`` Poor Nan , '' said Mrs. Blythe , when the news came ."
She thought of her own happy girlhood at old Green Gables .
There had been no tragedy like this in it .
How the girls of to-day had to suffer !
When Nan came home from Redmond two weeks later her face showed what those weeks had meant to her .
"John Meredith , too , seemed to have grown old suddenly in them ."
"Faith did not come home ; she was on her way across the Atlantic as a V.A.D. Di had tried to wring from her father consent to her going also , but had been told that for her mother 's sake it could not be given ."
"So Di , after a flying visit home , went back to her Red Cross work in Kingsport ."
The mayflowers bloomed in the secret nooks of Rainbow Valley .
Rilla was watching for them .
"Jem had once taken his mother the earliest mayflowers ; Walter brought them to her when Jem was gone ; last spring Shirley had sought them out for her ; now , Rilla thought she must take the boys ' place in this ."
"But before she had discovered any , Bruce Meredith came to Ingleside one twilight with his hands full of delicate pink sprays ."
He stalked up the steps of the veranda and laid them on Mrs. Blythe 's lap .
"`` Because Shirley is n't here to bring them , '' he said in his funny , shy , blunt way ."
"`` And you thought of this , you darling , '' said Anne , her lips quivering , as she looked at the stocky , black-browed little chap , standing before her , with his hands thrust into his pockets ."
"`` I wrote Jem to-day and told him not to worry ` bout you not getting your mayflowers , '' said Bruce seriously , '' 'cause I 'd see to that ."
"And I told him I would be ten pretty soon now , so it wo n't be very long before I 'll be eighteen , and then I 'll go to help him fight , and maybe let him come home for a rest while I took his place ."
"I wrote Jerry , too ."
"Jerry 's getting better , you know . ''"
`` Is he ?
Have you had any good news about him ? ''
`` Yes .
"Mother had a letter to-day , and it said he was out of danger . ''"
"I told him not at all ; that I had seen much to admire among the Highlanders ; and if he came to that , Mr. Campbell himself was a Highlander ."
"`` Ay , '' said he , `` that 's true ."
It 's a fine blood . ''
`` And what is the King 's agent about ? ''
I asked .
`` Colin Campbell ? ''
says Henderland .
`` Putting his head in a bees ' byke ! ''
"`` He is to turn the tenants out by force , I hear ? ''"
"said I. `` Yes , '' says he , `` but the business has gone back and forth , as folk say ."
"First , James of the Glens rode to Edinburgh , and got some lawyer -LRB- a Stewart , nae doubt -- they all hing together like bats in a steeple -RRB- and had the proceedings stayed ."
"And then Colin Campbell cam ' in again , and had the upper-hand before the Barons of Exchequer ."
And now they tell me the first of the tenants are to flit to-morrow .
"It 's to begin at Duror under James 's very windows , which doesnae seem wise by my humble way of it . ''"
`` Do you think they 'll fight ? ''
I asked .
"`` Well , '' says Henderland , `` they 're disarmed -- or supposed to be -- for there 's still a good deal of cold iron lying by in quiet places ."
And then Colin Campbell has the sogers coming .
"But for all that , if I was his lady wife , I wouldnae be well pleased till I got him home again ."
"They 're queer customers , the Appin Stewarts . ''"
I asked if they were worse than their neighbours .
"`` No they , '' said he ."
`` And that 's the worst part of it .
"For if Colin Roy can get his business done in Appin , he has it all to begin again in the next country , which they call Mamore , and which is one of the countries of the Camerons ."
"He 's King 's Factor upon both , and from both he has to drive out the tenants ; and indeed , Mr. Balfour -LRB- to be open with ye -RRB- , it 's my belief that if he escapes the one lot , he 'll get his death by the other . ''"
"So we continued talking and walking the great part of the day ; until at last , Mr. Henderland after expressing his delight in my company , and satisfaction at meeting with a friend of Mr. Campbell 's -LRB- `` whom , '' says he , `` I will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted Zion '' -RRB- , proposed that I should make a short stage , and lie the night in his house a little beyond Kingairloch ."
"To say truth , I was overjoyed ; for I had no great desire for John of the Claymore , and since my double misadventure , first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper , I stood in some fear of any Highland stranger ."
"Accordingly we shook hands upon the bargain , and came in the afternoon to a small house , standing alone by the shore of the Linnhe Loch ."
"The sun was already gone from the desert mountains of Ardgour upon the hither side , but shone on those of Appin on the farther ; the loch lay as still as a lake , only the gulls were crying round the sides of it ; and the whole place seemed solemn and uncouth ."
"We had no sooner come to the door of Mr. Henderland 's dwelling , than to my great surprise -LRB- for I was now used to the politeness of Highlanders -RRB- he burst rudely past me , dashed into the room , caught up a jar and a small horn-spoon , and began ladling snuff into his nose in most excessive quantities ."
"Then he had a hearty fit of sneezing , and looked round upon me with a rather silly smile ."
"`` It 's a vow I took , '' says he ."
"`` Oh , thank God , '' murmured Mrs. Blythe , in a half-whisper ."
Bruce looked at her curiously .
`` That is what father said when mother told him .
"But when l said it the other day when I found out Mr. Mead 's dog had n't hurt my kitten -- I thought he had shooken it to death , you know -- father looked awful solemn and said I must never say that again about a kitten ."
"But I could n't understand why , Mrs. Blythe ."
"I felt awful thankful , and it must have been God that saved Stripey , because that Mead dog had ` normous jaws , and oh , how it shook poor Stripey ."
And so why could n't I thank Him ?
"` Course , '' added Bruce reminiscently , `` maybe I said it too loud -- 'cause I was awful glad and excited when I found Stripey was all right ."
"I ` most shouted it , Mrs. Blythe ."
Maybe if I 'd said it sort of whispery like you and father it would have been all right .
"Do you know , Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce dropped to a `` whispery '' tone , edging a little nearer to Anne -- `` what I would like to do to the Kaiser if I could ? ''"
"`` What would you like to do , laddie ? ''"
"`` Norman Reese said in school to-day that he would like to tie the Kaiser to a tree and set cross dogs to worrying him , '' said Bruce gravely ."
`` And Emily Flagg said she would like to put him in a cage and poke sharp things into him .
And they all said things like that .
But Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce took a little square paw out of his pocket and put it earnestly on Anne 's knee -- `` I would like to turn the Kaiser into a good man -- a very good man -- all at once if I could .
That is what I would do .
"Do n't you think , Mrs. Blythe , that would be the very worstest punishment of all ? ''"
"`` Bless the child , '' said Susan , `` how do you make out that would be any kind of a punishment for that wicked fiend ? ''"
"`` Do n't you see , '' said Bruce , looking levelly at Susan , out of his blackly blue eyes , `` if he was turned into a good man he would understand how dreadful the things he has done are , and he would feel so terrible about it that he would be more unhappy and miserable than he could ever be in any other way ."
He would feel just awful -- and he would go on feeling like that forever .
"Yes '' -- Bruce clenched his hands and nodded his head emphatically , `` yes , I would make the Kaiser a good man -- that is what I would do -- it would serve him ` zackly right . ''"
"CHAPTER XXVI SUSAN HAS A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE An aeroplane was flying over Glen St. Mary , like a great bird poised against the western sky -- a sky so clear and of such a pale , silvery yellow , that it gave an impression of a vast , wind-freshened space of freedom ."
"The little group on the Ingleside lawn looked up at it with fascinated eyes , although it was by no means an unusual thing to see an occasional hovering plane that summer ."
Susan was always intensely excited .
"Who knew but that it might be Shirley away up there in the clouds , flying over to the Island from Kingsport ?"
"But Shirley had gone overseas now , so Susan was not so keenly interested in this particular aeroplane and its pilot ."
"Nevertheless , she looked at it with awe ."
"`` I wonder , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she said solemnly , `` what the old folks down there in the graveyard would think if they could rise out of their graves for one moment and behold that sight ."
"I am sure my father would disapprove of it , for he was a man who did not believe in new-fangled ideas of any sort ."
He always cut his grain with a reaping hook to the day of his death .
A mower he would not have .
"No, she mightn't."
"""Tell me the way, then,"" she said, ""and I'll search you out; that surely I may get leave to do."""
"""Yes,"" she might do that, he said; ""but there was no way to that place. It lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither she'd never find her way."""
"So next morning, when she woke up, both Prince and castle were gone, and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy thick wood, and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old home."
"So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and wept till she was tired, she set out on her way, and walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an old hag, and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the Prince, who lived with his step-mother in the Castle, that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and who was to marry the Princess with a nose three ells long."
"""How did you come to know about him?"" asked the old hag; ""but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have had him?"""
"Yes, she was."
"""So, so; it's you, is it?"" said the old hag. ""Well, all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither you'll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next neighbour. Maybe she'll be able to tell you; and when you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to be off home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you."""
"So she got upon the horse, and rode a long, long time, till she came to another crag, under which sat another old hag, with a gold carding-comb. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and she answered, like the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was east of the sun and west of the moon."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never, but you shall have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she'll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off home."""
"And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be she'd find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and rode a far, far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag, under which sat another old hag, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel. Her, too, she asked if she knew the way to the Prince, and where the castle was that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon. So it was the same thing over again."
"""Maybe it's you who ought to have had the Prince?"" said the old hag."
"Yes, it was."
"But she, too, didn't know the way a bit better than the other two."
"""East of the sun and west of the moon it was,"" she knew that was all."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never; but I'll lend you my horse, and then I think you'd best ride to the East Wind and ask him; maybe he knows those parts, and can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he'll trot home of himself."""
"And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. ""Maybe you'll find a use for it,"" said the old hag."
"Then on she rode many many days, a weary time, before she got to the East Wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon. Yes, the East Wind had often heard tell of it, the Prince and the castle, but he couldn't tell the way, for he had never blown so far."
"""But, if you will, I'll go with you to my brother the West Wind, maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. So, if you will just get on my back, I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they went briskly along."
"So when they got there, they went into the West Wind's house, and the East Wind said the lassie he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince who lived in the castle East of the Sun and West of the Moon; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come with her, and would be glad to know if the West Wind knew how to get to the castle."
"""Nay,"" said the West Wind, ""so far I've never blown; but if you will, I'll go with you to our brother the South Wind, for he's much stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide. Maybe he'll tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you to him."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South Wind, and weren't so very long on the way, I should think."
"When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, for it was she who ought to have had the Prince who lived there."
"""You don't say so! That's she, is it?"" said the South Wind."
"""Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I'll take you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don't know where it is, you'll never find any one in the world to tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his house at a fine rate. And this time, too, she wasn't long on her way."
"So when they got to the North Wind's house, he was so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way off."
"""BLAST YOU BOTH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy shiver."
"""Well,"" said the South Wind, ""you needn't be so foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and here is the lassie who ought to have had the Prince who dwells in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again."""
"So, when the Lad woke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and that day he got home to his mother."
"""Now,"" said he, ""I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellow he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sort of food I please."""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but seeing is believing, and I shan't believe it till I see it."""
"So the Lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
"""Well,"" said the Lad ""there's no help for it but to go to the North Wind again;"" and away he went."
So he came to where the North Wind lived late in the afternoon.
"""Good evening!"" said the Lad."
"""Good evening!"" said the North Wind."
"""I want my rights for that meal of ours which you took,"" said the Lad; ""for, as for that cloth I got, it isn't worth a penny."""
"""I've got no meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"So the Lad thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get home that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before."
"Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the North Wind had said of the ram, and found it all right; but, when the landlord saw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the Lad had fallen asleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changed the two."
"Next morning off went the Lad; and when he got home to his mother, he said:"
"""After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but I shan't believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made."""
"""Ram, ram! make money!"" said the Lad; but if the ram made anything, it wasn't money."
"So the Lad went back again to the North Wind, and blew him up, and said the ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal."
"""Well!"" said the North Wind; ""I've nothing else to give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but its a stick of that kind that if you say: 'Stick, stick! lay on!' it lays on till you say: 'Stick, stick! now stop!'"""
"So, as the way was long, the Lad turned in this night too to the landlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore, as if he were asleep."
"Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worth something, hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the two; but, just as the landlord was about to take it, the Lad bawled out:"
"""Stick, stick! lay on!"""
"So the stick began to beat the landlord, till he jumped over chairs, and tables, and benches, and yelled and roared:"
"""Oh my! oh my! bid the stick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have back both your cloth and your ram."""
"When the Lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said:"
"""Stick, stick! now stop!"""
"Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home with his stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for the meal he had lost."

"Once on a time there was a fisherman who lived close by a palace, and fished for the King's table. One day when he was out fishing he just caught nothing. Do what he would however he tried with bait and angle there was never a sprat on his hook. But when the day was far spent a head bobbed up out of the water, and said:"
"""If I may have what your wife bears under her girdle, you shall catch fish enough."""
"So the man answered boldly, ""Yes;"" for he did not know that his wife was going to have a child. After that, as was like enough, he caught plenty of fish of all kinds. But when he got home at night and told his story, how he had got all that fish, his wife fell a-weeping and moaning, and was beside herself for the promise which her husband had made, for she said, ""I bear a babe under my girdle."""
"The Rattlesnake, for it was he, raised his head to look at the bird. The young Blue Jay saw that his eyes were very bright. He looked right into them, and could see little pictures of himself upon their shining surfaces. He stood still to look, and the Rattlesnake came nearer. Then the young Blue Jay tried to see his tail, but he couldn't look away from the Rattlesnake's eyes, though he tried ever so hard."
"The Rattlesnake now coiled up his body, flattened out his head, and showed his teeth, while all the time his queer forked tongue ran in and out of his mouth. Then the young Blue Jay tried to move and found that he couldn't. All he could do was to stand there and watch those glowing eyes and listen to the song which the Rattlesnake began to sing:"
"""Through grass and fern,   With many a turn,     My shining body I draw."
"In woodland shade   My home is made,     For this is the Forest Law."
"""Whoever tries   To look in my eyes     Comes near to my poisoned jaw;   And birds o'erbold   I charm and hold,     For this is the Forest Law."""
"The Rattlesnake drew nearer and nearer, and the young Blue Jay was shaking with fright, when there was a rustle of wings, and his father and mother flew down and around the Rattlesnake, screaming loudly to all the other Jays, and making the Snake turn away from the helpless little bird he had been about to strike. It was a long time before the forest was quiet again, and when it was, the Blue Jay family were safely in their nest, and the Rattlesnake had gone home without his supper."
"After the young Blue Jay got over his fright, he began to complain because he had not seen the Rattlesnake's tail. Then, indeed, his patient mother gave him such a scolding as he had never had in all his life, and his father said that he deserved a sound pecking for his foolishness."
"When the young Blue Jay showed that he was sorry for all the trouble that he had made, his parents let him have some supper and go to bed; but not until he had learned two sayings which he was always to remember. And these were the sayings: ""A really brave bird dares to be afraid of some things,"" and, ""If you go near enough to see the tail of a danger, you may be struck by its head."""
THE RED SQUIRRELS BEGIN HOUSEKEEPING
"The first thing that Mr. Red Squirrel did after coming to the forest and meeting the Gray Squirrel was to look for something to eat. It was not a good season for a stranger who had no hidden store of nuts and seeds to draw upon. The apples and corn were not ripe, and last year's seeds and acorns were nearly gone. What few remained here and there had lost their sweet and wholesome taste. Poor Mr. Red Squirrel began to wish that he had eaten breakfast before he ran away. He even went to the edge of the forest and looked over toward the farmhouse, where his open cage hung in the sunshine. He knew that there were nuts and a fresh bit of fruit inside of it, and his mouth watered at the thought of them, but he was a sensible young fellow, and he knew that if he went back to eat, the cage door would be snapped shut, and he would never again be free to scamper in the beautiful trees."
"""I will starve first!"" he said to himself, and he was so much in earnest that he spoke quite loudly."
"The words were hardly out of his mouth when ""Pft!"" a fat acorn came down at his feet. He caught it up with his forepaws before looking around. It was smooth and glossy, not at all as though it had passed a long winter on an oak branch. He took a good nibble at it and then looked up to see if there were more on the tree above him. You can think how surprised he was to find himself sitting beneath a maple, for in all the years since the world began no maple has ever borne acorns."
"""There are no more to come,"" he said. ""I must take small bites and make it last as long as I can."" And he turned it around and around, clutching it tightly with his long, crooked claws, so that not the tiniest bit could be lost. At last it was all eaten, not a crumb was left, and then ""Pft!"" down came a walnut. This hit him squarely on the back, but he was too hungry to mind, and he ate it all, just stopping long enough to say:"
"""If this maple bears such fruit as acorns and walnuts, I should like to live in a maple grove."""
"Next came a hazelnut, then a butternut, and last of all a fat kernel of yellow corn. He knew now that some friend was hidden in the branches above, so he tucked the corn in one of his cheek-pockets, and scampered up the maple trunk to find out who it was. He saw a whisking reddish-brown tail, and knew that some other Red Squirrel was there. But whoever it was did not mean to be caught, and such a chase as he had!"
"Just as he thought he had overtaken his unknown friend, he could see nothing more of her, and he was almost vexed to think how careless he must have been to miss her. He ran up and down the tree on which he last saw her, and found a little hollow in one of its large branches. He looked in, and there she was, the same dainty creature whom he had so often watched from his cage. He could see that she was breathless from running so fast, yet she pretended to be surprised at seeing him."
"Perhaps she now thought that she had been too bold in giving him food, and so wanted him to think that it had been somebody else."
"""Good morning!"" said he. ""Thank you very much for your kindness."""
"""What do you mean?"" said she."
"""As though you didn't know!"" he answered. ""I never heard of a maple tree that bore acorns, nuts, and corn, and that in the springtime."""
"""Oh, well,"" said she, tossing her pretty head, ""you have lived in a cage and may not know what our forest trees can do."""
"That was a rather saucy thing to say, but Mr. Red Squirrel knew her kind heart and that she said it only in mischief. ""How do you know I have lived in a cage?"" he asked."
"""I I thought you looked like the Squirrel at the farmhouse,"" she said; and then forgetting herself, she added, ""You did look so surprised when that walnut hit you."""
"""Where were you then?"" he asked quickly."
"""Oh! I was on a branch above you,"" she answered, seeing that he now knew all about it. ""You looked so hungry, and I had plenty of food stored away. You may have some whenever you wish. It must have been dreadful in that cage."""
"Now Mr. Red Squirrel had loved his little friend ever since the first time he saw her on the rail fence, but he had never thought she would care for him a tired, discouraged fellow, who had passed such a sorrowful life in prison. Yet when he heard her pitying words, and saw the light in her tender eyes, he wondered if he could win her for his wife."
"""I shall never be able to do anything for you,"" said he. ""You are young and beautiful and know the forest ways. I am a stranger and saddened by my hard life. I wish I could help you."""
"""The Blue Jays! The Blue Jays!"" she cried, starting up. ""They have found my hidden acorns and are eating them."""
"And sure enough, a pair of those handsome robbers were pulling acorn after acorn out of a tree-hollow near by, and eating them as fast as they could. You should have seen Mr. Red Squirrel then! He leaped from branch to branch until he reached the Blue Jays; then he stood by the hole where the acorns were stored, and scolded them."
"""Chickaree-chickaree-quilch-quilch-chickaree-chickaree!"" he said; and that in the Red Squirrel language is a very severe scolding. He jumped about with his head down and his tail jerking, while his eyes gleamed like coals of fire. The Blue Jays made a great fuss and called ""Jay!"
"Jay!"" at him, and made fun of him for being a stranger, but they left at last, and Mr. Red Squirrel turned to his friend."
"Then Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said, ""Don't be silly, because it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things like that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In Rotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of, unless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's all go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops."" So they went. And all the titled children took it in turns to feed the dragon with acid drops, and he seemed pleased and flattered, and wagged as much of his purple tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very, very long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn to give an acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide smile, and wagged his tail to the very last long inch of it, as much as to say, ""Oh, you nice, kind, pretty little Princess."" But deep down in his wicked purple heart he was saying, ""Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like to eat you instead of these silly acid drops."" But of course nobody heard him except the Princess's uncle, and he was a magician, and accustomed to listening at doors. It was part of his trade."
"Now, you will remember that I told you there was one wicked person in Rotundia, and I cannot conceal from you any longer that this Complete Bad was the Princess's Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you know from your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by the Babes in the Wood, or the Norfolk Tragedy, and one James at least was bad, as you have learned from your English history. And when anyone is a magician, and is also an uncle, and is named James as well, you need not expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold Complete Bad and he will come to no good."
"Uncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess and have the kingdom to himself. He did not like many things a nice kingdom was almost the only thing he cared for but he had never seen his way quite clearly, because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked spells will not work there, but run off those blameless islanders like water off a duck's back. Now, however, Uncle James thought there might be a chance for him because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the island who could stand by each other himself and the dragon. He said nothing, but he exchanged a meaningful glance with the dragon, and everyone went home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance except Tom."
"Tom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The intelligent little creature listened carefully, and then climbed from Tom's knee to the table, on which stood an ornamental calendar that the Princess had given Tom for a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant pointed out a date the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday, and looked anxiously at its master."
"""What is it, Fido good little elephant then?"" said Tom, and the sagacious animal repeated its former gesture. Then Tom understood."
"""Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right. I'll be on the lookout."" And he was."
"At first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with the dragon, who lived by the pillar and fed himself from the bun trees, but by-and-by he began to wander. He would creep into the burrows made by the great rabbits; and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his long, tight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out of sight, and before they had time to say, ""There he goes,"" his ugly purple head would come poking out from another rabbit-hole perhaps just behind them or laugh softly to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's laugh was not a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at first, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if you don't know what that means, ask Mother to tell you next time you are playing blind man's buff when she has a headache. Then the dragon got into the habit of cracking his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on people's nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed. And you know how unpleasant that is, even in a private school, and in a public kingdom it is, of course, much worse. The things that were missed were nothing much at first a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two, and some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much, as I say, but it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one day a favorite rabbit of the Princess's, called Frederick, mysteriously disappeared, and then came a terrible morning when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had barked ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had grown quite used to the noise. So when his barking suddenly ceased it woke everybody up and they all went out to see what was the matter. And the lapdog was gone!"
"A boy was sent to wake the army, so that it might look for him. But the army was gone too! And now the people began to be frightened. Then Uncle James came out onto the terrace of the palace, and he made the people a speech. He said: ""Friends fellow citizens I cannot disguise from myself or from you that this purple dragon is a poor penniless exile, a helpless alien in our midst, and, besides, he is a is no end of a dragon."""
"The people thought of the dragon's tail and said, ""Hear, hear."""
"Uncle James went on: ""Something has happened to a gentle and defenseless member of our community. We don't know what has happened."""
"Everyone thought of the rabbit named Frederick, and groaned."
"""The defenses of our country have been swallowed up,"" said Uncle James."
Everyone thought of the poor army.
"""There is only one thing to be done."" Uncle James was warming to his subject. ""Could we ever forgive ourselves if by neglecting a simple precaution we lost more rabbits or even, perhaps, our navy, our police, and our fire brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will respect nothing, however sacred."""
"Everyone thought of themselves and they said, ""What is the simple precaution?"""
"Then Uncle James said: ""Tomorrow is the dragon's birthday. He is accustomed to have a present on his birthday. If he gets a nice present he will be in a hurry to take it away and show it to his friends, and he will fly off and never come back."""
The crowd cheered wildly and the Princess from her balcony clapped her hands.
"""The present the dragon expects,"" said Uncle James, cheerfully, ""is rather an expensive one. But, when we give, it should not be in a grudging spirit, especially to visitors. What the dragon wants is a Princess. We have only one Princess, it is true; but far be it from us to display a miserly temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless that costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up your Princess will only show how generous you are."""
"The crowd began to cry, for they loved their Princess, though they quite saw that their first duty was to be generous and give the poor dragon what it wanted."
"The Princess began to cry, for she did not want to be anybody's birthday present especially a purple dragon's. And Tom began to cry because he was so angry."
He went straight home and told his little elephant; and the elephant cheered him up so much that presently the two grew quite absorbed in a top that the elephant was spinning with his little trunk.
Early in the morning Tom went to the palace. He looked out across the downs there were hardly any rabbits playing there now and then he gathered white roses and threw them at the Princess's window till she woke up and looked out.
"""Come up and kiss me,"" she said."
"So Tom climbed up the white rosebush and kissed the Princess through the window, and said: ""Many happy returns of the day."""
"Then Mary Ann began to cry, and said: ""Oh, Tom how can you? When you know quite well """
"""Oh, don't,"" said Tom. ""Why, Mary Ann, my precious, my Princess what do you think I should be doing while the dragon was getting his birthday present? Don't cry, my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged everything. You've only got to do as you are told."""
"""Is that all?"" said the Princess. ""Oh that's easy I've often done that!"""
"Then Tom told her what she was to do. And she kissed him again and again. ""Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom,"" she said. ""How glad I am that I gave you Fido. You two have saved me. You dears!"""
"The next morning Uncle James put on his best coat and hat and the vest with the gold snakes on it he was a magician, and he had a bright taste in vests and he called with a cab to take the Princess out."
"""Come, little birthday present,"" he said tenderly. ""The dragon will be so pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not crying. You know, my child, we cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others rather than our own. I should not like my dear little niece to be selfish, or to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon, far from his home and friends."""
The Princess said she would try not to be selfish.
"""YES, I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHERE IT IS,"" said the North Wind; ""once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but, I was so tired I couldn't blow a puff for ever so many days, after. But if you really wish to go thither, and aren't afraid to come along with me, I'll take you on my back and see if I can blow you thither."""
"Yes! with all her heart; she must and would get thither if it were possible in any way; and as for fear, however madly he went, she wouldn't be at all afraid."
"""Very well, then,"" said the North Wind, ""but you must sleep here to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we're to get thither at all."""
"Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and puffed himself up, and blew himself out, and made himself so stout and big, 'twas gruesome to look at him; and so off they went high up through the air, as if they would never stop till they got to the world's end."
"Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of wood and many houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds."
"So they tore on and on no one can believe how far they went and all the while they still went over the sea, and the North Wind got more and more weary, and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his wings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels."
"""Are you afraid?"" said the North Wind."
"""No!"" she wasn't."
"But they weren't very far from land; and the North Wind had still so much strength left in him that he managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows of the castle which lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon; but then he was so weak and worn out, he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home again."
"Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle window, and began to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was the Long-nose who was to have the Prince."
"""What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?"" said the Long-nose, and threw up the window."
"""It's not for sale, for gold or money,"" said the lassie."
"""If it's not for sale for gold or money, what is it that you will sell it for? You may name your own price,"" said the Princess."
"""Well! if I may get to the Prince, who lives here, and be with him to-night, you shall have it,"" said the lassie whom the North Wind had brought."
"Yes! she might; that could be done. So the Princess got the gold apple; but when the lassie came up to the Prince's bed-room at night he was fast asleep; she called him and shook him, and between whiles she wept sore; but all she could do she couldn't wake him up. Next morning, as soon as day broke, came the Princess with the long nose, and drove her out again."
"So in the daytime she sat down under the castle windows and began to card with her carding-comb, and the same thing happened. The Princess asked what she wanted for it; and she said it wasn't for sale for gold or money, but if she might get leave to go up to the Prince and be with him that night, the Princess should have it."
"But when she went up she found him fast asleep again, and all she called, and all she shook, and wept, and prayed, she couldn't get life into him; and as soon as the first gray peep of day came, then came the Princess with the long nose, and chased her out again."
"So, in the daytime, the lassie sat down outside under the castle window, and began to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and that, too, the Princess with the long nose wanted to have. So she threw up the window and asked what she wanted for it. The lassie said, as she had said twice before, it wasn't for sale for gold or money; but if she might go up to the Prince who was there, and be with him alone that night, she might have it."
"Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you must know there were some Christian folk who had been carried off thither, and as they sat in their room, which was next the Prince, they had heard how a woman had been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights running, and they told that to the Prince."
"That evening, when the Princess came with her sleepy drink, the Prince made as if he drank, but threw it over his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleepy drink. So, when the lassie came in, she found the Prince wide awake; and then she told him the whole story how she had come thither."
"""Ah,"" said the Prince, ""you've just come in the very nick of time, for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but now I won't have the Long-nose, and you are the only woman in the world who can set me free. I'll say I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she'll say yes, for she doesn't know 'tis you who put them there; but that's a work only for Christian folk, and not for such a pack of Trolls, and so I'll say that I won't have any other for my bride than the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to do it."""
"So there was great joy and love between them all that night. But next day, when the wedding was to be, the Prince said:"
"""First of all, I'd like to see what my bride is fit for."""
"""Yes!"" said the step-mother, with all her heart."
"""Well,"" said the Prince, ""I've got a fine shirt which I'd like for my wedding shirt, but somehow or other it has got three spots of tallow on it, which I must have washed out; and I have sworn never to take any other bride than the woman who's able to do that. If she can't, she's not worth having."""
"Well, that was no great thing they said, so they agreed, and she with the long-nose began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew."
"""Ah!"" said the old hag, her mother, ""you can't wash; let me try."""
"But she hadn't long taken the shirt in hand before it got far worse than ever, and with all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the darker and uglier was the shirt."
"Then all the other Trolls began to wash, but the longer it lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it was as black all over as if it had been up the chimney."
"""Ah!"" said the Prince, ""you're none of you worth a straw; you can't wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar lassie, I'll be bound she knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. COME IN, LASSIE!"""
he shouted.
"""All one to me,"" said the lad, ""I'd be just as glad to hear he had four heads beside; I'd like to see what kind of fellow he is. As for going, I won't go at all. I've done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I'm almost starved to death."""
"When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up."
"""Oh!"" said the Princess, ""now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword."""
"So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo! just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing. Halvor jumped behind the door."
"""HUTETU,"" said the Troll, as he put his head in at the door, ""what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"""Aye,"" said Halvor, ""you'll soon know that to your cost,"" and with that he hewed off all his heads."
"Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said:"
"""Would my sisters were free too!"""
"""Where are they?"" asked Halvor."
"Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by a Troll to his Castle which lay fifty miles off, and the other by another Troll to his Castle which was fifty miles further still."
"""But now,"" she said, ""you must first help me to get this ugly carcass out of the house."""
"Yes, Halvor was so strong he swept everything away, and made it all clean and tidy in no time. So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of grey dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day. When he first saw the Castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen. So Halvor went into the kitchen, and didn't stop there either, but went straight further on into the house."
"""Nay, nay,"" called out the Princess, ""dare Christian folk come hither? I don't know I'm sure how long it is since I came here, but in all that time I haven't seen a Christian man. 'Twere best you saw how to get away as fast as you came; for here lives a Troll who has six heads."""
"""I shan't go,"" said Halvor, ""if he has six heads besides."""
"""He'll take you up and swallow you down alive,"" said the Princess."
"But it was no good, Halvor wouldn't go; he wasn't at all afraid of the Troll, but meat and drink he must have, for he was half starved after his long journey. Well, he got as much of that as he wished, but then the Princess wanted him to be off again."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go, I've done no harm, and I've nothing to be afraid about."""
"""He won't stay to ask that,"" said the Princess, ""for he'll take you without law or leave; but as you won't go, just try if you can brandish that sword yonder, which the Troll wields in war."""
"He couldn't brandish it, and then the Princess said he must take a pull at the flask which hung by its side, and when he had done that he could brandish it."
"Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door. When the Troll got his first head in he called out:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in. The Princess was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of her sisters, and wished out loud they were free. Halvor thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off at once; but first he had to help the Princess to get the Troll's carcass out of the way, and so he could only set out next morning."
"It was a long way to the Castle, and he had to walk fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall he saw the Castle, which was far finer and grander than either of the others. This time he wasn't the least afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into the Castle. There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there was no end to her loveliness. She too like the others told him there hadn't been Christian folk there ever since she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the Troll would swallow him alive, and do you know, she said, he has nine heads."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""if he had nine other heads, and nine other heads still, I won't go away,"" and so he stood fast before the stove."
"The Princess kept on begging him so prettily to go away, lest the Troll should gobble him up, but Halvor said:"
"""Let him come as soon as he likes."""
"So she gave him the Troll's sword, and bade him take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish and wield it."
Just then back came the Troll puffing and blowing and tearing along.
"He was far bigger and stouter than the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get through the door. So when he got his first head in, he said as the others had said:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do, to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it."
"So all the Princesses came together to that Castle, which was called Soria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before, and they all were fond of Halvor and Halvor of them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three."
"At the wedding they drank and feasted both well and long; for feast they all could, even if they could not find the Princesses, and if they have not yet done feasting and drinking they must be at it still."
THE CAT ON THE DOVREFELL
"Once on a time there was a man up in Finnmark who had caught a great white bear, which he was going to take to the King of Denmark. Now, it so fell out, that he came to the Dovrefell just about Christmas Eve, and there he turned into a cottage where a man lived, whose name was Halvor, and asked the man if he could get house-room there for his bear and himself."
"""Heaven never help me, if what I say isn't true!"" said the man; ""but we can't give anyone house-room just now, for every Christmas Eve such a pack of Trolls come down upon us, that we are forced to flit, and haven't so much as a house over our own heads, to say nothing of lending one to anyone else."""
"""Oh?"" said the man, ""if that's all, you can very well lend me your house; my bear can lie under the stove yonder, and I can sleep in the side-room."""
"Well, he begged so hard, that at last he got leave to stay there; so the people of the house flitted out, and before they went, everything was got ready for the Trolls; the tables were laid, and there was rice porridge, and fish boiled in lye, and sausages, and all else that was good, just as for any other grand feast."
"So, when everything was ready, down came the Trolls. Some were great, and some were small; some had long tails, and some had no tails at all; some, too, had long, long noses; and they ate and drank, and tasted everything. Just then one of the little Trolls caught sight of the white bear, who lay under the stove; so he took a piece of sausage and stuck it on a fork, and went and poked it up against the bear's nose, screaming out:"
"""Pussy, will you have some sausage?"""
"Then the white bear rose up and growled, and hunted the whole pack of them out of doors, both great and small."
"Next year Halvor was out in the wood, on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, cutting wood before the holidays, for he thought the Trolls would come again; and just as he was hard at work, he heard a voice in the wood calling out:"
"""Halvor! Halvor!"""
"""Well,"" said Halvor, ""here I am."""
"""Have you got your big cat with you still?"""
"""Yes, that I have,"" said Halvor; ""she's lying at home under the stove, and what's more, she has now got seven kittens, far bigger and fiercer than she is herself."""
"""Oh, then, we'll never come to see you again,"" bawled out the Troll away in the wood, and he kept his word; for since that time the Trolls have never eaten their Christmas brose with Halvor on the Dovrefell."
ONE'S OWN CHILDREN ARE ALWAYS PRETTIEST
"A sportsman went out once into a wood to shoot, and he met a Snipe."
"""Dear friend,"" said the Snipe, ""don't shoot my children!"""
"""How shall I know your children?"" asked the Sportsman. ""What are they like?"""
"""Oh!"" said the Snipe, ""mine are the prettiest children in all the wood."""
"""Very well,"" said the Sportsman, ""I'll not shoot them; don't be afraid."""
"But for all that, when he came back, there he had a whole string of young snipes in his hand which he had shot."
"""Oh, oh!"" said the Snipe, ""why did you shoot my children after all?"""
"""What! these your children!"" said the Sportsman; ""why, I shot the ugliest I could find, that I did!"""
"""Woe is me!"" said the Snipe; ""don't you know that each one thinks his own children the prettiest in the world?"""
AMONG THE FOREST PEOPLE
MR. RED SQUIRREL COMES TO LIVE IN THE FOREST
"Life in the forest is very different from life in the meadow, and the forest people have many ways of doing which are not known in the world outside. They are a quiet people and do not often talk or sing when there are strangers near. You could never get acquainted with them until you had learned to be quiet also, and to walk through the underbrush without snapping twigs at every step. Then, if you were to live among them and speak their language, you would find that there are many things about which it is not polite to talk. And there is a reason for all this."
"In the meadow, although they have their quarrels and their own troubles, they always make it up again and are friendly, but in the forest there are some people who can never get along well together, and who do not go to the same parties or call upon each other. It is not because they are cross, or selfish, or bad. It is just because of the way in which they have to live and hunt, and they cannot help it any more than you could help having eyes of a certain color."
"These are things which are all understood in the forest, and the people there are careful what they say and do, so they get on very well indeed, and have many happy times in that quiet, dusky place. When people are born there, they learn these things without thinking about it, but when they come there from some other place it is very hard, for everybody thinks it stupid in strangers to ask about such simple matters."
Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
And to each of them the little slyboots replied:
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum too;     Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip.
"At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle, and he too called out"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin! Tum-pa  """
"But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at once, and cried: ""Hullo! you've turned yourself inside out, have you?"
"Just you come out of that!"""
Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.
Punchkin
Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.
"They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more clever than the rest. The Raja's wife died when they were quite little children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to take care of them."
"The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the affairs of the nation."
"About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her sisters, ""Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at her own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come here, we shall suffer for it some day."""
"But the other sisters would answer, ""Be quiet, Balna; why must you always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if she likes."" Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared for the Raja's dinner."
"Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated many successive days."
"At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room, and watched them through a hole in the wall."
"There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by the fire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, ""Why don't you keep fuel in your own house, and not come here every day and take ours? Sisters, don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself."""
"Then the eldest sister answered, ""Balna, let the poor woman take the wood and the fire; she does us no harm."" But Balna replied, ""If you let her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make us sorry for it, some day."""
"The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a little mud into each of the dishes."
"At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words, that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace."
"Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her, she did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them nothing but bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good food and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry and say:"
"""Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?"""
"One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the bad dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the beautiful tree."
"Then the Ranee said to her daughter, ""I cannot tell how it is, every day those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than you do. I cannot tell how it is."" And she bade her watch the seven Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat."
"So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and were eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them, and saw them gathering the fruit."
"""Of corse he will,"" said the hairy boy to the right of Whomsoever J."
"Opper, who afterwards became the father of a lad who grew up to be editor of the Persiflage column of the Atlantic Monthly."
Thus the boys of America impressed General Gage with their courage and patriotism and grew up to be good men.
"An expedition to Canada was fitted out the same winter, and an attack made on Quebec, in which General Montgomery was killed and Benedict Arnold showed that he was a brave soldier, no matter how the historian may have hopped on him afterwards."
"The Americans should not have tried to take Canada. Canada was, as Henry Clay once said, a persimmon a trifle too high for the American pole, and it is the belief of the historian, whose tears have often wet the pages of this record, that in the future Canada will be what America is now, a free country with a national debt of her own, a flag of her own, an executive of her own, and a regular annual crisis of her own, like other nations."
"In 1776 Boston was evacuated. Washington, in order to ascertain whether Lord Howe had a call to fish, cut bait, or go ashore, began to fortify Dorchester Heights, March 17, and on the following morning he was not a little surprised to note the change. As the weather was raw, and he had been in-doors a good deal during the winter, Lord Howe felt the cold very keenly. He went to the window and looked at the Americans, but he would come back chilly and ill-tempered to the fire each time. Finally he hitched up and went away to Halifax, where he had acquaintances."
"On June 28 an attack was made by the English on Fort Moultrie. It was built of palmetto logs, which are said to be the best thing in the world to shoot into if one wishes to recover the balls and use them again."
"Palmetto logs accept and retain balls for many years, and are therefore good for forts."
"When the fleet got close enough to the fort so that the brave Charlestonians could see the expression on the admiral's face, they turned loose with everything they had, grape, canister, solid shot, chain-shot, bar-shot, stove-lids, muffin-irons, newspaper cuts, etc., etc., so that the decks were swept of every living thing except the admiral."
"General Clinton by land tried to draw the attention of the rear gunners of the fort, but he was a poor draughtsman, and so retired, and both the land and naval forces quit Charleston and went to New York, where board was not so high."
July 4 was deemed a good time to write a Declaration of Independence and have it read in the grove.
"Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, moved that ""the United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and Independent states."" John Adams, of Massachusetts, seconded the resolution. This was passed July 2, and the report of the committee appointed to draw up a Declaration of Independence was adopted July 4."
"The Declaration was dictated by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the most melodious English of any American of his time."
"Jefferson had a vocabulary next to Noah Webster, with all the dramatic power of Dan. He composed the piece one evening after his other work. We give a facsimile of the opening lines."
"Philadelphia was a scene of great excitement. The streets were thronged, and people sat down on the nice clean door-steps with perfect recklessness, although the steps had just been cleaned with ammonia and wiped off with a chamois-skin. It was a day long to be remembered, and one that made George III. wish that he had reconsidered his birth."
"In the steeple of the old State-House was a bell which had fortunately upon it the line ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof."" It was rung by the old man in charge, though he had lacked faith up to that moment in Congress. He believed that Congress would not pass the resolution and adopt the Declaration till after election."
"Thus was the era of good feeling inaugurated both North and South. There was no North then, no South, no East, no West; just one common country, with Washington acting as father of same. Oh, how nice it must have been!"
Washington was one of the sweetest men in the United States. He gave his hand in marriage to a widow woman who had two children and a dark red farm in Virginia.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
"The British army now numbered thirty thousand troops, while Washington's entire command was not over seven thousand strong. The Howes, one a general and the other an admiral, now turned their attention to New York. Washington, however, was on the ground beforehand."
"Howe's idea was to first capture Brooklyn, so that he could have a place in which to sleep at nights while engaged in taking New York."
"The battle was brief. Howe attacked the little army in front, while General Clinton got around by a circuitous route to the rear of the Colonial troops and cut them off. The Americans lost one thousand men by death or capture. The prisoners were confined in the old sugar-house on Liberty Street, where they suffered the most miserable and indescribable deaths."
"The army of the Americans fortunately escaped by Fulton Ferry in a fog, otherwise it would have been obliterated. Washington now fortified Harlem Heights, and later withdrew to White Plains. Afterwards he retired to a fortified camp called North Castle."
"Howe feared to attack him there, and so sent the Hessians, who captured Fort Washington, November 16."
"It looked scaly for the Americans, as Motley says, and Philadelphia bade fair to join New York and other cities held by the British. The English van could be seen from the Colonial rear column. The American troops were almost barefooted, and left their blood-stained tracks on the frozen road."
"It was at this time that Washington crossed the Delaware and thereby found himself on the other side; while Howe decided to remain, as the river was freezing, and when the ice got strong enough, cross over and kill the Americans at his leisure. Had he followed the Colonial army, it is quite sure now that the English would have conquered, and the author would have been the Duke of Sandy Bottom, instead of a plain American citizen, unknown, unhonored, and unsung."
"""How soon will you be leaving?"" she asked."
"""The wound was superficial. I really didn't need to be hospitalized. I'm"
"being released tomorrow morning. I'll probably leave immediately."""
"""You'll make a fine doctor, Frank."""
"""Thank you, I'll try."""
"""Good-bye, Frank."""
"""Good-bye--darling."""
She turned and fled.
"And judging by the deep sadness in his soul, he knew he had hit bottom."
There was no place to go but up.

Brent Taber's phone rang.
"""Hello, Taber. Halliday here."""
"""How are you, Halliday."""
"""Tops, old man. Ragged by the stress of it all, of course, but tops."""
"Taber waited. Halliday waited. Seeing that he would get no help, he"
"said, ""By the way, that little ... misunderstanding we had, the Senator"
“I do not. I eat with my sister.”
“The Marchesa di Vaccarone?”
“Yes.”

_RUSKIN AND THE PHILISTINES_
They reached the hotel and Cæsar introduced his friend to Laura.
“He is an admirer of yours.”
"“A respectful admirer... from a distance,” explained Kennedy."
"“But are there admirers of that sort?” asked Laura, laughing."
"“Here you have one,” said the Englishman. “I have known you by sight"
"ever since I came to Rome, and have never had the pleasure of speaking"
to you until today.”
“And have you been here a long time?”
“Nearly two years.”
"""I have not long to live,"" said Tyapa, quietly."
Once the teacher asked how he had learned to read.
"""In prison,"" answered Tyapa, shortly."
"""Have you been there?"""
"""I was there...."""
"""For what?"""
"""Just so....  It was a mistake....  But I brought the Bible out with me"
"from there.  A lady gave it to me....  It is good in prison, brother."""
"""Is that so?  And why?"""
"""It teaches one....  I learned to read there....  I also got this"
"book....  And all these you see, free...."""
"When the teacher appeared in the dosshouse, Tyapa had already lived"
"there for some time.  He looked long into the teacher's face, as if to"
discover what kind of a man he was.  Tyapa often listened to his
"conversation, and once, sitting down beside him, said:"
"""I see you are very learned.... Have you read the Bible?"""
"""I have read it...."""
"""I see; I see.... Can you remember it?"""

_THE MONK WITH THE RED NOSE_
The next day Cæsar was finishing dressing when the servant told him
that a gentleman was waiting for him.
“Who is it?” asked Cæsar.
“It’s a monk.”
"Cæsar went to the salon and there found a tall monk with an evil face,"
"a red nose, and a worn habit."
"Cæsar recalled having seen him, but didn’t know where."
“What can I do for you?” asked Cæsar.
"“I come from His Eminence, Cardinal Fort. I must speak with you.”"
“Let’s go into the dining-room. We shall be alone there.”
“It would be better to talk in your room.”
"“No, there is no one here. Besides, I have to eat breakfast. Will you"
join me?”
"“No, thanks,” said the monk."
Cæsar remembered having seen that face in the Altemps palace. He was
doubtless one of the domestic monks who had been with the Abbé Preciozi.
AT DIEPPE.
AFTER SUNSET.
THE sea lies quieted beneath
The after-sunset flush
That leaves upon the heaped grey clouds
The grape’s faint purple blush.
"Pale, from a little space in heaven"
"Of delicate ivory,"
The sickle-moon and one gold star
Look down upon the sea.
ON THE BEACH.
"NIGHT, a grey sky, a ghostly sea,"
The soft beginning of the rain:
"Black on the horizon, sails that wane"
Into the distance mistily.
"The tide is rising, I can hear"
The soft roar broadening far along;
It cries and murmurs in my car
"Entman sighed. ""I wish I could get some of the data those creatures"
"used in the construction of the androids."""
"""You'd like to make one of your own?"""
"""It would solve the servant problem. Terrible here in Washington."""
"""Labor unions would holler bloody murder."""
"""You can't stop progress."""
Suddenly Entman got to his feet. He walked to the edge of the patio and
looked upward. Taber saw his face in the light streaming from the living
room--he seemed frightened.
"""Brent! It's such a helpless feeling. What do we do?"""
"Brent Taber got up and went over and stood beside Entman. He, too,"
"looked up into the velvet night; the beautiful, quiet, impersonal night."
The sinister night.
"""We watch the stars,"" Brent said. ""And we wait."""

Frank Corson rang the bell and waited at the door of Rhoda Kane's
apartment. The door opened. She wore a pale blue brunch coat. Her hair
"glowed in the light of midmorning, but her face was pale and a little"
drawn.
"Her eyes were slightly red, as though she might have been crying."
"""Hello, Rhoda."""
"""Hello, Frank."""
"""I really didn't expect to find you. I was going to write a note and"
"slip it under the door."""
"""I didn't feel well today so I didn't go to work."""
"""May I come in?"""
"""Of course."""
"""I don't know, Rhoda. I should know but I don't. I should have known"
what was wrong so I could have done something about it. It just went
"sour, I guess."""
She turned and walked to the window. He wondered if there were tears in
her eyes.
"""Good-bye, Rhoda."""
"""Good-bye, Frank. I'm sorry."""
"The door hadn't quite closed. Now, as Frank Corson turned, he found it"
open. A man stood there--a man in a blue suit with empty eyes.
Frank stared at the man for long seconds. His eyes went toward the
"window. Rhoda had turned. She was watching the man in the doorway,"
looking past Frank at the creature from somewhere in space who was
neither man nor machine. _But how--?_ Frank Corson asked himself the
question. _Good God! How had this thing come about?_
"""Not--not _him_,"" he finally exploded."
Rhoda was walking forward. The look of fevered excitement was in her
"eyes. ""Please leave, Frank."" She did not look at him as she spoke. She"
kept her eyes on the man in the blue suit.
"""Not him!"""
"""Please leave, Frank."""
But it was too late. The door had closed. The man was looking at Frank.
"""Sit down,"" he said."

tearing off his blouse.
"""Oh, Lav, what'll we do! What are you going to do now?"" cried Sidney."
"""It's so black,"" wailed Pola. ""I'm--sick!"""
"""I'm going to swim ashore. It's the only way. I don't know how long"
"this old tub'll stand a sea and the wind's rising. We got to get help."""
"""You shan't swim alone, Lavender Green. We'll _all_ swim. That's"
"nothing of a swim--"""
"""You can't! You forget--Pola."""
"Sidney wheeled in consternation. ""Pola's complex!"" The girl was"
"crouched, now, on the deck, an abject, wailing figure."
"""You go with Lav, Mart,"" said Sidney in a quiet voice. ""I'll stay with"
"Pola."""
"""What do you think I am? I guess I'll stay with her too!"""
"""But your grandmother--"""
"""Oh, gran'ma!"" Mart's voice choked. ""But she'd be the one to _tell_ me"
"to stay--"""
"""It's no use our all trying it,"" muttered Lav. ""I'll get there or I"
"won't get anywhere."""
"""Maybe it's too far for you to swim!"" Sidney was at Lavender's side,"
"""You like pleasure, I believe."""
Fiorsen said violently:
"""Look here: I have done with your friendship--you are no friend to me.  I"
"have never really known you, and I should not wish to.  It is finished."
"Leave me in peace."""
Rosek smiled.
"""My dear, that is all very well, but friendships are not finished like"
"that.  Moreover, you owe me a thousand pounds."""
"""Well, I will pay it.""  Rosek's eyebrows mounted.  ""I will.  Gyp will"
"lend it to me."""
"""Oh!  Is Gyp so fond of you as that?  I thought she only loved her"

"Crouching forward with his knees drawn up, Fiorsen hissed out:"
"""Don't talk of Gyp!  Get out of this!  I will pay you your thousand"
"pounds."""
"Rosek, still smiling, answered:"
"""Gustav, don't be a fool!  With a violin to your shoulder, you are a man."
"Without--you are a child.  Lie quiet, my friend, and think of Mr. Wagge."
But you had better come and talk it over with me. Good-bye for the
"moment.  Calm yourself.""  And, flipping the ash off his cigarette on to"
"the tray by Fiorsen's elbow, he nodded and went."
CLARE.  When every day and every night!--Oh!  I know it's my fault

on him.  At home they've got every bit as much as they can do to keep
going.
CLARE.  I know.
HUNTINGDON.  And you've got to think of the girls.  Any trouble would

"CLARE.  Thanks, old boy, of course not."
HUNTINGDON.  Can't you try to see George's side of it a bit?
CLARE.  I do.  Oh!  don't let's talk about it.
"HUNTINGDON.  Well, my child, there's just one thing you won't go"

Frank Corson lay propped on two pillows in a private room of the Park
Hill Hospital. Rhoda Kane sat in a chair beside the bed. She was pale
and very beautiful. The fire was now gone from her body and the fever
from her eyes.

"looked down quickly, then slowly raised her head."
"""Yes."""
"""I'll--I'll never understand. I get sick thinking about it. I'll just"

"""He was human and yet not human. He had extraordinary powers that we"
"don't begin to understand, so that what happened to you is no disgrace."""
"""It's a terrible disgrace."""
"""It happened to me, too. When he told me to sit down I had to do it. I"
"was helpless."""
"""But you fought! You overcame it."""
"Frank Corson smiled wryly. ""No, I didn't. It was just that he'd had"
"little time to work on me. It was a single mental blow, so to speak,"
"that laid me out. Like one punch in the ring. Gradually, I came out of"

"""Only think, Alicia!"" she cried. ""Dick is on his way home, and with such"
"good news. We've just had a cable from him."""
"""Coming back!"""
"""Yes. He's engaged! He met the Grangers on their tour round the"
"world--you know them, the great cotton people?--at Sydney, and he's"
"engaged to the youngest girl, Violet--you remember her? It all happened"
in a fortnight. Mary and Lord Eynesford are delighted. It's just
"perfect. She's very pretty, and tremendously well off. I do declare, I"
never thought Dick would end so well! What a happy thought it was
"sending him away! Aren't you delighted?"""
"""It sounds very nice, doesn't it? I don't think I knew her more than"

"""Dick'll be here in four days. I've been looking for you to tell you for"
"the last hour. Where have you been?"""
"""In the Park."""

"""Well, I met the Medlands and Mr. Norburn, and talked to them for a"

"""No, Eleanor, I'm tired, and--and hot. I'll go to my room."""

"Frank Corson entered the office of Wilson Maynard, Superintendent of"
Park Hill Hospital. Maynard looked out over the tops of his
"old-fashioned pince-nez glasses and said, ""Oh, Doctor Corson. You phoned"
"for a chat."""
It was the rather pompous superintendent's way of saying he was happy to
give Frank Corson a little time. He considered all the doctors and
"nurses at Park Hill his ""boys and girls,"" and he did the ""father"" bit"
very well.
"""Yes, I--"""
"Maynard peered even harder. ""You don't look well, Frank. Pale. You've"
"been working too hard."""
"GEORGE.  I tell you plainly, as a man of the world, I don't believe"
"in the guide, philosopher and friend business."
CLARE.  Thank you.
A silence.  CLARE suddenly clasps her hands behind her head.
CLARE.  Let me go!  You'd be much happier with any other woman.
GEORGE.  Clare!
CLARE.  I believe--I'm sure I could earn my living.  Quite serious.
GEORGE.  Are you mad?
CLARE.  It has been done.

"“It is rumored,” began Kennedy, “that an attempt was made on your safe"

"“Yes,” he admitted, taking off his glasses and polishing them"

hear that a somewhat similar attempt was made on the safe of my friend
Herman Schloss in Maiden Lane.”
“You lost nothing?”
Moulton put his glasses on and looked Kennedy in the face frankly.

_C. Custance._ And he stood by
"While Ralph Roister Doister, with help of Merrygreek,"
For promise of marriage did unto me seek.
_T. Trusty._ And had ye made any promise before them twain?
"_C. Custance._ No, I had rather be torn in pieces and slain."
"No man hath my faith and troth but Gawin Goodluck,"
"And that before Suresby did I say, and there stuck;"
But of certain letters there were such words spoken--
_T. Trusty._ He told me that too.
"_C. Custance._ And of a ring and token,"
"That Suresby, I spied, did more than half suspect"
That I my faith to Gawin Goodluck did reject.
"_T. Trusty._ But was there no such matter, Dame Custance, indeed?"
"_C. Custance._ If ever my head thought it, God send me ill speed!"
Wherefore I beseech you with me to be a witness
That in all my life I never intended thing less.

“Thinking me dead?”
“Yes.”
"He looked at her for a few seconds, then slapped his thigh and, rising"

The tears stood in Yvonne’s eyes.
"“Oh, but it’s comic. You don’t find it so?”"
He leant back against the railings and laughed again in genuine
merriment.

Yvonne shook her head.

The lorgnettes were turned upon him:
"“It’s that ridiculous Mr. Ffolliott,” said she; and laughed"
immoderately.
"Ffolliott sighed, and turned away:"

He sat down.

He watched Fosse button-hole Gomme; and he saw Gomme’s lips smile

"""Yes, yes, soon again!  Spoiling yourself, playing for that fiddler!"

"Now, four hours a day for six weeks--and we shall have something again."""
Gyp said softly:

Monsieur Harmost bounded.
"""What!  That is a tragedy!""  Gyp shook her head.  ""You like it?  A baby!"
"Does it not squall?"""
"""Very little."""
"""Mon Dieu!  Well, well, you are still as beautiful as ever.  That is"

The affair seemed to cause him intense amusement. A ray of light
appeared to Yvonne.

The two men entered the sea-chamber together. Stella welcomed her Great

sit down.
"“I 'm afraid I can't stay, Stellamaris. I have to go back to London.”"
Stella glanced at the clock. “Your train does n't go for an hour.” She
was jealously learned in trains.
“I think John wants to talk to you.”

"Stella, “and I want to talk to you.”"
"“He has something very particular to say, Stellamaris.”"
"“What is it, Belovedest?” Her eyes sparkled, and she clasped her hands"
over her childish bosom. “You are not going to marry Belinda Molyneux?”
"“No, dear,” said John; “I'm not going to marry anybody.”"
“I'm so glad.” She turned to Herold. “Are you going to get married?”

'Where is he?' I asked sternly.

"'Nonsense, mother!' I said. 'Who is in the house besides yourself?'"
"'What is that to you?' she replied, breathing short."
"'I have told you,' I said, trying to control my anger. 'I----'"
"But, quick as lightning, the door slammed to and cut me short. I had"

remained closed.

'Whose house is that?' I asked him.
"'Herr Krapp's,' he answered."
"'I am a stranger,' I said. 'Is he a man of substance?'"
The person I addressed smiled. 'He is a member of the Council of

“Yes.”

“Where?”
They walked to the Piazza del Popólo and through the Via Babuino to the
Piazza di Spagna.
“Would you like to go to a Benedictine abbey tomorrow?” asked Kennedy.
“All right.”
"“And if you are still melancholy, we will leave you there.”"
_THE ABBEY_
"The next day, after lunch, Kennedy and Cæsar went to visit the abbey of"
"Sant’ Anselmo on the Aventine. The abbot, Hildebrand, was a friend"
"of Kennedy’s, and like him an Englishman."
They took a carriage and Kennedy told it to stop at the church of Santa
Sabina.
"“It is still too early to go to the abbey. Let us look at this church,"
which is the best preserved of all the old Roman ones.”
They entered the church; but it was so cold there that Cæsar went out
again directly and waited in the porch. There was a man there selling
"rosaries and photographs who spoke scarcely any Italian or French, but"
did speak Spanish. Probably he was a Jew.
"Cæsar asked him where they manufactured those religious toys, and the"
pedlar told him in Westphalia.

"""Ford? _Ford?_ Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand...."""
After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few
"moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided"
"miserably. Besides, she was a girl."
"All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could"
help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to
"him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a"
little better.
"The door opened on the signal, ""Sesame."" When Butt saw somebody was"
"with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his"
fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.
"He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered"
his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump
when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.
"""An honor, Miss Sparling,"" he said in that rumbly voice. ""Please come"

So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the

"Charlotte. “I agree with mother,” she cried triumphantly. “The train"
overweights it.”
"Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,"
"dozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it,"
he was tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls
were too much for him to-night. They were too... too.... But all his
drowsing brain could think of was—too _rich_ for him. And somewhere at
the back of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man
climbing up endless flights of stairs. Who was he?
"“I shan’t dress to-night,” he muttered."
"“What do you say, father?”"
"“Eh, what, what?” Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at"
"them. “I shan’t dress to-night,” he repeated."
"“But, father, we’ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs."
Teddie Walker.”
“It will look so _very_ out of the picture.”
"“Don’t you feel well, dear?”"
“You needn’t make any effort. What is Charles _for_?”
"“But if you’re really not up to it,” Charlotte wavered."
“Very well! Very well!” Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....

critic. He has written a eulogy of Anthony Bickersteth that is to
appear in a few days--you must win his favour to your poems.”
The old baronet cackled with senile laughter.
Fosse threw up his head. He glowed. He felt that all eyes were upon him.
"“Yes,” he said--“my eulogy appears to-morrow.” He forgot to bawl."
Sir Gilders put his hand to his ear: the entrance and stir of the
arriving guests and their announcement and greetings perplexed his weak
hearing:
“Eh?” said he--“borrow? Why borrow?”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” cried Fosse, getting very hot--“I did not say"
borrow--I said my eulogy appears to-morrow.”

If a pirate is to be reckoned by the amount of damage he does and the

"be placed at the very head of his profession, for he is said to have taken"
over 400 vessels. The only man who can be said to rival him is Sir Henry
"Morgan, but Morgan, although in some ways an unmitigated blackguard, was a"
"man of much greater breadth of outlook than Roberts ever was, and,"
"moreover, was a buccaneer rather than a pirate."
"Roberts, like many other successful pirates, was born in Wales, not far"
"from Haverfordwest. He is described as being ""a tall black man,"" and was"

"The woman opened the door and they went into the church. It was small,"
overcharged with ornaments. They saw the tomb of Bishop Spinelli and
"Giotto’s Virgin, and then went into a hall gay with red flags with a"
"white cross, on whose walls they could read the names of the Grand"
Masters of the Order of Malta. The majority of the names were French and
"Polish. Two or three were Spanish, and among them that of Cæsar Borgia."
"“Your countryman and namesake was also a Grand Master of Malta,” said"
Kennedy.
"“So it seems,” replied Cæsar with indifference. “I see that you speak"
with contempt of that extraordinary man. Is he not congenial to you?”

Quogge Myre stared at his little disciple with contempt; a sneer played
about his puffy lip--became too tense for silence:
"“This man repeats what I say--what I _used_ to say--like flattery,” he"
said.
Lovegood smiled grimly:
"“Oh,” said he--“_he_ stays in Paris sometimes now. And there are the"
French newspapers.”
Myre shrugged his shoulders:
“I have changed all my ideas on these subjects----”
But the ridiculous figure of Ffolliott strolled nervously up to the
"group, and interrupting the critical vapourings of Quogge Myre, he said"
with affected drawl:
"“D’you know, I feel such an awful ass--and I don’t get used to it.”"
Lovegood gazed at him solemnly:
"“Young fellow,” said he--“you must not be egotistical--it’s bad for the"
morals. Try and forget yourself in that disguise.”
"“I can’t,” drawled Ffolliott miserably--“I am quite angry with"
Rippley--he told me it was a fancy-dress affair--and----”

"The count bowed himself out and left me to decipher, if I could, the"

"Abbé was George Hamilton, and for the moment my heart almost stopped"
"beating. If he should come to England on the French king's business,"
"which could be nothing more nor less than the Dunkirk affair, and"
"should be discovered, there would be a public entertainment on Tyburn"
"Hill, with George as the central figure."
"When I found a spare hour, I hastened to see Lilly and came upon the"

Hamilton. It was short and in cipher:--

and very carefully wrapped them up. They too went into the bag.

"""You needn't believe _me_,"" he answered her. ""Ask Mr. Jobling. He'll"
"tell you."""
"Mr. Jobling coughed importantly. ""I'll tell you all I know myself, Lady"
"Josceline,"" he promised her, and proceeded to repeat in part what he had"
"told Slyne on the terrace the night before concerning the Jura family,"
but without a single word of the fortune awaiting the next of kin.
Captain Dove's face expressed the extreme of astonishment as he too sat
listening with the closest attention.
"""That's as far as my present knowledge goes,"" the lawyer finished"
"blandly. ""And now--I understand that Captain Dove is prepared to supply"
the proof required in conclusion.
"""How long have you known Lady Josceline, Captain Dove?"""
"Captain Dove frowned as if in deep thought, and Slyne looked very"
crossly at him.
"""About three quarters of an hour,"" the old man answered, and, glancing"
"at Slyne, chuckled hoarsely. ""She's only been Lady Josceline for so"
"long."""
Mr. Jobling nodded understanding and the creases on his fleshy forehead
disappeared again.

"Then they went down to a hall, at whose door there were guards dressed"

There was a loud ringing of the door-bell.
Pangbutt put his hand over his eyes:
"“I must be going mad,” he said."
Rippley bowed:
"“Sir Pangboot--me and me friends, we speak not very well ze"

"“Yes, yes.” Pangbutt dismissed them impatiently. “Get to your"

"As the four comic-looking foreign waiters left the room, he hesitated,"
"bewildered. And Rippley, as they passed out, nearly burst a bloodvessel"
as the tragic Blotte’s moustache fell off. But Pangbutt had suddenly
remembered that he was host; and advancing into the room he turned to
the others:

"laid a hand on each other."""
"Dr. Carew stared at her in puzzlement as she went on. ""They threw every"
"hard thing in the room at each other, without ever touching anything. It"
"was like some ghastly, murderous game. A clock flew through the air like"
"a cannonball, straight at Joseph's head, and some unseen force seemed to"
stop it. For a second it hung there and trembled in the air--_with
nothing under it_; then it turned and flew like lightning at Quincy; he
barely dodged it.
"""Finally a vase did find its mark and Quincy fell to the floor. Joseph"
"stepped over him and came toward me. I ran, slamming the door in his"

"A glance at the photograph, which she fairly snatched out of his hands,"
convinced the Girl of the truthfulness of his assertion. With a movement

ERASMUS AT BASLE
1521-9
Basle his dwelling-place for nearly eight years:
1521-9--Political thought of Erasmus--Concord and
peace--Anti-war writings--Opinions concerning princes and
government--New editions of several Fathers--The
"_Colloquia_--Controversies with Stunica, Beda, etc.--Quarrel"
with Hutten--Eppendorff
It is only towards the evening of life that the picture of Erasmus
acquires the features with which it was to go down to posterity. Only at
Basle--delivered from the troublesome pressure of parties wanting to
"enlist him, transplanted from an environment of haters and opponents at"
"Louvain to a circle of friends, kindred spirits, helpers and admirers,"
"emancipated from the courts of princes, independent of the patronage of"
"""When it gets dark I'm coming out to the _Arabella_ and stay all night."
Maybe they'll come back and I'll find out why. That fellow said
something 'bout Rockman's not being safe. They'll learn the _Arabella_
"isn't safe either!"""
"""But Lav, I'm coming with you!"""
"""You can't. And this isn't any work for a girl to get mixed up in."""
Sidney drew herself to her full height.
"""Lavender Green, if you think you're going to lose me _now_ you're"
mistaken. I guess we went into this in a sort of partnership and it's
going to hold. I found out just as much as you did! And if you come out
"to the _Arabella_, _I'm_ coming, and Mart, too, if she's home."""
Lav still hesitated.
"""Aunt Achsa won't let you. How'd you get away?"""
"This staggered Sidney for a moment, then she thought of a ""way."" This"
was Wednesday night and Miss Letty had said that on Wednesday night she
was going to drive to Truro and that Sidney might go with her. From
Truro Miss Letty was going on to Wellfleet. Aunt Achsa would think
Sidney wanted to see Cap'n Davies again. She explained all this
"breathlessly to Lavender. ""This is important enough to warrant a fib."
And when it's all over Aunt Achsa will understand. Let's go home now
"and find Mart."""
Unwillingly Lavender conceded Sidney's right to share with him his
night's vigil at any cost. Again they beached the dory near Sunset Lane.
"""Proceed, count."""
"""Monsieur le Comte Hamilton begs me to say that he was called away from"
"London early to-day on the king's business, but that he will return"
in four weeks. When he returns he will do himself the honor to send
"me again, asking you to name a friend, unless you prefer to apologize,"
"which no gentleman would do in a case of this sort. You said, I am told,"
"that Monsieur le Comte lied. If you admit that he did not lie, of course"
"you admit that you did. So, im-pos-si-ble! There must be to fight!"""
"""Do you know, count, the cause of my having given Count Hamilton the"
"lie?"" I asked."
"""I did not inquire,"" he answered smilingly. ""To me it was to carry the"
"message."""
"""George Hamilton is your friend, is he not?"" I asked."
"""Yes, but far more, he is the friend of my king, and will make entreaty"
"with my monarch for my return to France,"" answered De Grammont."
"""It was because of Count Hamilton's insulting reference to his brother"
"that I used the ugly word,"" I returned."
"""A-ah, that is different!"" Then recovering himself quickly: ""But I"
undertook the mission. It is to finish. Monsieur George Hamilton? My
friend? My king's friend? If it had been known to me! But you have the

"A Carolina pirate, accused and acquitted on a charge of having captured a"
"sloop belonging to Samuel Salters, of Bermuda, in 1699."
"TUCKER, ROBERT."
Of the Island of Jamaica.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried, condemned, and hanged at"
"Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718. The prisoners were not"
"defended by counsel, because the members of the South Carolina Bar still"
"deemed it ""a base and vile thing to plead for money or reward."" We"
understand that the barristers of South Carolina have since persuaded
"themselves to overcome this prejudice. The result was that, with the"
"famous Judge Trott, a veritable terror to pirates, being President of the"
"Court of Vice-Admiralty, the prisoners had short and ready justice, and"
all but four of the thirty-five pirates tried were found guilty.
"TUCKERMAN, CAPTAIN."
Sailed with Captain Porter in the West Indies. Captain Johnson gives an
account of the meeting between these two pirate novices and the great
Captain Roberts at Hispaniola.
"‘What does this mean, Pa?’ cried I."
"They gathered themselves up, shamelessly--laughed--ye gods, twittingly,"
"at _me_! Wholly unabashed, Pa, shaking himself into comfort in his"
"clothes, slapped me upon the back:"
"‘Horace, my son----’"
"‘Don’t be familiar, Sir Pompey,’ said I. ‘You are speaking to the heir"
to a baronetcy.’
The baronet laughed vulgarly:
"‘Mrs. Bartholomew Doome,’ he said--‘allow me to introduce to you"
"Horace, my son--at least, my reputed son.’"
"Bows, chassées, and greetings."
"‘Horace--the Misses Doome, Master Horace Doome, and Master Oliver"
Doome----’
The old gentleman slapped me upon the back again with mighty hand that
near drove me down amongst the fire-irons.
He dug me in the ribs:
"‘The rogue’s been married this seven years,’ cried he; ‘and now he’s"
"signed the deeds as partner in Malahide and Son, and you’re just in"
"the nick of time, the fool of a lawyer is upstairs--only--look here,"
"Horace, you must, like Doome, sign a bond not to touch the business"
arrangements--you and he would wreck the counting-house in six
months....’

SAN BLAS WOMAN IN DAILY GARB]
"“Among the San Blas Indians, who are at a far higher level of"
"civilization, the exclusion of aliens is the result of well-founded"
political reasons. Their respected traditions are a long record of proud
independence; they have maintained the purity of their race and enjoyed
freely for hundreds of years every inch of their territory. They feel
that the day the negro or the white man acquires a foothold in their
"midst these privileges will become a thing of the past. This is why,"
CHAPTER XVIII
"""HOOK!"""
Sidney found it a little difficult to take up the fun with her
erstwhile chums where she had left off. When she stopped at the
"Calkins' house directly after breakfast, Mart coolly declined to go"
"anywhere with her, and smiled scornfully at her bare legs."
"""I s'pose your million-dollar friend is otherwise engaged today!"""
"Sidney truthfully admitted that she was. ""She's gone to Chatham with"
her mother to see some people they know. And I'm glad. I've been just
"dying for a good swim. Let's go out to the _Arabella_ this morning."""
But Mart declared she was tired of all that. In fact she was tired of
doing lots of the silly things they'd been doing. She'd promised Gert
Bartow to go there right after lunch.
Sidney had no choice but to go on alone in search of Lav. She was
discouraged to the point of tears. Yet she knew in her heart that she
deserved Mart's coldness. She remembered how she had felt once when
Nancy had deserted her for a new girl at Miss Downs'. And it had
seriously threatened their friendship.
As she wandered slowly toward the town Sidney wondered what Mart and
Gert Bartow were going to do. Gert Bartow was a girl of nineteen at
"least, and much more grown up than even that. Mart had pointed her out"
to Sidney. Sidney wished Mart had asked her to go with her to Gert's.
She felt very lonely.
"Asiatic countries. We are said to be the successors of the Tartars, at"

Russia would be more fittingly the successor of the Tartars. The Tartar
races have been merged in the Russian Empire.
"'I am sure,' added Baron Suyematsu, in a final word, 'that Europe will"
"soon find its fears about the ""spectre of Japan"" are all ill-founded."
"England, I am glad to believe, never had those fears, and before long I"
hope to see her colonies in the same frame of mind. I hope the
Commonwealth Parliament will lead the way.'

THE ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE AND AMERICA[1]
AN INTERVIEW
"'Our people,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'like the British people, favour"
the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. They also favour its
"extension. The nature of such extension demands careful thought, of"
"course. I will not go into details, but I will say that a more effectual"
"alliance is desirable from the standpoints of both England and Japan,"
and I also think from the standpoint of America. Japan's interest is too
"obvious to require mention; but England's interest, in my opinion, is"
equally real. Russia and England are in contact throughout Asia and
friction is constant. England needs strengthening against Russia and
the better for it.
"83,672. He could not understand why men went to Japan and Canada instead"
of coming to India on better terms. It was a mystery to him. He thought
it was either sheer ignorance or the spread of the commercial spirit.
"83,673. All the students coming to his side of the University, were, as"
"a rule, keen and anxious to learn; he could not wish for better"
students.
"83,674. (Mr. Gupta). He desired one service, because he thought it was"
"most degrading that certain men, although they were doing the same work,"
"should be classed in a Provincial Service, while others should be"
classed in an Imperial Service. The prospect of the members of the
"Provincial Service were not at all what they ought to be, and that was"
the reason why the best men were not attracted to it.
PROF. J. C. BOSE AT MADURA
On his way back to Calcutta from the Fourth Scientific Deputation to the
"West, Prof. J. C. Bose visited Madura, 14th June 1915. The Tamil Sangam"
presented him with an address. In reply Dr. Bose made an important
"speech, in course of which he said:--"
I am no longer a representative of Bengal nor have I come to a strange
"place, but as an Indian addressing the mighty India and her people. When"
we realise that unity of our destiny then a great future opens out for
us.
"friendly girl letters they are, too, not of the type that preach, but"
of the kind which give sound and helpful advice in a bright and
interesting manner. Of course there is a splendid young man who also
"gives advice. Any ""What-shall-I-do"" young girl can read of the careers"
"suggested for Joy Kent with profit and pleasure, and, perhaps, with"
surprise!

THE HARBOR MASTER
_By Theodore Goodridge Roberts_
"Author of ""Comrades of the Trails,"" ""Rayton: A Backwoods Mystery,"""
etc.
"_12mo, cloth decorative, with a frontispiece in full color by John"
Goss. Net $1.25; postpaid $1.40_
The scene of the story is Newfoundland. The story deals with the love
"of Black Dennis Nolan, a young giant and self-appointed skipper of the"
"little fishing hamlet of Chance Along, for Flora Lockhart, a beautiful"
"professional singer, who is rescued by Dennis from a wreck on the"
"treacherous coast of Newfoundland, when on her way from England to the"
"United States. The story is a strong one all through, with a mystery"
"that grips, plenty of excitement and action, and the author presents"
life in the open in all its strength and vigor. Mr. Roberts is one of
the younger writers whom the critics have been watching with interest.
"In ""The Harbor Master"" he has surely arrived."
"""They was here first,"" said Lampert obstinately."
"""But the hisland is British ground,"" urged Simcox, ""and where our"
flag flies no Frenchman can have the best.  We gives 'em liberty to
"trade, and they can take what's left.  What for have we always beat"
"'em if we're to give in now?"""
"""Continuosity of foreign politics is my motter,"" said the skipper."
"""With continuosity and joodishus firmness, and a polite 'hout o'"
"this,' you'll see 'em listen to reason, and evacuate.  I shall send"
"hin my hultimatum this very afternoon.  And you, Simcox, shall be"
"hambassador."""
Simcox looked anxious.
"""Well, captain, I was thinking it would be judicious policy to send"
in the Dutchman.  It will remind them that Europe is more or less
"agin them, and to have a Dutchman here will make 'em think twice"
"afore they elects for war."""
The skipper shook his head.
"""No, Simcox, it looks judicious on the surface, but takin' deeper"
"thought it ain't.  It would aggerawate them, and that ain't policy."
"We fights if we must, but don't start it by doin' anythin' unpleasin'"
more'n askin' for our rights.  And in n'gotiashuns it ain't policy to
remind 'em deliberate of the time the Prooshians beat 'em.  And
moreover it's accordin' to no tradition I've heard of to send a
"furriner as hambassador.  No, Simcox, you shall go.  I'll draw up the"
"hultimatum at once."""
"MORGAN, COLONEL BLODRE, or BLEDRY."
This buccaneer was probably a relation of Sir Henry Morgan. He was an
important person in Jamaica between 1660 and 1670. At the taking of Panama
by Henry Morgan in 1670 the Colonel commanded the rearguard of 300 men. In
"May, 1671, he was appointed to act as Deputy Governor of Providence Island"
by Sir James Modyford.
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL EDWARD. Buccaneer."
Uncle and father-in-law of Sir Henry Morgan.
"In 1665, when war had been declared on Holland, the Governor of Jamaica"
issued commissions to several pirates and buccaneers to sail to and attack
"the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius, Saba, and Curacao. Morgan was put in"
"command of ten ships and some 500 men; most of them were ""reformed"
"prisoners,"" while some were condemned pirates who had been pardoned in"
order to let them join the expedition.
"Before leaving Jamaica the crews mutinied, but were pacified by the"
promise of an equal share of all the spoils that should be taken. Three
"ships out of the fleet slipped away on the voyage, but the rest arrived at"
"St. Kitts, landed, and took the fort. Colonel Morgan, who was an old and"
"corpulent man, died of the heat and exertion during the campaign."
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL THOMAS."
Sailed with Colonel Edward Morgan to attack St. Eustatius and Saba
"""Butt's trying to decide whether he wants him fried or scrambled,"" the"
"Computer's Mate said, pulling her back. ""Hey, purse, remember when the"
whole family with their pop at the head went into Heatwave to argue
"with Colonel Leclerc?"""
"""Eleven dead, sixty-four injured,"" the purser answered mechanically."
"""And no more army stationed south of Icebox."" His right ear twitched"
"irritably. ""But what're they saying?"""
"Suddenly we heard. ""By authority vested in me under the Pomona College"
"Treaty,"" the Captain was saying very loudly, ""I arrest you for"
violation of Articles Sixteen to Twenty-one inclusive of the Space
"Transport Code, and order your person and belongings impounded for"
the duration of this voyage as set forth in Sections Forty-one and
"Forty-five--"""
"""Forty-three and Forty-five,"" Sis groaned. ""Sections Forty-three and"
"Forty-five, I told him. I even made him repeat it after me!"""

"Directives."""

We all waited breathlessly for Butt's reply. The seconds ambled on and
"there was no clatter of electrostatic discharge, no smell of burning"
flesh.
Then we heard some feet walking. A big man in a green suit swung out
"into the crossway. That was Butt. Behind him came the Captain, holding"
"the blaster gingerly with both hands. Butt had a funny, thoughtful look"
"Now they found Mart at home. Sidney put her head in the door, made"
"certain that gran'ma was not in hearing, and cried ""Hook!"""
Mart had only to look once at Sidney's face to know that something had
happened. Sidney dragged her out to the Lane and there she and
"Lavender, in words as quick as pistol shots, told the story."
"""Meet us down on the beach near Milligan's at eight o'clock,"" Lav"
"whispered, as they parted."
CHAPTER XIX
THE GLEAM
Exactly at the appointed hour Sidney met Lavender on the beach. She was
breathless and a little worried for it had been neither easy nor to her
liking to deceive Aunt Achsa. Aunt Achsa had declared that a storm was
"""comin'"" for she could smell it in the air and Tillie Higgins had seen"
Sam Doolittle start for the backside with his pike pole and that meant
"a blow for Sam didn't waste steps. ""'Tisn't likely Letty Vine'll _go_"
"to Truro tonight."""
"""But I'll _see_ if she's going, anyway,"" Sidney had cried and had raced"
"off, a sweater over her arm."
"""I wish I could tell her how very important it is and then she'd"
"understand, but I can't for maybe she wouldn't understand,"" Sidney"
thought as she hurried to the rendezvous.
"would go ashore and through his agents, Messrs. Ross and Co., transmit"
large sums of money to his wife and children in England. But Thwaites had
"another home at Algiers fitted with every luxury, including three Armenian"
girls.
For several years this successful pirate plundered ships of all nations
until such pressure was brought to bear on the Dey of Algiers that
Thwaites thought it best to collect what valuables he could carry away and
disappear.
"Landing at Gibraltar in 1796, dressed in European clothes, he procured a"
"passage to New York in an American frigate, the _Constitution_. Arriving"
"in the United States, he purchased an estate not far from New York and"
"built himself a handsome mansion, but a year later retribution came from"
"an unlooked-for quarter, for he was bitten by a rattlesnake and died in"
the most horrible agonies both of mind and body.
"TOMKINS, JOHN."
Of Gloucestershire.
Hanged at the age of 23 at Rhode Island in 1723. One of Charles Harris's
crew.
"TOPPING, DENNIS."
"He shipped on board the sloop _Buck_ at Providence in 1718, in company"
with Anstis and other famous pirates. Was killed at the taking of a rich
Portuguese ship off the coast of Brazil.
"Gunner on board ""Blackbeard's"" ship, the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on"
"November 22nd, 1718, in North Carolina, during the fight with Lieutenant"
Maynard.
"MULLET, JAMES, _alias_ MILLET."
Of London.
"One of the crew of the _Royal James_, in which vessel Major Stede Bonnet"
played havoc with the shipping along the coasts of South Carolina and New
England. Hanged at Charleston in 1718.
"MULLINS, DARBY."
"This Irish pirate was born in the north of Ireland, not many miles from"
"Londonderry. Being left an orphan at the age of 18, he was sold to a"
planter in the West Indies for a term of four years.
"After the great earthquake at Jamaica in 1691, Mullins built himself a"
house at Kingston and ran it as a punch-house--often a very profitable
business when the buccaneers returned to Port Royal with good plunder.
"This business failing, he went to New York, where he met Captain Kidd, and"
"was, according to his own story, persuaded to engage in piracy, it being"
"urged that the robbing only of infidels, the enemies of Christianity, was"
"an act, not only lawful, but one highly meritorious."
At his trial later on in London his judges did not agree with this view of
"the rights of property, and Mullins was hanged at Execution Dock on May"
"23rd, 1701."
"to have been particularly active in helping to take a Dutch merchantman,"
"the _Gertruycht_. Hanged in chains at Cape Coast Castle in April, 1722, at"
the age of 23.
"SWAN, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded the _Nicholas_, and met Dampier when in the _Batchelor's"
Delight_ at the Island of Juan Fernandez in 1684. The two captains cruised
"together off the west coast of South America, the _Nicholas_ leaving"
"Dampier, who returned to England by way of the East Indies."
"SWAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
Of the _Cygnet_. Left England as an honest trader. Rounded the Horn and
"sailed up to the Bay of Nicoya, there taking on a crew of buccaneers who"
had crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot. Dampier was appointed pilot or
"quartermaster to the _Cygnet_, a post analogous to that of a navigating"
"officer on a modern man-of-war, while Ringrose was appointed supercargo."
"Swan had an adventurous and chequered voyage, sometimes meeting with"
"successes, but often with reverses. Eventually he sailed to the Philippine"
"Islands, where the crew mutinied and left Swan and thirty-six of the crew"
"behind. After various adventures the _Cygnet_, by now in a very crazy"
"state, just managed to reach Madagascar, where she sank at her anchorage."
"SWITZER, JOSEPH."
Of Boston in New England.
"Tried for piracy at Rhode Island in 1723, but found to be ""not guilty."""

King Merriwig of Euralia sat at breakfast on his castle walls.  He
"lifted the gold cover from the gold dish in front of him, selected a"
trout and conveyed it carefully to his gold plate.  He was a man of
"simple tastes, but when you have an aunt with the newly acquired gift"
"of turning anything she touches to gold, you must let her practise"
sometimes.  In another age it might have been fretwork.
"""Ah,"" said the King, ""here you are, my dear.""  He searched for his"
"napkin, but the Princess had already kissed him lightly on the top of"
"the head, and was sitting in her place opposite to him."
"""Good morning, Father,"" she said; ""I'm a little late, aren't I?  I've"
"been riding in the forest."""
"""Any adventures?"" asked the King casually."
"""Nothing, except it's a beautiful morning."""
"""Ah, well, perhaps the country isn't what it was.  Now when I was a"
"young man, you simply couldn't go into the forest without an adventure"
"of some sort.  The extraordinary things one encountered!  Witches,"
"giants, dwarfs----.  It was there that I first met your mother,"" he"
added thoughtfully.
"""I wish I remembered my mother,"" said Hyacinth."
The King coughed and looked at her a little nervously.
"""Seventeen years ago she died, Hyacinth, when you were only six months"
old.  I have been wondering lately whether I haven't been a little
"remiss in leaving you motherless so long."""
"fine--it made me ashamed of my silly standards, my fears."""
"""And Lavender is best of all--"""
Now quick tears shone like stars in Trude Romley's eyes. She reached
out her hands and caught Sidney's.
"""Oh, Lavender--when I think what _he_ did I--I--"" She could not finish,"
but Sidney understood the gratitude that was in her heart. She leaned
her face against Trude's shoulder with a long sigh.
"""I'm cured of lots of things, Trude. I wanted something different but I"
didn't want all _this_ to happen! You see I _made_ Lavender and Mart
believe it was diamonds Jed Starrow was hiding when it was probably
"only a case of rum--"""
"Suddenly Trude straightened. ""I almost forgot. A boy came here and said"
a Captain Davies wanted you to come down to Rockman's wharf as soon as
you could. That was two hours ago. You see it is nearly noon now. You'd
"better dress quickly and I'll go out and fix you some breakfast."""
Sidney obeyed reluctantly. In her mingled remorse and humiliation she
shrank from facing the world. She was not even curious as to why Cap'n
Phin wanted to see her.
By the time she had dressed Trude had a poached egg and a glass of milk
ready for her. Miss Letty was with Lavender and Aunt Achsa had gone to
bed.
Sidney begged so hard that Trude accompany her to Rockman's that Trude
put on her hat and went with her. And poor Sidney needed Trude's

"TURNLEY, CAPTAIN RICHARD."
A New Providence pirate who received the general pardon from Captain
"Woodes Rogers in 1718. When, a little later, the scandal of Captain"
Rackam's infatuation for Anne Bonny was causing such gossip among the two
"thousand ex-pirates who formed the population of the settlement, it was"
Turnley who brought news of the affair to the notice of the Governor. In
"revenge for this action, Rackam and his lady, one day hearing that Turnley"
"had sailed to a neighbouring island to catch turtles, followed him. It"
"happened that Turnley was on shore hunting wild pigs and so escaped, but"
Rackam sank his sloop and took his crew away with him as prisoners.
"TYLE, CAPTAIN ORT VAN."
A Dutchman from New York.
A successful pirate in the days of the Madagascan sea-rovers. For some
"time he sailed in company with Captain James, taking several prizes in the"
Indian Ocean.
Van Tyle had a plantation at Madagascar and used to put his prisoners to
"work there as slaves, one in particular being the notorious Welsh pirate,"
"David Williams, who toiled with Van Tyles's other slaves for six months"
before making his escape to a friendly tribe in the neighbourhood.
"UPTON, BOATSWAIN JOHN."
Born in 1679 of honest parents at Deptford.
"Apprenticed to a waterman, he afterwards went to sea, serving on different"
"ship, the _Santa Maria Desaie_, from Tenby to Bastabill Haven. Off the"
Welsh coast the ship was attacked by a pirate vessel called the
"_Furtuskewys_, with a crew of thirty-five pirates. Alves was put ashore on"
"the Welsh coast, and the two ships then sailed to Cork, where the ship and"
"her cargo were sold to the mayor for 1,524 crowns."
"Alves complained to the King of England, and orders were sent to the Mayor"
"of Cork, Richard Gowllys, to give up the ship, which he refused to do, but"
by way of excusing his actions he explained that he thought the ship was a
Scotch one and not a Portuguese.
"PHILLIPS, CAPTAIN."
"In 1723 this noted pirate took a sloop, the _Dolphin_, of Cape Ann, on the"
Banks of Newfoundland. The crew of the _Dolphin_ were compelled by
"Phillips to join the pirates. Amongst the prisoners was a fisherman, John"
"Fillmore. Finding no opportunity to escape, Fillmore with another sailor,"
"Edward Cheesman, and an Indian, suddenly seized and killed Phillips and"
"the two other chief pirates. The rest of the crew agreeing, the ship was"
taken to Boston.
"PHILIPS, JAMES."
Of the Island of Antigua.
"Formerly of the _Revenge_, and afterwards in the _Royal Fortune_ (Captain"
Roberts). When the _Royal Fortune_ surrendered in 1722 to H.M.S.
"_Swallow_, Philips seized a lighted match and attempted to blow up the"
"ship, swearing he would ""send them all to Hell together,"" but was"
"prevented by the master, Glasby. Hanged at the age of 35."

"instant death to the Spanish guards if they cried out, then cut the cables"
and sailed out of the bay. As soon as it was light the Spanish ship
"commenced a furious bombardment of Rackam's empty vessel, thinking he was"
still aboard her.
"In the summer of 1720 he took numbers of small vessels and fishing boats,"
"but nothing very rich, and was not above stealing the fishermen's nets and"
landing and taking cattle. In October Rackam was chased near Nigril Bay by
a Government sloop commanded by a Captain Barret. After a short fight
"Rackam surrendered, and was carried a prisoner to Port Royal."
"On November 16th Rackam and his crew were tried at St. Jago de la Vega,"
convicted and sentenced to death. Amongst the crew were two women dressed
"as men, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. The former was married, in pirate"
"fashion, to Rackam."
"On the morning of his execution Rackam was allowed, as a special favour,"
"to visit his Anne, but all the comfort he got from her was ""that she was"
"sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have"
"been hanged like a Dog."""
"Rackam was hanged on November 17th, 1720, at Gallows Point, at Port Royal,"

"RAPHAELINA, CAPTAIN."
Much dreaded by the merchant sailors navigating the South Atlantic. In
1822 he controlled a fleet of pirate vessels in the vicinity of Cape
Antonio.

wherever he passed in his magnificent motor he was to be saluted
"with Eastern servility, who boasted of his ""tender heart,"" so that"
he issued placards about this time punishing severely all who split
the tongues of finches to make them sing better. Edith Cavell--she
did not pause to consider the fate of patriotic Belgian women--but
"Edith Cavell, directress of a nursing home in Brussels, known far"
"and wide for her goodness of heart. She had held aloof from Vivie,"

Senator Crane today launched a one-man campaign to make America
space-conscious. If there was any Madison Avenue thinking behind the
launching it was certainly lower Madison Avenue.
In order to make his point--exactly what this was confused a vast
roomful of newspapermen--the Senator invented a race of creatures called
"androids. These androids, it seems, look exactly like Tom Smith down the"
block except that they'd just as soon cut your throat as not.
We fear the Senator must have been watching the wrong television
"shows--knives yet, ugh!--possibly _Jim Bowie_, because there wasn't a"
ray gun nor a disintegrator in his whole bag of exhibits.
"All in all, it would appear that the project was pointed toward making"

He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the

"""Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just"

the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers
figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.

He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were
bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just
about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.
He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the
first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I
told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood
listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked

commissions were to attack only Spanish and French ships. The two
"captains quarrelled at the very beginning of the voyage, while lying off"

the Canary Islands.

"Marblehead the crew mutinied, locked the captain in his cabin, and elected"

"Encouraged by these assurances, one of the newcomers said to the other:"
"""Come on, let's sit down here and have a coffee--we needn't stop long."""
"All the smaller tables were occupied, but there was one long table that"
stretched across the room and only a few men were sitting at the far end
of it. The officers sat down at the near end and ordered coffee. They
"seemed a little embarrassed at first, but they soon began to talk freely"

Ringrose never attained any rank among the buccaneers beyond occasionally
"being put in charge of a boat or a small company on shore, but as a"
recorder of the doings of his companions he proved both careful and
"painstaking. Dampier had a great regard for him, and in his book he"

"Askew’s little gloved hands trembled, and he turned white with"
anger--as pale as Montagu Askew allowed himself to turn:
"“It has belonged to my forefathers for seven generations,” he"
said--“and every man of them backed his acts with his sword.”
Noll laughed; shrugged his shoulders:
"“If your acts are hereditary, it is an excuse for you,” he said."
"The following morning, Rupert Greppel and a French cousin called upon"
Noll; and Rupert stiffly asked if he could refer him to two friends.
"“No,” said Noll--Doome was with him--“no--I do not associate with men"
who associate with Lord Montagu Askew.”
"Rupert Greppel paused, dumbfounded:"
"“I do not think you understand,” he said. “Lord Montagu Askew"
challenges you to fight him.”
"“Tell Lord Montagu Askew from me,” said Noll, “that I only brawl with"
men. Good-morning.”
The whisperings at the clubs are said to have hit Lord Montagu Askew
"harder than a pistol-bullet; but Lord Montagu, from lack of experience,"
is not an authority on being hit with pistol-bullets. He never takes
"part in ungentlemanly encounters where people are hit. Indeed, he"
"maintains a wondrous silence, except that he challenged Noll; and the"
jade-handled cane has joined the ancestors.

possibly its spectators regarded it as merely a better Interlude than

"their gruesome task, and Vivie was being persuaded to take some"
"nourishment, that her great grandfather had been a soldier servant"
who had married a Belgian woman and settled down on the site of this
very shop a hundred years ago. He and his wife had even then
"made a specialty of tea for English tourists. She, his great"

7. Hymns of the Reformation: The Metrical Psalms.
"While the German people, under the leadership of Luther, were singing"
"chorales set to original religious poems, a large section of"
"Protestantism, under the influence of John Calvin, confined itself to"
"the singing of Psalms. To the French reformer, now preaching at Geneva,"
"hymns were “man-made,” whereas the psalms were the inspired word of God"
"and the only proper vehicle for the praise of God. Calvin, unlike"
"Luther, was not a musician, and at first permitted only unison singing,"
unaccompanied. Part singing and instrumental accompaniment seemed to
"savor of the frivolous and worldly, an opinion which Calvin, however,"
was soon to modify. For two hundred years the Calvinistic churches on
the Continent and in Britain were influenced in their worship song by
"the strict views of Calvin, limiting themselves to the metrical psalms"
and scriptural paraphrases. The German people in the meantime produced a
"rich treasury of original religious lyrics, contributed by some of their"
best poets.

"burned nearly to his lips.  He went on, scarcely knowing what he played."
"At last he stopped, and sat dejected.  A great artist?  Often, nowadays,"
he did not care if he never touched a violin again.  Tired of standing up
"before a sea of dull faces, seeing the blockheads knock their silly hands"

were his powers beginning to fail?  What was happening to him of late?
"He got up, went into the dining-room, and drank some brandy.  Gyp could"
"not bear his drinking.  Well, she shouldn't be out so much--taking"

Chapter IV
HOLLAND
NOTE ON LITERATURE
The special interest of Dutch history for English and other readers led
in past generations to a more general sociological study of it than was
given to almost any other. L. Guicciardini's _Description of the Low
"Countries_ (_Descrizione ... di tutti Paesi Bassi_, etc., Anversa,"
"folio, 1567, 1581, etc.; trans. in French, 1568, etc.; in English, 1593;"
"in Dutch, 1582; in Latin, 1613, etc.) is one of the fullest surveys of"
the kind made till recent times. Sir William Temple's _Observations upon
the United Provinces of the Netherlands_ (1672) laid for English readers
further foundations of an intelligent knowledge of the vital conditions
of the State which had been in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the great commercial rival of England; and in the eighteenth century
many English writers discussed the fortunes of Dutch commerce. An
English translation was made of the remarkably sagacious work variously
"known as the _Memoirs of John de Witt_, the _True Interest of Holland_,"
"immediately recognized Colonel-General of Aviation Anatoly Savitsky,"
whose humorless face appeared almost weekly in Soviet Military Review;
"Major- General Igor Mikhailov, whose picture routinely graced the pages"
"of Air Defense Herald; and also Colonel-General Pavel Ogarkov, a"
marshal of the Soviet air force before that rank was abolished by the
general secretary.
What are those Air Force neanderthals doing here? They're all notorious
"hardliners, the ""bomb first, ask questions later"" boys. And _Daedalus_"
"is supposed to be for space research, right? Guess the bullshit is"
about to be over. We're finally getting down to the real scenario.
"And there in the middle, clearly the man in charge, was a tall, silver-"
haired Japanese in a charcoal silk suit. He was showing off the
"vehicles as though he owned them, and he carried himself with an"
authority that made all the hovering Soviet generals look like bellboys
waiting for a tip.
"Well, Yuri Andreevich thought, for the time being he does own them."
"They're bought and paid for, just like us."
"""_Tovarisch_, Major Androv, _kak pazhavatye_,"" came a voice behind him."
"He turned and realized it belonged to General Valentin Sokolov,"
commander of the MiG 31 wing at the Dolinsk air base on Sakhalin.
"Sokolov was three star, top man in all the Soviet Far East. Flanking"
him were half a dozen colonels and lieutenant colonels.
"""Comrade General Sokolov."" He whipped off a quick salute. Brass. Brass"
everywhere. Shit. What in hell was this all about?
"Now the project director, Taro Ikeda, had broken away from the Soviet"
"group and was approaching. ""Yuri Andreevich, thank you for coming."" He"
"Defoe is uncertain, though the character of Robinson Crusoe was certainly"
"founded on his adventures in Juan Fernandez. In 1712 he returned to Largo,"
"living the life of a recluse, and we must be forgiven for suspecting that"
"he rather acted up to the part, since it is recorded that he made a cave"
in his father's garden in which to meditate. This life of meditation in an
artificial cave was soon rudely interrupted by the appearance of a certain
"Miss Sophia Bonce, with whom Selkirk fell violently in love, and they"
"eloped together to Bristol, which must have proved indeed a sad scandal to"
the elders and other godly citizens of Largo. Beyond the fact that he was
"charged at Bristol with assaulting one Richard Nettle, a shipwright, we"
"hear no more of Selkirk until his first will was drawn up in 1717, in"
"which he leaves his fortune and house to ""my loving friend Sophia Bonce,"
"of the Pall Mall, London, Spinster."" Shortly after this, Alexander basely"
"deserted his loving friend and married a widow, one Mrs. Francis Candis,"
at Oarston in Devon.
"In 1720 he was appointed mate to H.M.S. _Weymouth_, on board of which he"
died a year later at the age of 45.
"Selkirk is immortalized in literature, not only by Defoe, but by Cowper in"
"his ""Lines on Solitude,"" beginning: ""I am monarch of all I survey."""

"29. The Proceeds of any Sale, made either before or after Condemnation,"
"and after Condemnation the appraised Value of the captured Ship, in case"
"she has been delivered up to a Claimant on Bail, shall be paid under an"

"Her Majesty's Paymaster General, or into the Hands of an Official"
Accountant (belonging to the Commissariat or some other Department)
appointed for this Purpose by the Commissioners of Her Majesty's
"Treasury or by the Lords of the Admiralty, subject in either case to"
"reversed, and then ended. This was the last answer of the plants."
Thus the responsiveness of the plant world was one. There was no
"difference of any kind between sunshine plants, and those which had"
hitherto been regarded as insensitive or ordinary. It had also been
shown that all the varied and complex responses of the animal were
foreshadowed in the plant. An impressive spectacle was thus revealed of
"that vast unity in which all living organisms, from the simplest plant"
"to the highest animal, were linked together and made one."

he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front
"of the car. His wife followed, but she first turned her eyes and saw"
the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind
"a tree on the edge of the little park, not fifty feet away."
"Descended to the ground, James Williams faced his captors with a smile."
He was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in Cloverdale
about having been mistaken for a burglar. The Rubberneck coach
"lingered, out of respect for its patrons. What could be a more"
interesting sight than this?
"“My name is James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri,” he said kindly,"
so that they would not be too greatly mortified. “I have letters here
that will show—”
"“You’ll come with us, please,” announced the plainclothes man. “‘Pinky’"
McGuire’s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds. A
detective saw you on the Rubberneck up at Central Park and ’phoned down
to take you in. Do your explaining at the station-house.”
James Williams’s wife—his bride of two weeks—looked him in the face
"with a strange, soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks,"
looked him in the face and said:
"“Go with ’em quietly, ‘Pinky,’ and maybe it’ll be in your favour.”"
And then as the Glaring-at-Gotham car rolled away she turned and threw
a kiss—his wife threw a kiss—at some one high up on the seats of the
Rubberneck.
"“Your girl gives you good advice, McGuire,” said Donovan. “Come on,"
now.”

"I believe your match is to be found.'  And I says, with dignity (with"

"DE SOTO, CAPTAIN BENITO."
A Portuguese.
A most notorious pirate in and about 1830.
"In 1827 he shipped at Buenos Ayres as mate in a slaver, named the"
"_Defenser de Pedro_, and plotted to seize the ship off the African coast."
"The pirates took the cargo of slaves to the West Indies, where they sold"
"them. De Soto plundered many vessels in the Caribbean Sea, then sailed to"
"the South Atlantic, naming his ship the _Black Joke_. The fear of the"
_Black Joke_ became so great amongst the East Indiamen homeward bound that
they used to make up convoys at St. Helena before heading north.
"In 1832 de Soto attacked the _Morning Star_, an East Indiaman, and took"
"her, when he plundered the ship and murdered the captain. After taking"
"several more ships, de Soto lost his own on the rocky coast of Spain, near"
"Cadiz. His crew, although pretending to be honest shipwrecked sailors,"
"were arrested, but de Soto managed to escape to Gibraltar. Here he was"
recognized by a soldier who had seen de Soto when he took the _Morning
"Star_, in which he had been a passenger. The pirate was arrested, and"
"tried before Sir George Don, the Governor of Gibraltar, and sentenced to"
death. He was sent to Cadiz to be hanged with the rest of his crew. The
"gallows was erected at the water's edge, and de Soto, with his coffin, was"
"conveyed there in a cart. He died bravely, arranging the noose around his"
"own neck, stepping up into his coffin to do so; then, crying out, ""Adios"
"todos,"" he threw himself off the cart."
"This man must not be confused with one Bernado de Soto, who was tried for"
"me to see Doctor Lilly, and I suggested that I return for him in three"
hours.
"I went back to Whitehall, where I found Frances, and told her to be at"
"Lilly's house on the Strand within three hours, to meet the French king's"
"ambassador, and to receive the instructions which George's letter had"
"intimated the Abbé would give. I told her, also, that the Abbé was not"
the person we had expected to see.
"The evening before, she was ready to die of fright because we believed"
"that the Abbé was George Hamilton, and now, since I had found he was not,"
she was ready to die of disappointment--so she assured me.
"At the appointed time, De Grammont, the Abbé, and I took the count's"
"barge and went down to the water stairs nearest Temple Bar, where the"
Abbé and I left De Grammont and walked up through the crowded streets to
"Lilly's house. Owing to the crowded condition of the street, the Abbé and"
I found no opportunity to exchange words until we were before Lilly's
house.
"Lilly was at home, I having sent word of our coming, so when we knocked,"
"the servant opened and directed us to the waiting parlor, saying that the"
Doctor would soon come down.
"We started upstairs, I in the lead, the Abbé following ten paces behind."
"When I entered the room, I found Bettina and Frances sitting by the"
"street window. They came to me quickly, and Frances explained Bettina's"
presence.
"""I did not like to come here alone, so I asked Betty to come with me. She"
"is to be trusted."""
"Taken prisoner by the pirate Captain Teach on November 21st, 1718, and on"
the very next day retaken by Lieutenant Maynard. Odell received no less
"than seventy wounds in the fight, but recovered, and was carried to"
"Virginia to stand his trial for piracy, and was acquitted."
"OUGHTERLAUNEY, THOMAS."
Acted as pilot in the _Royal Fortune_. Took an active part in taking and
plundering the _King Solomon_ on the West Coast of Africa in 1721.
"Was tried for piracy with the rest of Roberts's crew, when one witness,"
"Captain Trahern, deposed that the prisoner dressed himself up in the"
"captain's best suit of clothes, his new tye wig, and called loudly for a"
"bottle of wine, and then, very arrogantly, gave orders as to the steering"
of the captured ship.
Hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722.
"PAIN, CAPTAIN."
A Bahaman privateer who in 1683 turned pirate and attacked St. Augustine
"in Florida under French colours. Being driven off by the Spaniards, he had"
to content himself with looting some neighbouring settlements. On
"returning to New Providence, the Governor attempted, but without success,"
"to arrest Pain and his crew. Pain afterwards appeared in Rhode Island, and"
"when the authorities tried to seize him and his ship, he got off by"
exhibiting an old commission to hunt for pirates given him a long while
"before by Sir Thomas Lynch. When the West Indies became too hot for him,"
Pain made the coast of Carolina his headquarters.
"TOWNLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
A buccaneer who in the year 1684 was one of the mixed English and French
"fleet blockading Panama. On this occasion, he commanded a ship with a crew"
of 180 men. By the next year the quarrels between the English had reached
such a pitch that Townley and Swan left Davis and sailed in search of
"their French friends. In May, 1685, Townley was amongst the company that"
"took and sacked Guayaquil. In January, 1686, Townley rescued the French"
"pirate Grogniet and some 350 Frenchmen who, when attacking the town of"
"Quibo, were surprised by a Spanish squadron, which burnt their vessels"
while the crews were on shore. Townley then sailed north with his French
comrades and sacked Granada.
"His next adventure was to take the town of Lavelia, near to Panama, where"
he found a rich cargo which the Viceroy had placed on shore because he was
afraid to send it to sea when so many pirates were about.
"In August of the same year, Townley's ship was attacked by three Spanish"
"men-of-war. A furious fight took place, which ended by two of the Spanish"
ships being captured and the third burnt. In this action the gallant
"Townley was gravely wounded, and died shortly afterwards."
"TRISTRIAN, CAPTAIN. French buccaneer."
"In the year 1681 Dampier, with other malcontents, broke away from Captain"
Sharp and marched on foot across the Isthmus of Darien. After undergoing
"terrible hardships for twenty-two days, the party arrived on the Atlantic"
"seaboard, to find Captain Tristrian with his ship lying in La Sounds Cay."
"The buccaneers bought red, blue, and green beads, and knives, scissors,"
moment a German soldier on leave came up and spat in his face. The
Frenchman felled the German with a resounding box on the ear.
Alarums! Excursions! A German officer rushed up to enquire while the
Frenchman was struggling with two colossal German military policemen
and the Englishman was striving to free him. Vivie explained to the
officer what had occurred. He bowed and saluted: seized the
soldier-spitter by the collar and kicked him so frightfully that
Vivie had to implore him to cease.
Moreover the Red Placards of von Bissing were of increasing
frequency. As a rule Vivie only heard what other people said of
"them, and that wasn't very much, for German spies were everywhere,"
inviting you to follow them to the dreaded Kommandantur in the Rue
de la Loi--a scene of as much in the way of horror and mental
anguish as the Conciergerie of Paris in the days of the Red Terror.
But some cheek-blanching rumour she had heard on a certain Monday in
October caused her to look next day on her way home at a fresh Red
Placard which had been posted up in a public place. The daylight had
"almost faded, but there was a gas lamp which made the notice"
legible. It ran:

AVIATION IN DREAMS
Dreams of Flying and Falling--Their Peculiar Vividness--Dreams of
Flying an Alleged Survival of Primeval Experiences--Best explained
as based on Respiratory Sensations combined with Cutaneous
Anaesthesia--The Explanation of Dreams of Falling--The Sensation
of Levitation sometimes experienced by Ecstatic Saints--Also
experienced at the Moment of Death.
"Dreams of flying, with the dreams of falling they are sometimes associated"
"with, may fairly be considered the best known and most frequent type of"
dream. They were among the earliest dreams to attract attention. Ruths
"argues that the Greek conception of the flying Hermes, the god who"
"possessed special authority over dreams, was based on such experiences."
"Lucretius, in his interesting passage on the psychology of dreaming,"
speaks of falling from heights in dreams;[100] Cicero appears to refer
to dreams of flying; St. Jerome mentions that he was subject to them;
Synesius remarked that in dreams we fly with wings and view the world
from afar; Cervantes accurately described the dream of falling.[101] From
"_Elizabeth and Katherine_, off the coast of West Africa. Fitting her out"
"for a pirate, they named her the _Flying King_, and Sample was put in"
"command. In company with Captain Low, he sailed to Brazil and did much"
mischief amongst the Portuguese shipping. In November of the same year the
two pirate ships were attacked by a very powerful man-of-war. Lane got
"away, but Sample was compelled to run his ship ashore on the coast. Of his"
"crew of seventy men, twelve were killed and the rest taken prisoners, of"
"whom the Portuguese hanged thirty-eight. Of these, thirty-two were"
"English, three Dutch, two French, and one Portuguese."
"SANDERS, THOMAS."
An Elizabethan mariner who was taken prisoner by the Moors. He wrote a
narrative of his life as a slave on a Barbary pirate galley.
"""I and sixe more of my fellowes,"" he wrote, ""together with four-score"
"Italians and Spaniards, were sent foorth in a Galeot to take a Greekish"
"Carmosell, which came into Africa to steale Negroes. We were chained three"
"and three to an oare, and we rowed naked above the girdle, and the"
"Boteswaine of the Galley walked abaft the masts, and his Mate afore the"
"maste ... and when their develish choller rose, they would strike the"
Christians for no cause. And they allowed us but halfe a pound of bread a
"man in a day without any other kind of sustenance, water excepted.... We"
"were then so cruelly manackled in such sort, that we could not put our"
"hands the length of one foote asunder the one from the other, and every"
"night they searched our chains three times, to see if they were fast"
"riveted."""
"SAWKINS, CAPTAIN RICHARD. Buccaneer."
basis of all Roman Catholic music today. Some of these chants were
"adapted by Luther for congregational singing, and set to words in the"
"vernacular of the people. A few of the tunes, usually in a form scarcely"
"recognizable from the original, are used today in Protestant hymnals, as"
"for instance, the tune “Hamburg.” Some of the music in the Amish church"
services is traceable to the Gregorian Chant.
The singing in the medieval church was liturgical in character and
confined to the clergy and trained choirs. This was its weakness. The
"laity was not expected to sing, neither were they able to do so."
"Congregational singing, so important in our worship today, had for"
centuries been unknown in the Roman Catholic Church. Reform was
inevitable and it came in due time.
"While only remnants of the music survive, many hymns from the Western"
Church have been translated from the Latin and a few choice ones have
found their way into the _Hymnary_.
Latin Hymns in the Hymnary
"Prudentius, 348-c. 413, “Bethlehem, of noblest cities” (88)"
"Gregory the Great, 540-604, “Father, we praise Thee” (24)"

"Anonymous, 12th century, “O come, O come, Emmanuel” (67)"
"Savonarola, 1452-98 (Italian), “Jesus, Refuge of the weary” (536)"
Enter the name of a firm under the family name rather than the
"forename, and do not fill out the forenames: e.g., _Friedlander"
"und Sohn, Raphael_, not under _Raphael_; _Stokes, F. A. Co._, not"
"_Stokes, Frederick A. Co._"
The consulter is much more likely to remember the family than the
Christian name. Whether the Christian name is written at the end
"or thus, _Town (John)_ and _Bowers (Henry)_, all firms should be"
"arranged after all the other entries of the first family name, i.e.,"
_Friedlander und Sohn_ after all the _Friedlanders_.
"This rule might be extended to include corporations, colleges,"
"libraries, etc., whose legal names include forenames. Entry under a"
"forename, as _Silas Bronson Library_, and especially under initials, as"
"_T. B. Scott Public Library_, is awkward. But the public habit is not"
yet sufficiently settled to justify an exception.
Enter the universities of the European continent and of Central and
South America under the name of the place; all other societies
"under _Königliche_, _Herzogliche_, etc."
Cross-reference from the first word in the university names and from
the place of societies.
"A few learned academies, commonly called by the names of the cities"
"where they are established, may be entered under the place with a"
"cross-reference from the name. These are _Berlin, Göttingen, Leipzig,"

"was deprived of his ship's rudder and sails. In 1666, Searle, in company"

"SELKIRK, ALEXANDER. The original Robinson Crusoe."
"Born in 1676 at Largo in Fifeshire, he was the seventh son of John"
"Selcraig, a shoemaker. In 1695 he was cited to appear before the Session"
"for ""indecent conduct in church,"" but ran away to sea. In 1701 he was back"
"again in Largo, and was rebuked in the face of the congregation for"
"quarrelling with his brothers. A year later Selkirk sailed to England, and"
in 1703 joined Dampier's expedition to the South Seas. Appointed
"sailing-master to the _Cinque Ports_, commanded by Captain Stradling."
"In September, 1704, he arrived at the uninhabited island of Juan"
"Fernandez, in the South Pacific. Selkirk, having quarrelled with the"
"captain, insisted on being landed on the island with all his belongings."
"He lived alone here for nearly four years, building himself two cabins,"
"hunting the goats which abounded, and taming young goats and cats to be"
his companions.
"On the night of January 31st, 1709, seeing two ships, Selkirk lit a fire,"
and a boat was sent ashore. These ships were the _Duke_ and _Duchess_ of
"Bristol, under the command of Captain Woodes Rogers, while his old friend"
Dampier was acting as pilot. Selkirk was at once appointed sailing-master
"of the _Duchess_, and eventually arrived back in the Thames on October"
"14th, 1711, with booty worth £800, having been away from England for eight"
"years. While in England he met Steele, who described Selkirk as a ""man of"
"good sense, with strong but cheerful expression."" Whether Selkirk ever met"
XVII. EVIL DAYS
"Accompanied by Kennedy, Cæsar called repeatedly on the most auspicious"
"members of the French clerical element living in Rome, and found persons"
"more cultivated than among the rough Spanish monks; but, as was natural,"
nobody gave him any useful information offering the possibility of his
putting his financial talents to the proof.
"“Something must turn up,” he used to say to himself, “and at the least"
opening we will dive into the work.”
Cæsar kept gathering notes about people who had connections in Spain
with the Black party in Rome; he called several times on Father
"Herreros, despite his uncle’s prohibition, and succeeded in getting the"
"monk to write to the Marquesa de Montsagro, asking if there were no"
"means of making Cæsar Moneada, Cardinal Fort’s nephew, Conservative"
Deputy for her district.
The Marquesa wrote back that it was impossible; the Conservative Deputy
for the district was very popular and a man with large properties there.
"When Holy Week was over, Laura and the Countess Brenda and her daughter"
"decided to spend a while at Florence, and invited Cæsar to accompany"
"them; but he was quite out of harmony with the Brenda lady, and said"
that he had to stay on in Rome.
"A few days later Mme. Dawson and her daughters left, and the San"
Martinos and the Marchesa Sciacca; and an avalanche of English people
"and Germans, armed with their red Baedekers, took the hotel by storm."
Susanna Marchmont had gone to spend some days at Corfu.
"good-sized table, and lays out his materials in front of him. After"
"testing every possible method, the present writer strongly urges the"
"use of individual slips of paper, about 2½ inches by 4 inches. Arranged"
"within easy reach in front of the indexer, but leaving room for the"
"proof-sheets, should be twenty small pasteboard boxes,[48] a little"
larger than the slips themselves.[48] On the inside bottom of each
"box mark a letter of the alphabet, combining O and Q, U and V, and X"
"Y Z. As soon as a slip is written, throw it into its proper box, and"
continue throughout the work. It is a false economy to search out the
"slips for subsequent entries, unless they can be easily found, as it is"
a simple matter at the end to combine the several slips which belong to
the same heading.
"Here are sample slips, showing a heading which requires full entries"
and one to which the text contains fewer references. The first shows a
slip on which the various entries have been combined:

"|   36; synonyms of, 36; plans for converting, 130;     |"
"|   war with Mohawks, 147; Hurons ask aid from,         |"
"|   162; mortal quarrel with Mohawks, 163; promise      |"

"|   270; finally overborne by Senecas, 270.             |"

This slip shows the method of indexing a work in more than one volume:

"Jay T. Stocking, 1870-1936, “O Master Workman” (93)"
"Wm. M. Vories, 1880—, “Let there be light, Lord God” (353)"
"Harry Webb Farrington, 1880-1931, “I know not how that” (99)"
"W. Russel Bowie, 1882—, “Lord, through changing days” (402)"
"Howard Arnold Walter, 1884-1918, “I would be true” (207)"
"Earl Marlatt, 1892—, “‘Are ye able,’ said the Master” (392)"
11. Gospel Songs.
"During the latter part of the 19th century there came into use, both in"
"the United States and in England, a type of religious song known as the"
"Gospel Song. Less dignified than the chorales or the English hymns,"
these songs made a popular appeal and were widely used in prayer
meetings and revivals.
The words of the typical Gospel Song are usually simple and easily
remembered and concern themselves largely with the individual’s
salvation. The personal pronouns “I” and “my” predominate. The tunes are
rhythmic and catchy and always have a refrain added. Their harmonies are
"largely built on the simple tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords. The"
masses of the people readily learned to sing these tunes and experienced
a thrill in singing them which the use of the more stately and solid
hymns failed to effect.
The great bulk of these songs were produced in America during the latter
half of the 19th century and were found extremely useful in large mass
"meetings. The evangelistic work of Moody and Sankey during the 1870’s,"
"1880’s, and 1890’s brought the Gospel Songs into special prominence and"
the Salvation Army has made them known in nearly every country in the
world. Collections of Gospel Songs sold by the millions of copies and
"every denomination was affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by this"
The gross rapacity of the Flemings in Spain under Philip I is
"admitted by Motley (_Rise_, as cited, pp. 31, 75); but on the same"
score feeling was passionately strong in Spain in the earlier years
"of the reign of Charles. Cp. Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. i (Works,"
"ed. 1821, iv, 37, 40, 43, 44, 46, 47, 52, 53, 55, 77 78); and van"
"Kampen, _Geschichte der Niederlande_, i, 277, 278. It took more"
than ten years to bring Charles in good relations with the
Spaniards. See Mr. E. Armstrong's _Introduction_ to Major Martin
"Hume's _Spain_, 1898, pp. 31-37, 57, 76. Even in his latter years"
"they are found protesting against his customary absence from Spain,"
"and his perpetual wars. Robertson, bk. vi, p. 494. Cp. bk. xii,"
"vol. v, p. 417, as to the disregard shown him after his abdication."
"While it lasted, the Flemish exploitation of Spain was as shameless"
as the Spanish exploitation of Italy. The Italian Peter Martyr
"Angleria, residing at the court of Spain, reckoned that in ten"
months the Flemings there remitted home over a million ducats
"(Robertson, bk. i, p. 53). A lad, nephew of Charles's Flemish"
"minister Chievres, was appointed to the archbishopric of Toledo, in"
defiance of general indignation. The result was a clerico-popular
insurrection. Everything goes to show that but for the Emperor's
"prudence his Flemings would have ruined him in Spain, by getting"
"him to tyrannise for their gain, as Philip II later did for the"
Church's sake in the Netherlands.
It is not unwarrantable to say that had not Charles had the sagacity to
"adapt himself to the Spanish situation, learning to speak the language"
and even to tolerate the pride of the nobles[764] to a degree to which
"he never yielded before the claims of the burghers of the Netherlands,"
and had he not in the end identified himself chiefly with his Spanish
"interests, the history of Spain and the Netherlands might have been"
"entirely reversed. Had he, that is, kept his seat of rule in the"
thirty-one thousand five hundred dollars. But it cost the Romish Church
far more than money--it cost her the loss of all the leading nations
"of the world, which had been under her dominion till that time. For"
"the expense of the vast structure, with its ""insolent opulence of"
"marbles,"" was so great that Julius II. and Leo X. were obliged to meet"
"the enormous outlay by the sale of indulgences, and that, as is well"
"known, precipitated the Reformation. So that Protestants may well feel"
a peculiar interest in this mighty cathedral.
[Sidenote: The Column against which Christ Leaned in the Temple.]
It goes without saying that the popes would not allow the chief church
"of Roman Catholicism to go begging in the matter of relics. And, sure"
"enough, we have no sooner pushed aside the heavy padded screen and"
"stepped within than we find on our right the Chapel of the Holy Column,"
so called because it contains a pillar which is declared to have been
that against which our Lord leaned when he prayed and taught in the
"temple at Jerusalem. The pillar contains this inscription: ""Haec est"
illa columna in qua DNS N{r} Jesus XPS appodiatus dum populo prædicabat
"et Deo pno preces in templo effundebat adhaerendo, stabatque una"
cum aliis undecim hic circumstantibus. De Salomonis templo in
triumphum hujus Basilicæ hic locata fuit: demones expellit et immundis
spiritibus vexatos liberos reddit et multa miracula cotidie facit.

his violin with a feeling of actual sickness.  Why not?  That deep and
fearful whipping of the sexual instinct which makes the ache of jealousy
so truly terrible was at its full in such a nature as Fiorsen's.  He drew
"a long breath and shuddered.  The remembrance of her fastidious pride,"
"her candour, above all her passivity cut in across his fear.  No, not"
Gyp!
"He went to a little table whereon stood a tantalus, tumblers, and a"
"syphon, and pouring out some brandy, drank.  It steadied him.  And he"
began to practise.  He took a passage from Brahms' violin concerto and
"began to play it over and over.  Suddenly, he found he was repeating the"
same flaws each time; he was not attending.  The fingering of that thing
was ghastly!  Music-lessons!  Why did she take them?  Waste of time and
"money--she would never be anything but an amateur!  Ugh!  Unconsciously,"
he had stopped playing.  Had she gone there to-day?  It was past
lunch-time.  Perhaps she had come in.
He put down his violin and went back to the house.  No sign of her! The
maid came to ask if he would lunch.  No!  Was the mistress to be in?  She
"had not said.  He went into the dining-room, ate a biscuit, and drank a"
"brandy and soda.  It steadied him.  Lighting a cigarette, he came back to"
the drawing-room and sat down at Gyp's bureau.  How tidy!  On the little
"calendar, a pencil-cross was set against to-day--Wednesday, another"
"against Friday.  What for? Music-lessons!  He reached to a pigeon-hole,"
"and took out her address-book.  ""H--Harmost, 305A, Marylebone Road,"" and"

"dullard[782] to wreck half of his own empire, with the greatest captains"
of his age serving him; and to bring his fabled treasury to ruin while
his despised rebels grew rich.
"As to the vice of the Dutch constitution, the principle of the"
"supremacy of ""State rights,"" see M'Cullagh, p. 215; Motley, _Rise_,"
"pp. 794, 795 (Pt. vi, ch. ii, _end_), and _United Netherlands_, ed."
"1867, iv, 564. Wicquefort (_L'histoire des Provinces-Unies_, La"
"Haye, 1719, pp. 5, 16), following Grotius, laid stress long ago on"
"the fact that the Estates of each province recognised no superior,"
not even the entire body of the Republic. It was only the measure
of central government set up in the Burgundo-Austrian and Spanish
periods that made the Seven Provinces capable of enough united
action to repel Spanish rule during a chronic struggle of eighty
"years. Cp. Van Kampen (i, 304), who points out (p. 306) that the"
"word ""State"" first appears in Holland in the fifteenth century. It"
"arose in Flanders in the thirteenth, and in Brabant in the"
"fourteenth. Only in 1581, after some years of war, did the United"
Provinces set up a General Executive Council. In the same year the
"Prince of Orange was chosen sovereign (Motley, pp. 838, 841)."
§ 3. _The Supremacy of Dutch Commerce_
"The conquest of Flanders by Alexander of Parma, reducing its plains to"
"wolf-haunted wildernesses, and driving the great mass of the remaining"
"artisans from its ruined towns,[783] helped to consummate the prosperity"
"of the United Provinces, who took over the industry of Ghent with the"
commerce of Antwerp.[784] Getting the start of all northern Europe in

"It is true that, as Buckle argues, the many earthquakes in Spain"
tended to promote superstitious fear; but then on his principles
"the Dutch seafaring habits, and the constant risks and frequent"
"disasters of inundation, had the same primary tendency. For the"
"rest, the one serious oversight in Buckle's theory of Spanish"
"civilisation is his assumption (cp. 3-vol. ed. ii, 455-61; 1-vol."
"ed. p. 550) that Spanish ""loyalty"" was abnormal and continuous from"
the period of the first struggles with the Moors. As to this see
"the present writer's notes in the 1-vol. ed. of Buckle, as cited."
"Even Ferdinand, as an Aragonese, was disrespectfully treated by the"
"Castilians (cp. Armstrong as cited, pp. 5, 31, etc.; De Castro,"
"_History of Religious Intolerance in Spain_, Eng. tr. 1853, pp. 40,"
41); and Philip I and Charles V set up a new resistance. An alien
dynasty could set up disaffection in Spain as elsewhere.
"It should be noted, finally, that the stiff ceremonialism which is"
held to be the special characteristic of Spanish royalty was a
"Burgundo-Teutonic innovation, dating from Philip I, and that even"
"in the early days of Philip the Cortes petitioned ""that the"
household of the Prince Don Carlos should be arranged on the old
"Spanish lines, and not in the pompous new-fangled way of the House"
"of Burgundy"" (Major Hume's _Spain_, p. 127). Prescott (_Philip II_,"
"ed. cited, pp. 655, 659) makes the petition refer to the king's own"
"household, and shows it to have condemned the king's excessive"
"expenditure in very strong terms, saying the expense of his"
"household was ""as great as would be required for the conquest of a"
"kingdom."" At the same time the Cortes petitioned against"
"bull-fights, which appear to have originated with the Moors, were"
"strongly opposed by Isabella the Catholic, and were much encouraged"
"by the Teutonic Charles V (U.R. Burke, _History of Spain_, 1895,"
"for nine millions of square miles over half Asia, much of Persia,"
and now claim to control the Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor? If
England might claim a large section of Persia as her sphere of
"influence, and Egypt likewise and a fourth part of Africa, much of"
"Arabia, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean, why might not Germany and"
Austria expect to have their little spheres of influence in the
"Balkans, in Asia Minor, in Mesopotamia? We had helped France to"
Morocco and Italy to Tripoli; why should we bother about Servia? It
"might be unkind, but then were we not unkind towards her father's"
"country, Ireland? Were we very tender towards national independence"
"in Egypt, in Persia?"
"Yet this brutal invasion of France, this unprovoked attack on Liège"
were ugly things. France had shown no disposition to egg Servia on
"against Austria, and Sir Edward Grey in the last days of June--she"
"now learnt for the first time, for she had seen no newspapers in"
"prison, where it is part of the dehumanizing policy of the Home"
"Office to prevent their entry, or the dissemination of any"
information about current events--Sir Edward Grey had clearly shown
Great Britain did not approve of Servian intrigues in Bosnia. Well:
let the best man win. Germany was just as likely to give the Vote to
her women as was Britain. The Germans were first in Music and in
"Science. She for her part didn't wish to become a German subject,"
but once the War was over she would willingly naturalize herself
Belgian or Swiss.
And the War must soon be over. Europe as a whole could not allow
this devastation of resources. America would intervene. Already the
Germans realized their gigantic blunder in starting the attack.
Their men were said to be--she read--much less brave than people had
expected. The mighty German Armies had been held up for ten days by
a puny Belgian force and the forts of Liège and Namur. There would
"theirs. They suspect me of being a spy in German pay. Besides, your"
"von Bissing has ordered now that all Belgian, British, and French"
wounded shall be taken to the German Red Cross. Well: if you want
"to be kind, give me an introduction there. Surely it would be bare"
humanity on your part to let an Englishwoman be with some of those
"poor lads who are sorely wounded, dying perhaps""--she broke"
"down--""The other day I followed two of the motor ambulances along"
"the Boulevard d'Anspach. Blood dripped from them as they passed, and"
"I could hear some English boy trying to sing 'Tipperary--'"""
"""My _tear_ Miss Warren--I will try to do all that you want--You will"
"not do _anything I_ want, but never mind. I will show you that"
Germans can be generous. I will speak about your mother. I am sorry
that there are bad-mannered Germans in the hotel. There are
"some--what-you-call 'bounders'--among us, as there are with you. It"
"is to be regretted. As to our Red Cross hospitals, I know of a"
person who can make things easy for you. I will write a letter to my
cousin--like me she is a Saxon and comes from Leipzig--Minna von
"Stachelberg. She is but a few months widow, widow of a Saxon"
"officer, Graf von Stachelberg who was killed at Namur. Oh! it was"
very sad; they were but six months married. Afterwards she came here
"to work in our Red Cross--I think now she is in charge of a ward..."""
So Vivie found a few months' reprieve from acute sorrow and bitter
humiliation. Gräfin von Stachelberg was as kind in her way as her
"cousin the Colonel, but much less sentimental. In fact she was of"
"that type of New German woman, taken all too little into account by"
our Press at the time of the War. There were many like her of the
"upper middle class, the professorial class, the lesser nobility to"
"be found not only in Leipzig but in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfort,"
"Halle, Bonn, München, Hannover, Bremen, Jena, Stuttgart,"
"Cologne--nice to look at, extremely modern in education and good"
"missals, hours, offices, prayer books, etc., go under _Baptists,"
"Benedictines, Catholic Church, Church of England, Friends_, etc."
That part of a body which belongs to any place should be entered
"under the name of the body, not the place: e.g., _Congregationalists"
"in New England_, _Congregationalists in Massachusetts_, not _New"
"England Congregationalists_, _Massachusetts Congregationalists_. But"
cross-references must be made from the place (indeed in cases like
"_Massachusetts Convention_, _Essex Conference_, it may be doubted"
whether those well-known names should not be the headings).
"Enter corporations and quasi corporations, both English and"
"foreign, under their names as they read, neglecting an initial"
article or serial number when there is one.
"Enter orders of knighthood, both those of medieval times and their"
"honorary modern equivalents, under the significant word of the"
"English title: e.g., _Garter, Order of the_; _Malta, Knights"
"of_; _Templars, Knights_; _Teutonic Order_; _Freemasons_. But"
"the American Knights Templars, being merely a division of the"
"Freemasons, belong under _Freemasons_; so of other regular"
masonic bodies.
The colleges of an English university and the unnamed professional
schools of an American university go under the university's
"name. Such professional schools, if they have a distinctive"
"name, particularly if at a distance from the university, or for"
"any other reason less closely connected with it, go under their"
"own name: e.g., _Oxford University, Magdalen College_; _Harvard"
"University, Veterinary School_; but _Barnard College, Columbia"
"University_; _Radcliffe College, Harvard University_; _Sheffield"
Scientific School of Yale University_.
"Captain Johnson, in his ""Lives of the Pirates,"" when Porter and his friend"
"""addressed the Pyrate, as the Queen of Sheba did Solomon, to wit, That"
"having heard of his Fame and Achievements, they had put in there to learn"
"his Art and Wisdom in the Business of pyrating, being Vessels on the same"
honourable Design with himself; and hoped with the Communication of his
"Knowledge, they should also receive his Charity, being in want of"
Necessaries for such Adventures. Roberts was won upon by the Peculiarity
"and Bluntness of these two Men and gave them Powder, Arms, and what ever"
"else they had Occasion for, spent two or three merry Nights with them, and"
"at parting, said, he hoped the L---- would Prosper their handy Works."""
"POUND, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"On August 8th, 1689, this pirate, with five men and a boy, sailed out of"
"Boston Harbour as passengers in a small vessel. When off Lovell's Island,"
five other armed men joined them. Pound now seized the craft and took
"command, and declared his intention of going on a piratical cruise. The"
first vessel they met with they decided to take. It was a fishing boat.
"Pound ran his craft alongside, but at the last moment his heart failed"
"him, and he merely bought eight penn'o'th of mackerel from the surprised"
fishermen.
"He then sailed to Falmouth, Maine, where the corporal and soldiers of the"
guard at the fort deserted in the night and sailed off with Pound and his
"crew. Fortified by this addition to his crew, the pirate attacked a sloop,"
"the _Good Speed_, off Cape Cod, and a brigantine, the _Merrimack_, and"
"several other prizes. By this time, the Governor at Boston had heard of"
"Pound's escapades, and sent an armed sloop, the _Mary_, to search for him."
"The pirate was discovered in Tarpaulin Cove, and a fierce and bloody fight"
"took place before the pirates struck their ""Red flagg."" The prisoners were"
"cast into Boston Gaol to await their trial. Pound had been wounded, being"
"grown to piracy, the northern League gave its main strength to trade by"
sea.
Its special interest for us to-day lies in the fact that it was
"ultra-racial, beginning in 1241 in a pact between the free cities of"
"Lübeck and Hamburg,[715] and finally including Wendish, German, Dutch,"
"French, and even Spanish cities, in fluctuating numbers. The motive to"
"union, as it had need be, was one of mercantile gain. Beginning,"
"apparently, by having each its separate authorised _hansa_ or"
"trading-group in foreign cities, the earlier trading-towns of the group,"
perhaps from the measure of co-operation and fraternity thus forced on
"them abroad,[716] saw their advantage in a special league for the common"
good as a monopoly maintained against outsiders; and this being
"extended, the whole League came to bear the generic name."
See Kohlrausch for the theory that contact in foreign cities is the
"probable cause of the policy of union (_History of Germany_, Eng."
"tr., p. 260; cp. Ashley, _Introd. to Economic History_, i, 104,"
"110). As to the origin of the word, see Stubbs, i, 447, _note_. The"
_hans_ or _hansa_ first appears historically in England as a name
"apparently identical with _gild_; and, starting with a _hansa_ or"
"hanse-house of their own, English cities in some cases are found"
"trading through subordinate _hansas_ in other cities, not only of"
Normandy but of England itself. Thus arose the Flemish Hansa or
"""Hansa of London,"" ignored in so many notices of the better-known"
Hanseatic League. Early in the thirteenth century it included a
number of the towns of Flanders engaged in the English wool-trade;
"and later it numbered at one time seventeen towns, including"
"Chalons, Rheims, St. Quentin, Cambray, and Amiens (Ashley, _Introd."
"to Economic History_, i, 109; cp. Prof. Schanz, _Englische"
"Handelspolitik_, 1889, i, 6, citing Varenbergh, _Hist. des"

39. Any Ship or Goods taken as Prize by any of the Officers and Crew of
"a Ship other than a Ship of War of Her Majesty shall, on Condemnation,"

IV.--PRIZE SALVAGE.
[Sidenote: Salvage to Re-captors of British Ship or Goods from Enemy.]
"40. Where any Ship or Goods belonging to any of Her Majesty's Subjects,"
"after being taken as Prize by the Enemy, is or are retaken from the"
"Enemy by any of Her Majesty's Ships of War, the same shall be restored"
"by Decree of a Prize Court to the Owner, on his paying as Prize Salvage"
One Eighth Part of the Value of the Prize to be decreed and ascertained
"by the Court, or such Sum not exceeding One Eighth Part of the estimated"
Value of the Prize as may be agreed on between the Owner and the
"Re-captors, and approved by Order of the Court; Provided, that where the"
"Re-capture is made under circumstances of Special Difficulty or Danger,"
"the Prize Court may, if it thinks fit, award to the Re-captors as Prize"
"Salvage a larger Part than One Eighth Part, but not exceeding in any"
"Case One Fourth Part, of the Value of the Prize."
"Provided also, that where a Ship after being so taken is set forth or"
"used by any of Her Majesty's Enemies as a Ship of War, this Provision"
"for Restitution shall not apply, and the Ship shall be adjudicated on as"
in other Cases of Prize.
[Sidenote: Permission to re-captured Ship to proceed on Voyage.]
"41. Where a Ship belonging to any of Her Majesty's Subjects, after being"
"taken as Prize by the Enemy, is retaken from the Enemy by any of Her"
"which these occasioned"" (Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. v, ed. cited"
"of _Works_, vol. iv, p. 387). ""It was only tanners, dyers, and"
apostate priests who were Protestants at that day in the
"Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 124). The same conditions would have had"
"similar results in Spain, where many Catholics thought Philip much"
"too religious for his age and station (Motley, p. 76)."
It seems necessary to insist on the elementary fact that it was
Netherlanders who put Protestants to death in the Netherlands; and
that it was Spaniards who were burnt in Spain. In the Middle Ages
"""nowhere was the persecution of heretics more relentless than in"
"the Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 36; cp. p. 132). Grenvelle, most"
"zealous of heresy-hunters, was a Burgundian; Viglius, an even"
"bitterer persecutor, was a Frisian. The statement of Prescott"
"(_Philip II_, Kirk's ed. 1894, p. 149) that the Netherlanders"
"""claimed freedom of thought as their birthright"" is a gratuitous"
"absurdity. As regards, further, the old hallucination of ""race"
"types,"" it has to be noted that Charles, a devout Catholic and"
"persecutor, was emphatically _Teutonic_, according to the"
established canons. His stock was Burgundo-Austrian on the father's
side; his Spanish mother was of Teutonic descent; he had the fair
"hair, blue eyes, and hanging jaw and lip of the Teutonic Hapsburgs"
"(see Menzel, _Geschichte der Deutschen_, cap. 341), and so had his"
"descendants after him. On the other hand, William the Silent was"
"markedly ""Spanish"" in his physiognomy (Motley, p. 56), and his"
reticence would in all ages pass for a Spanish rather than a
"""Teutonic"" characteristic. Motley is reduced to such shifts of"
"rhetoric concerning Philip II as the proposition (p. 75) that ""the"
Burgundian and Austrian elements of his blood seemed to have
"evaporated."" But his descendant, Philip IV, as seen in the great"
"portraits of Velasquez, is, like him, a ""typical"" Teuton; and the"
"stock preserved the Teutonic physiological tendency to gluttony, a"
and _Political Maxims of the State of Holland_ (really written by De
"Witt's friend, Pierre Delacourt; De Witt, however, contributing two"
"chapters), and much attention was given to it here and on the Continent."
In addition to the many and copious histories written in the eighteenth
"century in Dutch, three or four voluminous and competent histories of"
"the Low Countries were written in French--_e.g._, those of Dujardin"
"(1757, etc., 8 vols. 4to), Cerisier (1777, etc., 10 vols. 12mo), Le"
"Clerc (1723-28, 3 vols. folio), Wicquefort (1719, folio, proceeding from"
"Peace of Münster). Of late years, though the lesson is as important as"
"ever, it appears to be less generally attended to. In our own country,"
"however, have appeared Davies' _History of Holland_ (1841, 3 vols.), a"
"careful but not often an illuminating work, which oddly begins with the"
"statement that ""there is scarcely any nation whose history has been so"
"little understood or so generally neglected as that of Holland""; T."
"Colley Grattan's earlier and shorter book (_The Netherlands_, 1830),"
which is still worth reading for a general view based on adequate
"learning; and the much better known works of Motley, _The Rise of the"
Dutch Republic_ (1856) and the _History of the United Netherlands_
"(1861-68), which deal minutely with only a period of fifty-five years of"
"Dutch history, and of which, as of the work of Davies, the sociological"
value is much below the annalistic. All three are impaired as literature
by their stale rhetoric. The same malady infects the second volume of
"the _Industrial History of the Free Nations_ (1846), by W. Torrens"
"M'Cullagh (afterwards M'Cullagh Torrens); but this, which deals with"
"Holland, is the better section of that treatise, and it gives distinct"
"help to a scientific conception of the process of Dutch history, as does"
"J.R. M'Culloch's _Essay on the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Commerce"
"in Holland_, which is one of the best of his _Essays and Treatises_ (2nd"
ed. 1859). The _Holland_ of the late Professor Thorold Rogers has merit
"as a vivacious conspectus, but hardly rises to the opportunity."
"Of the many French, Belgian, and German works on special periods of the"
and gone himself with their beautiful new motor--whatever _could_
"the chauffeur have thought?--to meet her at the prison gates,"
"_there_ he was, afterwards, worrying himself over the War: not"
"content as she was, as most of her friends were, as the newspapers"
"were, to leave it all to Lord Kitchener and Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward"
"Grey, and even Mr. Lloyd George--though the latter had made some"
"rather foolish and exaggerated speeches about Alcohol. Michael, if"
"he went on like this, would _never_ get his knighthood!"
"Then when Michael had at last, thanks to General Armstrong, found"
his right place and was accomplishing marvels--the papers said--as a
"""mender of the maimed""--here was she left alone in Portland Place"
"with hardly any one to speak to, and all her acquaintances--she now"
realized they were scarcely her friends--too much occupied with war
work to spend an afternoon in discussing nothing very important over
"a sumptuous tea, still served by a butler and footman."
"Presently, too, the butler left to join the Professor in France and"
"the footman enlisted, and the tea had to be served by a _distraite_"
"parlour-maid, with her eye on a munitions factory--so that she"
"might be ""in it""--and her heart in the keeping of the footman, who,"
"since he had gone into khaki, was irresistible."
"Mrs. Rossiter of course said, in 1914, that she would take up war"
work. She subscribed most handsomely to the Soldiers' and Sailors'
"Families' Association, to the Red Cross, to the Prince of Wales's"
Fund (one of the unsolved war-time mysteries ... what's become of
"it?), to the Cigarette Fund, the 1914 Christmas Plum Pudding Fund,"
"the Blue Cross, the Purple Cross, the Green Cross funds; to the"
outstandingly good work at St. Dunstan's and at Petersham--(I am
glad she gave a Hundred pounds each to _them_); and to the
"French, Belgian, Russian, Italian, Serbian, Portuguese and Japanese"
"A complete bibliography, cataloguing the whole of Croce's multifarious"
"activity, is outside the scope of this note. The nearest approach to it"
"can be found in G. Castellano's _Introduzione alle opere di B. Croce_,"
"Bari, 1920, which contains, besides, a full list of translations in"
"eight languages, a bibliography of the Italian and foreign critical"
"literature on Croce, and a very useful series of abstracts of"
discussions and judgments on Croce's work.
Besides articles and essays in American and English magazines and
"reviews, the following works of Croce have been translated into"
"English: the four volumes of the _Filosofia dello Spirito_, the essay"
"on Hegel, the _Essence of Ãsthetics_, and the essays on _Ariosto,"
"Shakespeare, and Corneille_, by Douglas Ainslie; the essay on Vico, by"
"R. G. Collingwood, and the essays on Historical Materialism, by C. M."
Meredith. But the English or American student of Croce ought to rely
as little as possible on translations; the reading of the Italian text
"will be found comparatively easy, on the basis of a good acquaintance"
with Latin or with French. The labour entailed by the surmounting
of the first difficulties will be largely repaid by the advantages
"gained in coming into direct contact with Croce's thought, and by the"
acquisition of at least a reading knowledge of Italian.
"For the vast critical literature on Croce, scattered through the"
literary and philosophical reviews of Europe and of America during
"the last twenty years, we are compelled again to refer the reader to"
Castellano's book. We shall only mark out Croce's own autobiographical
"notes, the Contributo listed above, which, however, having been printed"
"for private circulation only, is not generally accessible except in"
the French translation printed in the _Revue de MÃ©taphysique et de
"Morale_, XXVI, pp. 1-40. The following are the only books which give"
"a general view of Croce's thought: G. Prezzolini, _Benedetto Croce_,"
"Naples, 1909; E. Chiocchetti, _La filosofia di B. Croce_, Florence,"

"As a result of researches in the field of Babylonian-Assyrian divination,"
"now extending over a number of years[1], it may be definitely said that"
"apart from the large class of miscellaneous omens[2], the Babylonians and"
Assyrians developed chiefly three methods of divination into more or less
elaborate systems--divination through the inspection of the liver of a
"sacrificial animal or Hepatoscopy, through the observation of the"
"inadequate way, but for the help generously accorded from many"
"quarters. My heartfelt thanks are due to Lord Acton, Regius Professor"
"of Modern History in the University of Cambridge, for advice of the"

Maybe plumbing.

Otherwise they'll worry and come here.
Then hurry and call.
Yes.
"This is Ilia, please bring the change."
Change?
"It's 20,000 yen, right?"
I don't need change.
Oh...

Show him our ID.
What's happening?
Why?
Don't leave me up here.

You're not going to go outside.
Are you?

You know the risks.

So.
Is it cold or not?
No.
It's not cold.
I went out like this.
OK.

Just keep calm.
(CRAWFORD GAGGING)
"Fine, Clare!"
What do you need?
(STAMMERING) Okay...
I need something sharp...
"To stab into his chest, to release the pressure."
That's right.
I have a knife.
That's no good.
A valve...
I need a valve.
Got a pen.
In my back pocket.
"Yes, a pen!"
A pen will work!
Here...
Okay?
"Yes, perfect."
"Um, take that part out of it, and then slice off the end."
"All right, Dad, just keep breathing for me."
That's right.
I've got you.
I've got you.
Are you good?
All right.
All right.
(YELLING)
(YELLING IN ARABIC)
"Keep breathing for me, all right?"
I'll never get used to that name.
It took a lot of courage to do what you did at the hearing.
Maybe we can talk.
Call me.
Bye.
"Yes, Bob, I know you're hungry."
You're always hungry.
Go catch a rat.
Let's see what our friends the coastguard have for us.
Let's see.
Nothing up there but cabins.
Jesus Christ!
"Bob, will you get that..."
This is Hardy here.
Go.
Jo!
Kim Lee!
No!
"Oh, God!"
It stops now!
"Hands high, Danny."
Where's the girl?
I know everything.
- I got your note.
- What note?
Jesus Christ!
The key to Detillo's conviction was the testimony of Thomas Hardy.
Surprised?
"Hello, Jimmy."
I got you.
"I got you good, didn't I?"
Admit it.
Pass it on.
MAN 4:
"Hey, vato, pass that wire."
MAN 5:
Just a minute.
Pinche mayate.
MAN 4:
"What the fuck's going on, ese?"
Pass that wire.
"Órale, pass the wire!"
"Here you go, man."
Here you go.
Fuck!
COP:
Chow release!
Let's go.
(BELL ringing)
"Let's go, gentlemen."
Chow release.
"Okay, gentlemen, let's go."
"Come on, move it."
Give him the uppercut.
He's going down.
"(GRUNTlNG) That shit wasn't even clean, man."
(SPEAKS spanish)
What's your problem?
I paid for a full load.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of business.
Don't worry?
"I'm sick, motherfucker!"
Make sure he gets what he ordered right now.
You think your mom will let us stay up all night?
Yeah.
And we could also...
"Um, tonight's not gonna be good."
I just remembered I have to see my grandma.
What?
"Oh, but..."
"I'll come by your house if I can, maybe."
It's okay.
"See you tomorrow, Gracie."
Then there was the other mom.
Mommy?
"How was school, baby?"
Hm?
- Want a foot rub?
"- Oh, no, honey."
What are you doing?
Why did you do that?
You want the neighbors to see me?
- Is that what you want?
- No.
They're gonna take me away if they see me.
"I'm sorry, Mommy."
"Oh, I'm so..."
What kind of tea do you want?
Mint?
You like mint.
I would try anything to reach her.
Ow!
"Ow, ow, ow!"
"Mommy, I burnt myself!"
Ow.
- I didn't know that.
- Why don't you come to Chicago with me?
Iâm not gonna be there long.
I don't even know you.
"That's weird, isn't it?"
Right?
- Sure.
- Okay.
Oh!
You have a jukebox.
There's your fun over there.
- Yeah.
- Do you have any money?
"- It's free, we just let you give--"
"- Oh, free?"
"Finally, something free, okay."
I'm gonna play a song and Iâm gonna get out of your hair.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Any song?
- Whatever you want.
- Okay.
Here's one.
This one's for you.
Redhead.
(song playing)
Perfect.
"All right, I'll see you tomorrow."
- Okay.
- Okay.
Bye!
- It's nice to meet you.
Go straight and turn right.
Okay.
- Thank you.
Hello.
I ordered coffee a long time ago.
Will you bring it today?
Yes.
Come quickly.
"May I come in, sir?"
- Yeah.
Come in.
"Hello, sir."
This is Gul.
Yeah.
Pia told me about you.
Tell me something.
Will you come to office at this hour every day?
"Actually, sir.."
- No.
No.
You don't have to call me sir.
I am used to working in a friendly ambiance.
So I guess Vivek is fine.
- Okay.
Come.
You got time?
It takes you an hour to bring a cup of coffee.
"Yes, sir."
He is the spoilt brat of our office.
Delete Singh.
"- Hello, ma'am."
Delete Singh?
- Angel?
It's me.
John.
"- I'm scared, John."
I'm coming to get you.
- Everything all right?
- Yes.
Where and when?
- John?
- Girls in life.

You do not have to do this.
Support call.
I'll kill you.
- John.
I silahsızım.
- Where the little girl?
I know you've got what I want?
Thank you.
OK.
Leave the little girl.
I'll take you to him.
- I'm afraid.
- Listen.
"Rachel'la want you to go, okay?"
- Go Rachel'la.
- Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.
God.
For me what to do grant the power and wisdom.
Must find the head with me.
"The beginning of the little girl will be asked, since that is where it is?"
Take me.
Go ahead.
Take...
Hello.
Eva.
I'll call your insurance.
Why?
You've no right to bother me at work.
I don't.
- You don't want my services.
But I do want your services.
My job is to fuck.
At your home.
If I report that you're harassing me...
- I need you.
Eva.
No one needs me.
Especially you.
- Really?
You're just a customer.
A very difficult one.
Let's stop playing games.
- Why are you calling me?
Why me?
Because I was crying?
Why were you crying?
That's my problem.
- Maybe I could help.
Great.
I've got me a Saint Bernard.
Please.
Don't compare me to a dog.
Stop!
You can come in!
You can come in!
What was that?
I don't know.
I just know this is what happens if you don't invite me in.
What if I didn't say anything...?
Would you have just kept bleeding...?
You'd have died?
I knew you wouldn't let me...
You can borrow one of my mom's old dresses if you want...!
Hello!
Owen?
I'm in here...!
I'll be right there!
"""Hi, Owen."
Good morning.
I am in the bathroom.
Please do not come in.
Want to hang out with me again tonight?
I really like you.
"Love, Abby."""
Hello...!
Police department!
Open the door
Open the door!
Police officer!
"No, no!"
Stop!
"Jesus Christ, son !"
No!
Owen...
Shut up.
Get off me.
Get off of me.
Get off.
"Get away from me, Leonard."
Don't touch...
Get away from me!
Stay away!
"Quinn, go to your room and lock your door."
"Go on, son."
"- I hate you, Leonard!"
- Maggie.
Don't touch me!
I hate you!
- 911.
What's your emergency?
- My name is Quinn.
- Something bad is happening.
"- Maggie, it's your dad."
I'm not hearing this.
This cannot be happening again.
This voice I keep hearing...
No.
This is not happening again.
Please...
This doesn't make sense to me.
Please...
Mom.
You're such a nut.
What do you think I have on?
"No, I have a skirt and a shirt on."
It's not too short.
- Plan B. There it is.
Right there in front of us.
I knew it.
I knew it.
- Just trust and it will come.
"- Oh, my gosh."
This is insane.
- The fountain is plan B?
- You're putting them in the fountain?
- Really?
- Freshwater.
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- It's like a giant aquarium, I guess."
- Make a wish upon each fish.
"- Okay, guys."
Out you go.
Out you go.
"- Ma'am, I don't think you can do that."
- We should probably go.
Stick with your buddy.
- Don't get left behind.
- Ma'am.
- Mom.
- Freedom!
I got a lady and three minors putting some fish in the fountain.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"- Run, run, run."
Hoo-hoo!
"Hey, Grace, come on."
Get in the car.
Come on.
Don't try to serve a summons on me!
I'll do it.
(CHATTERING)

Get down !
COP:
Get down !
I said get down !
Wipe your face.
"I got him, ese."
I got the vato.
"You're bleeding, carnal."
"Hey, the dude had a filero."
"He cut me, man."
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?
Cheryl Ann.
That's right.
And you and Cheryl Ann have a little girl.
What's her name?
Bonnie.
How old is she?
Eight.
"You don't like telling me about your family, do you?"
"No, I guess I don't."
I don't blame you.
-I got something for you.
-Where are you going?
"Don't shoot me, officer."
What the hell are you doing now?
Whether I can trust him.
Take your time.
You've only just met.
"OK, Mother."
I'd like to know if it is love between Marco and me.
What do you think?
How should I know?
Hi.
What are you doing?
Watching TV.
Eating.
Could you?
Sorry.
I'll put it back.
Perhaps I should go to the movies after all.
"Oh, come off it."
Stop cleaning up his mess.
What do you mean?
- Any news about your car?
- Small-town cops.
Forget it.
Leave it.
I'll do it.
"Take this, will you?"
- Wow!
- Reflexes...
Shit!
We could spend some more time together.
We could be closer.
I mean...
I could live here.
You and I could do the ski courses together.
Kevin Calhoun.
I've just been talking to a friend of yours.
- I've got the probation report.
- Where are you?
Right around the corner.
Meet me at Franklin and Hudson.
Schwartz?
- George.
- Abe called me.
He's in the back.
That's the only way in.
The back door's gated.
All right.
I got a couple marriages.
Abe.
It's your play!
Throw the card for me.
You've been practicing all your life.
"Freddie, give us a minute."
He's dead!
Schwartz is dead.
I heard it on the phone.
I was...
Get ahold of yourself.
It's okay.
You were right.
You knew it from the minute we saw him that day.
It wasn't kosher.
There was a second report.
That was only a feeling.
Now it's a fact.
5 people are dead.
That's when I got burned.
It's four months ago now.
I left four years ago.
"- Hi, Mum."
- So you're back?
"- Yes, I am."
- And you'll stay?
- Yes.
- You can't stay here.
I know.
"But what have they done to you, Allan?"
"They didn't do anything, Mum."
It was an accident.
Something's happened.
All the old shit has to change.
I've made a decision.
My life's going to be proper now.
I'll lead a proper life.
With a job.
An apartment.
Maybe a girlfriend.
There are four walls.
You can even look out the window.
I'll take it.
I have to see whether my car will start.
It's a Ford Mustang '73.
Can I get you a beer?
"- An FF, please."
- An FF?
I'm Allan.
- Maja.
- Maja?
She's still not answering.
"Yeah, Morgan."
We're on our way to Hilary Ross' house now.
She's still not answering her phone.
"All right, call local police."
He's not going to go quietly.
Do you have Mayor Wennington?
Yeah.
Keep me posted.
You got it.
Hello.
You've reached Hilary Ross.
I'm still getting nothing.
That's her car.
"All right, you two go around back."
I'll draw his fire while you flank him.
You sure you want to split up?
We gotta cover the back and the front in case he runs.
Let's go.
Aah!
Aah!
FBI!
Ohh!
Oh!
You're hit!
I'm good.
"Go, go!"
He's upstairs.
Aah!
Get in here!
Trevor Mills!
FBI!
Help.
Help.
Help.
Help!
"Something wrong, Captain?"
Leave me alone
"- Hey, clear off, you drunk."
- Get lost.
Now what's the matter?
Have you gone mad?
There.
A moment ago.
Didn't you see anything?
Here?
I'm the only one here.
"Are you afraid of ghosts, Captain?"
I
I thought I saw something.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
Sounds like he saw a ghost.
- Maybe there was a ghost.
- Just for him?
Yes.
Just for him.
Help!
Bring us some drinks.
- A ship has been wrecked on the rocks.
- A ship?
When?
Only a few hours ago.
Yes.
Logan.
- Logan.
- Hey.
Hey!
You'll get it back after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into.
Logan.
- What?
I think the... that's not her mother.
- So she talks?
- We're communicating.
Communicating.
Take these now.
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.
you understand?
but this is the mutant that I told you about.
She needs our help.
She's not a mutant.
she is!
Charles?
Eating?
Pipe throwing?
It's okay.
yeah.
Take the gun.
Dump the body.
Text me when you're on the way back.
You have anything else you need?
Food for the kid?
mutie.
It's okay.
In here!
Up here!
"Indy, come on!"
Hold on!
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!
It's stuck!
Indy!
I can't push it off!
It's stuck!
-Turn it!
Turn it!
-It's stuck!
Turn it there!
Never mind!
Get back!
Get back!
Get the Ark away from this place immediately.
Have it put on the truck.
We'll fly it out of Cairo.
"And Gobler, I want plenty of protection."
Jones.
"Holy smoke, my friends,"
I...
I'm so pleased you're not dead!
"Indy, Indy, we have no time."
"If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo."
Truck?
What truck?
Let's go!
Get back to Cairo.
"Get us some transport to England- boat, plane, anything."
Holy shit!
A fucking...
Uh...
Hard to explain.
It's like a huge-ass spider with a face and dicks coming out of his mouth.
It's...
Peters.
Peters is inside.
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.
"Ah, Katie!"
"Are you doing this, or is this fucking me?"
- I think that's all you.
- I'm so fucked up!
God!
Fuck!
"Holy shit, you're fucking gross."
Yeah...
"Sorry, can you say again?"
"Katie, hello?"
"Damn it, Katie!"
"Whenever you come back online, just say the word."
"No, I'm not scared, just... bored."
That you guys?
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably a good idea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Fuck it, man!"
Come on!
You're in danger.
Sonja?
Now we're talking.
"As long as I don't eat a piece of food for a month, I'll be fine."
"Yeah, I thought you said you wore a size six."
Daisy:
She was a size six.
"Like 12 years ago, right?"
"- Hey-- yo, that ain't funny."
Shit.
- I'm sorry.
Maggie:
Don't be like that.
You know you look gorgeous.
Daisy:
"You do, you're beautiful."
"- Hey, Carlos."
"- Hi, baby!"
Bride:
"I said, uh!"
The bitch is four feet tall.
And her man is supposed to have...
- Maggie:
Here you go.
-...a 10-inch dick!
Baby?
- You're sure?
- No.
"Do you want some of this, Carlos?"
- No.
I'm not into that shit.
What are you into?
Are you sure?
- I'm out of here.
- Carlos?
- Oh.
Um...
"He was here a couple of minutes ago, but I know he's going on soon."
"- I was just wondering, is he okay?"
"- Yeah, he seemed fine."
- Tell him to call me after.
- Okay.
All right.
Y'all having fun?
Good.
Good.
I'm glad.
"Well, our next performer is Eddie Tennenbaum, and, uh..."
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
"Yes, we all love him."
"No, he's not..."
Okay...
"He's not here, though."
I'm sorry.
He's not here.
- But he is...
"- Come on, Eddie."
I don't know where he is.
We can't find him.
Which is fine.
I'm sure he'll be here any second.
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
Eddie?
"Are we back there, Eddie?"
Anywhere?
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hyo-jin?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.
Hey.
Say hello.
This is my nephew.
"What, a priest?"
"Not yet, he's in training."
A deacon.
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.
You speak Japanese?
Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
Yang E-sam.
Two-three
Is that your real name?
"Yes, sir."
How are you?
Good.
Ow!
Richie!
It was cute when you were five.
Shut up and help me.
Ah!
Freed.
"Hey, ab..."
Sent-minded.
What is he doing here?
You know Brody's my partner.
He comes with the car.
I'll catch you later.
Could he be any more disgusting?
Ha ha.
You don't want to know.
Did you tell Steve you knew?
"Hell, no."
This is your mess.
I'm just a shoulder to cry on.
I appreciate it.
Mom knows.
Is she mad?
"You know, more hurt than mad."
I told you to tell 'em last night.
I couldn't.
The Bears were winning.
Everybody was really happy.
Exactly!
Always take advantage of a good mood.
"Well, you could always quit."
Oh.
Oh.
# Do-do-do-do do-do-do

Oh!
Oh!
HE GROANS
Where's the fucking remote?
"Oh, no."
"It's all right, you don't have to go."
"I'm sorry, Norma."
I can't do it.
It's my babies here I need.
What are you talking about?
"I'm not coming back, Norm."
"And I am sorry to you three an' all, you went to so much trouble."
"Food was lovely, though."
It's all right.
I understand.
Here.
Cheers.
So what are you going to do now?
Are you gonna go home?
Nah.
She'll come round.
She's just not thinking straight.
Who?
A strange man.
He's trying to get in.
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hvo-jm?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.

"What's your name, son?"
"Oh, God, it hurts!"
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!
"-Oh, make it stop!"
-I am trying!
Get the ball.
Ready?
Get the ball!
"You're cute, but you're not too smart."
Did I just throw this?
-Hi.
-Hi.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute.
"I wish I could play, but I've gotta go to work."
I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting.
"Yes, I do."
"Bye-bye, Joey."
"Seriously, I can't stop it."
Come here!
Hey!
That's Rachel.
She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
"Hey, you understand, right?"
"Pardon, my Mariska."
Which on side shall we start it?
"Below or above, totally all the same."
One.
Two.

Very good.
Now like this.
Some.
Now that.
Great.
Ready.
Come on.
What's it like?
What?
Ow.
Well beautiful.
I did not see one like this yet.
"Newer cardboards, Ágika!"
Wow it no.
Not at all.
Our kindest guest humiliates himself with so inferior work.
This can not be.
"Me, not spare, my Mariska."
"Now, when I feel well finally."
"Cardboards, Ágika!"
Here you go.
"If it is for major lord, has desire for him really."
What his blessed hand yes.
"Don't worry, my doll."
Don't cry.
Forget about it.
"No, grandma."
I don't want to forget.
"Wake up, Maria."
Get up already.
Get up!
What's the matter?
- I'm leaving.
"- So soon, Quico?"
When are your parents coming for you?
I don't know.
Did you ask grandma?
"- Bye, Maria."
"- Bye, Quico."
"Don't step on the lines, Barbuda."
"Goodness, Maria!"
I don't know if I'll make it.
"Look, the cotton candy man."
Spin it around.
This one.
- We have a winner.
- Two reais.
- It's cheaper in the circus.
- Life is expensive these days.
I want a piece of this cloud.
"Look at the seagulls, Maria!"
Can we shoo them away?
- Want to get your feet wet?
- Yeah.
I've missed you so much!
"Hey, little man."
You've been through a lot lately.
How you doing?
I have nightmares sometimes.
I get scared.
You do?

My hero.
"Oh, geez."
Ohh.
I didn't know it was gonna get that crowded!
"So, what do you think of the book so far?"
"Dude, seriously."
Quit asking me.
I will throw this book out the window.
That's the only signed one in the world.
It's a collector's item.
"We'll always have omaha, mouth."
You just said a mouthful.

"Go on, turn."
You two are gorgeous.
"My partner, Pedro."

They work at the crab factory.
We're celebrating because they got a raise.
They won the strike.

I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew this was gonna fucking happen.
I'm here.
I'm here.
"Why would you lie to me, Michael?"
What are you talking about?
What were you doing all night?
I was with Chris.
"God, you lying bastard."
You make me so sick.
You know?
I'm really lucky you became my husband.
Really?
Well now is the start of our new life.
Oh come on!
You're so handsome!
And you...
You're the fairest of them all!
Promise me that it'll only be me.
You're the only one I will love.
Promise me that you won't leave me.
I'll always be here by your side.
"You're my life, Migs."
"I love you, Joy."
"Here, I've already prepared it because I knew you were coming."
-Nice.
-There you go.
Is it nice?
.
Thank you.
-Hey Migs!
Your change!
-Buy load instead!
Thank you Migs!
-Joy!
Stay here first.
-What happened?
-We'll take care of that.
"-Migs, wake up!"
It's too low.
-Why did you come inside?
-Alex please!
What is that?
I hear balloons.
"I'm actually, uh..."
I'm doing birthday parties now.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
"- Well, that's good."
"- Yeah, yeah, it is good."
"So, okay, uh, take Meemaw to the doctor, got it, and I'll do a good job of that."
"I won't let you down, okay?"
I promise.
"- Thank you, Chip."
"- Thank you, Mom."
"Where are you, by the way?"
- I gotta go.
- You outta town?
Mom?
- You doin' okay?
- Hi.
"- Hey, Mom, what's goin 'on?"
"How are you, Cody?"
All is well.
"How are you, Mom?"
- Where's Logan?
"- Uh, he's sleeping."
"Oh, God, he always was a sleeper."
"- Man, you know that."
"- You have a lot of energy, more than him."
[Chuckling]
"Um, I have a little surprise."
Please share.
"What is it, what is it?"
F...
"Unbelievable, man."
- She's fucking impossible.
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
What happened?
She's worse than Audrey.
Or maybe it's you.
Can I buy you a drink?
"Uh, are you supposed to smoke around pressurized oxygen?"
No.
That's why I turned it off.
Dip shit.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
That was the wrong way to start this.
- Gee.
"- Maggie, my name is Lance."
"I'm, uh... in a relationship with your niece."
I know your mother very well.
I've been on the wrong end of her wrath a good many times.
"- And, uh..."
- Up-up-up.
Shit.
Shit!
Fuck!
She lose the lisp?
Pardon me?
Julia.
Had a bad lisp as a kid.
I only rooted for her.
Yeah.
She told me about that.
- Yes Sir!
Got a big shadow though!
She's the biggest woman in Japan.
Here's name's Amelian.
- Amelian!
- Yes Sir!
Beat him up!
Don't pull me!
Stay away from me...
I've got B.O.!
I'm getting dizzy.
Please let me go!
Let me down!
What a B.O.!
You still want Amelian?
No...!
I wouldn't dare...!
Give me the money!
"Some more, don't you try to fool me!"
Where's the 'Beast'?
I won't tell you.
Amelian has been again!
I can't hear your death bells ringing!
"You wouldn't tell the lady, I'll get you a man!"
Hiroshima!
Why is it taking so long?
Have you got it yet?
In a second!
Soon!
It is hot!
It's time!
"Let me do the introductions,"
"We need Toxie, though."
MAN:
Do you need background?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Yeah you can sit there.
Doesn't hurt.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
What the-- who [inaudible] him?
I didn't--
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Get him back.
Tell him to put the makeup back on.
"We'll just use his body, right?"
Who wrapped him?
I didn't wrap him.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yeah, I know."
"Well, nobody should wrap until we wrap."
That's ridiculous.
"Just get him in with his body, right?"
"Oh, that's bad stuff, right?"
I won't continue with that.
CAT:
I didn't wrap him.
I'm sorry.
"Well, who did wrap him?"
CAT:
I have no idea.
He's in effects getting his makeup taken off.
MAN:
Easy.
"Easy, Lloyd."
"Alright, this is incredible."
This... very impressive.
I am thoroughly impressed.
I am...
Wow!
Wow!
You look so real.
"You're, like, just like her."
"I mean, wow."
Except... you're just unfortunately not...
um...
"- Cooper, what are you doing?"
"- Wait, wait."
"Hold on, hold on."
"- Cooper, you're in danger."
- Shh!
Quiet.
Quiet!
I need to think.
You're fucking real.
You are real.
You're real.
"- Cooper, you're in..."
- You're Sonja.
You're actually here.
- Are you actually here right now?
- I'm real.
I'm actually here.
- God.
- And we have to go.
- You have to listen to me.
- How are you here?
- That you don't remember.
I remember you told me about it.
"You used to climb out of the crib, come down."
And I was
- It was almost midnight.
And I was ready to close.
And then you -you -
- This was the store?
"- The store, yeah."
And
-And you vomited on - on -
"A woman was standing there, and you vomit -vomited on her."
- Really?
- [Laughing]
I can never forget that.
She was so mad.
[Laughs]
[Woman] Hello.
- When can I go home?
- Home?
"Where would you like to go, Dad?"
Hi.
[Kisses]
Hello.
"Hello, Joe."
[Both Laughing]
I wish I were -
"- Well, you wish you were what?"
- With you.
With me?
You are with me.
- Right now.
What special way?
You've got your heart in the wrong place.
I must open your chest and put it right.
Then I'll sew up your chest.
Then you'll be okay.
He can stand it.
"Master Huang, this knife alright?"
Just about.
Ah Foon!
Hold him down!
I'm fine!
I'm okay.
Mousy...
Ah Foon!
Drink to the Marshal!
I'm generous.
I don't bear grudges.
I thought you're really clever.
Master Huang.
Stop drinking.
You're on duty now!
"Master Huang, see you later."
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
So long...
White Tiger!
Give yourself up!

I don't know what to do.
I...
I need to talk to you.
I...
"Hey, Marie."
It's me.
What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
- A man was killed?
"- A Federale, right in front of him."
"Three agents wounded, one lost his leg."
It's like what you hear about from Iraq or something.
- The IEDs.
"- Oh, Jesus."
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
Hank talked to his ASAC for about an hour.
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.
"He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed."
"And all he keeps saying is, ""I'm fine."
I'm fine.
"Leave me alone."""
"Baby, not now."
It's...
"It's me, Hank."
Sorry.
"Hey, buddy."
What's.?
What's up?
I just...
Do you mind if I.?
What are you doing?
- I cloned your card as you were asleep.
- Whoa.
Okay.
Put the knife down.
What are you going to do with that?
I drew your attention to this job.
"Sonja, put the fucking knife down, okay?"
It's not funny.
"Should've called your mum, Cooper."
"- But you called me, and I led you here..."
- Sonja.
- You know what?
- ...
like a breadcrumb trail.
Put the knife down.
Drop the act.
"Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja."
It's not fucking funny.
Put the knife...
This isn't what I signed up for.
"I'm fucking done, okay?"
Fuck!
What the fuck?
"Oh, fuck!"
Oh!
Holy fuck!
Stop!
Fuck!
"Oh, fuck!"
"Oh, fuck!"
-  Cooper.
Let's go.
-We're not leaving.
Enough now.
-Now what are we supposed to do uh?
How are we supposed to get him back?
"This is all your fault, this whole thing is your fault."
"You wanna play that game, you really wanna go there?"
"Take a hard look at yourself, son."
"Come on, let's go."
Get your hands off me.
Don't touch me.
Fuck all of you.
Come on.
I left money on the table.
I'm sorry about this.

We wasn't there.
We had nothing to do with it.

"Yes, Miss Zeynab."
"Zeynab, come here, this gentleman needs milk."
It's so dark here.

Come in.
Can you milk the cow for me?
"Wait, I'll do it."
It's so dark.
How can you milk in here?
I'm used to it. I work here.
You'll get used to it if you stay.
I'll be gone before I get used to it.
We have a flashlight.
The electricity is off.

You knew I'd be here.
Are we even?
- Come with me to Capri.
- No.
I believe in my marriage.
Though...
"Febo, Palm..."
Did you find the dogs?
Not yet.
It's my fault.
"- You're a good person, Captain."
"- No more than you are, Mrs. Wyatt."
"What's this about ""net weight in the morning""?"
What does it mean?
"I insisted on that, sir."
Scientifically... the morning is when the human body weighs the least.
- He's okay with this one.
You have a case.
- Druse.
Again?
- Mama.
"- Hush up, Bobby."
This could be serious.
I've got pins and needles all up my right arm.
There.
Isn't it lovely?
Ready?
"And one, two, three, up."
"Sweatpants, no pockets."
We can't do a wallet biopsy on this one.
I know who he is.

Is there a prize?

Want to share?

"Tension pneumo, Elmer."
Pleural sac is inflating like a beach ball.
Time for a party trick.
May I be excused?

Just please don't leave me alone.
"Look, um..."
I believe you.
Maybe Bob did this without you knowing.
I was with him all night.
"If I thought he did this, I would tell you."
Are you kidding?
"Great, I've a free chauffeur."
Bro Michael!
Pre-empt.
"Welcome, the God of Wealth!"

Monkey.
Scorpion King?
Police!
Stop!
Run or I'll shoot!
Where's the tattoo?
I don't have.
No scorpion tattoo?
"I don't, Inspector."
Then why call yourself Scorpion King?
"My nickname is Scorpion, last name King."
So they call me Scorpion King.
Stupid name!
Stop...
You act like a gangster.
You just have money.
Let's go.
Change your name!
What's this?
Lok Lok.
What's Lok?
Name of the panda at Ocean Park.
Get lost!
"Look, isn't it a scorpion?"
"No, it's a lobster."
It's not such a bad thing to keep a man waiting.
You don't want him to think he's the only date you've had in years.
- It's not a date!
- Give me the bow.
Where's the bow?
"Hey, your mother did you up again."
"Looks terrific, Miss Morgan."
- Thank you.
- Want me to get you a cab?
"- No, I'm fine."
- All right.
"Ooh, good."
Sir!
Sorry.
Hello!
Are you sure about this?
You're going to take me?
"- Get in, lady."
- Thanks.
"Here's where I'm going, but don't go until I put up the window."
"- They're broke, lady."
- My hair!
Don't complain to me.
Complain to the cab company.
Oh!
- Hi.
- Hi!
Hi.
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
You're exactly on time.
My hair.
Singapore...
"Uncle Tang,"
I'm quite heavy now.
No problem!
His strength is of no use.
He wants to fight everywhere.

- Hurry!
It's still hot.
Come on!
"Yes, drink it."
You first.
- How about this one?
- Here!
You have picked the hot one!
Xiaotian...
"I have waited so long, so will you giving me an answer?"
Can you stop making joke on me?
Nobody's joking with you!
Think I just fell in love.
So we're friends.
Yeah.
You wanna come in?
"I'm sorry, I don't trust myself."
That's okay.
You can just watch.
"You know, you may be the best friend I've ever had."
[LAUGHS]
- Hi.
- Hey.
BEN:
Take a shower.
Hey.
- What?
Hi.
- Honey?
- Yeah.
You smell weird.
- I smell weird?
"- Yeah, different."
- Different how?
- I don't know.
[BEN LAUGHS]
Sort of an odd thing to say.
"You know, maybe it was the ashtray and cigarettes I found."
In the back yard.
"What part of ""My dad died of lung cancer"" is so hard for you to wrap your brain around?"
What?
"Do not lie to me, Ben."
"Please, okay?"
Are you serious?
"♪ Rockabye baby, on the treetop..."
It's burning hot.
Bastard!
Are you trying to scald my child?
"Let's go, dear!"
- Madam!
"- Mousy, come here."
"Sifu Wong, I'm innocent!"
I was...
- Have you studied Kung Fu before?
- No.
- Good news.
- What's good?
"It means ""OK""."
"Kneel down, quick."
This is my best singing bird.
Here.
You two...
"Watch where you go, girl!"
"Lady, you made me lose my lovebird."
I want you to be my kept bird now.
Return the bird to him.
"Lady, come home with me now."
I'll treat you well.
Now's your chance to impress Sifu.
Go and settle this.
Be brave.
Go.
"Come on, let's go."
Take her home.
"Hey, don't be a bully!"
Your bird is here!
Ready...
and drink.
I know what it is.
"Oh, you know?"
From one sip.
Yep.
So Bob knows it.
Say it.
I'll give you a chance here.
You take a guess.
"Oh, he's giving Rick a chance."
You don't know it.
"Talk to me, Goose."
Get inside me.
Take your shoes off.
Make yourself comfortable.
The wine's inside of Rick.
Getting comfortable.
Okay.
It's a blend...
"Yeah, it's definitely a blend."
I'm getting a few things here.
It's very complex.
"Take another sip, Rick."
This is gettin' good.
"Oh, I guess I was wrong."
I hope you're happy.
He was beautiful.
"Well, whatever."
Enjoy the rest of your ride.
I'll go check the busboys.
Somebody has the chocolate.
I'll revive the whole thing right.
"Now, watch-- here."
"That was the beach, right?"
-ALL:
Right.
-Okay.
This was Hill 405 right here.
I'll tell you why.
Zeke...
"All right, this was zero hour."
This is the way it went.
Everybody in posi...
"Gunther, in position?"
"-Right, sir."
-All right.
What are you doing there?
You're with the artillery.
"-Get over there, Tubby!"
"-All right, all right."
"Morgan, get behind the foxhole."
"Zeke, you got the bazookas ready?"
"-All set, all set."
-Now... wait a minute.
Then there came that air...
air raid!
-Air raid!
-Get in position.
(mimicking machine gun sounds)
You got him!
All right.
All right.
Set your watches.
I'm going up.
Right.
"Oh, I'm coming now."
[Wind howling]
[Seagulls screeching]
Janet?
- Janet!
-Hmm?
The sun is out again.
[Janet groans]
"[Sighs] Oh, good."
Oh.
It's so gorgeous.
Everything smells so fresh after the storm.
We seem to have escaped relatively unscathed.
"Oh, the buddleia's knocked about a bit, though."
The tide was quite high last night.
Yes.
What's that?
"Janet, quick, come here."
What's that?
At the end of the beach.
That black thing?
- I can't see it.
- There ... there.
Oh.
"Oh, dear."
I think it's a body.
I'll telephone Pendered.
[Ursula]:
Where do you think he's gone?
I don't know.
Do what?
Somers.
Martin Somers.
"I tell you all about it tomorrow, but now I got many people to call."
You be there.
Goodbye.
"Hello, Axel."
Shall I call him back?
No.
I guess not.
He'll be here first thing in the morning.
"Axel, you think I don't know how it is with you?"
"Lisa, please."
No more talk.
"But all day long, you haven't eaten enough for a sparrow."
And now it's late.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, that."
We'll go to your place.
I'll make you some supper.
Then you have a good night's sleep.
Look.
What is it?
I don't understand.
What does that mean?
I'm going to find out.
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
What's going on out here?
Why you knock my sign down?
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
"It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."
You are...
"Please, I don't need a nurse."
- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.
"Marion, leave me alone."
- What is this here?
- Go away.
"Yes, it hurts."
Ow!
"Well, goddamn it, Indy, where doesn't it hurt?"
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
Jones...
Jones?
"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've gotta tell someone."
I can't keep it to myself any longer!
- Every time I go out in that yard...
- What do you mean?
Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!
- I don't believe it.
- I did.
I buried him in the sheep pen!
"Selena, you've gotta call the state police."
No.
"No, I can't!"
You've got to.
You should've done it long ago!
Please don't make me!
"Listen to me, Selena."
Listen.
- One of us has got to call.
- I can't!
- No.
- You must call them now.
I can't.
- Pardon me.
- Allison!
Norman.
- What a surprise.
- Yeah.
Come here.
"Hey, you guys."
Idiot.
-Guess what?
What?
It carries more fish than penguin that any existed.
In-land.
-And he's amazing ...
Impressive ...
-Sven?

"Silly now, is it?"
"Oh, for goodness sake!"
How many?
[Janet]:

Mm-hmm.
[Janet chuckles]
It hasn't let up for a minute.
I said-
- I heard you.
I think you should apologize.
What for?
For snapping at me.
Right.
I'm sorry.
I'd call that perfunctory.
Ursula.
- You can be so insensitive.
On the contrary.
Sehr gute?
What did you say?
Nothing.
I told you.
Oh my God!
It's horrible!
It's hell breaking loose!
I'll close that door.

The Gimp has to feed her three times a day.
He has to wipe her.
She shits like crazy.
"Well, she does."

She needs a double diaper.
- I'm off.
- Give her my best.
"You don't get it, Claire."
Bodil is..!
You can't get through.
She ate a fruit and turned into a vegetable.
- An olive isn't a fruit.
It's a nut.
"- No, an olive is a fruit."
- Anything above ground is a fruit.
- Chestnuts aren't fruit.
- Yes.
"- No, they're nuts."
- Nuts are fruit.
"- No, they aren't."
"Yes, they are."
Glad we got that straightened out.
- There's more if you...
- Thank you.
"Oh no, Bodil..."
- The meat balls are good.

But I bought the peas.

"That,s right!"
THE GREAT PAINTERS
"Sweetie, where do the great painters go?"
Maybe up there?
"I don,t know."
Put them over there.
Not like that!
Not there!
"Jean-MicheI, feel your way to CIaudine."
"When you find her, explore her body with your hands."
Describe what you feel.
Be honest.
I got the feeling she was hiding.
"It,s her all right."
Good.
"Jean-MicheI, take one step forward and fall backward into CIaudine,s arms."
Go.
Very good.
Take off his blindfold.

"Well, yeah, mom, 'cause I was worried about you"
After the one night gross you guys had.
You didn't call me back.
"I didn't call because it was nice to feel wanted by you,"
To be desired and paid attention to.
We're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be okay.
- They're exiting the building.
- Keep moving!
Castle South clear.
Clear!
We have Castle Sky.
"Five agents in the East Gate, four in the garden."
The rest should be on the South Lawn.
And two policemen on the South Gate.

Keep moving!
Shots fired.
Code Black!
Code Black!

Say again.

You serious?
Look around.
- Stand back!
- The threat is out there!
Go out and do your job!
"Donnie, where'd you send my daughter?"
I'm sure she's fine.
We're in the safest house in the world.
"Well, not today, it's not."
That's mine.
This is so sad.
Really sad.
You're right.
It's... sad.
We've reduced ourselves
To animals.
That's what we are.
"Yeah, a bunch of dumb ass,"
Animal house frat boys.
Morons.
Morons might be a bit harsh.
No.
Morons is right.
"Cause all of the porno tapes,"
"The dvds, are up in the"
Bunk room.
Son of a bitch.
What in the hell happened
To him?
"Man, he must have taken the"
White pills.
The sleeping pills.

Somunall.
Somunall?
"Goddamn, Tommy."
Those are the pills that have
Been in the newspaper.
"I know, I know."
He goes nuts.
Shoves her up against the wall.
Me and my buds step in to try and help...
"Next thing I know,"
I'm in E.R. getting stitches.
We're gonna need the names of all your buds.
"- Hey, Richie."
- Batten down the hatches.
Brother big-mouth strikes again.
Damn it.

Uh-huh.

You want to meet for lunch?

Another brother.

"Three brothers, all patrol cops."
And my dad.
You had to know they'd be upset.
What?
I'm not pretty no more.
You are beautiful.
You hear me?
Why did he have to come back?
I wish he could have just stayed up there.
You could have married Hector.
You're just saying that.
"You're just saying that, okay?"
*
"You all right, B.?"
Huh...
"oh, yeah."
"I'm shakin', I'm shaking."
"Nah, I'm just getting started though."

My money good?
"Yeah, fuck it."
All right.
Cuanto?

Shaking them down ain't gonna make no difference.
"(Man) All right, watch me."
"Come on six... here we go, baby, here we go."
"Four, five, six..."

"Lucy, do you understand why you're back at the hospital?"
Lucy.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Lucy.
Listen to me.
- You can't run away.
- You can't.
- We're right here.
- You can't run.

Are you OK?
You were really lucky.
Lizzy!
"Oh, God!"
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
"What do you mean, you have to check?"
"Who are ""they""?"
You're the only one there?
It must be terrible to be all alone.
"How do you manage to read the paper... drink the flowers, water the coffee... all by yourself?"
That's...
This can't be true.
Why did I fall asleep?
Don't worry.
Some joyrider will probably dump it somewhere.
"- Yeah, sure."
- What was in the car?
"Clothes, Christmas presents, all kinds of stuff."
I gotta go.
That guy must be on Valium or something.
"Becky, I'm taking your car."
"Hey, I have to go to work."
Ivana?
Is this you Ivana?
Help me!
Help me.
Assist.
Help.
Lift your legs.
And the panties?
And the bra?
At the games.
I played and I lost them.
Lost them.
Lost.
Please help me!
And your friends.
The blonde!
The dull!
Is this enough?
"-No, the debt is large."
-And you are very beautiful.
Now drop for the behind.
Here is the soap.
This is precisely what I wanted to say.
The dull and the blond... did so with the soap.
We'll see.
-FiIippo.
-My love?
When will we get back to play?
"Poor Filippo, lost in the game and also with his wife."
You think so?
"I, in contrast say that he has recovered."
-No reception for anyone!
(CHILDREN SHOUTING GLEEFULLY)
I just wanted to do something different.
Yeah.
"Well, it's definitely different."
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
You don't like it?
"No, I like it."
I like it a lot.
"I'm just surprised, that's all."
"What's goin' on, Tris?"
Nothin'.
I'm fine.
Just...
Still having nightmares?
No.
We're good.
You and me.
I know nothing else is.
But we are.

Who took away my trunk?
Where is my trunk?
"Even you will vanish like the trunk, mister!"
"Go away, go away, go back."
"Look mister, I will tell you something worth.."
..10 lakhs forfree.

Got it?
Look there.

"Mister, catch him!"
Hey where are you running with my trunk!
My trunk!
Boss!

-What is it?
Why are you screaming so much?
"Boss, look at this."
That..
"He is my man, what is it?"
"Mister.. mister, that trunk belongs to me."
He.. he stole it from the station.
It has my name on it.
I didn't say that to be mean.
I know.
"Um, I'm sorry."
What was it like?
[Sighing]
Um... it was bad.
"Not as bad as New York City, but it was bad."
"Hey, mama."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"All right, grandma, let's hand it over."
Please.
"My check was late, so I couldn't buy any food."
"I need my money, please."
"Lady, you are breaking my heart, here."
Gimme that.
[Screaming]
[Belching]
"This is for you, and, uh, this is for you, and this is for you, and this is also for you, and this is for me."
And this is for you.

Whoa.
Tryin' to be some kinda hero or somethin' here?
"Huh, huh?"
"No, man."
"Come on, man..."
Let's go.
Come on...

[Groaning]
I was thinking Antigua.
Always wanted to go there.
"Nope, nope."
"Nope, nope, nope."
No.
I dated a girl from there once.
What?
So the whole country's off-limits?
The whole West Indies is off-limits.
"Well, who's this girl?"
It's a long story.
"If we ever make it out of the U.S. alive,"
I'll tell it to you.
All kinds of craziness.
Good crazy?
No.
Is that Mike?
"No, it's Schmidt."
"Hey, Schmidt."
What's up?
You have to help me!
They're coming!
Okay...
"Schmidt, hang on."
What -- what's the problem?
Is somebody at the motel?
"No, I'm not at the motel, okay?"
"I mean, I was at the motel."
Then I went back to my warehouse --
Wait a minute.

Come on.
Let's go to church.
"- Good evening, Father."
- You look a little lost.
Can I help you?
I once was lost.
But now I found myself.
"What a sweet, sweet sound."
See you later.
"Well, John."
I gave it back to the little girl's life.
But I'm not sure if he would give the door allowed to travel.
Because you killed my son.
- What are you waiting for?
- Gentlemen.
Please.
This is the home of God.
- Family.
John.
All of the family.
- I know.
You stole mine from me.
Please!
Please!
"John, I can not go on like this pataklamaya."
- Please go.
Go!
"- Reverend, you're wrong place."
Children ...
"- First, read a prayer, please?"
- Hold your hand quickly.
"Let's Read, Father."
- [Laughs]
- Went on and on and on.
"- Okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high security."
'Cause we mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
- Hi.
"- Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
I didn't want to go home.
- Clark.
"- Yeah, I know, I know."
This is my home.
[Sighs]
It is!
Rough day?
Y-Yeah.
Were you...
Were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
Most people think she's a lot younger than that.
"Hello, I'm Olga."
"Olga, I'd like you to meet my good friend Bob Hartley"
How old do you think I am?
"Forty, 41."
I am 65.
- That's amazing.
- Yes.
"Now, what is it that you want to work on?"
"The legs, the thigh, the hips, the bust?"
A little below the bust.
"Well, just follow along."
We start very slowly in the beginners group.
All right.
Line up.
Arm's distance.
Good.
"We'll start with a little, stretching."
"Well, so much for the stretching."
"Now, we go."
And... run!
"One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two."
Bicycle.
Bicycle.
"Hartley, you're behind."
"One, two."
"One, two."
"One, two, one, two."
Kitty cat.
One more.
Fill it off.
And run.
I knew that.
So we're going to Dallas.
Together.
But first  we sleep.
"Watch the Season Finale of Remedy on a special day, Tuesday May 19th on Global."

I love Star Wars.
Me too.
"I mean, I've only seen the new ones."
Close enough.
- So?
- Yeah.
I knew it!
I could feel it.
It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.
"You felt that, right?"
- I couldn't have performed if I did.
"- Don't you see, Ted?"
We had a bronnection.
"All right, I gotta know what she looks like."
Show me a picture.
"Well, normally, I'm above such things, but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'."

"Was it just a ""Yeah, OK"", or ""Yeah..."

"Look, I'm exhausted."
It's kinda been a long day.
"Yeah, OK."
G'night.
Oh...
"Hey, thank you."
What did you just say?
"You know, thanks for lettin' me stay here."

Get out of the car!
"Hey, don't shoot, don't shoot. I got money."
I don't want your fucking money.
Help me get her in the car.
We gotta get into town.
We need to get to a hospital.
-What happened to her?
-She's shot?
-Shot?
Then I'll hold it.
What do you see?
I sense something else.
A picture?
His?
He's not wearing much.
"He's not into the sex industry, I hope?"
No.
I see him on the beach waves and...
What's up?
What did you see?
"I drifted off, I think."
"His name was there, letters."
"H and E, HENK..."
HERBERT...
HERMAN
Herman!
"Gee, I didn't know you were so good at it."
Look... ls that him?
Well now...
You're going to tell me all about this Herman.
I've known Herman for years.
From when I first met Johan.
Johan?
Who's this Johan?
- My dead husband I told you about.
"- Oh, yes."
"Herman wanted me, but I married Johan."
That's life.
Sure.
But tell me about this Herman?
I'd rather not.

We need to find that street.

He's knocking on doors.

You would take care of us.
But now my baby's out there.

- Let her go.
But she wishes to remain.
She has chosen to stay here.
Is that not so?
Please.
Don't hurt her.
You must go now.
My men will soon return and they are many.
–Where are they?
–They're in the waiting room.
–I gotta see 'em.
–I won't let you.
Not like this.
–Corrine... –I don't want them to be scared.
–They won't be.
Vic.
Daddy!
–Hi.
–Daddy.
I missed you so much.
Kiss.
"Hey, Matty."
Give Daddy a kiss.
"Hey, Vic, I really need you in here now."
"–Dad, don't go again."
"–Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
I have to.
"Listen, someone was hurt really bad... and I have to stay here until he feels better."
"But as soon as I can, I'm gonna come and see you again, okay?"
I promise.
I love you.

What I do is hard.
I am out there.
I am sweating out every clue.
I'm putting killers behind bars.
What does she do?
What does she do?
!
91.
Number 91!
91.
Number 91.
"91, number 9."
"I mean, how hard is that?"
A talking monkey could do her job.
- It's embarrassing.
"- Actually, that's 16."
You're holding it upside down.
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
- I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
- It's no big deal.
- I've seen it my whole life.
- I've never seen it under the six.
Why don't we ask Natalie then?
She's the expert.
"Okay, okay."
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
"Dig it, dig it"
"Oh, yeah"
"She's lookin' in your eye, eye"
Why?
I don't know

This is a pretty woman you got here.
Look at those little titties.
"Ray, what are you doing?"
"Hey, man!"
I got everything you want on that table over there.
There's 200 bucks in the wallet.
There's some coke in the kitchen.
Take the money and the coke.
You know what this is?
This is lighter fluid.
RAY:
"Fuck you, man."
I don't want no $200.
"Stop it, man."
"Put it out, man."
Put it out.
I'll tell you where the shit is.

What did I tell you about bouncing that ball in here?
"Angie, honey, nobody could pick him up?"

Exactly.
And here's the other thing.
"If I let you take a night off, I have to let everybody take a night off."
Who's everybody?
What are you talking about?
It's just me.
"Mr. Monk, come on."
It's one night.
"Well, then"
I'll guess i'll just have to say no...
Kay.
No kay.
No kay.
Which is it?
"""No"" or ""okay?"""
Nokay.
Noookay.
He's trying to say okay.
That's as close as he's ever gonna get.
No kay.
- Nokay.
- I'll do it.
Nokay.
- She looks nervous.
"- I don't care, as long as she's lucky."
- Is it too much?
- You look great.
"Excuse me, new girl."
"New girl, you're off your mark."
- My mark?
"- Yeah, the big ""X"" on the floor."
I think the point is to make us despair.
To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
"Dimmy, why do you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"
What is it?
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into a coma.
You're not my mother!
Don't listen.
"Why, Dimmy?"
Damien!
"Dimmy, please!"

"This is all your fault, beatnik."
If you hadn't...
Would you shut up and listen?
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.

Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
This place?
"Yeah, imagine."
"Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here."
"You know, I don't get you."
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
"Well, it's really pretty simple."
"I was an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and..."
"Oh, you were, were you?"
Were you rich?
- What?

"Yeah, OK."

And you know what?
It never felt... happy.

What happened to your eye anyway?
My eye's fine.
Just let me...
"Let me have your shirt, please."
What?
Just let me have your shirt.
I'm not gonna give you my shirt.
I can't go in to Gates like this.
You shouldn't have spilled coffee on it then.
"Okay, well, I did."
"And now I need your shirt, please."
Just...
All right.
All right.
Spill anything on your pants?
"You want me to give you those, too?"
Come on.
Stop being like that.
"Hey, everybody, I made it."
Just kidding.
"Big day, huh?"
Everybody pretty excited about it?
"Hey, Allan made it."
Whoa.
"What happened with your eye, bud?"
"Nothing, man."
I'm okay.
Yeah?
This is the birthplace of weird.
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."
What have you got?
A contact lens case.
With only one lens.

It's fluid!
I need a wipe.
What?
I don't have a wipe.
Give...
Give me a wipe.
Just...
I need a wipe.

I'm your biggest fan.
I never miss a show.
"Oh, thank you."
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
My gosh.
There are so many.
Mine's 19.
That's a good one.
Do you think it's going to come up on the show tomorrow?
Excuse me.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
I got a little distracted.
He's perfectly normal.
There's that old electricians behind school...
"Yeah, that old place."
He's an inventor-freak.

MAUDE:
Yah!
Giddyup.
"-Aw, hell."
-Where do you think you're going?
-You didn't think for a moment...
"... Iwasgonnamarrythat dreadfulman, did you?"
You--
You signed a contract.
"Yes, and he dropped the charges."
I'm free as a bird.
"-Well, what am I supposed to do?"
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
- Hey.
- Dad!
"- Hey, pal."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mind if I use your bathroom?
I've got to make a pit stop.
Not a full pit stop-- just an oil change.
I'm going to pee.
So do you like the zipper bags better than the pinchy kind?
We don't have to do the small talk.
"- Oh, thank you."
- Okay.
"Buddy, put your backpack on."
"Okay, have a good day at school."
"I'll call you tonight to tell you that I love you and to say good night, okay?"
"Okay, Mom."
I love you.
"Oh, that is so sweet."
Reminds me of my mom.
Not that you're as old as my mom.
My mom is young.
She looks great.
You look great.
- We're going to go wait in the car.
"- Great, great, great."
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye.

Oh.
That's funny.
I'm Carol...
Rance.
I know.
I just came in to look at the space.
How are you with decorating?
"Uh, try me."
Okay.
"When you were thinking of taking this job, where were you gonna put your desk?"
Uh...
I always thought here.
So you could see the view...
Plus it's more convenient for jumping.
"Clearly, you've given this some thought."
I have.
Just so you know...
Mm.
"...the reason I didn't take the job is,"
I really think I'm at my best when I'm supporting someone else.
I'm a great number two.
"Yeah, I don't want a great number two."
Sure.
I get that.
I want a partner.
"Hey, mertala."
Is she here?
Who is it?
!
It's Mr. Matt!
Then start acting like an adult.
I'm done here.
Go.

"Uh, It's me."
It's Leo.
"Oh, hi, Mr. Boykewich."
You have Ben's phone?
"Yes, I do."
"Oh, no, did you tell him that you know?"
"Yeah, but I told him, uh, Dylan's dad told me."
Oh.
Thank you.
"No, thank you for telling me."
You did the right thing.
And I just wanted to let you know you don't need to come over.
He's not going anywhere.
Okay.
Thanks.
Henry!
Hi!
Come in.
I want you to meet my parents.
I never smoked weed.
Marijuana.
Thank you for the clarification.
And I've never had a drink.
Filipino parents are very strict.
What time would you like me to bring your daughter home?
We haven't said she can go out with you yet.
"Uh, how do you two know each other?"
- Lock the door.
- This is prime estate.
"- Estelle, call the base."
- Security breach.
Level Four.
- Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear.

- Clear.
"Oh, no."
Yes.
Thank you.
Get up.
"Henry, right?"
- Please.
Don't...
- Shut up.
"What do you like the new, you?"
Did I interrupted the procedure?
Can Henry not talk?
"No, you..."
You can't.
No.
"Don't look at me like that, Henry."
"Your girlfriend here might have built you, but I gave her the raw materials to work with."
"And I mean really, really raw materials."
- What's your name?
- Timothy.
Nice to meet you Timothy.
Did you see Henry when Estelle brought his remains here?
Why?
Because I don't.
What was it?
"""What happens to the Good and Evil"
"""on Judgement Day?"""
That's obvious.
The Good go to hell and the Evil to heaven.
- ls that right?
- Yes.
No.
"The Good go to heaven, the Evil go to hell."
"Hurry in and write that, then come back."
Off you go.
Help yourself to tea if you want.
What?
Help yourself to tea if you want.
- You want some too?
"- No, not for me."
Do you want tea?
No.
You're a coward if you come back.
"Hello, Tajdolat."
May your wish come true.
Mother says the invalid ate the soup.
Put the bowl over there.
"Hello, Farzad."
- Are you well?
- Yes.
- Where are you going?
- To school.
- l'll go with you.
- Come on.
I've been to the Biesbosch.
I can't come along.
To kill an old man...
Oh yes.
You drink too much.
You're taking a cure here.
"That's a drag, ok."
But it's no excuse.
"You're not too sick to shoot, are you?"
It's your own old gun.
Works fine.
-Does it?
You're right.
"If we don't do it, who will?"
"They're walking around freely, everywhere."
"In Spain, South America, Germany."
And here.
-Exactly.
We have to settle this before we die.
I'm in.
-I expected nothing less.
Can I?
-I'll wait outside.
"Dr. Weinberg, come see Mr Haverman."
He shot himself through the head.
Where's his visitor?
-Visitor?
Sir!
Weren't you just with Mr Haverman?
"Yes, he asked me to wait outside."
What was that sound?
Come with me?
"Hey, you there!"
"Look here, governor."
- Steady!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Police!
"Chase him, somebody!"
Get a copper!
Police!
Hurry.
"Come on, open up!"
Let me in.
I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.
- Dr. Jekyll's not home.
- He told me to wait.
- I know all Dr. Jekyll's friends.
- Let me in!
- You'll have to come back.
"- Let me in, or I'll bash this door..."
"If you don't go away, I'll have to send for the police!"
That's him!
There he goes!
- This ain't no place to rob.
- But robbed it is!
Help!
Police!
"- Good night, Charles."
- Good night.
- Sorry your young man was detained.
"- So am I, Uncle Geoffrey."
"Good evening, sir."
"There was a ring at the door a while ago, sir."
"When I answered it, there was nobody there."
"Go, move."
"Chin, go, go, go."
I got you covered.
Stay down.
You're gonna be fine.
Hey.
Craig?
I wanna see him.
Please?
Dana.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
I was afraid you'd leave me if I did.
You were wrong.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I not be angry?
"But the man I fell in love with was Craig Ellers, not Paul Stark."
Everybody deserves a little forgiveness.
"Hey, where's Mary?"
- I got good news and bad news.
"- Oh, no, no."
"The good news, I got back with my girlfriend."
- That's good.
- Bad news is you lost Mary.
"Sorry, she confused me with a Jedi mind trick."
- You want me to put out an APB?
- No.
I think I know where she is.
What's that?

I don't listen to my brother.

"Untie my feet, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's difficult, but we're gonna make it."
"Come on, untie my feet."
"Go ahead, then I'll make breakfast."
What's to the right?
"To the right, we see the cannon fire."
Are these cannons ortanks?
"Well, shit, there really are some Tigertanks."
Our people must be having a hard time.
The prisoner seems to have told the truth.
-lt seems so.
"- 2,3,4,5,6,7,9!"
Two more!
"Hell, it is quite a number!"
"Well, scouts!"
This has to be checked.

Folks!

"You, in the trenches!"

Have you seen this?
These Tigertanks are made ofwood.
And theirteeth have long been covered with rust.

My dad.
Now I knowthat.

ERIC:
Hey!
Look who decided to show up.
It's really good to see you again.
"All right, folks."
Nothin' to be nervous about.
Just a little routine inspection.
Then we can all go back to our business.
Hello.
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
"Divergent,"
-10%.
-Hmm.
Shit.
"I thought you meant ""career"" with a dollar sign."
I think we need more.
"Fireworks, shooting guns."
Maybe we need to get arrested.
"Yeah, that might be a little bit problematic for some of my younger, more impressionable fans."
"I have a lot of those, I'm told."

For the article.
- Your dad?
- No.
You mean John?
Are you talking about John?
"Tell me, David."
What happened?
If it was John... why?
Cos I told her about the job.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.
It was me who found her body in the car park.
It was me who made the phone call.
"David, let me help you."
Please.
Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.
"If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out."
"- David, we need to go."
- No.
We can help you.
Shut up.
"Come on, son."
Let's go.
What about John?
Is he with you?
He got caught in the explosion.

But you made it out all right?
Come on.

"No, I know..."
I want to go to the concert.

- It'll be fun.
I haven't seen a concert in forever.
"Last concert I went to was that Green Day cover band, the Basket Cases."
- Pretty talented.
- That was cool.
We got high.
I'm gonna go get some more Molsons.
- You guys want one?
- Yes!
I would love a Molsons.
- More Molsons.

I'm gonna go sing some Rihanna right now.
That's how much I...
I love her and know who she is.

-Let me try.
"Hey, little one!"
Are you okay?
Do not you join the dance?
Do not.
-Can you say why?
-Why?
"No, no!"
What I say is ...
"Uncle Mano, I think he wants to know why dance."
"As if he needed one reason it is not, Erik?"
Yes.
There are many more reasons to dance.
What is my father?
The only way to is trying to figure out.
"Come on, son!"
Just one foot after another.
Nobody will laugh I promise you.
"Come on, climb on my feet."
I do not care with what people say
You'll get the hang.
Just need to feel the rhythm.
We are part Emperor of the Nation
"Come on, son!"
Let's shake this world!
Taylor.
They abolished slavery.
"Excellent, excellent."
Liam.
There were no executions.
"Yes, that's true."
Joanna.
Men and women were treated as equals.
"That's right, that's right."
"At the back, Sam."
"They believed in peace, not war."
Absolutely right.
"Now can you tell me, what was the Treasure of Atlantis?"

Wait a second.
"Okay, now."
You don't hear that?
I don't hear it.
It's humming.
-l'll think about it.
"But it'll cost you, Hill."
A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
At least that's what I thought.
"Hello, Henry."
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Come on.
"-Oh no, wait a minute."
-What?
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--
Karen...
Mom.
"I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill."
How do you do?
My daughter says that you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
See you later.
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.
It's a lot quicker that way.
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.
How are you doin'?
What's up?
Here you go.
"-How are you doin', Gino?"
-Good.
How are you?
"Talk to the hand, 'cause, er... nobody round here's arsed."
Who rattled your face?
"I'm thinking of calling my mix the ""On The Bathroom Floor"" mix or maybe the ""He Shouts His Own Name When He Comes"" mix."
What are you gobbing on about?
Have you had your brain clamped and towed away?
- (PHONE RINGS)

Suppose you best had.
Yes!

I'll tell you more.
"I hate Huang, and Huang's suspicious of you."
Let's cooperate.
I'll send you out of the country afterward.
They'll never get you.
But you may not be able to take Huang single-handed.
- Mayor!
- Congratulations!
Thanks for coming.
Have a seat please!
"Have a few more drinks, Marshal."
I'll get myself drunk alright.
I've got to see Chiu at the theatre.

"Ah Foon, but..."
But what?
You think I'll die?
What are we?

Take revenge if I die.
What are you doing?
This is my family charm.
Take it.

Wait for me!

Are you crazy?
Her window's wide open!
-Didn't he tell you?
-Didn't who tell me?
What's Burke got to do with it?
Nobody was here.
"When I went to get the Thorazine I had him stay with her, and...."
-I should have known better.
-I guess you should have!
How were the tests?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
"Hi, Chuck."
Come on in.
I suppose you heard.
Heard what?
You haven't heard.
Burke is dead.
He must've been drunk.
He fell from the top of the steps outside.
"By the time he hit M Street, he broke his neck."
"Oh, God!"
"Yeah, I know."
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
Not even a fountain...
It doesn't matter now.
Tell me everything tomorrow.
- If she needs...
"- Don't wake her up, here's the key."
- Do you know him?
- Me?
No.
- He went like this.
- No.
- Is that the truth?
"- Yes, bye."
- Where have you been?
- I'll tell you everything tomorrow.
"No, I wanted to tell you that... nothing."
- Tell me tomorrow.
- There's nothing to tell!
- Nothing?

Just one kiss?
Bye!

"Oh, no."
"Trevor, what happened?"
"Trevor, it's okay."
"Oh God, what happened?"
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.
Did he stop?
"No, he just kept going."
He fucking hit 'n run drivers man.
He gotta be hanged.
It was my fault.
I wasn't paying attention.
"Trevor, I gotta get you to a hospital."
You may have some internal injuries.
It's just bruises.
"Okay, you see this?"
"This is a bruise, and this is a train wreck, alright?"
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?
I trust you.
Now I know you're crazy.
Can I stay here tonight?
"Baby, you can stay here every night."
"Hey, my veil is the same as yours."
"Oh, you're right."
It is.
You're very pretty.
Thank you.
Are you the boy?
Yes.
You don't look as pretty as the bride.
Bye.

"You were right, Holly."
Because...
I'm having an asthma attack... from the stress !
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, my God."
Do you have an inhaler ?
Or like an Epi pen ?

"You know her, but she doesn't know about you?"
Yeah.
I don't really understand it all but that's what the doctor tells me.
"Oh, no, Al, faking or not, he's crossing the line here."
I if I wanna talk to JMJ...
Give him time.
...I have to call her.
JMJ?
Can you hear me JMJ?
Hello?
This could be thrown back in our face.
He's all over her.
We could get a law suit for sexual harassment.
This is the box.
He knows what he's doing.
He can't be second-guessed.
"Hello, JMJ?"
"Hell, Al, he's outta control."
You wanna stop it?
It's your call.
You are a mean son of a bitch.
Mean son of a bitch?

"I didn't kill eight innocent women, Pamela, you did."

We got back to the hotel late.
I didn't want to wake you.
Late means late.
"What do I do if there's no phone, paint one?"
"I'm working, don't start."
I am calm.
You're the one who isn't!
Good morning.
I'm sorry.

"You're going back, aren't you?"
Yeah.
"Klaus, we're gonna move you back to Bowmanville."
And I wanted to apologize.
Thank you.
Don't go to the police station again.
You may end up in an even bigger trouble.
Not all cops will be honest like me.
Got it?
Panju.
If 333 number is Ashwini's...
The victim is related to Ashwini.
"But, Ashwini... has not shared that detail with Manoj."
"So, our next target is..."

"Dad wait, how many years have you been with mommy?"
Is it 29?
"Ara, is it 29?"
That's sweet!
You know what?

Wait a second.

"-Yes, of course!"
Why won't I?
.
"Dad, wait."
"It's like this, actually..."
She said...
Brother.
"-You've been together for just 1 year, right?"
-Yes!
So what?
Are you sure about your decision?

This is really all I want in my life.

I'll get the sandwiches.
- These bottles?

I'm a parent at Westbridge too.
"Actually, our kids are in the same class."
"Oh, The Kite Runner."
Oh.
What a great book.
The writing is super lyrical.
"Oh, not that chardonnay."
"Uh, could you see if there's any more Stags' Leap?"
"- Uh, I'd have a Merlot."
"- Oh, I'll have Merlot too."
Would you see if there's any bubble water in the fridge?
Yes.
"For you, a thousand times, yes."
Thank you.
"No, that's a line, um, uh, from the book."
"You had a date with Doc Migs, didn't you?"

"The last time we e-mailed each other, you said you have a boyfriend, it's Ryan, isn't it?"
We've broken up.
I heard you're getting married in three months?

Why?
Don't you love me anymore?

"Shake it up, take a sip, and wish for what you want most in the world."
Okay.
I want to replicate my own DNA and win the Nobel Peace Prize.
Yeah.
Oh!
"Very good, Janie."
"Okay, shake it up, Sport."
Shake it up.
"I want to play more baseball games than Cal Ripkin, Jr."
"Oh, yeah!"

"That's very pretty, isn't it, Janie?"
"Yes, I like it."
Got you!
"Hey, wait up."

Look at me!
I'm taking a bite!
That's my food.
- Mmm!
So good.
- Okay.
"So, um, are you guys gonna be home or away for Thanksgiving?"
Home.
Allen is gonna be in the city with the boys and his ex-wife.
They still do holidays and vacations together.
"- Don't you go, too?"
- Mnh-mnh.
His ex-wife hates me.
- Mm.
- Hates me.
Hates me.
She thinks I stole her husband.
Which I kind of did.
But not on purpose.
"You realize that's not a good story to tell people, right?"
I know!
"So, I'm gonna be all alone."
- Mm.
- By myself.
- Yeah.
- On Thanksgiving.
This coming Thursday.
"Well, enjoy the peace and quiet."
I will!
Okay!
- Bye!
( phone rings )
( people scream )
Can't think with the phone ringing.
"Dorothy, get over to the window and shut the blinds."
The rest of you stay put.
Don't do anything stupid.
"Come on, Dorothy!"
"All right, back with the others."
( cell phone rings )
What's that?
Whose is that?
Is that you?
Yeah.
- Answer it.
- You sure?
"Just don't say anything stupid, huh?"
Okay.
Hello?
"Ni-Ni-Nina, it's really not a good time."
"Allie doesn't run off, Nina."
That's not something she does.
I-I can't.
It's really hard to explain.
- Hang up.
- My daughter's missing.
- Hang up the phone.
- You can just wait.
Is she okay?
"- Yeah, she's all right."
- How do you know?
.
I know.
Yeah.
Seriously you think you can.
But it's impossible.
You have another 50%.
I've been waiting for this job.
I don't want it to go to someone else.
Do you want me to beg?
"Je, please just this one time."
Tomorrow I will send the rest.
"When you talk like this, what do you expect?"
Let's go Suchart.
This medicine may make you sleepy.
Bring it on bedtime pill!
I'm not afraid of you.
"Kai, let's play badminton."
Huh?
Badminton.

Hurry.
Alright.

"Wait, right..."
Coming.
No.
No.
No.
- That's a cool shot.
- This.
Here it comes.
- Now.
- Bingo.
I love that.
I love that so much.
That gets a huge...
People will really laugh at that too.
That lipstick on the windshield thing took us a long time.
I know.
I know it.
Yeah.
- I had to be in a very specific spot.
- Yes.
"- Mike, you're thinking about me here."
- Yeah.
- Were you thinking about Kat here?
- No.
- He was thinking about...
- Food.
"I forget what I was thinking about, it wasn't Kat."
I don't think it was to do with the movie.
"It was probably, like, ""Why""..."
You were thinking about seeing No Country for Old Men.
- You got your ticket?
- I must have dropped mine.
What kinda ticket did you have?
He's in the brown Lincoln.
Foreign plates.
He's walking towards Front Street.
Gothim.
Angie's parked overhere in the LTD.
Cute.
You stay with her.
We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.
"The car's dirty, Cloudy."
We're gonna sit here all night ifwe have to.
What time is it?
Ten after four.
- Huh?
- Ten after four.
That's the third time those guys have been around.
"All right, let's hit 'em."
Hit 'em!
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!
Stay right there.
"Ifyou move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off."
- What the hell's that?
- What are you doin'?
Turn around.
Who's the boss here?
Who's runnin' this outfit?
You are?
What are you doin' here?
-I saw our future.
What?
-He came to me.
-Seriously.
"He said ""Sven go through there fast!"""
I'll go with you.
But he lacked fly.
Sven-

-What is this?
-It is amazing.
"-Seriously, never saw it."
Do not.
-Is the green.
-Green!
"Brothers and sisters, behold the power of Sven."
On that day I made an oath.
Sven ...
I
I promise to use my powers only for good things.
"For eternity all the time, to create ... eter a new ..."
Is there no end to the power of Sven?
-Will you marry me!
"No, marry me!"
-Will you marry me!
-Will you marry me!
What jokes ...
"But if I love some, who love girls."
They love you.
And who will love Ramon?
"Someone, either."
No one.
"Hear me, Jesse?"
You've done that to me before.
I couldn't think of anything else.
You were always lighting fires.
What fires?
Fires.
-What fires?
What fires are you talking about?
I don't remember any fires.
Get up!
Get up!
"We'll be fine, as long as we forget the past."
Deal?
-Deal.
Forget the past.
-Forget the past.
Here you are...
"Thanks, Marjukka."
Is Jesse still here?
"He's in there, brooding."
Jesse is a fine man.
He thinks a lot.
I think he's really deep.
"Hello, Jesse."
Marjukka!
You gave me this lighter.
It's out of gas and useless now.
I came here to see you - and it's your fault I always ended up in the garbage can as a kid.
Mrs. Hakkarainen!
-Don't...
I dumped him.
Guess why?
What do you want me to do?
Finish it.
"Look, you give her an inch, she takes a mile."
I think we should stop.
"Oh, babe."
Come on.
Not now.
-I'm sorry.
-No.
You're right.
I....
I didn't....
Sorry.
Can I talk to you for a second?
-You should be with her if you want.
-I don't want to.
I wanna be with you.
-I want you to be with her.
-I can't be with her.
-Why not?
-She's Sam's girlfriend.
They're about to break up.
It's obvious.
-She's throwing herself at us.
"-She's throwing herself, I can't do it."
Jane....
"Look, I've done some weird shit in my life, and I'm glad I have because I have enjoyed 99 % of it, but I'm not screwing my son's girlfriend and I won't lay there and watch you do it."
"Oh, who's gonna know?"
I'll know.
-Hey.
What took you so long?
-Sorry.
"Nothing, nothing."
I finish seeing the analyses.
-The analyses?
-Yes.
-You are hiding something to Me.
"-No, Calm no."
I do not want to die.
"Calm down, calm down."
"It must have an error, surely."
"help me, help me."
"Yes, but you must calm, you do not have to be altered."
"I only feel, I need much affection."
But...!
Mr. Santarelli!
I am much scared.
Why have you done that?
I do not understand...
-Call me Sandro.
"-Yes, yes, as you want."
Thanks.
Sandro...
I must return to the work.
Damn it is...
-Lella.?
I take you home?
-No.
Thanks.
-You are angry with me?
"-No, what goes."
"Well, it raises, I take to house."
I do not go to house.
I am going to make practices to a house of a friend.
It's only Chinese tea!
Chinese tea is still tea.
There're great Chinese tea!
"Mr. Lin, do I need to call security?"
"No need, David."
Mr. Mak...
Shut up!
I'm a member here.
Of course you are.
"Otherwise, our security would be here."
Fight with me if you've balls.
"I can't stop you guys, just be careful."
Help yourselves.
Other women love your money.
"Only Lisa loves you, right?"
I can't watch this.
Please look after them.
Bye.
There's a Lo Keung looking for Mr. Lin.
Pass it to me.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lin."
Mr. Lo Keung called.
He has something important to tell you.
His number and address are here.
Can you swim?
Bye.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Why?
Are you scared?
"Excuse me, Mr. Mak."
You want to wear your jacket now or after you dry yourself?
"That's what people do when they love each other, isn't it?"
I'll never forget you.
Go to the hospital now.
- You'll come and see me?
- I guarantee it.
- Now I suppose you want some time off?
- A day or two.
Well...
Take Thanksgiving.

I want to get stronger stronger and stronger.
I will become stronger.
Amazing!
Yes!
A comeback!

You look like shit.
Did you fall off the wagon?
You're a fucking mess.
I'm sick of taking shit for you.

You're a real asshole.
How did I end up with you?
Hardy!
"Get some dry clothes on, Sacco."
I'll catch you on the next run.

"This is what... recovery is all about -- you know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids -- boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.

Every single one of them.
What about him?
We missed him.
- You fool!
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Wait here!
Wait here!
What are you doing?
Shut up or be arrested!
I can lock you all up!
Is this an uprising or what?
- What's going on?
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Stupid.
What about my loss?
If you find any one suspicious.
Let me know.
You'll get paid for it.
They're all crooks!
The murderer is connected with the opera troupe.
Keep your eyes open for me.
Yes?
There's a newcomer who acts strangely...
"Mr. Chiu, it's your turn."
I'm coming!
This!
I'll kill you if you don't take your hands off me!

"Although you saved me,"
Shaolin caused my master's death by my hand.
Why do you say that?
The Shaolin persuaded His Highness to get our 8-divine Sword Book.
- Shaolin wouldn't do such a thing.
There you go.
"Inhale, reverse warrior, look up."
Exhale.

Just wondering how you're doing.
I haven't talked to you in a little while and was just wondering how you're doing.
"So, hey, I was hoping to talk to you."
Obviously.
"But you're out, I guess."
So just call me sometime.
Or tonight.
"I'm around, I'll be..."
"Well, I'm in and around."
So that's enough for now.
It's Alex.

"Yeah, I know how it can suck being the new kid."
You can hang out here with me for a while if you want.
Are you sure?
You don't mind?
Tell you what.
I was thinking about going for a boat ride.
I could use a little muscle.
Sure!
I'm real strong.
Only if you promise I'll be safe out there on the lake with you.
"'Cause after all, you're a pretty good kisser."
Ready?
Go!

-My problem?
You're unbelievable!
This is why I never come back!
Things always spin out of control with you!

Like a fucking infant!
How did you get to be so rigid?
At least I'm living in reality!
At least I have dignity!
Dignity?

"The kid loves me, so why not do it?"
"Whatever time there is, huh?"
"I'm with you, Jimmy."
"- Are we ready to go, Jimmy?"
"- Yeah, I've been ready for 1 4 years."
- She's the one that's had cold feet.

"Robin Wirkus, do you take Jimmy Wexler to be your lawful wedded husband?"
Who the bleedin' hell does he think he is?

There you go.
"Thank you, Grandad."
"You deserve a medal, mate."
Johnnie.

Johnnie.

The kid's pretty messed up.
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I'm Rose.
This is the Nancy.
Rose.
The propeller's snarled.
If I-
- If I can just cut it free--
Just pretend you're Errol Flynn.
He can do anything.
I've cut it free.
- She's moving.
"Come on, you beauty."
- She'll do it.
"I haven't had the chance to thank you, Mr. Brannigan, for bringing Johnnie back."
"There's no mister, and back home, they call me Gene."
"- Thank you, Gene."
"- Thank you, Gene."
- Tell me one thing.
It's from Naples.
- From Naples?

Every last hair.

"Where'd you get it, Jimmy?"
Where have you been hanging out?
Tell me who gave you this.
"Jimmy, come here."
Come here.
Forgive me.
Excuse me.
I'd like to...
I'm looking for...
- Maria Concetta.

She has a brother...
Pasqualino.
There are thousands of Maria Concettas and Pasqualinos around here.
"Wait, maybe he's talking about the virgin."
"- Oh, the virgin?"

Her father doesn't know.
"Ah, her father doesn't know."

"- Antonio, and you?"
See if he'll give me a couple of dollars.

"No, no I'm not bill."
"Oh, you must be otis."
Otis?
Who the hell is otis?
"Goddamn it, Sean."
You're nacho.
"That's right, asshole."
Who the hell was that?
I think that was my new
Boyfriend.
"What's going on, officer?"
A man wearing a tee-Shirt
That had a ladder 62 FDNY logo
On it doubleparked over at the
"Supermarket, and he, uh, I don't"
"Know how else to say this, he"
"Looked like, uh, like a zombie."
A zombie.

He was really scary.
"And he told me, told me I should"
Lose weight.
He called my baby ugly.

"""Not everyone... finds love..."""
"""Not everyone... finds love..."""
Brother.
Brother I...

And file charges on Shiv.
1.
Damaging public property.
2.Assaulting the Home Minister's son.

"- Ah, yeah."
"Yeah, that's not a bad idea, that."
"Yeah, let's stick a foot on there!"
I tell you what.
I'll do a few remixes for you.
"If you like 'em, we'll sort something out."
- Remixes of what?
"- Shut it, Gollum."
It's none of your business.
- None of my business?
Remixing?
DJ Troy?
- Them's the words.
Now make sense of 'em.
"""Exhibit A""."
Will you stop getting 'em out your bag?
It looks like a cannibals' picnic round here.
"- Who have you remixed, then?"
- Me.
"- Yeah, you."
"- No, me."
I've remixed me.
I remix me own tunes.
Right.
Any good?
No.
You've got one more guess.
"Think more ""opposite of good""."
"Just finished me album, ""Troy's Noise""."
"""Troy's Noise""."
Sounds French.
It's not just rhymes.
Come on.
This is true.
"This is true, Roldy."
Ooh wee

Enjoy.
Just a minute.
Fuc--
"Hey, hey."

Ooh!
Hey!
"Ooh, what a lovely...cocoa tin lid!"
It doesn't matter what it is.

"Oh, meaningful."
The only thing I know about cocoa is it's very good at bedtime.

"- Language, Julie!"

I wouldn't stand too near the assistant manager.
You might get a nipple in the eye!

After my careful observation...
No?

"Ilango, where is Kutty?"
Tell him to come.
He went somewhere.
Cuddappah Raju questioned him where he went.
He didn't tell him anything.
He hit him with an iron rod.
No Velu.
Listen to me.
Cuddappah Raja asked him several times.
He should have told him the truth.
That's his fate.
No Velu.
This is our curse.
Let's go.
How many times to tell you?
Are you deaf?
You fear death.
Not me.
Singamuthu is in jail.
I saw him.
They threatened me.
But I told them nothing.

You know why?
"Gordon, I..."
"Denise and... all the others, they don't know, John.I do."
"I don't think you're crazy, Do you hear me?"
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...

That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."

CONDUCTOR 1:
You've got to find him?
We've got to find him.
Half-fare!
CONDUCTOR 2:
He must be around here someplace.
Hello.
Goodbye.
The train hasn't stopped.
He couldn't have gotten off.
"What's the matter, son?"
You're trembling.
I have very loose bones.
Are you lost?
You go and save the best for last
Oh!
What's happening?
What's happening is that this is a great song.
"I'll be out here if you need me, Jess."
Jess-Jess.
That's the wizard?
He's wearing a scrunchie.
Looks like he juggles clubs on the beach.
"Yeah, like he'd ever have a job."
Didn't you just kind of assume he'd have a handlebar mustache?
"Come on, Jess, just go in there and get that TV."
"- I miss you, Jess."
- Don't hug him back.
Ugh.
- Ugh.
"- Oh, that's not healthy."
- I told you to water the plants.
- Huh?
Oh.
"Oh, you know it's not my thing."
I told you to water the plants.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
What is she doing?
- Oh!
"- Oh, what a mess."
- I'm coming in!
"- Jess, take your shoes off!"
We keep an Asian household.
Didn't see that coming.
- What are you doing?
I believe a few weeks' proper care will be of great benefit... to your career.
"You're still a very handsome man, Mr. Hilliard."
Yes.
But your good looks have fallen prey to a certain scrawniness.
"Oh, no, we can correct this, I believe, together."
"- Thank you, Mr. Hilliard."
"This way, Mr. Hilliard."
"- Young ladies, thank you."
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
I'm not concerned about how many lines I have.
I'd rather have four honest words
- than 50 pages of bilge.
- Wyndham Best.
- Young lady.
Remarkably good turnout.
Mr. Frayle.
- Hello.
Did you-
- Is this--
- Yes.
Congratulations.
Well done.
- Good evening.
- Miss Moore.
Very ship shape.
"- Why, thank you."
- Hello.
Let me do this.
Mrs. Cole?
She's coming?
I tried.
"Spoon, stop!"
Shit!
-Stop it!
Stop!
-Stop cussing and go home!
-Shit.
-You have been deemed hazardous.
"-Spoon, watch out, man!"
"-Thanks a lot, Farber."
"Oh, mother-damn!"
She shot at you with her eyes closed!
-Did you shoot with your eyes closed?
"-lt worked, didn't it?"
"She is shit-hot, man."
Put in a good word for me.
-Stop cussing.
-And go home.
I got you.
Aim and fire.
I keep expecting the Marines or Air Force.
"Hell, I'll take the cavalry."
Defense Department uses all USR contracts.
Why didn't you just hand the world over on a silver platter?
Maybe we did.
Robertson has the uplink control in his office.
Service areas.
No surveillance.
-Fire alarm.
-He must have evacuated the building.
Everything's locked down.
"But don't worry, I've got a man inside."
-Dr.
Yes.
They might shoot us if we touch her.
She's valuable government property.
(GROWLS)
"Hey, I can see her face better now."
(CHATTERING)
She doesn't look like Sally.
Are you Sally?
(CHATTERING)
"Well, since it's Judy, we'd, uh, better take care of that leopard."
Uh-huh.
Be my guest.
(GROWLS)
(YOWLS)
"Ok, nut."
Come on down.
"Very nice work with that leopard, fella."
Thank you.
That's a handy gun to have around.
"Mr. Dane, I'm sorry that we doubted you."
We heard her confession.
"But if this is Judy, where is Sally?"
"Uh, beats me."
(THUDDING)
"Judy, stop that."
The least you can do is show them you're sorry.
"Thank you, Judy."
Now all you have to do is tell me where Sally is.
(CHATTERING)
You had the helmet.
You must know where she is.
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
I didn't mean to hurt you.
"Sara, I would never do anything to hurt you."
I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
- You wanna go ?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go.
This is it.
This is where l live.
This is my dad's music room.
- He plays the trumpet.
- No shit.
[ Laughs ] He's actually pretty good if you like jazz.
No.
He's got some nice stereo equipment.
It's off the hook.
Huh.
And this is our living room.
- lt's not anything special.
- lt's all right.
My dad's gonna flix that.
It's kind of messy in there.
- Do you wanna see my room ?
"- Uh, yeah."
- This is it. I sleep on the couch.
- [ Laughs ]
"There's a bed underneath, but it gets stuck, and my dad says he's gonna flix it, but I don't know."
"He's, um, at work right now."
He'll... be gone all night.
"Yeah, um--"
[Siren Wailing ln Distance] I'd sleep in a dresser too if I had six brothers to sleep with.
"Janki, open the door, Janki!"
"I said open the door, Janki!"
Janki!
"Janki, who will support me if you lose hope?"
I know that you are feeling very bad.
You cannot forget the bidding of the auction.
I know.
"Look, Janki.."
Janki.
Janki!
"No, Janki."
No.
Dont do such a thing.
I dont have anyone else besides you.
"If you leave me, then I wont be able to live."
"No, Janki."
Janki!
Janki.
Janki.
Janki!
Sister-in-Iaw!
"No, sister-in-Iaw."
"No, sister-in-Iaw, you cannot leave me!"
"Sister-in-Iaw, I didnt go away from you.."
..so that you leave me forever!
I didnt go to the city to earn so that when..
"..I come back, you dont even talk to me!"
"See, sister-in-Iaw!"
See.. see..
I have brought so many saris for you!
See!
"This pink one, this black one, this red one!"
"Hey, leave Dr. Cicchirini out of this."
He's my boyfriend.
He's an asshole.
"He may be an asshole, but he's my..."
What are you making me say?
"Okay, fine."
"Make the call, but first you should know I did it for you."
Sandro!
"You mean... the Addison's disease,   the fake kidnapping..."
you did that for me?
Yes!
"Meaning,   I'm so important to you that ..."
... that you ...
Yes...
"God, it's cold."
Stop!
"Stop, please!"
"I'm Dr. Cicchirini, can you give me a lift?"
"Hey, slow down."
What happened to you?
I've been robbed!
"16,600 liras, my girlfriend..."
"- Give me a ride, I can't go any farther."
"- Come on, get in."
"My God, what a terrible experience."
Mother of God...
That's the truth!
- What is it?
"- I'm not sure, but that's a serious stench!"
- And it's getting worse!
"- God, yes..."
What a stench!
Boston.
Connecticut?
Hartford.
California?
Sacramento.
"You're a smart one, huh?"
There you go.
Listen.
Mm-Hmm?
I got about 10 minutes left
On my chicken and potatoes.
I'm gonna go upstairs and talk
To colleen about what happened
In school today.
"You know, it is so not OK to"
Slap your classmate in the
Middle of class.
I'll handle it.
She's out of control.
"Hey, I'll handle it."
I like uncle Johnny.
He's so nice.
He never gets mad.
He never yells at us.
And he never does that thing
That daddy does where he would
"Say something and then, like, a"
"Few seconds later, he'd have to"
Explain that he didn't mean what
He just said.
"Oh, you mean sarcasm."
Yep.
I have the package.
"Ground floor, through the library and down the stairs."
- The library.
We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.
That's the library.
Don't go in there.
"Just-- Oh, this is so stupid."
You're not gonna get away with this.
Martin!
What are you doing?
"No, Mr. President."
"The question is, what are you gonna do?"
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?
Is this about Kevin?
"Look, I'm sorry--"
"Run, Mr. President!"
"To me, to me, to me!"
Move!
Walker.
"Move, move, move!"
"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
- Stand behind me and do what I say.
"- Walker, I say again we are coming to you, we are on the move."
In the library.
- Shit.
I'm empty.
- Walker!
"Run, run, run!"
Stenz!
"No, not that way!"
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Was that...?
Was that a conscious choice?
- I'm gonna dig into you.
- I think so.
- I think I remember being...
- I love Switzerland.
I think I remember saying it.
It's just...
"Like, yeah."
Well...
"Of course, those aren't gonna work."
And then Andy said a lot of funny stuff here.
He gave that guy a lot of funny names like Cheddar and...
What were the...?
The names were:
"Switzerland, Steinbrenner."
- Cheese.
- Cheese.
T-Bone.
"- T-Bone, yeah."
- Michael.
- And he said a lot of funny stuff.
- Your tighty whities are visible.
Yeah.
Kat made me have the most uncomfortable meeting with Andy Samberg.
- I didn't mean to.
I was so 7th grade and embarrassed.
I didn't mean to.
You were gonna meet him that night or you weren't.
"I was like, ""Oh, Andy's here?"
"- Go to bed, Jacob!"
"- ♪ Tell me, oh, mountain ♪"
♪ What secrets do you hold ♪
♪ Buried deep beneath the earth ♪
♪ In hidden walls of stone ♪
- Come on.
- ♪ If ever a man in all his days ♪
♪ Climbed your mighty slopes ♪
♪ To behold the gods as they danced ♪
♪ And listen as they spoke ♪
- Hollis.
I ain't troubling no one.
- Your neighbors are complaining again.
"You got to turn that music down and go back inside, son."
- It's a free country.
I can do what I want.
"- Come on, man."
Don't cause any more trouble.
We don't want to bring you in again if we don't have to.
Was it you?
Huh?
Fucking no-good coward.
"Hey, you got something to say to me, Harold?"
You say it to my face!
- Hollis!
Hollis.
"Hollis, that's enough."
That's enough.
Go in the house and sleep this off.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Hold your fire!
I think that man is a friendly!
Get ready to deploy!
Fast rope down!
"Go, go!"
Getusout!
Missile!
Javelin up!
Javelin up!
Countermeasures!
Brace for impact!
No.
This mission is going terribly wrong.
I can see now that there are two men on top of the roof..
and they're engaged in handtohand combat.
Shit!
Yes!
Skip Tyler is in!
"Walker, that last firewall just came down."
Mr. Tyler..
"we are a go, sir."
God bless us all.
Sir.
My weapons system is coming online.
It's being accessed remotely.
I can't..
"Jesus Christ, it's targeting."
What?
It's firing.
Target is an aircraft somewhere over Ohio.
Appears to be a modified 747.
"Oh, my God."
I don't know.
I just thought.
"Well, you didn't think so good."
How do you know?
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Ok?
Really.
Ok.
You ready for sleep?
Good night.
"Good night, honey."
"Jukebox: ¶ lord, I was born a ramblin' man ¶"
"¶ lord, I was born a ramblin' man ¶"
"it's my mother, tom."
She's alone.
I never should have left her.
"At least in New York, I'd be near."
I'd be close to her.
"I could see about a transfer, Damien."
"I need reassignment, tom."
I want out of this job.
It's wrong.
It's no good.
You're the best we've got.
Am I really?
"It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, tom."
"Some of their problems come down to faith-- their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore."
I need out.
I'm unfit.
"I think I've lost my faith, tom."
Hello?
"Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil."
It wasn't my call.
Oh!
What the hell are you doing?
[Yelling]
"Come on, Kamen!"
I'm sorry.
"No, Kaman!"
Please don't!
"Oh, God!"
[Screaming]
[Screaming continues]
[Tires screeching]
[Car horn blaring]
[Siren blares]
[Hotch] Yeah.
Kaman Scott worked for Chris Edwards.
- He was fired seven months ago.
- [Garner] Why did he kill him here?
Roadblocks forced him out of his comfort zone.
- Anything in the van?
"- Welding equipment, cans of gasoline."
And a cage.
I'm getting everyone in the city down here on this.
"Without his car, he's going to lie in wait until he can't anymore."
Then he's gonna lash out again.
[Siren wailing]
[Train whistle blaring]
Prentiss.
I think I found something.
What do you got?
A girl.
There's two more of the same girl in here.
Samuel's sister.
Ah!
He was in office.
Last night he was working late.
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I...
I'm unable.
Mr.Hilliard?
Mr.Hilliard?
"I'm afraid my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did that myself.
"You see Sammy Smith, has two fingers missing from his left hand."
I'm sorry.
We tried very hard to...to make a whole person.
For the relatives.
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent...
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
"To Mrs.Cole, Seasonal Greetings."
With very best wishes
- Lily and Rose Starling.
P.S. We hope the film is going well.
"Happy New Year, Mr.Hilliard."
"Sammy, liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
"Okay, come on, come on."
When'd you attack lompard?
[Gurgling]
When you attack lompard?
- July...
July 31st.
- Good.
That's what our spy said.
[Groaning]
[Gunfire]
[Screaming]
[Groaning]
[Gunfire]
They're over there...
Come on!
"Hey, you, give him a hand there."
"Oh, Christ!"
"Let's get outta here, huh?"
[Rapid gunfire]
[Indistinct chatter]
Let's move... come on!
"All right, let's get the fuck outta here."
This way!
"Hey... hustle, hustle!"
Let's go...
let's go!
Come on!
Take 'em up...
Let's get out of here.
Song:
I have been a witness to the spilling of the blood seen a lifeless body lying in the mud
I walked away alive with a wounded heart but I had to heal it
Has there been any change?
No.
They believe that she might remain in this condition for some time.
We will wait as long as it takes.
We are used to waiting.
"I bet that she will be surprised, waking up to find that everything has changed."
Will I...
Will I seem different to her as well?
"She will think that you have grown into a fine man, I'm sure of it."
I shall return.

Your Highness!
I've been waiting so long to hear you say my name once again!
Not yet.
- One day.
- Mm.
Ah.
Another?
- What the hell is that?
- Get it down you.
Is there no chance of them getting back together?
Mum and Dad?
No way!
#... around me
"# Inside I'm feelin', oh, so cold"
"# Oh, yes..."
"So, tell me about London."
I don't see it.
Underground most of the time.
Underground?
"Er, yeah."
I'm a tube driver too.
"A writer who also drives a tube train, eh?"
Very glamorous.
"Research for your novel, I suppose."
Yeah.
That's right.
It's all about a tube driver.
"Handsome, comes to the Lake District, meets this feisty, young girl who gives him a really fucking hard time, and they get drunk."
"Oh, yeah?"
How does it end?
Tragically.
Oh!
"Hello, Paul's phone."
"No, I'm sorry, he can't get to the phone right now."
There's a meeting I go to... over at the Calvary Church.
- What?
- It starts at 8:
OO.
All right.
Hey.
"Oh, Burton, you caught me."
"Oh, no, that's all right."
"Shannon was upstairs, so I snuck a butt."
"Oh, OK."
- You got another one?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Burton."
"Oh, honey, listen... one of my clients has a problem, so tonight might be a little tricky."
"I'm going to be there,"
- but just maybe a few minutes late.
- Oh.
"Now, the good news is Nick is going to be able to drive you over there."
- Nick?
- Yeah.
He's going to be your escort until I get there.
"You're going to have fun all the way around, OK?"
- Yeah.
- All righty.
See you soon.
Bye.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Some bad news about Aaronson's wife.
- What happened?

What did he do to her?

Let's finish 'em.
[older boy #1] hey!
"[older boy #2] now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.

That was an ambush!

Get it off me.
[boys] yeah!
All right!
"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
"I don't think I can drink any more water, Howard... especially with this belt."
What's that got to do with it?
"Well, I have to go to the bathroom, and I..."
- can't stand up.
"- Oh, honey."
Bob's gotta go to the... bathroom.
Excuse us.
"- Honey, you okay?"
"- Oh, oh."
"Oh, oh."
Shh.
Quiet.
- Surprise!
- For he's a jolly good fellow
For he 's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
- Speech.
"- Speech, speech, speech."
All right.
"This, I'll have to admit this really was a surprise, and I-"
"I wanna tell you how much I appreciate it, but-"
- Aw.
- I really have to go to the bathroom.
"- Uh, Emily?"
- What?
How do I look?
"Oh, I love the pants."
But the jacket doesn't match.
"No, no."
I lost two inches around my waist.
"Oh, Bob."
What?
I'm a dirty panty fiend.
I have a thing for your panties.
"Really, I can't get enough of your jumbo panties."
I really love your panties.
I love your panties so much.
You can stop saying that.
I'll stop saying that now.
Good.
"Now, Marnie, what are you doing here?"
Ask Ricky.
Don't say my name.
"So, Ricky sent you?"
"Oh, Marnie, don't kid yourself that I don't know all about the big secret."
What secret?
What secret?
And I don't care if my husband did father that fat bastard!
Sshhhhhh!
Coach Bowman's my dad?
Ricky.
Can you feel me closing in?
"You're mine, Ricky."
Ricky!
Ricky!
"Hey, we're trying to sleep."
Sorry.
"Yeah, I do get carried away sometimes."
I should just shut up.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:
"For over a century, I have lived in secret."
Until now.
And is this a dessert or a side?
- It's a warm banana.
"- Oh, okay."
Halved... microwaved for two minutes.
- Hmm.
- Give that a shot.
"- Oh, 'cause it's..."
"- Oh, God, the middle is hot!"
- Take some water!
- [coughing]
- Mm.
- This is not a good meal.
"No, no, no, no, I'll just munch on this dry pasta."
"- No, no, it's okay."
- Babe...
You know what?
I have a better idea.
- What?
- I'm gonna go over there
- and cue up some music.
- Okay.
"[""Between the Sheets"" by The Isley Brothers plays]"
"Oh, what?"
- Okay.
"- Uh-oh, what's this old jam?"
- Taking you back to the day?
- [laughing]
"Oh, you slid into it."
"Ooh, you miss these old moves?"
"- Oh, yes."
"- Come here, girl."
"Come on, yeah."
Any other little tidbits of information
You'd like to share with us?
No.
"No, at least I don't think so."
[cell phone ringing]
Hello.
Guess where I am?
"You know,"
"This really isn't a great time,"
Lemme call you back.
"Sydney, I'm at a book signing."
And the guest of honour is
"Your druid expert, gareth watson."
Describe him to me.

If you like the generous-
Love-handles type.
Thanks.

I don't know.
RAY:
"Where does he live, goddamn it?"
JACKIE:

RAY:
How do you get your shit?
"I said, where does he live, bitch?"
If we told anybody where Marco lives he'd kill us.
"Well, what the fuck do you think we're going to do, huh?"
Leave us the hell alone!
Don't hit her like that.
Please tell him and everything will be okay.
Jackie don't know.
I deal with Marco.
She don't.
Leave her alone and I'll tell you.

- It's Ryan Gosling.
Come on.
- This is gonna be amazing.
"- I assure you, it's just fine and dandy."
"- He invited us, sweetheart."

- Ohh.
"- Uh, um..."
- What are these?
- She doesn't know what they are.
Ha-ha-ha.
They're goldfish.
"I know what a goldfish is, but why do you have goldfish in your car?"
- Can't believe I got all my stuff back.
"- You did, but most of it's broken."
"Yeah, it's broken, but, I don't know, it's mine."
"Yeah, but it's broken."
"Hey, look at that."
I think it's working.
"- Oh, my God!"
- We got a TV again.
- It's a TV and it's working!
"- Hey, we got the TV back!"

Wait.
Where are you guys going?
These are heartwarming films.

Shit
It wasn't them
Do I just click on the room?
I think so
"Whatever room is fine, I guess"
Welcome
This way please
Guess you didn't see him
Yeah...
"Normal people use an elevator, you know"
Over here
It's so hot
Wait a second
Excuse me
It's the front desk
Excuse me
It's the front desk
Yes?
That's Bebi's voice
Excuse me
We believe you dropped something downstairs
Wrong room
We are sure it is yours
I'm coming
What?
Natsuko?
Is that you Natsuko?
Yeah
Natsuko!
Why?
Why are you here?
Clark?
Roland?
Zendaya?
- Who?
"- It's Brooke, isn't it?"
[gasps]:
It's Brooke!
I've got all I need.
"But I, I didn't say anything."
"Hey, Emma."
We're finally here.
Face-to-face.
[somberly]:
To face.
I invited Amy to our after-work hang.
[breathily]:
Oh...
"Hi, Amy."
AMY:
Sorry we're late.
It was a crazy day at the office.
"I had to calculate the company's overtime, then I realized that was making me go overtime, and that I had to include that, too... ugh, my life!"
I could really use a drink.
"I'll go order two beers, Amy."
Maybe they'll give me a third one
I didn't ask for.
"Jack, help!"
Emma doesn't know this is a date.
How can that be?
You were so clear when you asked her out.
"I know, but she brought her friend Amy."
"Okay, don't panic."
Yes.
I'd like that very much.
- I'm here all the time.
- I could call.
Yes.
- Or I could give you my number.
"- If you've got one, I'd like that."
- Now you know I exist.
- Yes.
I've got a pencil and some paper.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
I better go now.
Bye.
I'II be home very soon.
Do I have any brothers or sisters?
"- No, not really."
- What do you mean?
There's a little boy at the orphanage called Pramod.
- Pramod?
"- Pramod, yes."
I've taken care of him since he was a baby.
- How old is he now?
- He'll turn eight in precisely a week.
He's this big.
"He's tiny, but he want's to be a footballer."
"Maybe it's stupid, but I brought some pictures, if you'd like to see them."
"Yes, please."
Here I'm taking a bath.
"That's Lennart, my first boyfriend."
He had a moped.
- But he didn't want me.
I love this song uh.
It reminds me of being in Rome.
I wonder if toe sucking is big in Rome?
Baby you want a beer?
The six pack no?
"Baby, we have good energy."
We have a good energy me and you no?
Yes.
Come here...
Come dance with Papi.
Me and JP have been together on and off for about six months.
It's going pretty good but sometimes I get the feeling I'm not the only girl JP's seeing.
"Oh, JP..."
Ahhhh no no...
Are you still there?
Just stay here.
Who is that JP?
"Ah, computer is broken"
Is crazy joke ha ha...
No...
Come out where ever you are.
I only have eyes for you.
Hey JP!
Let's do that thing with the toes again.
Call me if you want to rendezvous.
Hey...
- Bye.
OK baby is no big deal is my massage therapist.
OK?
That's a reasonable explanation... right?
JP...
JP...
Where is he?
"Well, I'm sure it doesn't matter."
You seem to have plenty of company.
What do you mean?
"If I were you, I'd stay on this train and keep going."
What are you...
Oh!
Oh!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
You're sorry.
Oh.
"Well, Gretchen, what happened to you?"
I found Nancy.
"What'd you do, have breakfast with her?"
I think you better not go in there.
Why?
"Well, she's sharing her drawing room with a man."
Nancy?
He was in bed when I walked in.
"Oh, there's some mistake."
"Yes, there's a mistake all right, and Nancy's made it."
"Gretchen, I think you've said about enough."
"Well, I saw him!"
You coming?
No.
Not until I hear Nancy's side of the story.
Uh-huh.
Drawing Room B. I'll see you at school.
"Aunt Nancy, I still have something on my mind."
(BELL BUZZING)
BOB:
Nancy.
"He's Mr. ABCD, he's good at playing deadly games."
He's going to play Russian Roulette!
There are 3 bullets in this Russian Roulette.
Over there!
Let's start the game!
I'm done!
"Hiroshima, he's shot himself 3 times!"
"Damn it, wake him up!"
He's dead.
"You're just as dead, Wake Yoyo!"
Follow me!
Follow me!
- l heard something.
- Let me see if I hear it!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What happened?
- l asked you what happened?
- Nothing...!
But there are mechanical traps.
I'll go first!
Robin darling!
You're terrific!
You always know where they are!
Sure. I know exactly where they are.
"So you go first, I'll protect you from the back."
Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright!
I can hear something!
Him again?
"No, he's Mr. ABCD's half brother, Mr. EFGH,"
Born 3 days after his brother.
"So Rothenberg clearly feels that greed is ruining our society, but is that greed systemic or a result of individual choices?"
- Hello.
Can I help you?
- Hi.
"Uh, yeah, Denise McBride, please."
- Denise?
- Denise McBride.
- And who are you?
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.
- Denise:
Sorry.
It's okay.
Go ahead.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
"- Boy, am I."
- What is going on?
What happened to your hand?
Is my dad okay?
- It's avocado--
- Did something happen?
Was there an accident?
Why are you here?
Your dad's fine.
"Your dad's fine, okay?"
He had a little bit of a panic attack.
Panic attack?
Like a heart attack?
- Is he in the hospital?
- Like an anxiety attack.
"He's fine, though."
- Never mind.
Dad's at Aunt Rosa's.
She wants us to come.
- What?
- Dad is at Aunt Rosa's!
- He came especially?
Why?
- How should I know?
He isn't answering.
Where is he?
Ricky doesn't have to follow us everywhere.
- What did Rosa say?
- To come.
You're more hysterical than her.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Why didn't you invite me along?
That was very unkind of you.
You want to know who your father is.
Good for you.
Really.
"But I want to know, too."
"I want to know who raised you, who was with you all your lives."
I won't hold you up.
Have some tea and go.
It seems Aunt Rosa has something to say that I thought you should hear.
That's all.
"Rosa, where's the Sweet'N'Low?"
In the kitchen?
I swore to Jonah.
"I have to pinch myself, I think I'm dreaming."

"Ariel, what are you..."
How could you...
What is all this?
"It's, uh..."
It's just my collection.
"Oh, I see."
"Your collection, hmm."
If your father knew about this place...
"You're not gonna tell him, are you?"
"Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand."
"Ariel, you're under a lot of pressure down here."
I'll take you home
- and get you something warm to drink.

- [Ariel] What do you suppose...
- Ariel?
Ariel?
I know.
But that doesn't mean you didn't.
Justin.
I get the feeling you're not here to see me.
"No, I'm not."
Is Rebecca here?
"Rebecca, this is Justin."
Justin Walker.
So you're one of them?
- His family?
- Yeah.
"- I got it, Mom."
- OK.
"If you're expecting tears from me, you can forget it."
I'm not expecting anything.
I just wanted to meet you.
"Well, I'm here."
I'm real.
You can even touch me.
- Uh... you want to walk?
- OK.
It's so bizarre.
"We live, like, 15 minutes away."
"In L.A., that's practically like being neighbors."

Swanky.
I got kicked out junior year and I finished up at San Marino.
- What about you?
- Marshall.
I think we played you in football.
- I didn't play football.
"- Yeah, so did I."
- So did I.
[PHONES BEEPING]
GOSSIP GIRL:
You wanted to meet Gossip Girl?
"Well, look around."
You just did.
I'm nothing without you.
And while most high-school friendships fade it's my hope that what happened today will bond you forever.
"Now that all my secrets are out, you have a clean slate until college."
Congratulations.
I'm coming with you.
GIRL:
"Oh, my God."
- Drinks on me.
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Wonderful.
NATE:
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about what I said.
You don't have to apologize.
Where's Chuck?
It's over.
Once and for all.
But I'm gonna be strong.
"Still, it doesn't feel right without him here."
"You know, everyone's here."
Yeah.
Everyone's here.
"- Oh, it's beautiful."
I got a better shot letting him fuckin' drive.
What are you waitin' for?
The car's cold.
Get the fuck out of here!
"What, warm it up?"
Get out of here!
-Who is it?
-lt's Belle.
Open up.
It's Belle.
Let me in.
Morris didn't come home.
He's missing.
I know something's happened.
Calm down.
He's missing!
I know something happened.
He's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere.
In 27 years he's never been away all night without calling.
I know something's happened.
I know you know.
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.
I've been home!
I've been on the phone--
-So what the fuck you want me to tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care about her?
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.
I do it all the time.
Everyone okay?
SAM:
Dirk.
[GUN CLICKS]
Winchester.
"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.
"That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk."
You're not going anywhere.
Everybody stay where you are.
You'll be okay.
Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.
I'm like 21 Jump Street.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
The bus driver sells pot.
Yeah.
It's not here!
-Where is it?
-No way you'll ever find it.
SAM:
Where is it?
"Sam Winchester, still a bully."
"You, you jocks."
"You popular kids, you always thought you were better than everybody else."
"And to you, I was just Dirk the Jerk, right?"
Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you.
"I'm not evil, Dirk."
I'm not.
And neither were you.
Trust me.
I've seen real evil.
"- Night, Buckley."
"- Night, Mrs. Cole."
- Pretty copper kettle.
- Such an age since...
- Bright copper kettle.
- Been such an age since...
"Pretty copper kettle, bright copper kettle."
There it is.
Dunkirk.
Blimey.
There's so many of us.
They'll never...
Mrs. Cole?
They'll never get us all out.
"Uh, where..."
Where is she?
- Thank you.
- Cut!
Could someone please get Mr. Hilliard out of Dunkirk?
- Find Mrs. Cole!
- Train ticket.
Ration card.
Authorization to travel.
"Oh, don't be nervous."
Mr. Hilliard won't notice you're gone--
It's not Hilliard.
It's Ellis.
"He's gonna be so disappointed in me for missing the opening, for not turning up till the last minute."
Nonsense.
"Your husband is a lucky man, Mrs. Cole."
I'm sure he knows it.
He's not my husband.
She still is.
Roommate I.D'd the photo as a Jordan Arnold.
Run the DMV.
Get me an address now.
We're running out of time.
Snitch's Tavern.
Your first arrest.
That guy had to be 6′6″ easy.
"–Still, that bust was when I knew."
–Knew?
That maybe you wouldn't be a complete screwup after all.
–Take a right up here.
I wanna show you something.
"–No, I can't."
I gotta get back to the barn.
I got some stuff I gotta check up.
Bullshit.
"This is your training officer, all right?"
Take the afternoon off.
Humor an old man.
Take a right.
Come on.
All right.
Yes?
I've got a problem on this Tio murder.
What's that?
"The more I look into it, the more Vic Mackey's name pops up."
"Well, Tio was Vic's C.I."
He was also a drug dealer.
Vic's name is all over his phone records.
But Vic told me he hadn't talked to him in months.
–He lied.
- That's right.
"- Two women, side by side..."
That is the most powerful thing that there is.
Now get on up here and attack each other.
- All right.
- What's that now?
What...
"Oh, God."
"Well, Cookie, hold on one second."
"This is my first class, so I don't think..."
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be the attacker.
- Okay.
"- And Maggie, you just do all the moves that we've been working on, okay?"
"Yes, Cookie."
"All right, you're at the ATM."
It's late at night.
"Emma, attack."
"Beep, boop, beep, boop."
"Ooga-booga, give me your money and also your body!"
[groaning]
- You're dead.
- Ow.
"- Nice, Maggie."
- That actually really hurt.
"Remember too, your forearm is a five-way weapon, okay?"
- Five ways?
"- So you've got one,"
"- two, three, four, and five."
"- Ah, ah!"
- That hurts.
- You're okay.
"- Are you still in the same house, John?"
- You too?
"- Rachel, how?"
- I say hello.
A little girl was abducted.
I need to find him.
"""Sacred Quest"" A little girl's life, how beautiful."
Time is running out for him.
"I can feel it, John."
But time is running out for all of us.
Except you.
"You're dead, man."
"""Sticks"" have the name of a club."
"The club's owner, Jade the name of a woman."
"But the man behind the name ""Rook."" Jade, Rook'un knows where it is."
"- Girl, Rook'un hands?"
- Ask him.
"The Rook, a young man."
Young and very dangerous.
"Be careful, my friend."
"- The same as you say: ""I'm already dead."""
- Hey!
Bitch where is it?
!
(This is work that man.) (What's he doing that here?
)
"Fuck, man!"
Kill him!
Shut up.
- Rook'u Where can I find?
- I do not know what you're talking about halttan.
Fuck man!
And I shall.
Take care of her.
Of course.
Look. ;0]
We'll put this by the window.
So you can watch your friends dancing across the street.
And look.
I love this room.
I'm going to order the whole lot.
And...
Come in and close the door.
How are you?
Sit down.
Thank you.
"Alicia, look who's here."
"We're just getting some air, reading magazines..."
Who was that woman who just left?
"Katerina, Alicia's teacher."
Her teacher?
"Yes, her dancing teacher."
Katerina's a real character.
Her academy is in front of my house.
Alicia was her pupil.
And Katerina loves her like a daughter.
FOUR YEARS EARLIER
"Benigno, you've been at the window for half an hour."
"I'm coming, Mom."
Are you following me?
No...
"Well, yes."
And?
I think this is yours.
"We all spend so much time, energy AND money in an effort to look our best."
We all WANT to be attractive.
Hello.
"Hello, Rose, it's Alex."
Oh!
"Hi, Alex."
How... how are you?
"Oh, I'm okay, I'm... trying to get on with my life, ya know."
"Oh, good, good."
What's wrong with you?
You don't...
Claire's gone.
Gone?
Yeah.
Gone where?
I came home to surprise her during lunch and I found her in bed with her masseur.
"It's my own fault, really..."
Claire hates surprises.
"Alex, I'm..."
I'm really sorry.
"No, no, I knew it was coming."
I don't know WHY she wasn't happy.
I...
I...
I don't know how I could have loved her any more than I did.
I don't think it would've mattered how much you loved her.
- Rose.
- Uh-huh.
Did you know that Claire was jealous of you.
- What!
Jealous of me?
"- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yes.."
"Sammy, watch where you're going."
I'm watching.
"I'm all right, man."
Jesus-sorry!
[Overlapping chatter]
"Red light, red light."
Jesus fuck!
God damn it.
"You're fucking pushing on me, man."
Who's that?
"Hey, it's John Wayne!"
It's not the same guy.
"Hey, it's Mr. America."
I thought I told you to get out of here.
Holy shit!
[Gunfire]
"You must be thinking of somebody else, friend."
Come on...
Get out of here.

"You're very kind, but I have... Is all right."
You're safe now.
I really can't...
"Shh, shh."
Don't worry.
Everything's all right now.
My little girl is home.
I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me.
But you know there's nothing I wouldn't do for my sweet Ralkana.
My name is Kathryn Janeway.
"""Kathryn""?"
Thas an unusual name.
Very pretty.
I
- I like it.
I am a starship Captain.
It is very important that I contact my ship.
Wonderful.
Captain...
Kathryn of a glorious starship.
Then what happens?
Go on.
I'm listening.
I love your stories.
Is not a story.
Is a request.
May I use your communications equipment?
Communications...
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favourite toy.
So you got rid of him.
"Well, what ifAndy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?"
You gonna knock me outta the window too?
I don't think we should give him the chance.
"There he is, men."
Frag him!
Let's string him up by his pull string!
-I got dibs on his hat!
-Would you boys stop it!
Tackle him!
"No, no, no!"
Wait!
I can explain everything!
"Okay, Mom, be right down."
I've gotta get Buzz.
Retreat!
"Mom, do you know where Buzz is?"
"No, I haven't seen him."
"-Andy, I'm heading out the door!"
"-But, Mom, I can't find him!"
"Honey, just grab some other toy."
"Now, come on!"
"Oh, okay."
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.
"Honey, I'm sure he's around."
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!
Hold it.
Hold it.
"- Say, ""Thankyou, Snookie."""
"- Thankyou, Snookie."
Get your ass on the floor.
"Ticket, please."
Have a good trip.
"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"
No.
I love ballet.
I never had the body for it.
You dance?
I used to.
I've got something for you.
"It's for love, not luck because you don't need luck."
You dance like an angel.
Mom...
You're the best luck I'll ever have.
- Are you okay?
- I keep messing up the pirouettes.
"It's frustrating, but it'll be okay."
My mom's gonna be there.
You have nothing to worry about.
You're the best dancer in Lamont.
"This is not Lamont, it's Julliard, New York City."
- Do you want to pray?
- What?
You're leaving for St. Louis.
I'm not gonna see you.
We should pray.
"Awesome Father, S.J. Auditions today, let her do okay..."
because I wanted to forget him.
Did you?
Well...
I thought so.
- Who drove off last night?
- It was Jacob.
"I thought Johannes drove him, but he couldn't have."
- Jorgen lent him to Jacob.
- He never lends out Johannes.
He did to Jacob.
It seems he is giving it all to that Jacob.
Helene Hansson.
I'd like to speak to Doctor Philippsen.
Remember to lie.
How big was it?
You have to agree or she won't believe it...
"Good, off you go."
- We caught one that was this big.
- No way!
"It's true, but it got away."
I have to go to town.
Jorgen?
Won't you stay for lunch?
We ate on the way.
I'll be home in a few hours.
- Jorgen?
I spoke to Doctor Phillipsen.
- Yes.
Phillipsen's under confidentiality.
That's totally unacceptable.
He promised me.
He's betrayed my trust.
It's the sign of Solon.
MacGyver... it's...the Ark... of Solon.
Oh...
Oh...
It looks so beautiful.
"Yeah, it's gorgeous."
Now can we get it and us out of here?
But just think.
Inside this Ark rests the Torch of Truth.
"Ah, yes."
"""Gods march in rank."""
Yes!
Yes.
"""And Hecate races in the heavens,"
"""enters the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"""Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages, and the Treasure of Atlantis...shall rise."""
It's the riddle of Solon.
Great!
Now can we go?
You are going nowhere.
What?
What is it?
Ah!
Tell me who you were spying for.
United Nations?
U.S. Intelligence?
Who?
We're not spies.
"Ah, yes, you are, uh historians."
Historians?
I happen to be a professor of archaeology.
You said that.
Mr. Aaronson.
"Hello, Nicholas."
Did you see your dad outside?
"Yes, I did."
"Mr. Aaronson, uh... about Sarah--"
Sarah?
Your child.
is there anyone that can take care of her?
She's with a nanny.
"Well, legally, the biological father has rights."
He does?
Legally.
But I'm prepared to help you if you--
What?
If you wish to keep her.
Oh.
No.
"Thank you, no."
Have you met the father?
She said they were just friends.
I even gave him a job at one of my stores.
I gave that guy a job.
"Oh, Alvin?"
I'm on my way to the track.
"I'm up _3,OOO so far-- an astonishing run."
"Alvin, understand that if you choose not to do your job, then I will have to--"
- What?
Fire me?
- Yes.
"I've already been fired, Lulu, trust me."
I'm already dead to this place.
"Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"
[Baby Crying]
[Clicks]
What happened?
[Yawns]
"Mmm, that crazy kid."
[Chuckles]
She locked me up with my own cuffs.
[Yawns]
Where's the keys?
[Mumbling] Over there.
[Yawns]
[Gasps]
- Hi there.

[Yawns]
Anybody hurt in this wreck?
Thought I told you to get plastic folders for this stuff.
[Yawns]
Your scrapbook is like you- a mess.
"Gimme my pants, will ya?"
Come on.
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.
I also got two feds- Mulderig and Klein.
[Groans]
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys... and they can get all they want from ""Uncle Sap."""
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
"[Man] Mike, take a look at this blue one with the tan, on the right."
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
INTERVIEWER:
And that way it's cheaper to set on fire
A non-established character.
I don't think it matters.
I think it was more like that was on his resume.
"And they went, oh, there's an idea."
So now he starts right here.
MAN:
Where are your cameras?
He'll do the whole stunt.
I get most of the flame.
You'll still get your stuff here.
Is that OK?
So I'm gonna have both cameras at the bottom.
MAN:
So both the cameras--
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put my cameras down here.
MAN:
Yeah that' my buddy TJ up there.
I'm a little nervous just for him.
INTERVIEWER:
You're worried for him?
"Hey, how long have you been doing this?"
About 22 years.
"Setting myself on fire, probably about 10."
INTERVIEWER:
Yeah?
You nervous at all?
"Mommy is dead, Gonki."
Mommy is dead.
Yes.
Want me to sleep here?
Gonki Galonki is sad.
Daddy Galonki is very sad too.
How long have you been here?
I just got here.
"You look good, Daddy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
And you?
Great.
How's your son?
He is in the army theater.
That doesn't surprise me.
And your wife?
Nira and I got divorced 5 years ago.
I didn't know.
"Until it happened, I didn't know either."
"Here, something sweet."
Thank you.
"It's a good play, ""The Enchanted Nose""."
"Yes, it's never been done here before."
"Maybe in drama school, I'm not sure."
It's a lovely comedy.
So much street wisdom.
Renee had a very sharp eye.
They don't write like that anymore.
How many characters?

I started to walk west towards the diner.
I was in this area here when I heard the shots.
I saw a white adult male running north down the alley away from the vehicle.
I checked the vehicle-- observed CSI Brown bleeding from a gunshot wound.
Did you hear about Mr. Rossi.
"-No, what?"

I got it first hand.
From Mr. Rossi?
"From Kathy, who got it from Betty, who got it from Miss Thornton."
I suppose that's first hand.
I guess we won't be able to keep him here.

"Her name is Lemonade, and she's come to live in our house forever."
What?
- Isn't she great?
- No!
It looks like a child in an animal suit.
"Well, come on, give her a pet."
- (neighs) - (gasps)
Oh!
"Now, that's no way to treat family, Lemonade."
Be nice.
Aw...
Now you're just flirting to flirt.
She'll come around.
I promise you.
"Come on, girl."
Let's go night-night.

You're ugly.
I'm not talking about it anymore.
I already told the cops and the doctors.
No one believes me.
They think I'm crazy.
SAM:
"Well, I'm a little bit more open-minded than most."
"April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?"
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
When I--
"When I hurt Taylor, I was there, in my head."
But I couldn't control my body.
I could see what I was doing.
But I couldn't stop.
I just wanted to stop.
[SIGHING] I'm sorry.
-You don't need to apologize.
Air France made me.
"We walked out with $420,000 without using a gun."
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.
Sixty thousand.
It's going to be a good summer.
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.
"Anybody asks you where you got it, you got it in Vegas playing craps."

"One night, Bobby Vinton sent us champagne."
There was nothing like it.
I didn't think there was anything strange in any of this.
"You know, a 21-year-old kid with such connections."
Good.
"You haven,t eaten, I hope."
- Nice trip?
- Us?
"We got lost at first, but after that it was easy."
"Here,s the paperwork."
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, against the wall, please."
Very good.
Now undress.
"That,s right - undress."
"Lab coats off, shoulders against the wall."
"Jean-MicheI, tell us how you met."
Me or...
"Sure, CIaudine."
"At some friends, dinner party."
"I hadn,t really noticed him."
"But at a certain point our eyes met,"
",cause we were both bored."
- You were bored?
- Yes.
THEY WERE BORED.
He smiled and then -
"It wasn,t Iove at first sight, but..."
I was surprised when he called me afterwards.
",We got to know each other, Iike in the song."
What song?
By Hugues Aufray.
could you sing it for us?
"No, not Iike this."

- How about you?
"- I don,t know it."
I can always make a new one.
I'd rather lose my engine than seeing it misused by a villain.
This is it.

"I do this and this, and then..."
"Professor, here we come!"
"Oh, no!"
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Wait!
"He has the devil's luck, indeed."
Did you see that?
Two planes are leading.
Mac's and Hudson's.
Everybody's here.
Dear!
Helen!
Here.
Congratulations on your victory.
"Congratulations, Mac."
Thank you very much.
I owe my victory entirely to your kindness.
"No, it's due to your excellent engine."
Or perhaps to Mrs. Hudson's lunch basket.
"Oh, that may be right."
I wished I could have asked Professor Moriarty how he liked the dessert.
I bet it was the bitterest cake he had ever tasted.
Ouch...

I beat it out of there the minute Roger got back.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I...
I get goin' on a story.
"Not at all, John."
I like it.
It speaks to your general enthusiasm.
"Well, I do have that."
I have something else.

I surely do.
"Where is everybody, Mama?"
I'm here.

"Dejalo, dejalo..."
Come on.
That's gonna throw everything off.
"Danny, just throw the ball, dude."
"Man, he's gonna take my spot."
All right.
"Remember how we used to do it in little league, right?"
"Choke up on the bat, put your shoulder into it."
"Come on, throw him a nice juicy one so he can smack it!"

Belgium?
No.

No...
"Hungary, or...?"
What's the country?
It must be something?
"Yes indeed, it must be something, but you haven't found it."
I'm going to throw it over for a bonus point to the Araucarians?
"Oh, yes, I've got the country."
We think it's Chagall and...
Belarus?
Show me your first letters.
Let's see if you're right.
Yes you are.
Chagall and Belarus.
"Chagall, one of the leading artists of the 20th century, came from Belarus."
Settled in France.
Anyone know the town he was born in a Belarus?
Minsk?
Vitebsk!
"And whenever he did his paintings, he said, ""Whenever I paint,"

"Araucarians, we're with you."

"Gibbs, Lance Corporal Finn's fiancée's upstairs."
She saw a report on the local news last night.
"How, Doctor?"
"As soon as I know, you'll know."
Her name is Siri Albert.
"She's 25, lives in Manassas, and works as a physical therapist."
- Finn's fiancée is here.
I put her in the conference room.
- You did?
I did.
"No, I did."
His fiancée?
"Yeah, his fiancée."
Tall ?
Like brown hair ?
Red hair.
Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from Iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in Jackson, Pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That James Finn has been dead three months.
He left for Iraq three months ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay, but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
AndI 'mcomingforyou .

Gear up.
- This ends tonight.
Uh!

"- Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
- Why do we keep hurting each other?
- I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not--
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
I count that.
- Yeah.
"- Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just-- want us to be normal again."
"- Yeah, me too."
- I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.
- What?
- Why did I say that?
- Why did you kiss Holt?
- I didn't.
I did.

He's growing up in exile.

"- Where's Budapest, in the Negev?"
"She's in school there, pest."
If you married her she wouldn't have left.
But like an idiot you told her you're bi.
- 'Cause I'm not a liar.
"- ""Bi"" my ass"
There's no such thing as bi.
"What is it, a bivalve?"
"What are you, an oyster?"
Go ahead and laugh.

Yeah.
"Drawing the pumpkin man, huh?"
Yeah.
"Bus ride is hard for you, isn't it?"
"It's okay, Santana."
"You know, your father wanted to come see you, but something came up."
He couldn't make it.
I'm a good girl!
I went to Catholic school!
"Okay, well, it's getting late."
This was terrific.
You win.

"I think the word you're looking for is ""befuddled."""
My catapult flings my bishop to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two.

Check on Leonard.
Hang on.
When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
When it's done charging.
Or you land on the time machine.
Obviously.

Beekeeper to King 12.

What did you say to Gus?
Because he's on to us.
Yeah.
I didn't say jack.
What do you mean he's on to us?
He's walking to his car.
Then suddenly he isn't.
"No, we have to go."
Come on.
Come on.
Ten blade.
Retractor.
"Carter, start compressions while I cross-clamp the aorta."
"Yeah, I got it."
-She's clamped.
-What happened?
-Abdominal bleed.
She coded.
-Start an atrial line.
-I need two 15 French cannulas.
"-Mark, little girl's coding in 2."
"Hit-and-run, recent onset of abdominal pain."
Crashed and went into asystole.
We've infused four units of O-neg and epi and cross-clamped her.
-Mesenteric rupture?
-Probably.
Nothing you could've done.
"Peter, I'll take over."
Hypothermic kid in Trauma 1.
Needs femoral lines for a bypass.
Infuse another unit.
"-Peter, it's about damn time!"
-Cut down!
We're trying internal paddles.
-Charge to 10.
-Charging.
Clear.
-Charge 20.
-Charging.
She's got a Firebird and two horses!
We could've raced 'em!
All right.
That's it.
I'm gonna go askJake Bradley.
I know.
"We've all been thinking it, but no one's had the guts to ask him... 'cause he's the quarterback, and we're a bunch of jelly heads."
But you know what I say?
I say we shoot for the stars.
And that star is Jake Bradley!
Jake Bradley!
"All right, Fez."
There's Nina.
"Now remember, you're a new man."
You don't need her or anything else.
- Got it.
"I am cooler, suaver, aloofer."
- There you go.
"- Oh, hi, Fez."
"- Oh, you wish, baby."
"Why don't you take your ""Hi, Fez"" act and try it on someone else?"
'Cause I don't need it.
"- Nice work, Fez."
- Shut up.
I don't need your accolades.

These threads ain't about the cruise.
I'm filling in for the Sandman at The Apollo.
"But the Commodores, those cats are outta sight!"
You dig?
Is everyone in this family stuck in the '70s?
Can any of you name a single current rapper?
What's a rapper?
"Oh, Cleveland, you are stuck in the '70s."
"They're the guys who wear the gold chains and go,"
"""Wibbity-bop, flibbity-blop."""

"Oh, Cleveland, this cruise is gonna be fun."
But are you sure you can take the week off from work?
Of course I can.
Everybody gets off for spring break.
It's ridiculous!
- I'll never take it!
- What's so bad about it?
I won't even hear about it!
"It's embarrassing, don't you understand?"
- Why embarrassing?
- There're people looking...
- Is this hat for me?
"- Yes, for you."
What a mess I've got in!
Maria Vasilyevna!
- Comrade General!

Here's a photo machine.
Insert 20 kopecks...
I can't understand anything.
I've been waiting all preened up since 5.
Call him.
Can you do it for me?
I did it for you last time.
Thanks for nothing.
Bye.
Some friend...
Damn hypocrite.
"When she needs anything, you must do it even if it's nighttime."
Hello?
May I speak to Gennady Borisovich?
"Ghena, are you playing games with me?"
It's almost 7.
Is this why you disappeared every other day?
No no I...
I snatched your power.
Next you attack my father...
I'll pull the earth from under your feet.
And this isn't just a statement... it's the Boss' prediction.
Boss!
Ankita has to come sir.
Shivani is a common friend.
And her mom's in the ICU.
She's in a state of shock.
So I thought if Ankita just met Shivani once... she will feel better.
And anyway I couldn't contact Ankita earlier.
So I had to come here.
Okay.
Take her along.
But...
You will bring Ankita back home... sooner than Shivani's mother's eager to die.
Okay sir.
I...
I'll bring her back home soon.
Go.
Hurry up Dimple.
Poor Shivani...
What happened?
I'm taking you to Shiv not Shivani.
What?
Shivani's mom is alright.
Now call him.
Here's my phone.
- Shiv.
- Ankita how are you?
More and more of the Germans.
Watch out for that Jerry!
I'm going to have to take a chance.
"Your pistol, Sergeant Major."
Thank God for the Navy.
Get down to the boats.
Come on there.
Hurry upl
"Come on at the double, get a move on!"
"Sergeant Box and his party, hurry, hurry!"
Get a move on!
"Don't play around in the bloody sand, you bloody fools!"
"All the other boats are loaded, Sir."
"All right, all away."
Take it away.
I thought you weren't going to make it.
So did I. We met a German destroyer outside the port.
"Here you are, boys."
Ta.
Thanks.
"Well, what was it like?"
"I don't know, very foggy."
The Germans?
"Oh, I couldn't understand a word they said."
Here.
Corporal Dawes?
"Yes, he's behind the screen."
"He's still under a sedative, so please don't stay too long."
Thank you.
"Hello, Corporal."
Who is it?
"Blimey, it's the Yank."
Horace.
"-Good night, ma belle."
-Good night.
"-Good night, Horace."
-Good night.
You make an awfully handsome couple.
Naturally.
I'm married to the second prettiest girl in New York.
-Good night.
-Good night.
"Everything is all right with them now, isn't it, Horace?"
"I think so, Nora."
It's worked itself out.
"-Fun, wasn't it?"
-I love our Thursday nights.
"You're such a lamb, flirting with mother, asking just the right questions."
But I do wish you could come home with me.
So do I.
"I don't think I'll be very late, darling."
It's just a question of reminding Frank that he's a reasonably honest man.
-Shall I wait up for you?
"-Yes, do."
We'll have a nightcap together.
We might even hold hands.
"-Your car is here, Mr. Belney."
"-Oh, thank you."
-Can I drop you?
-It's early.
I think I'll stop in at the Del Rio for a drink.
Join me?
"No, but I'll take you there."
But I'd much rather you went home and worried about me.

- Coming.
Excuse me.
You can go on with your chat.
I have some more calls to make before lunch.
Your poor father does his best to leave us two alone.
"Shouldn't we make him happy, Aliki?"
"We could make him so happy, living with him in this house."
- Why insist Dimitris?
"- Because I love you, Aliki."
"I've always loved you, ever since you were a little girl."
And because I always believed the day of marrying you would arrive.
"I love you, too, Dimitris."
But as an old childhood friend.

There's no Montgomery here.

"Oh, no, please stay."
Ricky's just getting John down to bed.
I really should be going.
Thank you so much for inviting me over and letting me meet you and John.
Ricky loves you both so much.

The worst criminals this country has ever known are coming back.
My grandfather wasn't a guard.
He was an inmate.
That's him.
"Tommy Madsen, he killed my partner."

So we have to find these '63s?
We need to find who took them.
I need you to watch them.

Easier than mowing the lawn.
Everybody's as busy as little bees.
"Hello, Charlie."
Get me Captain Nim and Colonel Kirby!
NIM:
What are the charges?
He was pacing off the distance between the wall and the team house.
We could've caught a round tonight.

Sponsor an inquisition over here?
- Is that what you'll tell the people?
- L'll tell what I saw.
- That was nothing.
- Brutality's not nothing.
That man was lining us up for a V.C. Mortar crew.
Leave?
"They want to drink, my friends."
They want to hear music and gamble.
And where's the only place they can do that?
I give you the Standish Tavern.
I can hear the jingle of the cash box now.

It never seemed to be a good time.
There was a game last night?
"It's called Monday Night Football, Mackie."
"It's been around for, like, 40 years."
I'm going to tell them!
When?
It's already been a week.
I know.
I will.

That's another five days.

Very nice.

Hmm.
She drowned herself?
I found this shoe floating' under the dock.
Guess the other one sunk to the bottom.
Melvin?
"What is it, Melvin?"
Hmm?
- Nothing.
- Come on.
It's not like you've never seen this sort of thing before.
It's just that she's so young.
"Well, don't you remember?"

The little boy who got hit by the speedboat.
Hmm?

"I mean, sure, if you want to."
We could start with everyone you've ever punched in the face since moving to Newport.
First would be...
Luke at Holly's beach house.
"Yeah, and number two would be Luke."
Right.
At the diner.
"Yeah, and again at the mall."
What about Holly's dad at Cotillion ?
That was more of a tackle.
Which takes us back to Luke.
"Yeah, in T.J."
"Summer, do you really think Pancakes is in the attic ?"
"Like he pulled down the ladder, hopped up and-and then put it away ?"
Hmm.
"Well, we have checked everywhere else."
Light.
Be careful.
Oh... gross.
It's okay.
What is that ?
That's Uncle Alistair.
That's your uncle ?
Yeah.
No.
"It's, uh, my dad's skeleton from med school."
He called him Uncle Alistair.
I don't know why.
"God, well, I don't want to meet any of your other relatives, so let's just find Pancakes and go."
Okay.
Bye.
Hello?
I'm Max.
"Excuse me, I thought you were Cristina."
I got the wrong number.
Sorry.
Fermín?
I'm Max.
"Hey, don't you remember Cristina's number by any chance?"
What do you mean Cristina who?
"Well, some years went by but... you know Cristina."
"Yes, of course, that Cristina!"
All of a sudden I thought I could remember her number.
Yes that's right.
It's possible that she doesn't live there anymore.
"But, I don't know."
Nothing in particular.
I just... wanted to know how she was.
"Well, I'll find her anyways."
Thanks a lot Fermín.
Bye.
Can you put Father Urlieta on the phone please?
Thank you.
Father Urlieta?
I'm an old student from high school.
My name is Máximo Gascón.
They called me Max.
Yes...
I think you should remember.
You taught me religion for 4 years!
Of course it was a lot time ago... 30...
More than 30 years ago I think.
That was a long-ass leg.

You ain't been here the whole show?
"You talking about some, ""Damn."""
I've said some fucked-up shit.
"My God, man."
Jump on it.
That shit remind me of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air... when Will Smith and Carlton got in that--all right.
I love Fresh Prince.
That's my show.
"But y'all, I'll be honest with you."
Will Smith does not think I sound like him.
Nope.
"First time I met him, it was weird."
He was like...
"""Yo, Jay, I don't think you can sound like me."""
And I was like...
"""Yo, Will, stop playing."""
"He was like, ""Yeah, that's good."
"""Check it out."
Whoo!
"Miami."""
"He made some good music, man, you know?"
"No, but I was raised mostly on, like,"
Biggie Smalls and Tupac.
That's what I like listening to.
Biggie Smalls is just cool.

"I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all."
"Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose."
It's just a mistake!
"Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody."
-Have you been replaced?
-What did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
"Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice, big Andy's-room welcome."
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
"Come in, Star Command."
"Star Command, come in."
Talked to your husband about going overseas?
"Yes, I've been talking to him."
"Yes, I know."
"You've been a perfect angel about it, but I've changed my mind."
You have?
I think that Robert should go.
Are you sure Bob wants to?
"All right, Gretchen,"
I'll tell my husband that Bob's changed his mind.
"Oh, thank you, Karen."
You're such a darling!
I'll tell him he should have his orders in the next 24 hours.
"Goodbye, Gretchen."

"Listen, if I leave my suitcase, will you send it to me?"
I guess so.
You're just gonna sneak out of here without saying goodbye to anyone?
"Well, I have to."
"You say goodbye to Nancy for me, huh?"
What do you want me to tell her?
"Tell her, uh..."
"Just tell her goodbye, huh?"
You!

You killed my husband because he wouldn't give in to you.
And his oldest son Paolo because he swore revenge.
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.
He never speaks.
It's not his words I'm afraid of.
He's weak.
He couldn't hurt anyone.

That's me.
"Hi, I'm Agnes lenbert."
I work for social services.
Who's she?
Her name is kalaya nirapattanassai.
She's a thai national.
"Hello, kalaya."
My name is James.
She doesn't speak much English.
Can we speak in private?
Why is she here?
She was arrested at the airport yesterday with 2 adult thai nationals who were smuggling heroin.
She was posing as the drug smugglers' daughter.
Where there any drugs found on her?
"No, she was just there to make it look like a family vacation."
To Pittsburgh.
Heh!
Not exactly a thai dream.
No wonder they got caught.
Where's she staying?
At a locked shelter for juvenile offenders.
But I don't understand why you're here.
I think she wants asylum.
[Slowly] Do you speak any English?
Uncle Joe.
Me and Uncle Joe.
Do you want to stay with Uncle Joe?
Does Uncle Joe live here?
Does Uncle Joe know you're coming?
Uncle Joe.
Me and Uncle Joe.
Hundred percent.
"Unfortunately, your ball won't make it over."
- Data tennis is starting to show its abilities.
- It's really a strong method.
Use that move.
Yosh.
"Do it, Kaidou."
Game set and match.
Won by Seigaku.
Seven games to five.
It's a pit between physical peserverence.
We can't lose.
Third match is beginning.
Hyotei's Kabaji against Seigaku's Kawamura.
One set match.
Hyotei to serve.
Play.
Hadoukyuu.

- Love
What!
Winner will be Hyotei.
"If this continues, we'll lose."
"Taka-san, that is..."
I will definitely win this match.
I want to be in the Nationals.
Single-handed Hadoukyuu technique.
I can't play anymore.
Kabaji's stamina is actually drained.
The last ball doesn't count.
Singles three no game.
Chiku'so!
Get the hell out of here Danny!
You drunk!

- What's wrong with him?
"- Oh, Danny was so mean to him this morning."
I can still totally picture it.
"So it all started when Justin, he woke up."
He was in a great mood.
"He was like, man, I love being in love, man."
I just love it.
Makes me wanna do the moonwalk.
I could do the moonwalk.
I could get jiggy with it.
I could...
I could spin.
I could jump.
I could dance for days and days but I'm not.
I'm just gonna stand completely still.
Completely still.
Still like a stone.
Like a stone.
"And then... and then Danny,"
We pan over to Danny and Danny was all like grrr.
I think love is stupid.
Getting married.
"Getting married, ""pfft""."
That's all like a dumb mistake.
I would never do that.
And I get to be mean to you for just no reason because I'm a big baby.
I'm a big baby.
My hair's too long to be a baby but I act like a baby anyways.
I'm the friggin' host of the show.
"Oh, okay."
We're being interviewed by a 12 year old.
Hi.
"I'm 14, and my show gets the most hits on Viddimension."
- You dig?
- Yeah.
I dig.
"I guess ""dig's"" back in."
"Now, I hope you noobs are ready 'cause I've played your beta, and I got some serious questions for you guys."
So who's gonna walk me through the demo downloads?
- I hope it's you.
"- Uh, I will."
- Come on.
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"- Yeah, that's awesome."
Hi.
"Oh, hey, you must be Suzanne."
"I'm Deena, Dave's wife."
Of course.
Really nice to meet you.
Dave's told me so much about you.
"Oh, not too much, I hope."
Hi.
Hey... honey.
What are you doing here?
"- Hi, honey."
- What are you doing here?
"Well, you know, today's a big day for you, so I just, uh--"
I'm--I'm glad you came.
And I finally get to meet the famous Suzanne.
"- I just can't believe it's taken this long-- - oh, it's been really crazy."
"Hello, John Klein."
Who is this?
My name is Indrid Cold.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
"Your father was born in Racine, Wisconsin."
He lived in a green house on Monroe Street.
You don't remember how your mother looked.
"Okay, you got my attention."
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.
Under the bed.
"Very good, John."
Thank you.
What's in my hand?
Chap Stick.
"You're reading my mind, aren't you?"
Did you read my mind?
"I have no need to, do I?"
What's the third line of page 51?
"""A broken smile beneath her whispered wings""."
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
Look how happy the mom is now.
"-Oh, Rach."
-Screw you!
You don't have to do it!
-Hey.
-Hey!
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.
"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
Why?
"Lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend."
I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
"In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner."
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
Joey without a date on Valentine's Day?
"What's going on, huh?"
Girl trouble?
-Sort of.
-Really?
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Maybe I can help.
"Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me."
"You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex."
"-So anyway, what is it?"
-Forget about it.
It's no big deal.
"-Come on, what is it?"
- You're welcome.
Your boarding pass.
Sir?
You forgot your bag.
Thanks.
"Nice going, Campbell."
"Hey, Ben."
Basic strategy says you should hit that.
"Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,"
"Mona, Miss Sommers, your new identities are on the bar."
So glad you could make it.
Vladimir Stupnitsky?
Yeah.
Your dad's a diplomat with the Russian consulate.
"You live in Washington, D.C."
"Your hobbies are backgammon, chess and long walks on the beach."
Will anyone help me?
Hey Gocha...
"Don't put pressure, he may die."
"See and tell me, I must kill him."
I must kill him.
"Hey, Doctor?"
- He's on the bed.
- Wake him up!
"Doctor is there, but what you do there?"
What to do now?
Gocha...
Gone again!
My partner said he's in this quarry.
He can't speak properly.
Even a sorry would hear like quarry.

Stupid fucking nigger police.

Have something sweet.
"Thank you so much, aunt Anka."
"I'll be off, then."
"Wait, I've got something else."
- What is it?
- Take a look.
Thank you so much.
You really piled up a heap.
"I didn't peel this off, I was afraid to tear the stamp."
- You'll do a better job.
- Thank you so much.
"I asked the neighbours, too."
I know that you collect these things.
- Now you've got a bunch.
"- Thank you, I've got to go."
"Bye, thanks for dropping by."
The series will start now.

Tito lives.

"Never, never, never in my worst dreams did I picture--"
only Poe.
only Mr. Edgar allan Poe could do justice to it.
What are you doing in that horrible place?
"Oh, what am I saying?"
I didn't mean to say that.
"I meant to be nice and say, ""What a convenient location,"" and such."
-You haven't said a word to me.

"stella, I can't meet him now."
Not till I've bathed and rested.

"I think I know how, but it's a little dangerous."
Like sandwiches with toothpicks in them dangerous?
Even more dangerous than that.
Like eating a bomb?
In between.
Like eating a firecracker.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Well... aren't you kids playing nice.
"Hey, Ethan, over here."
Look at my face and hands while I'm talking.
I just want you to know it's my mom's birthday today.
"Um, it isn't June 3, it's today."
Okay.
"Wait, I have some questions for you."
Uh-huh.

Or just hitting Mike.
- It's like hitting a puppy.
You cannot...
- But we were in character.
"I know, but..."
It would have been so Of Mice and Men.
I didn't do it.
But back to the Denzel story somebody thought Michael was Denzel.
Did you ever think that maybe Denzel was just standing behind you?
- We looked to make sure.
- They were looking at me.
"I looked around for Denzel, because I love Denzel."
- But there is no Denzel.
"- No, it was me."
Did we have any celebrity sightings on the shoot?
- I don't...
"- Wait, wait."
"Yeah, we..."
"Oh, God."
"Well, now I forget."
"Remember there was a guy near Don Hill's who was crossing the street and I was like, ""That's the guy from..."""
Really?
"He's in a band, remember?"
He's handsome.
- Was it Mayim Bialik?

"Mayim Bialik was, like, head of a Yiddish singing group."
"He'll understand, believe me."
Connie.
"If you don't listen to me and marry this man,"

-Famiglia!

It means we should all live happily for 100 years.
The family.
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.
Hey...
"Merle, you've met my sister-in-law, Deanna."

-You're falling all over the floor.
You're justjealous because he's a real man!

These Dagos are crazy when it comes to their wives.
"Michael says that if you can't take care of this, I have to."
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop.
Don't!
"What are you doing to me, you big slob?"

And the Dyane 6 has them built in.
It was more like this one.
The Dyane 6.
- Who are they?
- Pickers.
Here for the harvest.
He's from the town.
They know him.
Could be a picker who comes every year.
Or someone who works at the fair.
The father has a Dyane 6.
Yellow.
It was parked outside the house.
Yellow looks like white at night.
- And gray.
It's a common car.
- Excuse me.
Someone wants to talk to you.
"Angelita is psychic, she sees stuff."
She talks to the dead in her sleep.
She asks them what she wants to know and the dead tell her.
Have a seat.
I've been talking to my dead mother the last two nights.
And she said... she saw the girls at the abandoned farmhouse.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing.

What was the question again?
The question was about...
LAUGHTER
I mean...
"I tell you who misheard, David O'Doherty."
LAUGHTER
"And he was like, ""Oh, that's a sweet job"
"""you've done there,"" you know?"
LAUGHTER
"OK, top thing people get jealous about."
People that can spell definitely.
LAUGHTER
Ohh...
"I've got D-E-F - after that, I've got nothing left in the locker."
LAUGHTER
That's why defo was invented.
Defo.
LAUGHTER
New girlfriends or new boyfriends.
"Yeah, that's a good answer, yeah."
It's that sort of area.
"Flirting, flirting."
Flirting with...
Yeah.
Flirting is exactly it.
Ahh.
APPLAUSE
"Yes, the top thing people get jealous about is their partner flirting."
I'm a bit of a flirt.
"Just last night, I had a girl give me a look that left me in no doubt as to what she wanted."
"It's well worth a flutter, but pay the tax on it before..."
"Oh, delighted you enjoyed your stay."
Very nice.
Hope to see you again before long.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
"Goodbye, Mrs. Fawlty."
"Goodbye, Mr. Firkin."
A satisfied customer.
We should have him stuffed.
"Oh, Mr. Fawlty, 3:00, Exeter, Dragonfly."
Right?
"Yes, good luck!"
Jolly... jolly good luck with it.
"Morning, Major."
"Good morning, Fawlty."
"Yes, dear?"
"What was that about the 3:00 at Exeter, Basil?"
"Oh, some horse he's gonna bet on, I expect."
"You're looking very spruce this morning, Major."
"- St. George's Day, old boy."
- Really?
"Got a horse, have you?"
What's his name?
"Did you catch it, dear?"
"Dragonfly, Major."
"- Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?"
"- No, no, no, no, no."
"No, Basil doesn't bet anymore, Major."
"Do you, dear?"
"No, I don't, dear, no."
That particular avenue of pleasure has been closed off for me.
Absolem?
Why are you upside down?
I've come to the end of this life.
-You're going to die?
-Transform.
Don't go.
I need your help.
I don't know what to do.
"I can't help you if you don't even know who you are, stupid girl."
I'm not stupid.
My name is Alice.
I live in London.
I have a mother named Helen and a sister named Margaret.
My father was Charles Kingsleigh.
"He had a vision that stretched halfway around the world, and nothing ever stopped him."
I'm his daughter.
I'm Alice Kingsleigh.
"Alice, at last."
You were just as dim-witted the first time you were here.
"You called it ""Wonderland,"" as I recall."
Wonderland.

This movie's awesome.
You must be the last person on earth who has never seen Psycho.
Spoiler alert:
It's gonna scare the crap out of you.
"Holly, if there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I'm a pretty tough..."
Aah!
That wasn't even scary.
"Yeah, but look where it got me."
"Hey, guys."
Hope I'm not interrupting.
"- Actually, uh..."
- 'Cause I gotta talk to Holly
- about something important.
"- What's going on, Phil?"
Is this shirt too tight?
"No, it leaves just the right amount to the imagination."
Is that kung pao chicken?
"Oh, stop drooling."
Sit down.
"I couldn't, I couldn't."
Not without a glass of wine.
So what are we watching?
"Wow, Psycho?"
- Uh-huh.
"- Oh, I love it."
"Get out the shower, girl!"
Get out the shower!
"F.Y.I., he'll be doing that the entire movie."
Yippee.

"No, baby."
"No, I told you to run!"
You gotta run!
"Captain, do you see this?"
"Delta 26, we have a young girl on the lawn."

Pin me to some guy with a badge?
"Mary, I'm trying to keep you out of jail."
Come here.
Ahem.
- What are you laughing at?
"- Punk, you're like, 7 years old."
"I don't get it, Mary."
"I mean, why come back here?"
You already missed the funeral.
You think I feel good about not being there?
Truthfully?
"I don't know, I can't tell."
"I mean, we were invisible to that man."
"I would have taken anything from him, even disappointment."
Because at least it would have been something.
"Listen, Mary."
"You know this is really hard for you to accept, okay?"
But Dad loved us.
"He just didn't know how to show it, I guess."
"Hey, I got that address on Sofia Archuleta."
"Mary, right?"
"Sis, meet Danno."

Ugh.
"Oh, I do not want this vacation to end."
"Promise me when we get home, we'll only speak French to each other."
"Oh, ce sera comme nous sommes sur notre propre île privée au paradis."
I was kind of hoping for English with a fake French accent.
But of course.
I had such a good time.
Mm.
And you are really sexy.
"You put the ""moan"" in Mona Lisa."
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
"You put the ""oomph"" in arc de triomphe."
Ooh.
You put your hands in my pants at the Louvre.
"I know that that's not what we're doing right now, but it was fun."
Yeah.
It was all fun.
"Yeah, it was."
And you know what the best part was?
What?
No Mansfield.
"I mean, you blew off opening a new office in Hong Kong to go to Paris with me, and your boss didn't even call or e-mail or text."
He fired me.

"For weeks, Pete was complaining:"
"""Why aren""t our towels as white as the towels at the gym?"""

"We went to Tiffany""s soccer game on Friday night."
"A date, Joan."
"High heels, tight skirt, pretending to be the maid?"
"Joan is a grownup, not a Barbie doll."
She has real-life responsibilities.
- Pete needs to suck it up and be a man.
- Says a woman twice divorced.
"Look, Joan, is Pete being a prepubescent jerk?"
Yes.
"He""s a man in his 40s."
What do you expect?

I could see for the first time that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.
His mind was going in eight different directions at once.
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?
Morrie?
Him?
That's when I knew Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.
That's how it happens.
That's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked.
He's a nut job.
He talks to everybody.
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.
"Nobody cares what he says, he talks so much."
Make sure you bring him here tonight.
-Okay?
-All right.
Start like this.
Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?
"Stop breaking my balls, alright?"
.
I was just stalling for time.
"We follow you no more, Bloody Big Head."
How dare you?
Off with his head!
"Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes against Underland are worthy of death."
"However, that is against my vows, therefore, you are banished to the Outlands."
"No one is to show you any kindness, or ever speak a word to you."
You will not have a friend in the world.
"Majesty, I hope you bear me no ill will."
"Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne, you are to join Iracebeth in banishment from this day until the end of Underland."
At least we have each other.

"Majesty, please!"
Kill me!
Please!
But I do not owe you a kindness.
-STAYNE:

-He tried to kill me.

"Miss Cross, you have a father in the Navy, Lucas Augustus Cross?"
-My stepfather.
-Have you seen him lately?
Not for a year and a half.
-What's wrong?
"-He went on leave, didn't come back."
He's listed as a deserter.
"Miss Cross, are you sure you haven't seen him?"
I didn't even know for sure that he was in the Navy.
He hasn't called you or written you?
-No.
"-He disappeared from town... a year and a half ago, deserting his family."
"Well, it looks like he's running true to form."
If you do hear from him get in touch with 1st.
District Shore Patrol.
I will.
"Oh, Selena, don't get upset."
It's not your fault they can't find him.
What is it?
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've got to tell somebody."
I can't keep it to myself any longer.
-Every time I go out in that yard...
-What are you talking about?
Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!
You leave Lucy out ofit.

Soyou call me when you want it to stop.
- [Beeps ]
"- She's not leaving town, is she?"
That'd be a no.
"[Doug] Ifshe knows all this aboutyou, she'll probably come here."
She won't play this out on my turf.
She'll keep the pressure on until she gets an opening.
I-
- I can't believe this.
"I'm a C.P.A., for Christ's sake."
C.P.A. brought down Al Capone.
There's a reason why the feds wantyou to testify.
I saywe hunt her down.
Ammunition's cheap.
"Fi, ifwe go out there without a plan, we're exposed."
She's more than happy to keep killing people until we hand Doug over.
She can come after me.
I'm ready.
Yeah?
- What about Sam?
"- I'm game, Mike."
"What about ifshe comes after my mom, my brother..."
Doug's sonJasper?
Let me hold it.

How do you do?
Doctor.
We're with the search party.
"Well, thanks very much for your help, gentlemen, but as you can see, we were fortunate enough to have already found Sally."
- Can we see her?
- Sure.
"It's all right, Sergeant."
"Hello, Sall--"
I don't believe it.
That's not Sally.
That's Judy.
She's our chimp.
You gotta be kidding.
Of course it's Judy.
She's our compound pet.
"Gentlemen, you are sadly mistaken."
"Look, she's wearing an authentic NASA space helmet."
"Now, if she weren't Sally, what would she be doing with that helmet?"
"Well, that's a tough thing to answer, but believe me, you are making a mistake."

And Mrs. Garcia said she stabbed her husband?
-That's correct.
-You weren't home?
-l was at work.
-Were you friends with Mrs. Garcia?
We didn't socialize.
We keep to ourselves.
What's the problem?
Why are you asking questions again?
-To be sure statements are accurate.
-Everybody knows she stabbed him.
"He beat her up, she took her revenge."
-They're gonna lock her up for that?
- Mary?
Mary who?
"Mary, the Mother of God."
"She, in person she helped me."
The woman in blue.
Mary helped you.
"It all checks, it does."
"She was on the train, with the blood on that picture."
She wanted to warn me.
And later in the Beauty Salon she was lying beside me.
"""When you're warned, you must listen..."""
And she was at the cemetery this morning.
Mary is with me.

"Except, we think we know why she might have killed Morty Price."

-Mother.
-You just stay right here.

"""Kane. "" So this is our Grandma, right?"

"Uh, what do you want in Hillie's room?"
"Well, I need-- I need a dress to bury her in."
Do you have any suggestions?
Her favorite was the blue dress with the bow on the back.
"You loved her, didn't you?"
"- Uh, everybody loved Hillie."
- But... you loved her a little more.

"William Holden is so handsome, and I know how he feels."
"All alone, a drifter with no one to love."
That's what's missing from my life-- someone to love.
"Mr. Truesdale's son, Greg, asked me to a picnic today."
He is so cute.
"He turned my camera on me, and I can't believe how silly I acted."
"[ Chuckles ] But it was fun, and it made us laugh."
"He asked me to the movies, and I decided to take a chance."
I hope it's not a mistake.

I distinctly ordered the Antarctic blue Super Sportswagon with the CB and the optional rally fun pack.
You didn`t order the metallic Pea?
metallic Pea?
"No, Antarctic blue."
The Sportswagon.
This isn`t even the right model!
I think you`re right.
I don`t think this is the car.
This is the new Wagonqueen family Truckster.
"This is a fine automobile, if you want my honest opinion."
It beats the hell out of the Sportswagon but I want to make you happy.
Davenport!
I`II get to the bottom of this.
Mr. GriswoId ordered a blue Sportswagon.
Where is it?
"I don`t know, sir."
I know what must have happened!
It didn`t come in!
"Ed, I`m not your ordinary, everyday fool."
Okay?
I`d like my Antarctic blue Super Sportswagon right now.
"If you can`t get it for me, I`m going to take my business elsewhere!"
Where`s my old car?
I`m just as upset as you are.
believe me.
Davenport!
Get Mr. GriswoId`s car back!
Bring it back here!
"I can get you the wagon, there`s no problem there."
"The problem is, it might take six weeks."
"I owe it to myself to tell you, Mr. GriswoId if you`re thinking of taking the tribe cross-country this is the automobile you should be using."
The Wagonqueen family Truckster.
What?
"No, well... just think about it when you're bored."
You came?
Yes.
Na Na is here.

I heard from ahjumma... that President Choi Eung Chan is Lee Yoon Sung's real father.
The person who raised you... he's too cruel.
He took you away from ahjumma.
"Intheend,itwastomakeyourrealfatherlikethisright?"
"Because of Lee Yoon Sung's revenge, everything..."
Lee Kyung Wan.
Seo Yong Hak.
Kim Jong Shik.
Cheon Jae Man.
They were all corrupt.
"If they were not corrupt, I would have forgiven them."
"If the President is corrupt, too, are you going to punish him?"
"If he is corrupt,"
That-- does it have to be you who does it?
He's your father.
"To your real father, how can you..."
Kim Young Joo was faced with the same.
"Because it was his father, he concealed and covered it."
"But, was that really good for his father?"
I'm the President's bodyguard.
Maybe...
"like when I was guarding Seo Yong Hak, we might meet like that again."
"I hope, that you won't do anything you will regret."
"You know Assemblyman Lee Young Taek, who is the highest council member of Segyere Party, right?"
Lee Young Taek?
"The prosecution is investigating him on a bribery charge linked to Haewon's Cheon Jae Man for the privatization of health-care, right?"

"SO, WHEN DO WE ROLL OUT?"
YOU DO NOT.
"AS PERHAPS THE LAST RESCUE BOTS IN EXISTENCE,"
"YOU ARE UNIQUELY SUITED TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLANET,"
AS WELL AS LEARN FROM THEM.
YOU MEAN WE'LL INTERACT WITH HUMANS?
YOU WILL BE AMBASSADORS TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLANET --

"STUDY THEIR CUSTOMS, OBEY THEIR RULES,"
AND WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP THIS PLANET SAFE.
"DURING THIS MISSION, YOU FOUR MUST APPEAR TO THE HUMANS"
"AS MACHINES, ROBOTS IN DISGUISE."
WHAT?
WHILE THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
"ARE COMFORTABLE WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,"
THE IDEA THAT ALIEN BEINGS ARE LIVING AMONG THEM
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CAUSE PANIC.
SO WE CAN HELP THE HUMANS AS LONG AS WE HIDE OUR TRUE SELVES?
"YOU ARE RIGHT TO QUESTION WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR TEAM, HEATWAVE."
THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO LEAD THIS MISSION.
"TO MAINTAIN YOUR COVER,"
YOU WILL EACH ADOPT A VEHICLE MODE BASED ON EARTH TECHNOLOGY.

"You know, with this kind ofthing, you gotto be brutal."

"Really, I think that's what has to be done."

"[Colson] You justwhisperthe word to me, and I'll shoot Ellsberg myself."
- [Ehrlichman] We're not Germans.
- Yeah.
Ellsberg's notthe issue.
The Pentagon papers aren'tthe issue.
It's the lie.
- [Crowd Cheering] - [Chambers] Mr. Hiss is lying.
Yeah.
"Remember, John, back in '48?"
Nobody believed Alger Hiss was a Communistexceptme.
"Well, they loved Hiss like they loved this Ellsberg character."
He was their kind- Ivy League establishment.
"I am not, and never have been..."
- Mr. Hiss is lying.
- Mr. Hiss?
"- I was dirt to them, nothing."
- And Dick kicked the shitoutof'em.
I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.
"The documents were old and outof date, just like these Pentagon papers."
The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.
Then people bought that he was a spy.
It's the lie that gets you.
"All right, Henry, we're gonna go yourway."
Crush this Ellsberg same waywe did Hiss.
"Yes, it's the Queen."
"According to Buckingham Palace, the Royal Family cost each of us 61p per person per year."
But they have made some cutbacks -
"Diana, Margaret and the Queen Mum have all been laid off."

JACKIE ROBINSON HAS PUSHED US FORWARD.
"FOR HIM, THERE WAS NO SATISFACTION"
WITH SIMPLY BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER THE ROOM.
BARACK OBAMA:
PART OF WHAT I ADMIRE ABOUT JACKIE ROBINSON IS
PRECISELY HIS ABILITY TO APPROACH BASEBALL
AND THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS OF INTEGRATION
IN WAYS THAT WERE CONTRARY TO HIS CHARACTER
OR HIS FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WRONG
IN SERVICE OF A LARGER CAUSE.
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT MADE SENSE FOR HIM TO SUSTAIN.
HE HAD PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SPEAK HIS MIND MANY TIMES OVER.
NARRATOR:
"ON APRIL 15, 1947, JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON BECAME"
THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE MODERN AGE
TO PLAY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.

"IN HIS FIRST SEASON WITH THE BROOKLYN DODGERS,"
"HE HAD SILENTLY ENDURED RACIST TAUNTS,"
"THREATS, AND ABUSE,"
PERFORMING SPECTACULARLY ON THE FIELD
AND BECOMING ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED MEN IN THE COUNTRY.
"LATER, UNBURDENED OF HIS PROMISE TO BRANCH RICKEY TO KEEP QUIET,"
"TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK,"
"AMERICANS WOULD BEGIN TO SEE THE REAL JACKIE ROBINSON,"
AND THEY WOULD NOT ALWAYS LIKE HIM.
As late as can be

I'm going to stay at your place for a few days for your punishment.
No.
My husband hates it when you visit.
No he doesn't.
He's just acting like it.

Okay.

We'll become blind if you say.
And... ...it seems your hero didn't like my idea.
We too didn't like it.
- What?
- Nothing.
And yes.
Listen!
I've a habit of drinking milk two times a day.

Trusting lads.
"You always said trusting lads was my problem, Bov."
I trust lads too much.
Trust the Yank too much.
This is how you prove your point?
Backstabbing me?
Teaming up with Tommy Hatcher to kill the Major?
Kill my fucking brother?
I'll kill Tommy.

You people are living in a disguise.
I'll send you behind bars.
"No, sir."
"No, sir."
Let me go home.
My younger brother... ...is suffering from fever.
I had to do this for his treatment.
I've no support in life.
I've nothing to eat at home.
Even my mother died of hunger.

She was suffering from Asthma.
I didn't have money to give her the treatment.
- Oh!
You go home.
- Yes.
Swings?
Were there swings there?
"You said you are going to the toilet,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;what are you doing?"
I was going now.
"Man Ok, let's eat together later."
Okay.
Aren't you going in?
Where did you go?
You neglected a person dying with pain alone.
Wow!
"What, neglect?"
I left after seeing that you had fallen asleep.
Never mind!

Take a hard look at yourself.
I'm slipping.
(BRAP!)
Both of us are.
We must abandon her.
Here?
Now?
(TWEET!)
RAPE!!!
"Handy, right?"
We have to go this very minute.
"Okay, um...I'm on board."
"We'll change our last names, and then we'll call the cops."
"Right, right, right!"
They'll take her into custody.
She's no longer our problem.
I like that.
-Move!
Go!
-What?
GO!
GO!
GO!
"Yeah, I don't need to know that."
"No, no, no, no."
I am an expert in discharge.
Just ask away!
"Nasal, Vaginal, Anal."
Our short webseries tells these stories.
It helps maintain the illusion.
"Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine."
She asked me to come.
But not to come late.
I have to see this show.
"Just let me in, I'll stand in the..."
A Spider-Man A Spider-Man...

Okay.
Cool Spidey outfit.
Thanks.
Where'd you get it?
I made it.
Looks uncomfortable.
"Yeah, it gets kind of itchy."
And it rides up in the crotch a little bit too.
Hi.
"In this case, I think it's required."
I'd better get home.
I feel a murder coming on.
"Mm, college man."
"Hi, I'm Lila."
Which Greek god are you?
"Lila, Russ and I are trying to talk here."
"Russ, is it?"
(trills) Russ.
"Sounds kind of like an animal, doesn't it?"
Your nose is shiny.
It is?
It is not.
Is it?
If you're lying...
Back in a flash.
Let's bail before she comes back and ruptures a hormone.
Bye.
Manny.
And I want a lot of closeups.
Hello?
Winston?
Are you in this time zone?
Hmm?
"Oh, yeah."
"Zooms, closeups, lots of energy..."
Gotta go.
Bye.
"Focus here, people, focus."
Remind me to talk to him about his attention span.
What?
"Here's a little present for you, trashman."
- What?
Yes!
- Alone?
I sent her.
So what?
"Aunt, we never send a girl and a boy out before marriage."
"This is a love marriage, son."
And you must be aware what can happen before marriage... ...in such types of marriage.
They come closer and closer... ...and embrace each other.
He's Jimmy and he's Kishan.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you very much for the drama you played for us.
Thank Mr. Damodar to trap me in this.
He's a very nice person.
Oh!
"So, this is your motorbike factory."
"Yes, I work here."
What?
You work here?
Yuck!
I thought you are an owner of it.
No!
I'm a labour.
Labour?!
Sad!
Very sad!
Labour class people.
"Anyway, Kishan."
These are few shirts... ...I had bought them for myself.
I didn't like it.
You keep it.
"No, sir."
- (Finebros) You got one.
- Yay!
(Finebros) But it's not over.
- Aw.
- (Finebros) You need seven more.
Come on.
Where are you?
I don't understand where I'm going.
There's a page.
"""Follows."""
♪ (jolting chord) ♪ (high-pitched static) - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - (whimpering) (high-pitched static) (nervously) Guys!
Don't be there.
"Oh, no!"
No!
"No, no!"
"Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!"
I really-- I didn't even find any notes.
"(Finebros) Oh, you're okay."
Keep going.
- Oh!
Oh!
- (Finebros) He's right there.
Go.
"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God."
I'm really lost.
I'm just walking aimlessly now.

That's so sc-- I don't like--

What the f--
What the f--
What?
Happy birthday.
I'm seeing somebody now.
"You mean, like a boyfriend?"
"Well, like I like him."
What?
Nothing.
"Thas good, you know?"
Companionship...
May be more than that.
More?
I don't know.
I'm coming to see your play tomorrow night.
You're coming?
I'll be there.
Don't disappoint me.
I won't.
Rent.
Hi.
Hi.
"Whas ""hi""?"
Can I spend it?
I have a paycheck due this week and...
You're a month late again.
Again.
I promise as soon as...
"If promises were crackers, my daughter would be fat."
"I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch."
All I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.
"""Sorry"" doesn't pay the rent."
And don't try to sneak past me.
I have ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.
Any story.
"Tenderly, as if whispering."
I'm busy here.
I have nothing to say.
I love...you.
Not that.
Something with a plot.
Oh I don't know.
What plot.
Hurry...
A long time ago...
In my ear.
Whisper!
"A long time ago, I was dating this woman."
She was a real virgin.
Really?
Yeah.
And so...?
"What do you mean, so?"
"Once she did it with me, she was no longer a virgin."
That's it?
Yes.
More specifically.
How did you meet her?
She lived next door.
And then?
"Well, then, one day."
Try to make it dramatic.
Like a movie.
Alright.
"One night, a night of brilliant moonlight,"
I was asleep... when the door opened quietly.
"Honey, could you turn that down?"
WHOA!
Dammit!
My ankle!
Oh yeah!
I didn't want to trip on them.
Ow!
"Sweetie, is your car running OK?"
"Yeah, why?"
Great!
I'm fresh out of gas.
I'll take yours.
I'm late for work.
(DlNG-DONG!)
Just a minute.
Oh!
"Hi, Marla."
We need to talk.
Come in.
What happened to your ankle?
Getting out of bed this morning ...
Tripped over Barry's golf clubs.
Yeah.
Happened to me many times when we were married.
I still wear a brace when it rains.
"So, what's in the box?"
I thought Barry cleared all of his stuff out after we got divorced.
I was cleaning today and I found something.
What is it?
You're not gonna like it.
Like what?
"Well, all those years, I knew there was something."
Catch him.
There he goes.
Catch him.
"Don't let him go. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
""" Here comes Govinda... """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
"Don't let him go, catch him. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
"Go that way. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Let's sit down and talk.
All I did was file a case.
lf you try to talk they'll cut you in half.
Look behind.
Catch him.
Faster!
Who are you?
Krishna Vasudev Yadav.
What?
Krishna Vasudev Yadav from Gokul.
So you're from UP.
You can call me Kanhaiyya.
Catch him.
Careful.
Careful.
"Careful, slow down."
Slow down.
Are you a man or a stuntman?
You can call me a stuntman as well.
But people call my stunts a miracle.
Miracle.
- Hold on.
You aren't wearing a helmet either.
There he is.
"Hey, even the card companies give you three months."
"You can give me three months, can't you?"
Let's meet on Saturday for sure.
Okay?
Saturday!
- Hello.

Is there a forecast for rain today?
Well... the report has just come in.
"Sorry, Soo-jeong."
It'll be clear today too.
"Oh, I see."
I'm right here.

- Did you eat?
- Yeah.
- And your homework?
- I did it.
- And the diary?
- Of course.
"Hey, I told you to draw me better."
"Look, my eyes are closed again."
Watch here.
Like this.
It's not working very well.
"Mom, do you regret it?"
Regret?
About me.
Do you regret it?
Why should I feel any regret?
It was my fault.
"No, it's Dad's fault."
Not you!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!

Inspector Damodar speaking.
"Yes, this is Uma."
- Oh Uma?

Cover your drape.
What?
- No...
Not you.
"Yes, tell me."

"Yes, I too miss you a lot..."
That's why... cover your drape.
What's wrong with you?
What are you blabbering?
You have to--
Sick!
You're so sick!
I'm so sorry.
I know.
The doctor said that you're gonna be okay.
He said it's just gonna take a little time.
We're leaving tomorrow.
It's not safe for us here now.
"- You all right, mate?"
- How is he?
He's hanging in.
"So, what now?"
You let Tommy know I want a straightener.
- Tomorrow.
- All right.
We finish this once and for all.
Somewhere quiet.
Away from old bill.
"Ike, your mate runs security at Trinity Wharf?"
- Yeah.
- Get hold of him.
Set it up.
Sure.
Come on.
What's going on?
Ben and I are on the noon flight to Boston.
You can't leave him.
He was trying to protect us.
"- You can't do this to him, Shannon."
"- Yes, she can."
She has to.
Then who the hell are you?
I'm...

"Beat it, punk."
What now?

"Oh, no!"
Get out!

What kind of person is your husband?
A good person!
But we don't love each other.
"My husband's a good person, too."

Don't worry about Yuning.
My mother and her cronies want to banish Yuning because of me.
They think he's a threat to my crown.
Prince.
But I have no right to the throne.
And so I won't allow an innocent like Yuning to be hurt.
What are you saying?
No right to your throne?
Does the Crown Prince know?
Does he?
Sire.
The Crown Prince to see you.

Your Grace.
"Now, what did you want to tell me?"
"Father, I have no right to be Crown Prince."
What?
"I have a basic obligation to the Royal House, the court and the nation."
"But I'm quite ill, Father."
I refuse to hide the truth just to keep a crown.
You're ill?
What are you saying?
Yun.
Well?

Papa.
Get down.
"Papa, we're practising."
Today's 'Janmastami'.
You've your exams tomorrow.
Who will write that?
Get down!
Why do you always stop for religious things?
He'll be absolutely fine.
My son's playing Govinda.
My son won't become Govinda or Chunkey Pandey.
He'll grow up to become a cricketer.
Get down.
Get down.
Come on.
Mahadev.
- Coming.
- Let's go.
- Come soon.
Listen.
Remove the tag of Rs.250 from.. ..all the new idols that we bought.
- Yes.
"Now, watch how I sell it for 10-12 thousand."
And keep one idol from each on display.
- Okay.
Understand?
- Yes.
Come on.
One and only one piece in the world.
This idol appeared from the ground.. - Yes. ..when the temple at Badrinath was being built.
What are you saying?
That's the plan.
Rule the world.
You and me.
Any day.
- Love your hair.
- What?
"No, I love the air."
"Anyway, with my freeze ray I will stop..."
"- Hey, doc."
"- Moist, my evil, moisture buddy, what's going on?"
Life of crime.
Got your mail.
"Hey, didn't you go on a date last night?"
Conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait And Switch.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It was alright.
I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait but...
I hear you.
I saw Penny today.
You talked to her?
So close.
Just a few weeks from a real audible connection.
I'm gonna ask...
Oh my God!
Is that from the league?
"It's from him, that's his seal, isn't it?"
The leader?
Oh my God!
I got a letter from Bad Horse!
That's so hardcore.
"Bad Horse is legend, he rules the league with an iron hoof."
"He's a singer, sings in two voices."
Male and female.
- What?
Kitchen Kumar.. how are you?
Where did you get these new set of teeth from?
"Kundan, what a surprise."
- Mala.
Bhikhu.
Where did this duet come from?
I didn't know that Kundan is also going to be here.
"How are you, brother Kundan?"
Mala.
Kishen.
- Mona.
"I am no longer Mona, but Ma Jogeshwari."
You've named a railway station after you.
Since when?
How did you stay with Kitchen Kumar so long?
What can I do?
I thought about it several times.
But its not right to throw the master out of the house.
- What?
Who is he?
"Kundan, he's my son."
Bunty.
But he is very good looking.
Like father like son.
You?
Look handsome?
- I was joking.
You only appear to be.
And that's regretting as well.
Am I looking like a mad person?
No.
The marriage will take place at the decided moment.
The bride will come.
Kasi will bring her.
We share the same blood.
"Boss, Kasi has come."
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
Kasi has come.
Shailaja has come.
Kasi!
Kasi!
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
I know that you will bring her.
You are a true brother.
Tell me where she is.
Brother!
You made me your younger brother.
You also gave me everything.
But I could not do what you wanted.
I came here because he spared my life.
I dont want such a life.
I dont want this life.
No.
Give it to me.
I am telling you.
Get up.
What are you saying?
Are you mad?
"Uncle, he says that he wants to die."
"Aunty, he says that he wants to die."
"Hey, dont die."
"Don't say anything to Cemre, okay?"
Don't let her know.
Or I won't forgive you.
"Okay abla, don't worry."
You said Cemre wasn't going to come.
It seems she changed her mind.
- Hello Sami Amca.
- Hey Cemre.
I thought you wouldn't come.
"I didn't mean to disappoint you, but... here I am."
Let me help.
- Let me help you.
- A moment.
"Could you hold these, Cemre?"
My hand is empty.
- I'll take them back.
- I could help you till the door.
"No no, you give them to me."
You can go sit in the car if you want.
Don't worry about us.
Go see your son.
"Right, for 15 minutes or so."
"Sami Amca, can you give these to Kuzey?"
From Demet and me.
Put in my pocket.
And this is my letter.
- Okay.
- Say him hello from us.
- I will.
- Kiss Kuzey for me.
Let's get in the car if you want.
"Thank you, I'm fine here."
"Just give him the freaking ""malk""."
[Josh]
You guys aren't even saying the same thing.
[Julian]
"We're all saying ""melk"", Josh!"
[Josh]
No!
"You're saying ""melk""!"
"You're saying ""malk""!"
(Yelling versions of milk)
[Josh]
Shut up!
Shut up!
[Donovan]
You better put it down.
[Julian]
"Don't do it, Josh!"
[Josh]
"You're going to shoot me, if I shoot myself?"
That doesn't even make any sense!
[Donovan and Julian]
"Josh, put it down!"
Put the gun down!
(Yelling at each other to put the gun down)
[Josh]
I'm going to kill myself over this!
[Julian]
You're like a brother to me!
Your head is like a brother to me!
(Screaming)
[Josh]
"And then, after that, we pull the trigger."
You only have to sign your name.
Don't even have to read it.
Would you help...
No?
How about you?
- Will you lend a caring hand... - Ah!
What?
I was wondering if I could just...
Hey!
I know you.
Hello.
You know me.
Cool!
"I mean... yeah, you do."
Do you?
From the laundromat.
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice last month you skipped a weekend.
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.
"I mean, I've seen you."
Billy is my name.
I'm Penny.
What are you doing?
Hmmm... texting.
Very important or I would stop.
What are you doing?
"Actually, I'm out here volunteering for the Caring Hands homeless shelter."
Can you spare a minute?
Hum...
"Okay, go."
We're hoping to open a new location soon.
Expand our efforts.
"What do you mean, it can't?"
Then name me three philosophers.
What a joke!
You wouldn't even know them if I did...
"Jacques Lacan,"
"Gilles Deleuze, Claude Levi- Strauss."
Herbert Marcuse.
Miss Dewdrop.
You're so cool.
Even pretty and smart.
I want to go back to school again!
- It's awkward.
- I like it.
Wait.
Now what?
It's ridiculous.
We've just met.
You don't seem like the man I've been talking with.
Yes.
I'm that man.
Your first kiss in 8th grade.
"First sex with your husband, age 19."
In someone else's car.
After drinking two cups of soju.
What kind of a man remembers only those details?
That's what men are like.
I know that but...
I liked you because you seemed different.
I thought we'd talk a lot.
Again talk.
What talk!
You're driving me crazy.
Klaus told me to do it and I said no.
"And then, it just happened anyway."
Like it was completely out of my control.
That's why I had your mom call him.
Daddy?
"Hi, Caroline."
"I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond."
Can you help him?
I'm going to try.
Why?
Because he made a mistake.
And now he wants to make good.
And I understand that.
Do you want anything else?
A beer?
"Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes."
And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor.
"Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are."
Angry.
Oh.
Thanks for lunch.
"Yeah, sure."
"Ah, so, um, next time, dinner?"
"Yeah, that would be great."
Cool.
Take care.
Bye.
Thanks.
Who's that?
My doctor.
She's a doctor?
Ooh.
"Wow, no way."
None
You're wearing a gold necklace today.
Today's fashion is...
This is being filmed.
Why does that matter?
Zelo says his socks are a 'miss' to his fashion today.
So he doesn't want to be filmed.
- Super star Zelo!
"- No, no."
Stop filming.
"Are you playing the ""solitude game""?"
"This must be the ""solitude game"" you enjoy."
How'd you know that?
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
"Dog, you say, ruff!"
It's not a Korean dog.
You're not a Korean dog but hand!
Hand!
"Don't do that, don't do that."
Right.
"Dog will... hand, hand."
I told you not to do that.
This does connect to usb.
- I bought a few LP's too.
- He bought LP's!
- There are more LP discs in Korea.
- I gotta go to Chung-gye-cheon now.
"Finally, we head to our first MV shooting."
None
"- Hey, gimme the room key."
Here we go.
I got to fix my finger.
NARRATOR:
It looks like Lee cut himself and he might be bleeding
Lee:
"Slow down, Lee."
Slow down.
You're going too fast.
You got plenty of time.
Broken in small bits.
"If it's big, it ain't going to get cooked."
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Yeah, if you got blood in the food then you, you can't serve that, you know."
Lee:
Still bleeding a little bit.
"Now you all, we are ready here."
This...
NARRATOR:
"Hold up, guys."
Hold up.
Lee.
Lee:
You got it.
NARRATOR:
"Looks like you cut yourself while you were cooking there, brother."
Lee:
Yes.
NARRATOR:
Let me see that.
Lee:
Right on top of the thumb.
NARRATOR:
We can't take a chance with blood being in this food and the Cub Scouts eating it.
Give us dinner.
You can go up now.
"Ha Ni, you finished everything too?"
"Yes, I'll finish up the rest."
"Okay, then it's a favor."
Good night.
Ha Ni.
Welcome.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I want to drink some water.
"Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet."
"This time, you helped with a lot of things."
Thank you.
Punk.
He has some cuteness to him.
You were here.
I guess I ended up moving back in.
Just don't get in the way.
Okay.
"Ah, you came?"
Why are you still here and not leaving?
I was going to go after finishing this.
Go upstairs first.
"Ha Ni, go up."
"Ha Ni, wait."
"Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success."
Yeah.
"Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?"
"I knew it would be like that, so I made these."
"Sit down, sit down."
"Father, sit down please."
Here.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying.
I wanna be here.
Then be here.
"Look at you, Peter."
Your grades have been steadily declining.
You're late for class.
You always appear exhausted.
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.
I know.
I'm planning to write it on Dr. Otto Octavius.
Planning is not a major at this university.
Octavius is a friend of mine.
"Better do your research, Parker."
"Get it done, or I'm failing you."
Surprise!
"Well, say something."
Whas the occasion?
"Really, Peter."
Is your birthday!
Whether you want to remember it or not.
He lives in another reality.
"Don't you, Pete?"
"Hi, M.J. Hi."
"Hey, buddy."
Hey.
"Long time, no see."
So how's the play?
I read a great review.
Is going fine.
Is going good.
She's brilliant in it.
How would you know that?
Because--
"Because we were gonna get married, that's how."
He ever talk about going back to Greece?
All the time.
It was just talk.
He never meant to go.
Think he could have killed him for the passport?
He's been running for two years.
That could change a man.
But why?
"Why the passport if he had the car and $8,000?"
( sighs ) This whole killing thing is hard to buy.
"From everything I can learn, they were friends."
Not no more.
They had a fight.
"Well, Gus found out"
I went into Johnny's room.
Johnny made me go.
"Oh, sure."
( dials phones )
Is this Gus' handwriting?
I wouldn't know.
Hello.
Who is this?
North Shore Clinic.
"Uh, this is the police."
"Will you check something for me, please?"
I'd like to know if you've given a smallpox vaccination to a Gus Priamos recently.
"Uh, Priamos."
P-R-I-A-M-O-S.
This morning?
"From the land of Mathura, where else?"
Glory to Sri Kanji Lalji Mehta.
Glory to you.
As long as people believe in toys like this.. ..our business will prosper.
Kanji.
"This is the God's idol, don't call it a toy."
The Lord is only a delusion.
"- Yes, let's go."
lsn't that Chintu?
Yes.
"Yes, that's him."
- Yes.
Yes.
He's dancing so well.
I'll put an end to all this.
Shut down the shop and get the scooter.
- Yes.
Come on.
- Kanji.
- Yes.
Look after my shop for a month.
Why?
- I'm going on Haj.
I suggest that you get your shop fixed.. ..rather than going on a Haj.
God save me from devils.
Your shop will come crashing down even if anyone sneezes.
Let's go.
- Coming.
Feed them worth 10 rupees.
- Okay.
"Let's go, let's go."
Glory to.. - Siddeshwar Maharaj.
Whoa.
*(revving engine)*
Aah!
Principal Cooper?
Can you believe these people don't separate their paper from plastic?
"Egbert, down, now."
Just doing... my part to save the environment.
"Liz, wake up."
You've got to help me with my stories.
Your stories?
Don't tell me you didn't write them.
Of course I wrote them.
"OK, so maybe I didn't write them."
Jess.
It's not my fault.
I didn't get in until 3:00.
We went to the movies.
All night?
What did you see?
I don't know.
Russ was in the way.
Anyway...
"Liz, please."
Here's the pen.
I'm begging.
Why can't you do it?
I have to put on my makeup.
You've got two hours.
I know.
"It'll be tight, but I can just skip my bikini wax."
"I'm sorry, Jess, but this is your assignment."
You'll have to do it yourself.
Matt:
I can't be the only person that heard that scream.
We're running around down here - Where the fuck are we going?
Connor:
"Matt, calm down."
"If you know where to go, let's hear it."
"If not, shut up."
Connor:
"James, do you know where we can go?"
James:
I think if we go back and left and follow the ring around we can find our way from there...
(Loud bang)
(Growling) (Kate screams)
James:
Kate!
(Bang against door)
James:
We've got to go and get her.
Amy:
You have to listen to me!
"James, listen!"
She's gone!
"You saw those people James, you saw what they did."
Matt:
"Don't just fucking stand there, help!"
(Gas escaping)
(Zombies scream in pain)
Connor:
What's that?!
James:
Freon coolant gas.
Matt:
"What happened to Egghead, Egg-breath,"
"Eggbeater, Eggnog, Egg-brain?"
Egg salad?
Good one.
Ha-ha!
"Winston, this thing between us is getting out of hand."
"I play a trick on you, you try to get me back."
The anger we're building up here could scar us for life.
"Here, let me get that."
Sit.
"Now, as I was saying,"
I think we should try to live together peacefully.
"You know, let bygones be bygones."
"Have you suffered a severe trauma of the head recently, Bruce?"
What a kidder.
"Right, Manny?"
Yeah.
Truce?
(snorts)
This is nice.
"Hi, guys."
See ya.
"Whoa, Eggman, she wants you."
You think?
Yeah.
Go talk to her.
*(fabric rips)*
"What's the matter, Egghead?"
Butt too heavy?
"Aw, gee, empty."
Someone must've spilled glue all over the bench.
"Tough break, Eggplant."
"I don't know, the overrides aren't working."
Kate:
I haven't got any signal!
Matt:
"We're a hundred metres underground, what do you expect!"
(Console alarm sounds)
James:
The radiation levels are spiking.
The shielding's not in place when the maintenance tunnels are open.
Matt:
Well why the fuck not?!
James:
This shouldn't be able to happen.
Connor: ...Shit!
Connor:
We've got less than two minutes and we're fried.
We've got to get out!
Kate:
What about the people in the tunnels?
Matt:
What about us!
James:
Fuck!
James:
It's locked down!
Connor:
"James, calm down and think."
How do we get out?
James:
We go into the service tunnels.
Matt:
The tunnels?!
Where?
Shigu Town.
So?
"Let him go, and I'll get the snakes out."
"Fine, let him go."
"Stop it, or my head will fall off."
Get the snake out.
Let him go first.
Go.
Hurry.
Now.
"Sikong Xuan, the snake has given birth to little snakes, if you kill me, they will remain in your body, for your whole life."
How about this?
"Let me go, and I'll summon a snake out everyday."
"Lingerh told me to find Xiang Yaocha, what's that?"
A person or a herb?
I have no idea.
"Old man,"
What's Xiang Yaocha?
What?
Xiang Yaocha?
You're looking for Xiang Yaocha?
That's right.
"Sorry, I don't know."
Ask someone else.
Wait.
Hand over your money.
I'll kill you if you make a sound.
"You can take everything you want, except this box."
I must bring this to Xiang Yaocha.
What?
You're a friend of Xiang Yaocha?
They aren't like you.
Wasn't that Jae Hee?
"Who, hyung?"
Why did that guy come here?
"Now, you even sleep out?"
Ah!
"Baek Go Dong, are all the guys here?"
I detest waiting!
I think the guys are here.
Hello! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Subtitles brought to you by The Maid of House 2 Team @Viki.com&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
What is this?
"Uh, did you come?"
Who said you can use our practice room without permission?
So what?
"Man Ok, keep doing it."
This... this is totally cool!
Aren't you practicing?
"All right, I'm leaving now."
Practice.
Go ahead and start.
Where are you going?
Go to the toilet.
Why didn't you come yesterday?
I kept waiting.
That is... something came up.
But I went there at 11 p.m.
Huh?
I was at Playground (Bar) at that time.
That's strange.
I waited till midnight just in case.
Where?
On the swings at the playground.
"-Wait, let me finish."
- Absolutely not.
No way.
-Why are you so worked up?
- Fools...
Don't I have a say in this?
Forget it.
No.
I have a guy already.
"A blind date is the best present, right?"
Really?
You have a boyfriend?
You do?
"115 00:14:46,652 --&amp;gt; 00:14:47,209 Wow..."
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"Yeah, he's good-looking."
How'd she meet a guy like this?
"- They look like a good couple, huh?"
- Right.
"Hey, Sister-in-law!"
Stop!
Stop!
Wait a minute.
Time out!
"Looks ridiculous, huh?"
- It was a mistake!
"Coach, save me!"
- You're dead meat!
"Come here, you bastard!"
"Get over here, you bastard!"
It was a misunderstanding!
The ministry of education requested proper courtesies regarding cell phones.
"And if anything unwanted comes up in the future, get rid of it."
And I'm sorry.
But I can't wear a skirt for you.
"A baby, crying all night."
"This poor mom, who can't do anything for him, other than to cry outside, so that he doesn't hear her."
"All night the baby cries inside the house, and I cry outside..."
"I love you, baby."
Please don't be sick.
I love you mommy.
Please don't be sick.
Why?
Hwi-chan.
Hwi-chan.
You don't need to do that for Mom anymore.
The nurse came and gave her a shot and some pills.
So you don't have to do that.
"No, when Mom did this for me I got well."
Go on.
-What?
-The song.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Mommy's got a pot belly.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Is anyone here?
- Is nobody here?
-We're the rescue team.
"If anyone's here,just yell."
-Anyone here?
-We're the rescue team.
"Ten, this is 101."
- We're fine too.
"- I am fine, son."
- You lost weight.
"- Who, me?"
"No, I think it's just you."
I am as I should be.
- You not eating much?
- I am.
Your mommy brought a lot of nice food.
"I made karnı yarık, börek, mantı."
I made deserts.
You should definitely eat them.
Oh God you didn't have to.
"It is nothing, really."
But don't give all out.
Eat them yourself.
"- Thanks, will do."
- And I brought you cookies and stuff from the bakery.
I left them downstairs.
Eat them as well.
"- Okay, don't worry."
- Don't eat them with an empty stomach.
They might burn your tummy.
Don't listen to her.
You can eat them safely.
"Okay, don't argue at least here."
- Everyone alright?
"- They are, thanks to God."
- Güney says hello as well.
- Aleykum selam.
He wanted to come here so much.
But they let only me.
She can carry the whole show.
I'll stake my reputation on it.
"*Good morning, Sweet Valley.* *Today's top story...*"
*Missing school fund discovered.* *After a recent probe...*
"Now, there's our anchor."
"Hi, Russ."
(boy) Out of the way.
Quit shoving!
Editorial!
"Yes, the Patman does it again."
"What's it feel like to be a loser, Egg-wad?"
There's no justice!
"Yes, I got anchor!"
Yes!
I got the Fashion Forecast.
Taste finally arrives at Sweet Valley High.
(girl) I know.
She's gonna be great.
"(boy) Oh, well..."
*(boy #2)* OK...
"So, Russ, looks like we'll be working some long hours together."
It'll be my pleasure.
"Well, that's a start."
Jessica and Lila got on and I didn't?
There must be some mistake.
Maybe you should talk to Mr. Collins.
"OK, news team, come get your story assignments."
Go on.
I will.
Go get your assignment.
I'll be fine.
"You did an exceptional job, Jessica."
Go!
Father.
"Canglong, are you an animal?"
Lingerh.
Mother.
Shut up.
"If I get angry,"
I'll eat up all your hearts.
Canglong.
We're guests here.
How could you be so rude to Miss Zhong?
Down.
Wake up.
Where are we?
Caught by the Yellow Robe Man and brought here.
Right.
"You've sucked up the Red Python's blood, and you're endowed with ""Red Dragon Soul""."
Climb up and look around.
"Maybe you can break the top, and we can escape."
I'll try.
The cover is very strong.
I can't break it.
Senior.
Is Tuan Zhengchun coming for his children?
Of course.
I've brought them here... as bait for Tuan Zhengchun.
Chief Zhong has a giant gorilla in the chamber.
"After it has eaten Tuan Yu, it will be a very powerful beast."
No one can fight it.
Not even the Yi Yang Finger... can tackle it.
We can get rid of his whole family.
Only then I'd have vent my anger.
Do you remember what he looked like?
About 35.
Dark.
Nice-looking.
"Uh, thanks."
Thanks very much.
A boat would be too slow.
Check out the airlines.
Right.
One of them has a booking for Gus Priamos.
Find the person who sold him the ticket and make an identification.
See that your men have pictures with them.
We've got no pictures of Priamos.
You've got pictures of Kimble.
( dramatic theme playing )
I keep thinking about it.
Keeps coming up in my throat.
"Ah, you think too much."
"If Gerard wasn't there, where is he?"
Someplace.
What do you care?
"He's going to get a message from the captain, he's gonna come running like crazy."
And he's going to be late.
And you're on your way to Greece.
You're on your way to Greece.
Yeah.
But he thinks it's you.
"Hey, Johnny."
We're here.
"You know what to do, Gus."
You betcha.
( tense theme playing )
Because you are the future of Egypt

Out of my way!
What're you doing here?
Your Queen needs you on guard!

Not here?

"It doesn't matter, he's safe"
"Listen to me, Mardian"
Caesarian is in grave danger
That's not it!
Don't you know me?
In that extremely degraded place!
Ah!
I don't know.
I feel leery!
I feel leery!
Hey!
Doesn't my body smell?
Huh?
"Hey, Baek Go Dong!&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Try to smell it."
"Ah, hyung-nim!"
Speed up!
I have to go quickly and wash it off.
Sauna!
Sauna!
You can't go home right now.
Why?
Tae Ik hyung-nim
left for the practice room.
He kept saying he won't let you go if you are late.
Seriously!
I said speed up!
"Anyway, the one that came out best..."
I think is this one.
What do you want?
I don't expect anything big.
The commercial that Won Kang Kwi is shooting again.
"If you hand it over to me, &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;I'll keep my mouth shut."
Just for a commercial you go through all this trouble?
"At a cheap motel, with a guy partner..."
Isn't the combination extreme for a Hallyu star like Won Kang Hwi?
"-No, your ideas are always this unoriginal and half-baked."
-[scoffs]
"Well, you know what?"
I wasn't thinking of going with that idea anyway.
I was thinking that we should just--
"-Haunt people and, while they're distracted, just steal their money?"
-Stop it!
"Yes, let's just do that."
"-Sweet, high five!"
-Whoa!
[groans]
Ow!
"All right, Old Man Blumpkin's house."
"-Yeah, but be easy on the old guy, okay?"
You know he's got that heart condition.
[gun cocks]
-What are you two turds doing in my house?
-Old Man Blumpkin?
-How can you see us?
Only ghosts can see other ghosts.
"-Duh, a--hole."
I just died.
-Ohh.
"-Wait, what did you just say?"
-Ohh.
"-No, the thing before that."
-Only ghosts can see other ghosts?
-But then... that means...
-You don't remember... do you?
"Last week, when you were driving..."
-No.
-There was an accident.
Radha's alliance is fixed with Jimmy!
There's a call from Singapore.
Talk to him.
Hello!
Yes!
- Hello!
"- Mr. Singh, Jimmy here."
Did you receive my marriage invitation?
"Yes, I did."
And I'm the happiest person to see this card.
Shreekant is not only yours... ...but my relative too.
"That's why I fixed this alliance, partner."
"You are coming to Bombay, right?"
"Not only me, all of us will come in your procession."
Along with the band party.
- I understood.
And I also want to see one more relative.
"Mr. Jackie, don't drink so much."
For God's sake.
Please.
Mr. Bharat?
You?!
"Come... come, sit, Mr. Bharat!"
Jaikishan!
I came to know everything.
"You want to drink, right?"
Go on... drink... drink more.
You came to know?
Drink more.
I'll drink...
I'll drink more and more.
So much that all my blood will get vomited.
You tell me.
He family has abandoned him?
"I've had tried call them, but they denied knowing him."
Moon.
What?
"Hello, Ms.Lee."
Brother is looking for us.
I've got Mr Lee here.
Go ahead and I'll join you later.
See you arroud.
Ms Lee.
Where're you going?
School.
So this is the place.
"What's your old lady, cutie?"
She is out.
Really?
Come in and find out yourself.
Sure I will.
Look at you!
You should be in school!
Look at your nails!
You think you're madonna?
Where's your mom?
"She went play mabjong, I guess."
She has the money to play mabjong but not the money to pay what she owes us?
How much do we owe your bom?
A few thousand dollars are no big deal.
Just the inerest alone will cost you a lifetime to repay.
A few thousand will soon turn into tens of thousands... ...which will then became hundreds of thousands.
Here is 500 bucks.
"My father owed you $5,000."
Fuck Prince.
"Because it would have like, doves and sheer scarves."
TED LEO:
"I think it would anti-climactic, you know?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Well, no-one's going to climax."
I feel like there would be a lot of whispering.
TED LEO:
"I feel like there would be all this lead up to it, and then you'd actually get down to it--"
BETH HOYT:
"And he'd just be like, missionary, and it would be over?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, right?"
TED LEO:
Yeah.
"And he's really little, you know."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
He is really little.
BETH HOYT:
Cee-Lo might be the one to have sex with.
TED LEO:
That's what I'm saying.
BETH HOYT:
Because he's a giver.
"Do you watch ""The Voice?"" He really, like, is into, I think he might give just the right amount."
"Like, not Sting give, but--"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I would do what I had to do to meet that cat.
That white cat he holds on that show.
BETH HOYT:
That's what he's saying.
What?
"Yes, I believe we are."
Close friends...
It's hot!
Then can I ask you a favor as a father of your friend?
"Yes, of course."
"Got 30,000 won with you?"
"Just 30,000 won."
Pardon me?
I saw a pair of sneakers perfect for Ji-hwan.
"I'm short 30,000 won."
I'll pay you back right away.
Can you lend me that money?
Sure.
Thanks a lot!
"I ask you as a father of your friend... keep this a secret, okay?"
"Yes, a secret!"
Quiet!
I worry about you and your life.
Not everyone can become Jackie Chan.
Heard from somewhere that he fell unconscious five times and has metal parts all over his body.
My goal is to fall unconscious six times and be a Robocop!
Ouch!
That really hurts!
A Robocop!
You're Robocop!
"Dad, Dal-rae's killing your son!"
Dal-rae?
"He deserved it, right?"
Of course.
Take her away Young-hoon!
Don't come back here again!
How can he be so filthy!
Audience:
Yes.
AB:
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
We can do it that way.
"Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that."
I brought with me a book of calendars.
"It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know."
(Laughter)
"I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there."
(Laughter)
"Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind."
This is a book of calendars.
Who wanted to know their birth day?
"What year was it, first of all?"
Audience:
1966.
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.
And what month?
Audience:
April.
AB:
April what?
Audience:
17th.
I believe that was a Sunday.
"Can you confirm, Chris?"
Chris Anderson:
Yes.
AB:
So should you.
I'm going with you to that wharf tomorrow.
Jesus Christ.
They crash our pub.
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.
"Matt, listen to me."
It's time to go home.
I don't know where my home is anymore.
I think we both know where it ain't.
"Mate, this is my fight."
It's my brother in the hospital.
I'll take care of Tommy.
"Go home, mate."
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
They reach the sky
And like--
"You're doing the right thing, Matt."
Yeah.
"You know that back home, nobody's gonna care about your rep here."
"You know that, right?"
I'm gonna call a cab.
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.
Come on.
"This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501, at Brixton Road."
Disturbance...
The cab's on its... ...way.
When did you return?
Years passed in your waiting.
"Sister-in-law, look who's standing in front of us."
Till now we had seen him just in a photo.
Today we saw him personally.
Who... - We're... - Mr. Jimmy.
"You know inspector Damodar Mathur, right?"
Just shut up!
Talk about Radha.
- No!
Wait!
I'm Damodar's wife.
- Damodar?!
"Oh, sister-in-law!"
"Hello, sister-in-law!"
- Hello!
How's Damodar?
Few months before he wrote me that he... ...is very fine and become fat now.
"You are very naughty, son."
Letters must be sent by Radha... ...and you are talking about Damodar?
"Right, sister-in-law?"
He's trying to fool us.
"This isn't right, son."
You came to India but you didn't inform us.
Radha has gone mad.
- Radha?
"Yes, our Radha!"
- What?
"So, are you surprised seeing your in-laws, Mr. Son-in-law?"
Now let's go home now.
- Home?!
Radha will be happy.
How do I explain to him?
Yes.
"Watch, watch."
"Look, this is you."
And this is Mala
And this is..
And this is me.
Here's your money.
I would prefer dying.. than do this.. with Mala.
Kishen.
Kishen.
"You're trying to ruin my life, Kishen."
Kishen!
If you make Mala fall for you. ..then I will give you 5000 rupees.
I had a wager with my friends that you can make Mala fall for you.
And if that happens then I will win the bet of 10000 rupees.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Let's run away!
"Marriage ceremony is over, Mr. Jackie."
- Hey...
Jackie!
- Yes.
Pasha's letter for you.
"Jackie, I've raised you."
And given you a new life.
But today my life is in danger.
On the statement of retired IG Mr. Shreekant Mathur... ...to the court on 25th September I can get death penalty.
You must stop him from giving his statement to the court.
Oh... sorry.
Amy:
"Listen, I'd better go."
I've got a lot of work to do.
Amy:
(Sighs) I'm so tired.
I can't even think about work right now.
Amy:
I hope he doesn't expect me to remember anything.
Dr. Niven:
Ah Lisa.
Did you finish your talk?
Lisa:
Yeah!
Just in time.
Dr. Niven:
I had every confidence in you.
Amy:
Did you get a chance to look at my simulation?
Dr. Niven:
Ah yes!
The problem with the supersymmetric parameter lattice...
Dr. Niven:
I think I found a way to express it differently.
Dr. Niven:
I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.
Amy:
It looks more complex though.
I don't know if it'll work on my laptop.
Dr. Niven:
"Well, we'll deal with that later if we need to."
Amy:
How... you know this better.
At present he's celebrating festival at Khandala...
"Your father, Pasha."
Santo!
Raghu!
Kali!
Badal!
God!
Who are you trying to threaten by firing in the air?
Those days of threatening and firing have gone.
Now I'm only a retired IG.
- Uncle!
- Yes.
Uma sent this photo for you.
Wow!
Dear father!
Your darling daughter Radha!
Did you see?
This time my daughter left me... ...for her college youth festival.
"Thank God, your darling sister is here."
"Sandhya, it's right that Jamna is my sister."
But reason her widows are not supposed to have long tongue.
Even I don't like it.
But she's a widow.
"So, I can't even say anything to her."
"Shanti, where's Jamna?"
Sitting in the backyard.
Reading a holy book.
Mother!
Aunt is calling you.
"You go, my son."
I'm coming.
What the f did I tell you?
The bandaid on the back of your neck?
The briefcase.
MALE SPEAKER:
No.
MALE SPEAKER:
"Oh, jeez."
Just another day at the office.
-I told you Porno Pictionary was the way to go.
"-Hey, why don't we kick it up a notch and make this into a swingers party?"
"-Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
-I choose Nancy.
-What?
-That little filly.
-What are you talking about?
-For the swingers party.
"I thought we were choosing up, like draft picks."
No?
-No.
"That was a joke, Steve."
BETH HOYT:
"OK, open comments is coming up as soon as I get your questions in for Ted and Julie in the chat."
"First of all, you didn't think we were going to spend half an hour with Ted Leo, and not get him to perform a song for us, did you?"
"What are you playing for us, Ted?"
TED LEO:
"Uh, I'm, I don't need to talk into this, do I?"
BETH HOYT:
Do it for fun.
For effect.
TED LEO:
I am going to play a new song that is yet untitled for now.
"So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along."
"Hello, Eun Jo!"
You came again?
"Go Ri, hello!"
"It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!"
That's right.
"Hello, No Ri!"
Hello.
I brought cake to give to you.
"So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?"
"No Ri, No Ri!"
I'm sorry.
I'm not that smart.
"No, it's okay."
"Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun."
"But, it's fun and nice here."
"No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?"
"Yes, about 1 year and 2 months."
"So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade."
Really?
"Then, I'll teach you your homework."
You're going to teach him?
Do you think that makes sense?
He's an elementary school student.
So rash.
Dummy how can you?
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.
Really?
It's going to be more harmful than anything.
Let's just eat the cake.
Thank you.

- Is Güney Bey here?
- No.
- Tell me when he is.
"- Yes, sir."
Has the vendor come?
"You bought some hair conditioner, too?"
"Okay okay, good."
I took my time when those two appointments were canceled.
Maybe I shouldn't come to the shop today if there's no customers.
"I'm home, yes."
You call me if you need me.
"Okay dear, kolay gelsin."
Why don't you take a break.
- Your coffee is getting cold.

There's a lot of ironing to do as well.

Don't worry.
"What is wrong, abla?"
- He's dead.

"Which one, the one with the picture?"
Who is he?
Abla?
Someone you know?
"""Son of deceased Ibrahim and Hatice Gencerel..."""

The gap in performance at elementary schools is rising.

"Due to the high atmospheric pressure from the southwest, the heat wave..."
And that's fine.
I understand that.
Bobby:
Dad's fault.
Cathy:
"If it's because you're scared to go upstairs by yourself or downstairs by yourself, just tell me that."
Bobby:
I will.
Sometimes... [speaking indistinctly]
And stop videotaping!
Cathy:
Bobby... man:
I was gonna give you a camera too.
Cathy:
"We're gonna do a project-- a family project, okay?"
Can we all agree to do the family project?
"If not, then we can't do it. man:"
Do you want a camera?
Cathy:
Okay?
Bobby:
What? man:
Do you want a camera to videotape me?
Bobby:
Mm-hmm.

Because it's a happy film.

Ms. Eom Ju-young?
I'm from a separation agency.
You know Park Hwi-chan?
I was sent by him.
"I was going to quit this work, but since he's my last client, I came especially for him."
Now...
I'll deliver the message from Mr. Park Hwi-chan.
"Hwi-chan doesn't want to separate from you, Ms. Eom."
This is an unusual case.
Hwi-chan wants you to stand up again.
Who?
Park Hwi-chan.
My son.
Yes...
Your son has one more thing to show you.
And that is...
Didn't he draw it well?
He said he couldn't draw you well before... because you are too pretty.
Are you okay?
"Hwi-chan says he'll do what you say, keep his diary, and won't tell lies anymore, so please..."
Tell my son...
Thank you... for drawing me... so well.
I will.
Mom...
Mom...
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Okay!
What's the time now?

What!
"For a 1 1 O'clock meeting, you wake me up at 12?"
"Don't worry, one hour late in India is okay."
Nonsense!
Now I know why our India has not progressed.
Why?
If wives like you wake up their husbands like me an hour late. . .
India will never progress.
"God, why doesn't London have such wives?"
Why is she screaming?
- What happened to her?
She was shocked.
- Shocked?
Why?
Look down.
My pajamas got left in the blanket.

My complexion won't change even if I take a bath everyday.

Find Ghajini
Kill him
Day before yesterday.
10 am.
From Hiranandani to Andheri Station.
"Yes, I sold that ticket."
What's written behind it?
He paid me with a five hundred note.
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.
"He forgot to take the change... hey, it must be him."
Who...?
This one always forgets.
"Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket, sometimes it's the change."
"At times, he'll go on buying tickets."
He keeps on asking the names of bus stops.
Can you recognise him?
"- Why not... looks a strange sort, keeps his head shaven, has a long scar on the head."
"Every morning at ten, he takes the bus from Hiranandani."
It's nine.
We got an hour to get him.
Come on.
Take camera
Bus 392
There he goes.
Hey...
Damn it.
See you in the canteen after the lecture.
"Excuse me... excuse me, sir..."
Hi sir!
I'm Sunita.
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
Holy shit...

"Yes, I am YU..."
Just answer the damn question!
Who are you?
I have told you!
Are you deaf?
"No, YU is blind..."
"I'm not blind, You blind!"
That is what i just said!
You just said what?
I did not say what i said YU!
And that is what i'm asking you!
- He says he doesn't.
"lf you look at just my feet, I look at least a decade older... probably."
- My feet are really ugly.
- Right.
It's a joke.

Yesterday after filming in Las Vegas
I went back to hotel and slept 3 hours.
So I'm kind of tired right now...
But it's a night in Vegas.
The night is young.
I'll get myself together again.
It's my turn now.
It ripped.
None
Does this even show?
This is called reality.
"I have a lot of parts in ""Hurricane""."
It's a fun song.
It's a fun song but we're dressed like this.
So I should act more gentle...
With class!
Shouldn't I do that?
During overseas tour
We always set a goal as a team.
"lf B.A.P ever gets a vacation, Las Vegas is definitely on our list to visit."
It's over.
My eyebrows move too when I sing.
Thank you.
It's over.
I'm done.
Since I was young
- ln demonology -
- Hey so that you could make it - [ Moans ]
"- - You're really makin' it --** - Hon, can you tell Vic to come on down for supper ?"
- [ Screams ]
Holy shit !
- Shh.
You know there's no lock on your door ? - -- [ Humming ] - [ Moaning ]
-- [ Continues ]
Ohh !
I'm coming !
I'm coming !
-- [ Humming ]
"- Oh, Jim !"
- Dad.
"Hi, I was just looking at the old family portrait out here."
"Well, that was a fun day wasn't it ?"
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Jim, I want to talk about masturbation."
"Now, I just want you to know that it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing."
"And I have to admit, uh, you know."
I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger.
"- I, uh-- I used to call it ""stroking the salami."" - [ Groans ]"
"Yeah, you know, ""pounding the ol' pud."""
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort ?
"He ""pinched the one-eyed snake"" five, six times a day."
"See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game."
You see ?
It's like-- It's like... banging a tennis ball against a brick wall.
Which can be fun.
"It can be fun, but it's not a game."
Yes
CL:
It's scary.
I think it's scary.
CL:
I'm a little nervous about how it will go in front of huge numbers of audience.
CL:
I don't know how I will act when the cameras are turned on.
I have no idea.
I am so nervous that I hardly sleep at night anymore.
KL:
There are still some steps...
D:
A waltz by Camilla and Kristjan
D:
Thank you.
D:
Well Dermot.
DC:
"If you had the nerves, I couldn't see it."
"To be a premiere dance, this is perhaps one of the best I've seen through seven seasons."
DC:
It was elegant.
You have a very nice position.
"And if I should criticize anything the first night, it is to breathe more and get the head a bit more....."
CL:
I didn't breathe at all
DC:
Think about it to next week.
You have to dance and breathe.
"It was a very, very good start."
D:
You go to the hospital everyday?
"So, everyday you're with Baek Seung Jo?"
"Because Mother leaves during the day, it's just us two."
If only Baek Seung Jo's little brother would be hospitalized a little longer.
"Hey, what are you saying..."
No?
What no
"We can see everything, Oh Ha Ni!"
What are you saying?
You're not allowed to fool around with the wheelchairs!
How do you read this?
How much is it?
"Yes, what does it mean?"
How much is this?
Correct.
"Hey guys, let's eat a snack."
What is this?
"Hey, what's the use in knowing that?"
The No Ri that we love
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday!
"No Ri, happy birthday!"
"Eun Jo, congratulations on being discharged."
Thank you.
"Seung Jo hyung and Ha Ni noona, thank you for teaching me."
Okay.
"If there's something you don't know, always call me."
"You know my phone number, right?"
"Yes, I will."
"No Ri, get healed quickly."
"Yes, this kind of disease won't be a problem."
"No Ri,"

[Masood speaking native language] woman:
"Here I am by myself, because my husband is a half a world away, going to work, fighting for us."
What shirt should I wear?
Which one do you think will Phil like better?
Hmm?
Which one do you think?
That one?
Is that one the best?
Masood:
Here is the market in the old city.
"Most foreigners think that it is dangerous to walk around the streets of Kabul, but as you can see, there is no danger... for us, anyway."
woman:
Waiting game.
Waiting game.
[birds chirping]
Masood:
So this is a street that's normally selling birds like this.
They call them lovebirds because they are always kissing each other.
Sharon:
Oh.
Where are you?
Ooh.
Phil:
"Hi, Sharon."
Sharon:
Hi!
Phil:
Hi.
Sharon:
How's it goin'?
Can you see me?
Look forward to it!
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!
Bong(?) Dumplings!
This is called Bong Dumplings.
Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.
I made it after getting special permission from your father.
I'm not sure if it turned out well.
I have one for Father too.
Try it and please critique it.
I was waiting so long for you to come home.
Yeah.
"But, what to do?"
I already ate dinner.
Really?
You already ate?
"Ah, what a waste."
Dad.
Oh.
That...
You did quite a good job on the shape.
Does it really look like that?
"Father, try it once."
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.
Oh.
Joon Gu.
There... um....
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.
"It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back."
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.
We just decided to do it that way.
Just know that.
Okay?
"But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank."
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.
Why?
You do have charisma.
I know I have charisma.
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...
"Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?"
I had written a love letter before.
Letter!
"Wow, why didn't I think of that?"
Letter.
"Aigoo, you should never do that!"
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.
"If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself."
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.
Girls like that the best.
I can't even look at her right.
What do you mean look her in the eyes?
Why?
You can practice.
Here.
Just think that I'm Hae Ra.
Should I?
That won't work.
Why?
You can practice.
Just try it again.
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?
You try.
I'm Baek Seung Jo.
Try it.
Sam!
Look out!
Dad!
No!
Ow!
Your arm's broken.
Ow!
"You scared me, man."
How long have I been out?
Just a few minutes.
Where's Mai Jad?
They took her up to the bridge.
Hold still.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I don't know.
Just kinda made sense.
Ah.
I should've listened to you.
"Going after Chung was stupid, and..."
"Hey, we all make mistakes."
"Yeah, some mistake!"
Look at the fix I got us into.
You gotta learn to be more optimistic.
Look at all the options.

This has got to stop.
Hush!
I shwear that girl looks like Her Grace.
Huh?

"I really AM drunk, I'm seeing things."
She looks just like Dong Yi in the old days.
"Um, I think it's her."
Huh?
It IS her.
But why's she here?
Good question...
What brings you here?
And dressed like this?
I know this is sudden... but I desperately need some information.
About the capital murders?
I've been concerned about them myself.
There's talk that it's the Sword Guild.
That's why I'm here.
To find out who's behind these murders... and if they're the same people that framed the guild before.
The ghetto?
Yes.
"Your father lived there, so the guild's orders came from there."
"All Rio has to do is get his victim safely to shore, grab the flag, and he wins."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Make sure not to let my head go under in case he went under."
I wanted to see where he was at all times.
Stay calm.
I'm here to rescue you.
You're going to be okay.
I got you.
"Just try to kick with me, all right?"
I'm swimming for the finish line.
That's when I see Paul.
Paul:
"I get to the bridge, I look out in the lake,"
I see two swamped canoes and some guy in the middle of the lake splashing around.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" We're almost there, okay?"
Paul:
Calm!
Stay calm!
Everything's coming back to me from my Life Saving merit badge.
Get the person calm in the water before you approach him.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" I got him to the shore."
I pulled him out of the water.
You okay?
"All right, you'll be all right, man."
Teenager:

Masood:
"Afghanistan comes-- the name of my country comes with the conflict, war, suicide attack, and all the negative points that we--I mean hear and listen in the news."
But there is another side of Afghanistan that you don't normally see.
These girls make me feel optimistic about the future of my country.
Phil:
I love you.
Sharon:
I love you too.
Stay safe.
Phil:
"I will, honey."
"You too, okay?"
Sharon:
Okay.

He's a very nice boy.

"Well, I wanted to tell you that he's, um, not-- not just my friend."
He's--he's my boyfriend.
"Um, and it's something that I've wanted to tell you for a while, but I wasn't really sure how you would react, so I was a little nervous to tell you."
Um...
I-I love you too.
Yeah.
I love you too.
"And I'm hoping that-- that maybe you can love Nick too, um, because he's really important to me, so I'm hoping he can be really-- really important to you too."
Yeah.

I shouldn't have lent the room to...

"- Sir, Pasha murdered two men and escaped."
What?
Pasha!
- Pasha escaped?
Joseph!
"- Yes, man."
Don't worry.
We've come to receive you.
Now you'll reach Mr. Daver in Singapore.
Your fake passport is ready.
"I'd suggest, it's not good to delay Radha's marriage now."
But there should be a nice match for her.
What about Mr. Prem Prakash's son?
He's little close in our relations.
But the boy is really nice.
"Even if we keep refusing the alliances, Jackie... ...will not come out of the jail for 2 years."
And it's difficult for us to let Radha... ...remain unmarried for 2 more years.
Its an absolutely lost case.
Gone.
"Oh, yes."
I forgot.
Your old friend has sent a letter.
From Singapore.
- Singapore?
He's Mr. Jimmy Thapa.
"Oh, Jimmy!"
He was my college friend.
Last year he was stuck with some custom problem... ...and I had helped him solve it.
They're Granddad's teeth.
Granddad's teeth.
"So, the sex gods are twins."
- C'est magnifique.
- Marvy.
- But they're not identical.
"- Obviously, Jas."
They're two years above us.
Jackie's got Geography with the one called Tom.
She says he just moved here from London.
London!
I knew they were cosmopolitan.
Apparently their family just opened an organic shop on the high street.
Dishy and nutritious.
"So, G, Tom or Robbie?"
Which brother do you want?
- What about me?
"- El, we saw them first."
That's not fair!
"Ellen, you have to be emotionally sorted to be ready for a boyfriend."
Jas and I are there.
We even devised a snogging scale.
That proves it.
"We have to know ourselves, to see how boys see us."
Can you handle that?
"Okay, so it's time for the Physical Attractiveness Test."
Finished.
You lot are so sweet.
I got mostly eights for everything.
"- So did I. - Me, too."
"Hey, who gave me a four for my nose?"
And look.
- May God give you more.
Afiyet olsun.
"Mehmet, where's our tea?"
"Just kidding, sit down."
Eat your food.
It's Memo's day today.
"Eat all you can, Memo."
That's what I call a börek... ... health be upon your mother's hands.
Eat from that çörek as well.
It's the çörek my dad sells the most.
- I already ate 3 of those.
- Whoa!
"Mmm, this one is delicious as well."
This doesn't look like bakery material tho.
Where is this from?
From a certain çirkin.
"Guys, your letters."
"Good news, we got our letters"
- Rıza.
- Thanks babacan.
- Kuzey Tekinoğlu.
- It's me.
You got a letter from the whole alphabet.
"""Hello Kuzey,"""
"""As I think about the things happened since our last meeting in the bakery..."""

"I wish I could rewind the time and say goodbye in better terms."""
"""Maybe now is time to push our anger aside."
"What do you say?"""
"""I talked with your lawyer."""
"""I told him, I could be your witness if it is seen necessary."""
"""He said Barış's statement is the important one."""
"All right... ""children in costumes orderly proceed to the square."""
And march!
"- Calm down, darling, calm down."
"- Oh, my goodness."
- I'm Vostok Seven...
Transmitting...
"- Tell me, uncle..."
- What?
- Not in vain...
"Was Moscow, bound high in flame..."
Surrendered to the French?
"- Here ""the spectators applaud."" Applaud, everyone!"
- That will do.
"- Greetings to you, our masked comrades!"
We congratulate you on the occasion of the Parents' Day!
"- Parade, halt!"
"One, two!"

Ha Ni went to school already.
We know.
We just thought about So Pal Bok Noodles all of a sudden.
Seafood noodles?
With a lot of fresh raw oyster.
"I got it, i got it!"
Over here!
Two seafood noodles with a lot of fresh raw oyster.
Ooh!
Bong Joon Gu!
Sounds like it's your territory.
"Super charismatic, huh?"
"Right, huh?"
Should I buy Ha Ni a pair of glasses?
"Everyone else says I have charisma, but Ha Ni is the only one that doesn't see it."
"Joon Gu, if you're too pushy, Ha Ni will just get bored."
What...what did you say?
"Bong Joon Gu, you really don't know women."
Do you know why Ha Ni can't stand up against Seung Jo?
Because Seung Jo is cold.
What?
Cold?
"To women, if a man is far away, they want to get closer."
"If they come towards us, we want to run away."
Is that true?
Yeah.
"If you keep it up, she'll dislike you more and more, Bong Joon Gu."
"No, no."
Chef kept talking about being sought after!
So I tried it out...
But it does not really fit the personality
"And I can not play, For hard to reach."

"From the top, from the top, here we go."
-(director) Action!
-It's [hiccup] not...
So let me tell you what cutting edge astronomy looked like not so long ago.
It looked like this.
"First of all, that's just a sketch."
"Somebody stood at a telescope from night after night, incidentally wearing a top hat, sketching what they could see."
"And secondly, they're looking at a single object."
"In this case, it's what was known as a spiral nebula."
An island universe.
"Ah, I see."
- Mommy...
Daddy...
Grandma...
- He's calling for his parents!

But who gets to make all the important decisions?
- Stop worrying so much about it.
"Your life will be so much easier without Inochkin, you'll see."
If you only knew how much bad blood there is between him and Dynin.
- Hah.
"""Bad blood."""
Can you imagine what would happen if I spoiled even a tiny drop of his blood?
- All of comrade Dynin's blood just went bad!
Help!
Tony?

"You must have seen, father."
"Don't get disheartened, my child."
I've told Pundit to fix a date for your marriage with Radha.
Father!
You are God!
You are a great man.
And I'm a thief!

"What's the scoop, Mr. Collins?"
The school's installing a new in-class video system.
"As of next week, Oracle goes broadcast."
Cool.
Lame.
What a great opportunity.
I'm signing up now.

"-Anthony, not all French men are gay."
That sounds a little bit racist.
"-Okay, well, earlier today, he was doing some really questionable things."
"This is the living room, and I'll show you--"
Why are you holding my hand?
-Why would I not?
-Not gay!
-What?
-Not gay!
-What are you doing?
-Looking at gay porn.
"-Not g-- okay, that might be a little gay."
"-Anthony, you can't be so racist."
Just because his culture is different it doesn't mean you can spread lies about his sexual orientation.
-He was looking at gay porn.
-And who doesn't from time to time?
-True.
"-Dude, I gotta go."
I've been looking for French fries for the past five hours and I can't find them anywhere.

"No Ri,"
"Eun Jo, I'm fine."
I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.
I will definitely come over too.
Yes.
You must come.
"Yes, I will definitely come."
No Ri didn't cry... and he held it in really well.
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before.
Even though he's sad too.
"Eun Jo, we're going."
Eun Jo!
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!
"Ha Ni, you came back well!"
"Dad, what is all this?"
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt... and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.
Dad.
"Up til now, the upstairs room... was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?"
"Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family."
Welcome Ha Ni.
(Seung Jo's) Mother.
Yeah.
"Welcome back, Ha Ni!"
"Thank you, Ahjushi."
Then what about my room?
Your room is with your brother.
No!
I don't want to give up my room again.
You need to say thank you to your noona.
No.
I just did what I had to do.
I'm tired.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6?
"Same as she did, OK."
You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear.
Volunteer:
"0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4."
I think you left out the number 3?
AB:
That's three.
"The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:"
10 to the fourth power.
"OK, any six of them."
(Laughter)
"Really scramble them up this time, please."
Volunteer:
"2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2."
Did you leave out the number 7?
And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
"For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries,"
I have one more question for the audience.
"By any chance, does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on?"
"If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand."
"Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first."
"What year was it, first of all?"
That's why I pick a gentleman first.
Audience:
1953.
"1953, and the month?"
November what?
23rd -- was that a Monday?
"61 going once, 61 going twice."

Let's hit it!
This is your day to take stock and congratulate yourselves.
"You have successfully completed one of the major steps in life's long journey, and you've done it at one of the outstanding educational institutions in the world."
"Over 50 years ago, I sat before you, the class of 1958."
"Since I've put my 50 years in, it's time for a little bit advice."
Exercise your passion.
Seek out what turns you on.
Find something where you really enjoy what you do every morning.
Could she have gone there for another reason?
Why do you always think aboutthe worst and ugliest possibilities?
"- Abla, you are being over optimistic.- Come on, please."
Don't we all know Meltem?
What are you talking about Hilmiye...
"Tell me, didn't we know our own kids?"
Nothing surprises me anymore.
- Nothing...- Selim will be devastated if he learns about it.
- Don't tell him anything about it.- Of course we can't say such a thing to him.
Shall we change the music?
"- It's my turn now.- Floor is yours, abi."
"- Good evening, Fatmagül Ilgaz?- She's there."

You don't see that often elsewhere.
Horses on the streets.
This place sure is humongous.
The trees are enormous and the streets are wide.
It's one thing that stands out about America.
This place is so big I feel like I'm in a giant's forest.
Dae Hyun is a natural at acting.
This place is Central Park.

I took a picture over there by the fountain.

No matter how costly a set is it's incomparable to nature.

Neždet. her sisteranswered the phone?
I spoke with her
"Kader Altun,of all those letters that you sentto your son, are missing, right?"
"Maybe theylost in the mail,"
It probably happenedBefore I sent them to my niece in Trabzon. did you ever mention in any of these lettersyour relationship withmr.
Sulejman?
Never!I never mentioned it
"Nazif from Trabzonwas very honored one . to tell him about my relationshiplt would hurt him,and also make him so angry."
"How can we comprehend,you have not to mention it To protect Suleiman's life?"
"Not at all,"
I did not writebecause it was inappropriate...
In the town where I'm fromthey do not accept easilythis kind of relationship.
Maybe Nazif Kara learned about your relationship from someone else?Is that possible?
Maybe some offriend or relative?
No.Nobody knewabout our relationship.
"Many years passedsince I escapedfrom his family,"
"That's why I changed the name,I never used the name Kader,only Nihan"
So I couldnot be found.
mrs.
"Kader,you came to the court on the day of the murder.Why did you come?"
That was the day ofMahir engagement...
I wentand saw my son from a distance...
It is so difficultfor a mother not to benear her only sonon such a beautiful day.
I stood thereas a foreigner...
Then I wentby Suleiman cryand share my pain with him.
Suleiman was alwaysvery compassionate and promised to help meto meetwith my son...
He promised me he would call Mahirand called him to come totalk to him.
"Wait a minute,just a little bit..."
So that was the reasonwhy Suleiman sent the policeto bring in Mahir Kara that day?
I do not know...but I think so...
He promised to call him... mr.
"Judge,This explains everything!Nazif Kara went instead Mahir to prevent the mother to meet her son forever"

"Mind you Mitya, don't touch these pills!"

"Wow, That's great!"
Yeah-yeh.
If you'd eat one you'd immediately turn to stone.
Why didn't YOU turn to stone?
Only children turn to stone For grown-up it's just a cure for the common cold.
Will it turn dogs to stone too?
"Yes, Mitya, It will, very much so."
What do you want?
So that's the picture for a two by two system.
"And if the right-hand side B happened to be twelve seven,"
then of course the correct solution would be one two.
Okay.
"So let me come back next time to a systematic way,"
"using elimination, to find the solution, if there is one,"
"to a system of any size and find out -- because if elimination fails,"
find out when there isn't a solution.
"Okay, thanks."

but we like L A LAW.
"We like, that."
Right.
"So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it."
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at medical school in San Antonio right now."
"Oh, great."
So.
Great.
Yeah.
"Well, like I said, good luck to you."
Thanks.
"All right,"
"well, um, take care,"
and maybe we'll meet up again some time.
All right.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
"My name is, uh, Donna Donahue,"
"and I live in Plano, Texas."
Hi.
"My name is Lowell,"
"and I live in Raleigh, North Carolina."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, do you want to start"
or should I start?
Go right ahead.
"Okay, um,"
I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in.
"We have, um, three children,"
"and, um, they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports, soccer and baseball"
"and so,"
"Oh, yeah."
Right now it's terrible isn't it?
"It's, yeah, it's really bad."
Yeah.
"But, uh, it's going pretty well"
"and I've got a real good plan mapped out here,"
so.
Uh-huh.
I also like long-term Christmas club you know.
"I used to belong to a Christmas club,"
last year I didn't.
Uh-huh.
"Then, so then, naturally, Christmas comes along"
"and that puts you behind too, you know."
"So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my  checking account for my Christmas club."
"Oh that's,"
Yeah.
"So I figure, you know, that's going to help some."
That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time.
"That'll,"
"yeah,"
"Yeah,"
"right, you know."
"That'll be good,"
yeah
"most people are spending three or four months you know, at least, digging out after Christmas"
so.
"Right,"
right.
And I'm
"Yeah,"
"Last week going to the airport,"
I just hit a downpour
and I was on a highway going like eighty.
So I really did.
I mean I was soaking wet.
I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
Whoops.
"But it all dried out, you know. Didn't  take long when the sun came out"
Yeah.
but it was kind of funny.
I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it
"but,"
Oh. No I was just down in Austin last week
and the weather was pretty nice too.
"So,"
Oh
"and wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"With the Bluebonnets out,"
yeah.
It really was.
Yeah
I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.
is Yeah.
A lot of people say that
and it's pretty far from where I live
I'm ready if you are.
Okay.
"Um, where do you stand, uh, on,"
"Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them."
"Especially  if they go hunting,"
"Oh, you grew up in Orlando."
Uh-huh.
"That's, uh, that's interesting, Well, I was in submarines. Uh,"
"Well, that's what I worked on."
"Okay,"
"yeah,"
"must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there."
when did you retire?
The end of last month.
"Well, great."
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.
I certainly have
Yeah.
"So, I hate to, uh,"
"I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,"
"but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh,"
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
"Where's,"
How do you like Chinese food?
"Oh, we, we do enjoy that."
"Yes, sir."
"Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,"
"we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant"
and then we usually stick by it.
"But do you,  What about you?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food."
Hot?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I have a personal computer at home.
It's an A T compatible.
I don't use it very much any more.
I used to use it quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.
"I do some P C stand alone work on it,"
and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
Do you own a computer?
"Um, well I sort of own a computer."
"We have two P C at home,"
but neither one do we really own. Um.
Are you leasing them?
"No,"
"both of them are sort of work related,"
"and,"
Loaners from work?
"Yeah,"
"that's the nicer way, right."
Do you work for T I?
"No,"
no.
"Um, I, actually I'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby,"
"and my husband's working at Bell Labs,"
"but he's really from France,"
and these computers actually are from France.
What brand are they?
One of them's a Compaq
Uh-huh.
it's a three eighty-six
"Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE"
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, she comes on later"
"and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess."
Oh.
"I did watch soap operas,"
"but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,"
Yeah
"and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?"
That's right
They're stupid
Yeah.
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
Uh-huh.
But not anymore.
That can happen.
"So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?"
"Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS."
"Oh, that's always fun."
"Yes,"
I like that show.
Yeah.
"And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then."
"Oh, uh-huh."
And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
"Oh, yeah."
So
Uh-huh.
"It's exciting,"
"we're winning,"
so that's really exciting.
"Yeah,"
"we're from more, uh, from sort of towards the shore, central  New Jersey, you know,"
Okay.
"we're like, uh,"
"Well, that's nice, too."
"Yeah,"
"oh yeah,"
"it was beautiful,"
"that's why I, I really miss it."
"I, I don't really like it here at all"
"Really,"
"yes,"
"my wife's been away for twenty-five years,"
so she's been away for quite a while.
Uh-huh.
"Her dad was from Little Rock, Arkansas,"
"and her mother was from New York,"
so they just they over there in New Jersey.
"Yeah,"
"so they,"
Yeah
"Uh, and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your privacy,"
"but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just all the solicitors calling."
"Well, yeah,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and, then, of course they call, you know,"
"before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous"
I know.
"you know, I said, this is absurd,"
"I, you know, I, the minute I get home the phone would be ringing."
"That's a, that's a good suggestion."
I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.
"Yeah,"
"I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"well, they keep it rather secretive,"
yes
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh,"
"well two, two of them actually."
"Uh, the RAIN MAN was one."
Oh that was great one.
"Wasn't that fabulous,"
"and, and DRIVING MISS DAISY."
"Oh, I loved it."
"You know, I haven't seen that one yet,"
and I need to go see it.
"Oh, you need to see that."
Yeah.
That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black
Uh-huh.
and this all took place in the South.
Oh my.
"And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet."
"You bet, especially in the South."
"Yes,"
"right,"
"and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie."
The acting was phenomenal.
"Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it."
"Oh yes,"
Jessica Tandy won best actress
And the same way with those calls.
"What is it,"
"oh M C I, M C I really does."
"Even when you tell them no, they keep calling back."
M C I
what's that?
M C I
it's the long distance telephone company.
"Oh, now see I, I really don't have much trouble with, I just say no thank you and hang up."
"Uh-huh,"
well they they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason.
They just keep calling back.
"I had a carpet service call up three times, all within in an hour,"
Uh-huh.
"but, I, uh, I do telemarketing,"
Uh-huh.
"so, uh, I'm very polite"
"and I just say no thank you, and say no thank you very politely"
"and I hang up and, don't bother me after that."
Uh
Yeah.
So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me
and they try to get information out of me.
Uh-huh.
"Like the Census Bureau, United States Census Bureau."
Oh yeah.
That bothered me.
Uh-huh.
I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even.
Right.
That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
and I don't understand what their need to know is.
"yeah,"
"I agree,"
"it's, it's pretty tough that way,"
"and, I know, even like with your school books and papers."
Uh-huh.
Do you miss your papers sometimes?
"See,"
yeah.
Uh-huh.
You know.
"That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though."
"Yeah,"
"well, actually I do know,"
and I have used it once
Uh-huh.
"and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,"
"but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live, their street address."
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"And that,"
"I mean, I've, I've used it once,"
"All right,"
"well do you play any musical instruments or,"
"No,"
I don't play any.
I used to.
"Oh well,"
I think everybody took piano lessons
"so,"
"Everybody,"
sure.
Take it easy.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
All rightie.
Okay.
Do you have a budget that you go on?
Yeah.
I sure do.
"Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet"
"and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay"
and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything."
Uh-huh.
And it tends to work out pretty well that way.
"I can anticipate, you know, a little better."
I usually try to guesstimate
"and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh
So that works okay for me.
Uh-huh.
"Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be."
Right.
"Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know."
"Uh-huh,"
"I, I started when I was in, uh, third grade,"
"and I've, I still play the piano as of today."
Do you?
"Yes,"
I do.
"I started,"
I think I was in the fifth grade
and I played it for maybe three months
"But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band."
"I played the drums,"
"I played the clarinet,"
I played the trumpet.
Wow
"Uh, you know, whatever"
"and so I, I still sing,"
and I sing in the choir today
"so,"
All right
"I I enjoy the music,"
it gives me an out.
Yeah.
"It always sounds like,"
"for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano, you know."
True
"So, how long did you play?"
Only for about three months.
Three months.
"Yeah,"
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty bored quick
"I was going to say, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh."
"Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song."
And that was hard too.
"I, I lucked out with really good people both times"
but I know so many people that are never able to find that
"and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it,"
so
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you have a nanny
or did you have someone  that lived in with you?
Yeah.
"Well no,"
she didn't live with us.
"Uh, the first one was an, elderly lady who was putting a, a daughter through nursing school  just purely on baby-sitting money."
Oh.
Oh my goodness.
And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night.
Uh-huh.
And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had  because both our parents are dead.
Yeah.
Oh.
"So that, that was a plus from  that respect as well."
Oh gosh.
And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"I have, uh,"
I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center.
Uh-huh.
"I was just listening to a program this morning,"
"oh well, I guess it was on the HOME SHOW,"
"but they were talking about, uh, a new, uh,"
"I, uh, know the name"
but I haven't been there.
"Uh, that's an old established, uh, restaurant."
I used to go there when I was in college.
Uh-huh.
Where did you go to college?
"Uh, I went to the Naval Academy."
"Oh, the U S ,  Naval Academy?"
"And we used to,  we use to go up there on, uh, for football games sometimes. And have some liberty."
Uh-huh.
"And,"
"yeah,"
"we would go over there to, uh,"
"pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders"
"I think it was,"
yes.
I'll be darn.
I haven't been back there in years.
"Well, we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out,"
"but I'll just make one comment that, uh, I just retired from Penn State,"
"and, uh, all my work has been in research for the Navy"
Okay.
What area?
Underwater acoustics.
Is that right?
"Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?"
"I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that the country has."
"Yes, sir."
"My dad worked there for years, and years."
Uh-huh.
"That's that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando."
"So,"
Yeah.
"You know something must be wrong as far as, uh, not just the teaching techniques but just motivation, within, within the schools themselves."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"excuse me just a minute, uh,"
Uh-huh.
I'm on the other line Karen.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, it's okay."
Okay.
"Uh, she, uh,"
"yeah,"
"well the, the results,"
"I, I hear what you're, you're saying about the results."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, it's, what to do about it I guess is the, the big thing."
Yeah.
"I'm, I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my, my wife teaches school here in Plano."
Uh-huh.
"And, I know that, uh, the results that they get out of the system sometime is, is certainly not you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know,"
"I've seen that for years,"
yeah.
"Right,"
"and, I know, uh,"
"I work around, you know a lot of teachers"
"and I I understand how, uh, supportive they are of their students and how excited they are,"
Uh-huh.
"but some how, I don't think the students are getting excited."
"Yeah,"
"I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the, the home environment."
"Oh, yes"
"definitely,"
"You know, not so much at what the schools are teaching, but what they let the kids get away with."
"Um, uh-huh."
"You know, they, they see most, uh,"
"they're, they're quite upset about the, uh, the disruptive influence of school."
"Most of them would say, you know, those people should be removed from the school system."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And in Japan they would be, you know."
Right.
"But, uh, here again, you get back into a political thing, where, uh,"
Yeah
"there's, there's,"
right.
"There's definitely too much leeway as far as,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I've only been out of, I've been out of college only two years,"
Uh-huh.
and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out
"and I, I already, you know, I really didn't, I really don't see myself going back to school or anything,"
"but, I appreciate more what I had."
Uh-huh.
"And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm,"
"Yeah,"
were you at Baylor?
and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have.
"Yeah,"
did you go to Baylor?
"No,"
"I went to U T at Austin,"
uh-huh.
"Oh, oh, okay."
"I'm, uh,"
"Well, I know my folks live, uh, in Arizona there,"
"and, uh, you know, they just grow rocks"
Right.
"So. I know I was in, uh, Houston when I was working for a company once,"
"and we were taking care of lawns out there,"
"and, uh, that particular year they had just tons of rain, you know,"
it was raining continuously.
Uh-huh.
"And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems."
"Yes,"
that's true.
"Yeah,"
"Houston is a lot, um, a lot wetter than, than Dallas, Dallas area,"
"that's where Plano is,"
"and, um, and just humidity you know, just all the time, it's an awfully lot more humid."
Uh-huh.
"Are, are you, uh, able to get, uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain things in your garden?"
"Yes,"
"uh-huh,"
I think people do.
Yeah.
"I don't have a vegetable garden,"
"haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually,"
"but, um, but, yes,"
"uh-huh,"
"we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio,"
Okay.
So what do you guys having up there?
"I haven't been up there since, oh, Lord, forty-eight, I guess"
Forty-eight.
That's a long time. Uh.
"Well, no,"
Yeah.
"I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie, because that's, uh, not really the way comedies are right now"
Uh-huh.
"you know, all the comedies are more like jokes and, you know, gags and stuff like that"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
there's not as much slapstick anymore.
"Well, I guess it was a, uh, a very successful movie financially,"
so we may see more slapstick.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well, that's true,"
it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.
"Yeah,"
"it is, it is,"
"and I guess you don't have to, but, you know, if you look at oh,"
have you ever seen any of the movies?
Excuse me?
The French movies that .
"No,"
"not really,"
"the last movie I saw I guess, uh, was, uh, uh, the one about the French, the Frenchman that leaves and comes back, and he's someone different."
"Um, he's, uh,"
"well, it's about a man, uh, that, uh, leaves his home and comes back to his wife,"
and his wife's all excited
"but the guy that comes back is not her original husband,"
"but, um. O'Gear um, I'm sure you've heard of it,"
Um.
"it was a very famous, uh, popular movie."
"Norman Gray,"
Norman Gear.
"No,"
that's interesting.
"Yeah,"
"the only pet that I've had, uh,"
"I'm a, I'm a doctoral student right now"
Uh-huh.
"and in my, in my earlier days as a student I kind of time shared on a dog with a, a good friend of mine"
"and, uh, it was an amazing dog,"
it really was.
"They had, he had gotten it from the pound"
"and, uh, it, it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino. Kind of looks like a a Dalmatian"
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
"and we trained it from a pup,"
"and basically it, right now it, it's fully trained"
and it can do a lot of things.
"It will get beer for you out of the fridge,"
and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff.
"So, it's really, it's, it's kind of a show piece"
"and whenever anybody comes over, we all have to show him Domino you know ."
"Oh, I think so."
"Yeah,"
"it's, uh,"
"she's been a real good, a real good dog"
"and, uh, just, it's kind of a shame that I'm, I'm I'm away from it now."
"I, I I actually live in Florida"
Uh-huh
but I'm on an internship up here for a year
"and then I go back down,"
"but, uh,"
"yeah,"
Domino's a real good dog.
Yeah.
"Which was, uh,"
"I, I find that fascinating that, uh,"
"Yeah,"
"I do, too."
Do you ever listen to the radio
"or any,"
"I listen to K R L D, and, uh, uh, K L I F, the news talk radio."
Uh-huh.
And I actually listen to C N N radio.
Do you know it was on radio now?
"No,"
I don't.
It's on eleven ninety.
"Um. I really, uh, have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of, even music"
"and, uh,"
"Well, when I go to work I listen."
"Yeah,"
my husband does
"and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes, and says, oh, I just heard on the news that such and such happened, you know, if it's something really interesting"
"and and then I'll know to, to keep an eye out for it,"
Yeah.
but I've got out of the habit of listening to the radio.
"Well, with, with your, you know,"
"if you're around the home, though and, and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is, is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is"
and then they start repeating everything.
Uh-huh.
"And, and so it's kind of a, oh,"
"that's what's interesting is the C N N, uh,"
"I don't think, I'm trying to think if it's much local."
I listen to a little of that
and I listen to a little of ninety point one.
"I, I'm, I'm inveterate switcher."
"Where, where are you?"
I'm in Dallas.
"Oh, yeah."
Are you in Dallas also?
"No,"
I'm in San Antonio.
"Oh, really,"
okay.
I get my news from a combination of sources.
I take the paper every day
Uh-huh.
"and I read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool."
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, and I watch the, uh, actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work."
"And then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news."
Uh-huh.
"I normally find that uh, I'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,"
"so I don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch."
"I, I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because I used to get it during the week"
Uh-huh.
"but, um, I would always end up arriving at work late, because I would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time, reading it in the morning."
Yeah.
"So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work."
"Um, the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television"
Uh-huh.
and I enjoy that quite a bit.
Yeah.
"Um, one of the women that I work with, her husband is Iranian."
Uh-huh.
So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
"I will admit I work with, uh, someone who's Iranian,"
Yeah.
"I tell you what,"
"the first three days, I was glued to the television."
I will admit the same thing.
"And I, would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer"
"And I,"
"and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program"
Yeah.
"and I, I was just, I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing."
I tell you what.
"The uh, the war spot in"
"let's see, was it a Wednesday or Thursday?"
"Must have been Thursday, uh,"
"and Friday night I was, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open."
Uh-huh.
"Because I was watching C N N,"
"and they would, they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus,"
"and the people would be standing there in gas masks,"
"and you'd be hearing the sirens,"
"and it was just,"
I was amazed.
Uh-huh.
"I, I didn't have that experience."
"I, I don't have cable"
Oh.
"so I, I'm pretty much limited to P B S, which I thought, I thought they did a very good job."
Uh-huh.
"Um, I've got one question for you."
I you say you take the newspaper.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I, I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting."
"We've got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the TIMES HERALD, and then the MORNING NEWS, which has a very strong subscription."
"Lützow’s Wild Hunt (German: ""Lützows wilde verwegene Jagd"") is the title of a patriotic German song and a 1927 German silent war film."
"The poem was written by young German poet and soldier Theodor Körner, who served in the Lützow Free Corps during the Wars of Liberation. It was set to music by Carl Maria von Weber and became very popular."
"The song praises the deeds of the Free Corps that became an essential part of Germany’s national identity in the 19th century due to its famous members. Besides Körner, “Turnvater” Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, the famous poet Joseph von Eichendorff, the inventor of the kindergarten Friedrich Fröbel, and Eleonore Prochaska, a woman who had dressed as a man in order to join the fight against the French, served in the Corps."
"The tune was adopted as the regimental march of the 1st Surrey Rifles, a Volunteer unit of the British Army."

= = = Thomas Shorts = = =
"Thomas Dolman Shorts was a Canadian sailor, and one of the early captains on the Okanagan Lake. Shorts started the lakeboat service on Okanagan Lake in the Penticton area."
"""Ruth Shorts"" was Thomas Shorts's first boat. She was named for his mother. ""Ruth Shorts"" was a rowboat that could make a roundtrip from Penticton to Okanagan Landing in nine days. ""Ruth Shorts"" could carry 2.5 tons of cargo as well as a few passengers. Occasionally, the boat would sport a sail if the weather permitted it. Captain Shorts had no schedule; he left when he wanted or when there was enough people to make the trip worthwhile. Shorts would row during the day and when dusk fell he would row ashore and camp on land with his passengers for the night. Captain Shorts would row sixty-five miles per trip."
"In 1884, Shorts owned and operated the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"". She was a steamer that operated on the same route the ""Ruth Shorts"" did. The ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" had the capacity to carry five tons of freight and several passengers. She ran on kerosene. After only a short time in operation, the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" was destroyed by a fire."
"In 1887, Shorts salvaged the engine from the burned ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" and modified it so that it was powered by burning wood, and he installed this engine in his new boat, the ""Jubilee"". The ""Jubilee"" was thirty feet long and could tow a barge. In 1889, only two years after she began operation, she sank."
"In 1890, Shorts partnered with Thomas Ellis to improve the lake service in the Okanagan. Ellis could provide the funds that Shorts needed. Together, they had a new boat ordered. Meanwhile, Shorts took the engine from the ""Jubilee"" and attached it to a scow and called his new creation the ""City of Vernon"". He used the ""City of Vernon"" until the new boat was ready. The new boat, named ""Penticton,"" was a twin screw steamer. After only two years of operation, Shorts and Ellis sold the ""Penticton"" to Leon Lequime of Kelowna for five thousand dollars."
"Shorts had never been big on luxury, so when the Canadian Pacific Railway entered the lake service with the SS ""Aberdeen"", Shorts could not, despite his many efforts, compete with them. Not long after the ""Aberdeen"" was launched Shorts left the lake service. He headed for the Klondike hoping to strike it rich."

Squirrels is a one-act play by David Mamet.
"The 1974 comedy is about Arthur, a middle-aged, egotistical hack writer who has been working on the opening line of a story involving a man's encounter with a squirrel for fifteen years, and Edmond, the young fledgling writer he has hired as a secretary/collaborator. They soon discover that Arthur's flamboyant redundancy clashes with Edmond's mediocre melodramatic style as they each develop increasingly ridiculous scenarios for the story. They are joined by Arthur's cleaning lady, also an aspiring writer, whose suggestions seem to be the most promising, but they too eventually bog down in banality."
"In October 1974 Mamet directed the first production of the play at the St. Nicholas Theater Company in Chicago, Illinois.

"Shepperd's Dell is a small canyon in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon, located at"
which is less than one-third mile (500 m) southeast of Rooster Rock State Park.
"The Historic Columbia River Highway runs over the dell on a bridge that was the answer to one of the engineering challenges of the highway's construction. The dell was carved by a creek that includes two fairly substantial tumbling waterfalls. Due to the topography of the area, it is difficult to photograph the falls. As such, the bridge is what is normally pictured, and thus is arguably better known than the dell itself."
"The spelling of the dell's name tends to vary depending on the source. The official Oregon State Park site spells it with the apostrophe, however the GNIS entry omits the apostrophe. Oregon Geographic Names appears to make a distinction between the name of the geographic feature and the name of the state park (now a state natural area), referring to both Shepperds Dell and Shepperd's Dell State Park. Omitting the apostrophe when referring to the dell itself is consistent with the policies of the United States Board on Geographic Names, which strongly discourages the use of possessive apostrophes in geographic names."

"Spitz became one of America's leading high jumpers while still at Flushing High School, placing fourth in the 1929 national championships with a jump of 1.89 m (6 ft in)."
"In March 1930 he jumped 1.94 m (6 ft in), breaking the US high school record of Walter Marty. At the national championships he repeated his fourth-place finish from the previous year. He graduated from high school that spring and entered New York University."
"Spitz set his first indoor world record on February 7, 1931 at the Millrose Games, jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) and defeating the previous record holders Harold Osborn and Bert Nelson. He also had the best outdoor jump in the world that year, clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) at Travers Island and attempting the world outdoor record height of 2.04 m (6 ft in) three times. At the national championships, however, he only cleared 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in) and was yet again beaten to fourth place."
"Spitz was the world's best high jumper in 1932. On February 6 he improved his own indoor world record to 2.02 m (6 ft in), again at the Millrose Games. A week later at Boston he broke the record again, jumping 2.04 m (6 ft in), a mark that exceeded Osborn's outdoor world record as well. Spitz also won his first national indoor championship that year, clearing a meeting record 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) on that occasion."
"Spitz injured his ankle that spring, and while he remained in good form the injury gave him on-and-off trouble. He was forced to scratch from the annual meet of his own club, the New York Athletic Club, in early June. But he managed to return in time for the Olympic Trials, and after he jumped 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in workouts ahead of the Trials and 1.99 m (6 ft in) in the competition itself, tying for first with Bob Van Osdel and Corny Johnson, he was again considered the leading Olympic favorite."
"At the Olympics, however, the injured ankle bothered him again and he only managed to place ninth, clearing no higher than 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in)."
"Spitz defended his national indoor title in 1933, jumping 2.03 m (6 ft in) for a meeting record. At the outdoor championships, however, he was beaten by Johnson and shared second place with Marty, who had broken the outdoor world record earlier that year."
"In 1934 Spitz's indoor supremacy was seriously threatened by Marty, who had never jumped indoors before. At the Millrose Games on February 5 Spitz and Marty tied, both jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in). In the New York Athletic Club indoor games on February 17, however, Marty beat both Spitz and his indoor record, clearing 2.05 m (6 ft in) on his third attempt. At the national indoor championships Spitz and Marty tied for first again, both clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) this time to share the title."
"Although unable to improve his indoor best, Spitz made his best outdoor jumps that year. He won at the Penn Relays with a jump of 2.01 m (6 ft in) and went an inch higher with an additional exhibition jump. He then cleared 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in his home meet at Travers Island, his official outdoor best. Spitz and Marty, both now collegiate seniors, faced each other again at the NCAA championships and again tied, although Marty was victorious in the jump-off. At the national championships Spitz cleared 2.02 m (6 ft in), but had to be content with third place as both Johnson and Marty managed to jump an inch higher."
"Spitz continued his jumping career after graduating, but with decreasing success. At the 1935 national championships he still placed second to Johnson, clearing 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in). At the 1936 Olympic Trials he only managed 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in), sharing fourth place with six other jumpers."
"Spitz jumped in an era in which most jumpers from the American west coast (such as Marty) used the western roll, whereas east coast jumpers tended to prefer the eastern cut-off or other developments of the old scissors style. Spitz, a New Yorker, belonged to the latter group, although his technique was largely self-taught and incorporated elements of the roll."

"William G. ""Slicky Bill"" Greene, Jr. (1812–1894) was a friend of Abraham Lincoln and a businessman in Menard County, Illinois. Greene founded Tallula, Illinois in 1857, and Greenview, Illinois is named after him."
"Greene, along with his brother L.M. Greene, and William F. Berry, attended Illinois College in Jacksonville."
"By September 1831, Greene's parents lived 2 miles (3 km) southwest of New Salem; Greene, then age 19, was hired by recent arrival Abraham Lincoln to assist at Lincoln's mill and store. In early January 1833, Greene bought the inventory of Reuben Radford's store in New Salem for $400; Lincoln drew up and witnessed the mortgage. The same day, Greene sold the same inventory to Lincoln and Berry, now Lincoln's store partner, for over $600. When Lincoln had a debt judgement entered against him in 1834, requiring Lincoln to surrender his horse, Greene turned in his own horse instead; this horse was probably the one Lincoln had paid him with in 1833. Lincoln eventually paid Greene back after becoming an attorney."
"Greene was also an acquaintance of Richard Yates, and introduced Yates and Lincoln in New Salem; Yates became Governor of Illinois during the Civil War and Lincoln became President."
"Greene and Lincoln remained friends; though Greene was a Democrat, Lincoln, as president, appointed Greene as internal revenue collector for the Peoria district. In ""Lincoln's New Salem"", author Benjamin Thomas relates a story in which Lincoln introduced Greene to Secretary of State William H. Seward by saying that Greene had taught Lincoln grammar: When Greene later reminded Lincoln that all Greene had done was held the grammar book and checked the answers, and was not very good at grammar himself, Lincoln is said to have replied ""Well, that was all the teaching of grammar I ever had."""
"Greene had nine children. By March 1853, Greene and his wife, Louisa Green, lived on a farm near Havana, Illinois; their seventh child, Gaines Greene (1853–1918), was born there on March 3. Sons Carlin, McNult, Byrd, and Vance, and daughter Julia Greene, died before Gaines; sons Scott and Frank and daughter J. S. Noble outlived Gaines."
"Within months after the birth of Gaines Green, the family moved near Tallula, and William Greene spent most of his life in Tallula Precinct. Greene, along with Yates, J. G. Greene, T. Baker, and W. G. Spears, laid out the village of Tallula itself in late 1857. William Greene and physician J. F. Wilson established the local bank in May 1877."
"Greenview was laid out in October 1857. It was named after William Greene because he convinced the railroad to come through the town: located on the Chicago, Alton & St. Louis Railroad, Greenview was incorporated by a special act of the Illinois General Assembly in May 1869."

= = = Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang = = =
The Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang MM-1 is a single-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding. It is also known as the Long Midget. It was the predecessor to the Mustang II which is also known as the Bushby Mustang. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992.
"It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of metal construction, primarily of 2024-T3 aluminum and most are fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Developed by Piper engineer David Long in 1948, plans for production by Schweizer were underway at the time of Long's death two years later. All rights and tooling were purchased by Robert Bushby in 1959, who built a 90 hp Continental powered example and sold plans and kits until 1992 when the rights were sold to Mustang Aeronautics. The Midget Mustang design being marketed in 2016 is similar to the original, with the option of building it with a bubble canopy in place of the straight line of the upper tailcone and hinged canopy of Long's original design, making it an M-IA."
Construction requires about 1000 hours of builder time.
"The Midget Mustang was intended for air racing. David Long designed an aircraft for a friend to be used in the Cleveland Air Race in 1948. That aircraft was built by Long and was named ""Pea Shooter"". The Midget Mustang was only moderately successful as a race plane. However, its appearance and desirable flight characteristics made it an ideal sport plane. At the Cleveland Race, racers competed in aircraft with names like, ""Mammy"",""Miss Fort Worth"", and ""Slo Poke"". Over time, air racers modified the aircraft to reach 181 mph (291 km/h) speeds in competition. Nowadays, the Midget Mustang can cruise at 240 mph."

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Archanes-Asterousia, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of . Population 5,042 (2011). It is also the archaeological site of an ancient Minoan settlement in central Crete. The discovery of ancient roads leading from Archanes to Juktas, Anemospilia, Xeri Kara and Vathypetro indicate that Archanes was an important hub in the region during Minoan times. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancient Archanes spread out over the same area as the modern town of Archanes."
"In 1912, Xanthoudides noted the importance of Archanes, but Sir Arthur Evans was the first to characterize the site as palatial, declaring that Archanes was likely a Summer Palace for the Knossos kings. Spyridon Marinatos and N. Platon excavated minor areas in the region, but nothing supported Evans' theory. In 1964, Yannis Sakellarakis dug trial trenches at the Tourkoyeitonia site and uncovered the first evidence of a palace site. Since 1966, Archanes has been excavated by the Greek Archaeological Society under the supervision of John Sakellarakis and Efi Sapouna-Sakellarakis."
"In the Minoan era, aqueducts delivered water to Kephala Hill from spring water sources at Archanes, which are also the source of the Kairatos River."
"Troullos is the easternmost site of the Archanes settlement. Tourkoyeitonia, in central Archanes, is the site of its palace, likely built in the Middle Minoan period. Excavations began here in 1964 by J. Sakellarakis. It contains features such as ashlar blocks, poros-stone plaques and blocks, plaster, wood, stucco floor tiles, gypsum, kouskoura slabs, mud bricks, ironstone blocks, schist plaques, blue marble flooring, incurved concave altars, wooden columns and pillars, frescoes and Polytheron doorways. A variety of Porphyrite stone lamps, vases, amphorae, cooking pots, cups, lamps, tools and every-day domestic items such as tweezers have been unearthed at the site. Southwest of Tourkoyeitonia, more of the palace is found. While little remains of the architecture, the walls that are preserved are Middle Minoan III–Late Minoan IA. Linear A tablets and the model of a house were excavated at The Archive along with MMIII-LMIA pottery and several unworked pieces of rock crystal, obsidian and steatite."
"The man-made enclosure of a spring, partially excavated in 1921 by Sir Arthur Evans, was completed by J. Sakellarakis in 1964. The floor is laid with pebbles, and the walls are poros-stone. Evidence indicates that it was built between Middle Minoan IB and Middle Minoan IIIA, destroyed during Late Minoan IA, and then restored and in various use afterward. The reservoir is within the palace grounds."
"A large paved area, dissected by walkways that form a triangle, is found in Theatre Area"" or ""Aghios Nikolaos"" (Saint Nicholas). Two stepped altars are found here, one on a walkway and one on the pavement. There is a painting of a reconstruction of this area in Sakellarakis' ""Crete Archanes"" guidebook on page 49, which does this area more justice than a written description."
"The economy revolves around grape and olive processing and marketing. Both products account for some 96% of its total agricultural products. The Agricultural Cooperative of Archanes, set up in 1931, is one of the oldest in Greece, and consists of 1119 members. A quarter of the wine production is exported to Germany, France and the Netherlands, and the rest of the production is largely marketed domestically. Since the late 1990s, attempts have been made to convert part of wine making step by step to organic and integrated farming, beginning with the cultivation of table grapes."

"From 1891 to 1895, Day was professor of Military Science and Tactics at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio."
"After the United States declared war on Spain on April 21, 1898, Captain Day was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of volunteers and assigned to command the 1st Ohio Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, which had been reactivated after being mustered out at the end of the American Civil War. The 1st Ohio was a part of the Second Cavalry Brigade which included among its regiments the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, better known as the Rough Riders."
"The 1st Ohio reported to Port Tampa, Florida on July 12, for transportation to Cuba, but its sailing was delayed due to a shortage of transports and as a result, the regiment did not see action in the Spanish–American War. Day however, later saw action in the Philippines against the Moros. After postings to various units, he served as the colonel of his old unit, the 9th Cavalry, for a year before retiring from the army in 1912."
"Day died on September 12, 1927, in Los Angeles, California. He is buried in the San Francisco National Cemetery."

"Ernesto Carlos Tornquist (31 December 1842 – 17 June 1908) was an Argentinian entrepreneur and businessman, considered to be one of the most important entrepreneurs in Argentina at the end of the 19th century. The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world. Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in Buenos Aires, the partido of Tornquist and Tornquist its main city, in the south of Buenos Aires Province."
"Born in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist (1801-1876), a Lutheran born in Baltimore, United States and whose parents came from a German family in the city of Hamburg with roots in Karlskrona in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of Bremen in Montevideo, Uruguay, and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a Catholic, was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of yellow fever in 1871."
"Tornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evangélica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of Krefeld for two years. On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which exported wool and leather and imported agricultural machinery. In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law’s company which was now renamed, ""Ernesto Tornquist y Cia"". With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries. The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios, previously occupied by Indians. In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, ""Refineria Argentina"", in Rosario. Other initiatives included founding the ""Bieckert"" brewery, the ""Seeber"" margarine manufacturer and the ""Bianchetti"" scale manufacturer."
"On 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province. From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and Volga German immigrants. After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company ""Sansinena"" and its cold-storage plant ""La Negra"" in Riachuelo and set up the plant ""Cuartreros"" in Bahía Blanca."
"Amongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the South Georgia Islands through the ""Compañía Argentina de Pesca"", oil exploration in Mendoza, the exploitation of quebracho in Santiago del Estero and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital."
"Ernesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between Argentina and Chile in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister Estanislao Zeballos. He represented the German armaments group Krupp in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil."
"In 1903 he built the estancia, ""Sierra de la Ventana"", in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect Carlos Nordmann in Gothic style typical of German castles in the Rhine Valley. The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, Carlos Thays."
He maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents Julio A. Roca and Carlos Pellegrini and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of José Figueroa Alcorta (1906-1910).
"In 1909 he built the Plaza Hotel (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking Plaza San Martin in Buenos Aires."
He died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.

"Kisumu Rugby Football Club is a Kenyan rugby union club based in Kisumu. Also known as Lakeside RFC, for the 2015-16 season the club competes in the Nationwide League."
"Kisumu was founded in 1982, by David Mshila, Dennis Awori, Job Owino, Jack Ogal, Jim Owino, and Jos Odaga. They were originally based at the Kisumu Railway Club and the Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground in Kisumu. Kisumu Boys High School also served as a training venue for years. Kisumu Technical High School (later called Kisumu Polytechnic - Makasembo) (1997) was used as a venue for games because of the good grass facility. In 1983 Kisumu combined with Kakamega, Kitale and Eldoret to form KITUSUMU: an acronym for Kitale and Kisumu.J.B Nyamwange, Jack and Walter Omaido came in from Kitale. Reg ’Pape” Sembi of Kakamega, a Canadian member of the Peace Corps Johnson Travis and Paul Scott of Eldoret. Records indicate that Barclays bank RFC travelled to Kakamega in 1985 playing Kisumu in the Enterprise Cup match. Barclays won the game 47-4. Kisumu and Kitusumu played mainly as a Western Kenya touring side but folded up in 1988."
"It is host to the Dala Sevens tournaments in the Kenya Rugby Football Union Calendar, one part of the Kenya National Sevens Circuit, today Safaricom Sevens series."
"Kisumu RFC was revived in late 1990 by rugby enthusiasts led by Mike Omondi, Bella Maguys, Gordon Raila, Peter Openda, Jim Owino, Dennis Otti, Joseph Owino, Eric Ogot, Sammy Ogot, Susan Nyaribo, Bob Bengo, Paul Okong’o, Nasser Midamba, Trevor Mugwanga, John Mark Magana, Oyunga Pala, Felix Okech and Issa Mohamed Issa amongst others. After the initial positive response to training, Jimmy Owino was appointed club coach. His initial task was to build a team with more commitment and solidarity, and to weed out the complacent ‘feel good attitude’ that had led to the dissipation of the original Kisumu RFC."
"Jimmy’s approach bore rapid results, but the next major obstacle became finance. At a team, ""Kamukunji"" it was unanimously agreed that Charles Lutta Kasamani be appointed Club patron, should he agree. He agreed. He donated playing kit, rugby balls and a first aid box. Some of the Kisumu-based personalities who raised funds tirelessly at the ""infamous"" Club Night at the Kisumu Hotel(Hotel Royale) pool side included Nilmar Darbar, Widar Krogsund, Ogweno Omwaga, Franz Bonn, Noel Okoth, Mike Humphreys, Morris Odhiambo, Jacko Omino, Peter Odaga, Paul Okullu, Peter Openda, Jos Odaga Charles Okuthe and many more whose names we cannot include here. An interim office of Charles Okuthe (Chairman) and Bella Maguys (Secretary) organized the first ever rugby tournament in Kisumu which was ‘not too good not too bad ‘in October 1991."
"The same office later organized Kisumu RFC elections which saw a new office of Peter Openda (Chairman) and Paul Okullu (Hon- Secretary) take over, with most of the interim office bearers not seeking re-election."
"From 1991 to 1996, Kisumu steadily concentrated on building a strong foundation by taking part in tournaments such as the Great Rift Valley 10-aside in Nakuru and Mombasa’s Driftwood Sevens. This was by choice because of a small player base and financial limitations. At the same time, the Club hosted the Kisumu Ten-aside event held between 1991 and 1994. With a rich hinterland of players from Maseno School, St. Mary's School Yala, Nyang'ori High School, Moi University and Maseno University there was light at the end of the tunnel. Mombasa businessman Edwin Yinda donated playing kit to the team after the Driftwood finals contested between Mean Machine RFC and Kisumu."
"Kisumu RFC first came to the fore when they reached the Driftwood 7s in Mombasa in 1994 losing in sudden death to Mean Machine RFC. Come 1997, Kisumu again reached the Finals of the Driftwood 7s in 1997 losing to the United States International University Africa."
"It is a Sunday in June 1997 and the George Mwangi Kabeberi Memorial 7s is on at the Nairobi Railway Club. Kenya is playing, using the one-day event as preparation for the Tusker Safari 7s in a couple of week’s time. The squad is composed of Sammy Khakame, Paul Murunga, Tolbert Onyango, Ken Thimba, Gordon Anampiu, Felix 'Toti' Ochieng', Manuel Okoth, Steve Gichuki & Co. Kisumu RFC are also present and the players on show are Andrew Okwaro, Fred Jura, Frank Ndong' Steve Oloo, Issa Matan Issa, Moses Kola, Tony Lamba, Job Odonde and Dan Alego, Gordon Raila, Felix Oketch, Bob Bengo. Two weeks before at the driftwood sevens in Mombasa the lakeside outfit finished runners -up losing 19-7 to USIU-Africa."
"Kisumu had moved away from mere participation to competition and the rugby fraternity had taken notice. Expectations from both the playing unit and fanatics were high. Mean Machine RFC arrived and in the side was Eric 'Shaggy' Mwangi, Biko Ambesta, Ted Okinda, Ken Aswani, Kanyi Gitonga, Eric Musuva, Oyunga Pala, Kevin Matabutu, Sundiya Halwenge and Paul Okong'o."
"And the event kicked off and the usual winners and losers and it looked like a ""kawa"" event, till Kenya met Kisumu and there was fireworks. Kenya despite her constellation of international players with exposure in Selkirkshire, Dubai, Spain and Singapore struggled to beat Kisumu, but that was just round one. To the semis of the Main Cup and Kisumu again met Kenya while Mean Machine RFC played Nakuru RFC. Nakuru with Ben 'Benways' Otieno, Caleb Langat and the hard hitting and sometimes illegal play were too strong for Machine and that was the end for Machine."
"To the second semi and Kisumu versus Kenya and this was a nip and tuck battle. The crowd at the Railway Club was at full cry behind Kisumu. Tony Lamba after many years in the Ninja's outfit found a new life, and with a new team was in imperious form setting up, Jura, Okwaro, Kola and Co. However Kenya composed themselves and closed the match off to set up a final versus rift Valley side Nakuru. It was not Kenya's day as New winger Caleb Langat scored try after try, taking Kenya's winger's apart. Winners Nakuru RFC"
"By Monday of the new week, Call ups to Kenya, Andrew Okwaro and Fred Jura."
"A tour to Uganda in October saw them leave an indelible mark with their trademark hard running, tackling and skills level in a country which was just beginning to pick the game after a lull of over 20 years. The visitor's led 13-7 at halftime before the hosts recovered to win 47-13 in the second-half. This was a 'test' versus Uganda. Putting it mildly, 1997 marked the turning point for Kisumu Rugby. They did not look back and Kisumu became a fertile rugby nursery nurturing young players just out of school into mature club and national team material."
"Kisumu joined the Second division ESS in 1998 after winning the Bowl league in 1997. The ESS would prove tricky for Kisumu. The challenge came from two quarters, one depth in terms of players and two finances to honor 11 away games with most teams based in Nairobi. The league would be honored on and off between 1998 and 2002."
"Away from that the Management Board of Kisumu actively engaged the Union in trying to secure a future. In behind the scenes talks the Kisumu management Board asked the Union for one leg of the National Sevens Circuit. At talks in Moshi, Tanzania in December 2002 a hush-hush deal was done with the Hon-Secretary of the Union Richard Omwela who was scheduled to contest for the Chairmanship in a number of months."
"With Mount Kilimanjaro providing a spectacular backdrop, to the conversation he proposed a deal. In exchange for support from the Lakeside team at the election he agreed to give Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit. Present at the talks were Omwela, Aggrey Chabeda, John Akelola, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o. Kisumu also actively engaged Max Muniafu who was then Director for Development at the Union and argued for the same. Prior to Moshi talks were held with Max, David Akelola, Phillip Ocholla, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o at the Junction Inn restaurant in Kisumu to push for the same."
Surely enough one of the first acts by Omwela & Chabeda on their election as Chair and Secretary of the Kenya Rugby Football Union was to award Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit in early 2003 by 'Executive order'.

"In 1948, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth completed the purchase of the hospital from the City of Tyler and in October 1965, Mother Frances Week was celebrated in Tyler, dedicating a new wing. This $4.5 million wing added 110 new patient beds and a new cafeteria to the hospital."
"In 1934, The Trinity Clinic began as The Bryant Clinic. It was founded by Dr. William Howard Bryant and Dr. Sidney W. Bradford. The Bryant Clinic received the first call for help in Tyler to treat the victims of the New London tragedy. In 1948, The Bryant Clinic changed its name to The Medical & Surgical Clinic and later, with the addition of two other Tyler-area medical practices, became Trinity Clinic. Today, Trinity Clinic is the area's biggest multi-specialty medical group, with over 300 providers representing 38 specialties in 36 clinic locations in East Texas."

"John T. Shayne & Company, a Chicago-based hatter, haberdasher and furrier was founded on November 6, 1884, by John Thomas Shayne (born August 26, 1852) an importer/manufacturer, civic leader and Democratic politician. The firm was formally incorporated on May 23, 1899, and held the distinction of being ""the largest business of its kind outside of New York City."" The store was first located at 187-189 South State Street in the Chicago Loop (the city of Chicago's central business and shopping district) and later moved to the John Crerar Library building at 150 North Michigan Avenue where it remained until the department store ceased operations in 1979. At the time of its closing, Shayne's was a department store specializing in women's ready-to-wear, couture and furs."
"The achievements of the Shayne brothers in the manufacture of fine furs helped to bring a newfound respect for American manufactured furs which were primarily reserved only for the elite European manufacturing houses of Russia, France and Germany. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (also known as the Chicago's World Fair), ""The New York Times"" reported, ""The joint exhibit of C.C Shayne of New-York and John T. Shayne of this city has received awards which, by reason of their number and their language, leave no doubt that the Shayne fur products surpass those made in any part of the world."""
"On July 10, 1894, John T. Shayne commented to the Committee of Finance of the United States Senate that U.S. furriers were losing significant income from garments that were manufactured overseas and then brought back to this country duty-free by tourists. Shayne stated to the Committee of Finance, ""I could get up a petition that would almost reach from the Senate Chamber to the White House, but do not wish to encroach upon your valuable time."""
John T. Shayne & Company was one of the earliest Chicago retailers to join in America's burgeoning mail order business during the turn of the 20th century. Shayne's first mail order publication dates back to 1906 and is featured in the Chicago Public Library Trade Catalog Collection at the Harold Washington Library.
"Mail order merchandising played an important role in retail distribution during the 20th century. These catalogues provided rural communities access to an array of merchandise; items ranging from tooth paste to prefabricated houses were marketed to small towns and remote rural communities, transforming the way American's purchased goods."
"Chicago area retailers were among the nation's first companies to publish mail orders. The city was ideally suited for America's growing mail order business due to its central location, access to a national rail system and advances made in mail delivery. Chicago became a nationally recognized city through the many images that found their way into these mail order catalogs. These publications shaped the nation's perspective of Chicago and encouraged tourism to the city."
"On March 21, 1899, ""The New York Times"" reported, ""John T. Shayne, a wealthy furrier, and a prominent Democratic politician, brother of C.C. Shayne of New York, was shot, and probably fatally wounded, this afternoon by Harry H. Hammond, a tailor. The shooting occurred in the cafe of the Auditorium Annex, where Shayne was sitting at lunch with Mrs. Hammond, the divorced wife of Hammond, and two other ladies."" Shayne did miraculously recover from the shooting incident."
"Patrick Dennis, author of the bestselling novel ""Auntie Mame"" referenced John T. Shayne and Company in his subsequent novel ""Little Me"". The main character of the novel, Belle Poitrine, describes her shopping spree ""I went on a mad round of shopping -diamonds and pearls- from Peacock's, glossy furs from John T. Shayne, dresses of every description from Field's and Carson, Pirie, Scott with shoes to match from O'Connor and Goldberg."""

"More than 420 feature-length film versions of Shakespeare's plays have been produced since the early 20th century, making Shakespeare the most filmed author ever. Some of the film adaptations, especially Hollywood movies marketed to teenage audiences, use his plots rather than his dialogue, while others are simply filmed versions of his plays."
"For centuries there had been an accepted style of how Shakespeare was to be performed which was erroneously labeled ""Elizabethan"" but actually reflected a trend of design from a period shortly after Shakespeare's death. Shakespeare's performances were originally performed in contemporary dress. Actors were costumed in clothes that they might wear off the stage. This continued into the 18th century, the Georgian period, where costumes were the current fashionable dress. It was not until centuries after his death, primarily the 19th Century, that productions started looking back and tried to be ""authentic"" to a Shakespearean style. The Victorian era had a fascination with historical accuracy and this was adapted to the stage in order to appeal to the educated middle class. Charles Kean was particularly interested in historical context and spent many hours researching historical dress and setting for his productions. This faux-Shakespearean style was fixed until the 20th century. As of the twenty-first century, there are very few productions of Shakespeare, both on stage and on film, which are still performed in ""authentic"" period dress, while as late as 1990, virtually every true film version of a Shakespeare play was performed in correct period costume. The first film in English to break this pattern was 1995's ""Richard III"" which updated the setting to the 1930s but changed none of Shakespeare's dialogue."
