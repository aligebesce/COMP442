"he questioned sadly , after a silence ."
"`` I think I am , '' said Sara ."
She kept her stately head averted .
"`` If -- if you have loved me , Jeff , why did you never tell me so before ? ''"
`` How could I dare ? ''
he said gravely .
`` I knew I could never win you -- that I had no right to dream of you so .
"Oh , Sara , do n't be angry !"
My love has been reverent and humble .
I have asked nothing .
I ask nothing now but your friendship .
"Do n't take that from me , Sara ."
Do n't be angry with me . ''
"`` I am angry , '' repeated Sara , `` and I think I have a right to be . ''"
"`` Perhaps so , '' he said simply , `` but not because I have loved you ."
"Such love as mine ought to anger no woman , Sara ."
But you have a right to be angry with me for presuming to put it into words .
I should not have done so -- but I could not help it .
It rushed to my lips in spite of me .
Forgive me . ''
"`` I do n't know whether I can forgive you for not telling me before , '' said Sara steadily . ''"
"That is what I have to forgive -- not your speaking at last , even if it was dragged from you against your will ."
"Did you think I would make you such a very poor wife , Jeff , that you would not ask me to marry you ? ''"
`` Sara ! ''
"he said , aghast ."
`` I -- I -- you were as far above me as a star in the sky -- I never dreamed -- I never hoped -- '' `` That I could care for you ? ''
"said Sara , looking round at last ."
"`` Then you were more modest than a man ought to be , Jeff ."
"I did not know that you loved me , or I should have found some way to make you speak out long ago ."
I should not have let you waste all these years .
"I 've loved you -- ever since we picked mayflowers on the hill , I think -- ever since I came home from school , I know ."
"I never cared for anyone else -- although I tried to , when I thought you did n't care for me ."
Begone from me for ever . '
"She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded , but he brushed her off ."
"Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say , ` Well , not for ever , but for a whole week . '"
Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm ?
"Oh dear no , never wanted to pinch her so much ."
"Fairies indeed are strange , and Peter , who understood them best , often cuffed them ."
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health ?
"` Let us carry her down into the house , ' Curly suggested ."
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is what one does with ladies . '"
"` No , no , ' Peter said , ` you must not touch her ."
It would not be sufficiently respectful . '
"` That , ' said Slightly , ` is what I was thinking . '"
"` But if she lies there , ' Tootles said , ` she will die . '"
"` Ay , she will die , ' Slightly admitted , ` but there is no way out . '"
"` Yes , there is , ' cried Peter ."
` Let us build a little house round her . '
They were all delighted .
"` Quick , ' he ordered them , ` bring me each of you the best of what we have ."
Gut our house .
Be sharp . '
In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding .
"They skurried this way and that , down for bedding , up for firewood , and while they were at it , who should appear but John and Michael ."
"As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing , stopped , woke up , moved another step and slept again ."
"` John , John , ' Michael would cry , ` wake up ."
"Where is Nana , John , and mother ? '"
"And then John would rub his eyes and mutter , ` It is true , we did fly . '"
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter .
"` Hullo , Peter , ' they said ."
"` Hullo , ' replied Peter amicably , though he had quite forgotten them ."
He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need .
Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table .
John and Michael watched him .
"They were sorry for him , but sorrier for themselves , and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him ."
"Tootles ' face was very white , but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before . '"
"I did it , ' he said , reflecting ."
"` When ladies used to come to me in dreams , I said , `` Pretty mother , pretty mother . ''"
"But when at last she really came , I shot her . '"
He moved slowly away .
"` Do n't go , ' they called in pity . '"
"I must , ' he answered , shaking ; ' I am so afraid of Peter . '"
It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth .
They heard Peter crow .
` Peter ! '
"they cried , for it was always thus that he signalled his return ."
"` Hide her , ' they whispered , and gathered hastily around Wendy ."
But Tootles stood aloof .
"Again came that ringing crow , and Peter dropped in front of them ."
"` Greeting , boys , ' he cried , and mechanically they saluted , and then again was silence ."
He frowned . '
"I am back , ' he said hotly , ` why do you not cheer ? '"
"They opened their mouths , but the cheers would not come ."
He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings .
"` Great news , boys , ' he cried , ' I have brought at last a mother for you all . '"
"Still no sound , except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees ."
` Have you not seen her ? '
"asked Peter , becoming troubled ."
` She flew this way . '
"` Ah me , ' one voice said , and another said , ` Oh , mournful day . '"
Tootles rose .
"` Peter , ' he said quietly , ' I will show her to you ' ; and when the others would still have hidden her he said , ` Back , twins , let Peter see . '"
"So they all stood back , and let him see , and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next ."
"` She is dead , ' he said uncomfortably ."
` Perhaps she is frightened at being dead . '
"He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her , and then never going near the spot any more ."
Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time .
"Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne 's neck , snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder ."
"`` Anne , do n't you like me a little bit , even if I ai n't a good boy like Paul ? ''"
"`` Indeed I do , '' said Anne sincerely ."
"Somehow , it was impossible to help liking Davy ."
`` But I 'd like you better still if you were n't so naughty . ''
"`` I ... did something else today , '' went on Davy in a muffled voice ."
`` I 'm sorry now but I 'm awful scared to tell you .
"You wo n't be very cross , will you ?"
"And you wo n't tell Marilla , will you ? ''"
"`` I do n't know , Davy ."
Perhaps I ought to tell her .
"But I think I can promise you I wo n't if you promise me that you will never do it again , whatever it is . ''"
"`` No , I never will ."
"Anyhow , it 's not likely I 'd find any more of them this year ."
I found this one on the cellar steps . ''
"`` Davy , what is it you 've done ? ''"
`` I put a toad in Marilla 's bed .
You can go and take it out if you like .
"But say , Anne , would n't it be fun to leave it there ? ''"
`` Davy Keith ! ''
Anne sprang from Davy 's clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marilla 's room .
The bed was slightly rumpled .
"She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad , blinking at her from under a pillow ."
`` How can I carry that awful thing out ? ''
moaned Anne with a shudder .
The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry .
"Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs , for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall ."
When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief .
`` If Marilla knew she 'd never feel safe getting into bed again in her life .
I 'm so glad that little sinner repented in time .
There 's Diana signaling to me from her window .
"But now he knew her ; now , even in that ungainly dress , she smiled upon him , bright with love ; and his heart was transported with joy ."
"`` Sweetheart , '' he said , `` if ye forgive this blunderer , what care I ?"
"Make we direct for Holywood ; there lieth your good guardian and my better friend , Lord Foxham ."
"There shall we be wed ; and whether poor or wealthy , famous or unknown , what , matters it ?"
"This day , dear love , I won my spurs ; I was commended by great men for my valour ; I thought myself the goodliest man of war in all broad England ."
"Then , first , I fell out of my favour with the great ; and now have I been well thrashed , and clean lost my soldiers ."
There was a downfall for conceit !
"But , dear , I care not -- dear , if ye still love me and will wed , I would have my knighthood done away , and mind it not a jot . ''"
`` My Dick ! ''
she cried .
`` And did they knight you ? ''
"`` Ay , dear , ye are my lady now , '' he answered , fondly ; `` or ye shall , ere noon to-morrow -- will ye not ? ''"
"`` That will I , Dick , with a glad heart , '' she answered ."
"`` Ay , sir ?"
Methought ye were to be a monk ! ''
said a voice in their ears .
`` Alicia ! ''
cried Joanna .
"`` Even so , '' replied the young lady , coming forward ."
"`` Alicia , whom ye left for dead , and whom your lion-driver found , and brought to life again , and , by my sooth , made love to , if ye want to know ! ''"
"`` I 'll not believe it , '' cried Joanna ."
`` Dick ! ''
`` Dick ! ''
mimicked Alicia .
"`` Dick , indeed !"
"Ay , fair sir , and ye desert poor damsels in distress , '' she continued , turning to the young knight ."
`` Ye leave them planted behind oaks .
But they say true -- the age of chivalry is dead . ''
"`` Madam , '' cried Dick , in despair , `` upon my soul I had forgotten you outright ."
"Madam , ye must try to pardon me ."
"Ye see , I had new found Joanna ! ''"
"`` I did not suppose that ye had done it o ' purpose , '' she retorted ."
But here Dr. Livesey cut in .
"`` Stay a bit , '' said he , `` stay a bit ."
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling .
"The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words ."
"You do n't , you say , like this cruise ."
"Now , why ? ''"
"`` I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' said the captain ."
`` So far so good .
But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do .
"I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? ''"
"`` No , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . ''"
"`` Next , '' said the captain , `` I learn we are going after treasure -- hear it from my own hands , mind you ."
"Now , treasure is ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyages on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they are secret and when -LRB- begging your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret has been told to the parrot . ''"
`` Silver 's parrot ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` It 's a way of speaking , '' said the captain ."
"`` Blabbed , I mean ."
"It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . ''"
"`` That is all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' replied Dr. Livesey ."
"`` We take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us ."
"Next , you say you do n't like the crew ."
Are they not good seamen ? ''
"`` I do n't like them , sir , '' returned Captain Smollett ."
"`` And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that . ''"
"`` Perhaps you should , '' replied the doctor ."
"`` My friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional ."
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? ''
"`` I do n't , sir ."
"I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer ."
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! ''
`` Do you mean he drinks ? ''
cried the squire .
"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle , he wound his cloak around him , holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night , of which it was the blackest part , and muttering strangely to himself , stole away through the trees ."
Peter slept on .
"The light guttered -LSB- burned to edges -RSB- and went out , leaving the tenement in darkness ; but still he slept ."
"It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile , when he suddenly sat up in his bed , wakened by he knew not what ."
It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree .
"Soft and cautious , but in that stillness it was sinister ."
Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it .
Then he spoke .
`` Who is that ? ''
For long there was no answer : then again the knock .
`` Who are you ? ''
No answer .
"He was thrilled , and he loved being thrilled ."
In two strides he reached the door .
"Unlike Slightly 's door , it filled the aperture -LSB- opening -RSB- , so that he could not see beyond it , nor could the one knocking see him ."
"`` I wo n't open unless you speak , '' Peter cried ."
"Then at last the visitor spoke , in a lovely bell-like voice ."
"`` Let me in , Peter . ''"
"It was Tink , and quickly he unbarred to her ."
"She flew in excitedly , her face flushed and her dress stained with mud ."
`` What is it ? ''
"`` Oh , you could never guess ! ''"
"she cried , and offered him three guesses ."
`` Out with it ! ''
"he shouted , and in one ungrammatical sentence , as long as the ribbons that conjurers -LSB- magicians -RSB- pull from their mouths , she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys ."
Peter 's heart bobbed up and down as he listened .
"Wendy bound , and on the pirate ship ; she who loved everything to be just so !"
`` I 'll rescue her ! ''
"he cried , leaping at his weapons ."
As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her .
He could take his medicine .
His hand closed on the fatal draught .
"Without any waste of words , Alan plunged abruptly into the subject ."
"`` Miss Oliver , why have you avoided me so of late ?"
Have I done anything to offend you ? ''
`` No . ''
"She spoke as if the word hurt her , her eyes persistently cast down ."
`` Then what is the trouble ? ''
There was no answer .
She gave an unvoluntary glance around as if seeking some way of escape .
"There was none , for the spring was set about with thick young firs and Alan blocked the only path ."
He leaned forward and took her hands in his .
"`` Miss Oliver , you must tell me what the trouble is , '' he said firmly ."
"She pulled her hands away and flung them up to her face , her form shaken by stormy sobs ."
In distress he put his arm about her and drew her closer .
"`` Tell me , Lynde , '' he whispered tenderly ."
"She broke away from him , saying passionately , `` You must not come to Four Winds any more ."
You must not have anything more to do with us -- any of us .
We have done you enough harm already .
"But I never thought it could hurt you -- oh , I am sorry , sorry ! ''"
"`` Miss Oliver , I want to see that letter you received the other evening ."
Oh '' -- as she started with surprise -- `` I know about it -- Emily told me .
Who wrote it ? ''
"`` There was no name signed to it , '' she faltered ."
`` Just as I thought .
"Well , you must let me see it . ''"
`` I can not -- I burned it . ''
`` Then tell me what was in it .
You must .
This matter must be cleared up -- I am not going to have our beautiful friendship spoiled by the malice of some coward .
What did that letter say ? ''
`` It said that everybody in your congregation was talking about your frequent visits here -- that it had made a great scandal -- that it was doing you a great deal of injury and would probably end in your having to leave Rexton . ''
"`` That would be a catastrophe indeed , '' said Alan drily ."
"`` Well , what else ? ''"
"`` Why , '' I cried , `` the squire 's a gentleman ."
"And besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home . ''"
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` so you would . ''"
And he seemed very much relieved .
"`` Now , I 'll tell you what , '' he went on ."
"`` So much I 'll tell you , and no more ."
I were in Flint 's ship when he buried the treasure ; he and six along -- six strong seamen .
"They was ashore nigh on a week , and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS ."
"One fine day up went the signal , and here come Flint by himself in a little boat , and his head done up in a blue scarf ."
"The sun was getting up , and mortal white he looked about the cutwater ."
"But , there he was , you mind , and the six all dead -- dead and buried ."
"How he done it , not a man aboard us could make out ."
"It was battle , murder , and sudden death , leastways -- him against six ."
"Billy Bones was the mate ; Long John , he was quartermaster ; and they asked him where the treasure was ."
"` Ah , ' says he , ` you can go ashore , if you like , and stay , ' he says ; ` but as for the ship , she 'll beat up for more , by thunder ! '"
That 's what he said .
"`` Well , I was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island ."
"` Boys , ' said I , ` here 's Flint 's treasure ; let 's land and find it . '"
"The cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed ."
"Twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard ."
"` As for you , Benjamin Gunn , ' says they , ` here 's a musket , ' they says , ` and a spade , and pick-axe ."
"You can stay here and find Flint 's money for yourself , ' they says ."
"`` Well , Jim , three years have I been here , and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this ."
"But now , you look here ; look at me ."
Do I look like a man before the mast ?
"No , says you ."
"Nor I were n't , neither , I says . ''"
And with that he winked and pinched me hard .
"`` Just you mention them words to your squire , Jim , '' he went on ."
"`` Nor he were n't , neither -- that 's the words ."
"Three years he were the man of this island , light and dark , fair and rain ; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer -LRB- says you -RRB- , and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother , so be as she 's alive -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- ; but the most part of Gunn 's time -LRB- this is what you 'll say -RRB- -- the most part of his time was took up with another matter ."
"And then you 'll give him a nip , like I do . ''"
"He wanted John to decide , and John wanted him to decide ."
`` Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King ? ''
John inquired .
"Through Hook 's teeth came the answer : `` You would have to swear , ` Down with the King . ' ''"
"Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far , but he shone out now ."
"`` Then I refuse , '' he cried , banging the barrel in front of Hook ."
"`` And I refuse , '' cried Michael ."
`` Rule Britannia ! ''
squeaked Curly .
"The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth ; and Hook roared out , `` That seals your doom ."
Bring up their mother .
Get the plank ready . ''
"They were only boys , and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank ."
But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up .
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates .
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling ; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years .
There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger `` Dirty pig '' ; and she had already written it on several .
"But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought , of course , save for them ."
"`` So , my beauty , '' said Hook , as if he spoke in syrup , `` you are to see your children walk the plank . ''"
"Fine gentlemen though he was , the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff , and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it ."
"With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it , but he was too late ."
`` Are they to die ? ''
"asked Wendy , with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted ."
"`` They are , '' he snarled ."
"`` Silence all , '' he called gloatingly , `` for a mother 's last words to her children . ''"
At this moment Wendy was grand .
"`` These are my last words , dear boys , '' she said firmly ."
"`` I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers , and it is this : ` We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen . ' ''"
"Even the pirates were awed , and Tootles cried out hysterically , `` I am going to do what my mother hopes ."
"What are you to do , Nibs ? ''"
`` What my mother hopes .
"What are you to do , Twin ? ''"
Emily was quite sincere .
"Lynde had not told her , and Emily did not recognize him ."
"`` Well , Mr. Douglas did a brave thing in rescuing him , '' said Dr. Ames ."
`` I 'll be back tomorrow . ''
Harmon remained delirious for a week .
"Alan went every day to Four Winds , his interest in a man he had rescued explaining his visits to the Rexton people ."
"The Captain had returned and , though not absolutely uncivil , was taciturn and moody ."
Alan reflected grimly that Captain Anthony probably owed him a grudge for saving Harmon 's life .
"He never saw Lynde alone , but her strained , tortured face made his heart ache ."
Old Emily only seemed her natural self .
She waited on Harmon and Dr. Ames considered her a paragon of a nurse .
Alan thought it was well that Emily knew nothing more of Harmon than that he was an old friend of Captain Anthony 's .
"He felt sure that she would have walked out of the sick room and never reentered it had she guessed that the patient was the man whom , above all others , Lynde dreaded and feared ."
One afternoon when Alan went to Four Winds Emily met him at the door .
"`` He 's better , '' she announced ."
`` He had a good sleep this afternoon and when he woke he was quite himself .
You 'd better go up and see him .
I told him all I could but he wants to see you .
Anthony and Lynde are away to Crosse Harbour .
Go up and talk to him . ''
Harmon turned his head as the minister approached and held out his hand with a smile .
"`` You 're the preacher , I reckon ."
They tell me you were the man who pulled me out of that hurly-burly .
I was n't hardly worth saving but I 'm as grateful to you as if I was . ''
"`` I only -- did -- what any man would have done , '' said Alan , taking the offered hand ."
`` I do n't know about that .
"Anyhow , it 's not every man could have done it ."
I 'd been hanging in that rigging all day and most of the night before .
There were five more of us but they dropped off .
I knew it was no use to try to swim ashore alone -- the backwater would be too much for me .
I must have been a lot of trouble .
That old woman says I 've been raving for a week .
"Oh no , he just tormented her refined womanhood to the verge of frenzy , that was all ."
He died when you were a baby .
"And a year later I found out your mother could love me , rough sailor and all as I was ."
I married her and brought her here .
We had fifteen years of happiness together .
I 'm not a good man -- but I made your mother happy in spite of her wrecked health and her dark memories .
"It was her wish that you should be known as my daughter , but under the present circumstances I know she would wish that you should be told the truth ."
"Marry your man , Lynde , and go away with him ."
Emily will go with you if you like .
I 'm going back to the sea .
I 've been hankering for it ever since your mother died .
I 'll go out of your life .
"There , do n't cry -- I hate to see a woman cry ."
"Mr. Douglas , I 'll leave you to dry her tears and I 'll go up to the house and have a talk with Harmon . ''"
"When Captain Anthony had disappeared behind the Point , Alan turned to Lynde ."
She was sobbing softly and her face was wet with tears .
Alan drew her head down on his shoulder .
"`` Sweetheart , the dark past is all put by ."
Our future begins with promise .
"All is well with us , dear Lynde . ''"
"Like a child , she put her arms about his neck and their lips met ."
Marcella 's Reward Dr. Clark shook his head gravely .
"`` She is not improving as fast as I should like to see , '' he said ."
`` In fact -- er -- she seems to have gone backward the past week .
"You must send her to the country , Miss Langley ."
The heat here is too trying for her . ''
"Dr. Clark might as well have said , `` You must send her to the moon '' -- or so Marcella thought bitterly ."
Despair filled her heart as she looked at Patty 's white face and transparent hands and listened to the doctor 's coolly professional advice .
Patty 's illness had already swept away the scant savings of three years .
Marcella had nothing left with which to do anything more for her .
She did not make any answer to the doctor -- she could not .
"Besides , what could she say , with Patty 's big blue eyes , bigger and bluer than ever in her thin face , looking at her so wistfully ?"
"`` The boy who broke the rule last Friday , at afternoon recess , will come to the desk , '' said Mr. Acton in his most impressive manner ."
"If a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof it would hardly have caused a greater surprise than the sight of Jack Minot walking slowly down the aisle , with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on Joe as he passed him ."
"`` Now , Minot , let us have this over as soon as possible , for I do not like it any better than you do , and I am sure there is some mistake ."
I 'm told you went to the shop on Friday .
Is it true ? ''
"asked Mr. Acton very gently , for he liked Jack and seldom had to correct him in any way ."
"`` Yes , sir ; '' and Jack looked up as if proud to show that he was not afraid to tell the truth as far as he could ."
`` To buy something ? ''
"`` No , sir . ''"
`` To meet someone ? ''
"`` Yes , sir . ''"
`` Was it Jerry Shannon ? ''
"No answer , but Jack 's fists doubled up of themselves as he shot another fiery glance at Joe , whose face burned as if it scorched him ."
`` I am told it was ; also that you were seen to go into the saloon with him .
Did you ? ''
"and Mr. Acton looked so sure that it was a mistake that it cost Jack a great effort to say , slowly , -- `` Yes , sir . ''"
"Quite a thrill pervaded the school at this confession , for Jerry was one of the wild fellows the boys all shunned , and to have any dealings with him was considered a very disgraceful thing ."
`` Did you play ? ''
"`` No , sir ."
I ca n't . ''
`` Drink beer ? ''
"`` I belong to the Lodge ; '' and Jack stood as erect as any little soldier who ever marched under a temperance banner , and fought for the cause none are too young nor too old to help along ."
`` I was sure of that .
"Then what took you there , my boy ? ''"
"The question was so kindly put that Jack forgot himself an instant , and blurted out , -- `` I only went to pay him some money , sir . ''"
"`` Ah , how much ? ''"
"`` Two seventy-five , '' muttered Jack , as red as a cherry at not being able to keep a secret better ."
`` Too much for a lad like you to owe such a fellow as Jerry .
How came it ? ''
And Mr. Acton looked disturbed .
"Jack opened his lips to speak , but shut them again , and stood looking down with a little quiver about the mouth that showed how much it cost him to be silent ."
`` Does any one beside Jerry know of this ? ''
Christopher shook his head .
"`` No , I understand they 're not on very good terms ."
Sara do n't like Charles Stuart or his wife -- and I do n't blame her .
"She wo n't stay there , not likely ."
Probably she 'll go and live in town .
Strange she never married .
"She was reckoned handsome , and had plenty of beaus at one time . ''"
Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog .
To stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more than he could endure .
"The men idly watched his tall , erect figure as he went along the valley ."
"`` Queer chap , Jeff , '' said Alec Churchill reflectively ."
"`` Jeff 's all right , '' said Christopher in a patronizing way ."
`` There ai n't a better man or neighbour alive .
"I 've lived next farm to him for thirty years , so I ought to know ."
But he 's queer sartainly -- not like other people -- kind of unsociable .
He do n't care for a thing ` cept dogs and reading and mooning round woods and fields .
"That ai n't natural , you know ."
But I must say he 's a good farmer .
"He 's got the best farm in Bayside , and that 's a real nice house he put up on it ."
Ai n't it an odd thing he never married ?
Never seemed to have no notion of it .
I ca n't recollect of Jeff Miller 's ever courting anybody .
That 's another unnatural thing about him . ''
"`` I 've always thought that Jeff thought himself a cut or two above the rest of us , '' said Tom Scovel with a sneer ."
`` Maybe he thinks the Bayside girls ai n't good enough for him . ''
"`` There ai n't no such dirty pride about Jeff , '' pronounced Christopher conclusively ."
"`` And the Millers are the best family hereabouts , leaving the kunnel 's out ."
"And Jeff 's well off -- nobody knows how well , I reckon , but I can guess , being his land neighbour ."
"Jeff ai n't no fool nor loafer , if he is a bit queer . ''"
"Meanwhile , the object of these remarks was striding homeward and thinking , not of the men behind him , but of Sara Stuart ."
He must go to her at once .
"He had not intruded on her since her father 's death , thinking her sorrow too great for him to meddle with ."
`` Sure thing .
I 'm here for a look-in .
Can I come up to Ingleside tonight and see you ? ''
`` Of courthe . ''
Had he used `` you '' in the singular or plural sense ?
"Presently she would wring Jims ' neck -- oh , what was Ken saying ?"
"`` See here , Rilla , can you arrange that there wo n't be more than a few dozen people round ?"
Understand ?
I ca n't make my meaning clearer over this bally rural line .
There are a dozen receivers down . ''
Did she understand !
"Yes , she understood ."
"`` I 'll try , '' she said ."
`` I 'll be up about eight then .
By-by . ''
Rilla hung up the ` phone and flew to Jims .
But she did not wring that injured infant 's neck .
"Instead she snatched him bodily out of his chair , crushed him against her face , kissed him rapturously on his milky mouth , and danced wildly around the room with him in her arms ."
"After this Jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity , gave him the rest of his dinner properly , and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all ."
"She sewed at Red Cross shirts for the rest of the afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams , all a-quiver with rainbows ."
Ken wanted to see her -- to see her alone .
That could be easily managed .
"Shirley would n't bother them , father and mother were going to the Manse , Miss Oliver never played gooseberry , and Jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven ."
"She would entertain Ken on the veranda -- it would be moonlight -- she would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair up -- yes , she would -- at least in a low knot at the nape of her neck ."
"Mother could n't object to that , surely ."
"Oh , how wonderful and romantic it would be !"
Would Ken say anything -- he must mean to say something or why should he be so particular about seeing her alone ?
What if it rained -- Susan had been complaining about Mr. Hyde that morning !
What if some officious Junior Red called to discuss Belgians and shirts ?
"Or , worst of all , what if Fred Arnold dropped in ?"
He did occasionally .
The evening came at last and was all that could be desired in an evening .
"`` You both have the advantage of me , '' sighed Anne ."
"`` You 're going to teach children who do n't know you , but I have to teach my own old schoolmates , and Mrs. Lynde says she 's afraid they wo n't respect me as they would a stranger unless I 'm very cross from the first ."
But I do n't believe a teacher should be cross .
"Oh , it seems to me such a responsibility ! ''"
"`` I guess we 'll get on all right , '' said Jane comfortably ."
Jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good .
"She meant to earn her salary fairly , please the trustees , and get her name on the School Inspector 's roll of honor ."
Further ambitions Jane had none .
`` The main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that .
If my pupils wo n't do as I tell them I shall punish them . ''
`` How ? ''
"`` Give them a good whipping , of course . ''"
"`` Oh , Jane , you would n't , '' cried Anne , shocked ."
"`` Jane , you COULD N'T ! ''"
"`` Indeed , I could and would , if they deserved it , '' said Jane decidedly ."
"`` I could NEVER whip a child , '' said Anne with equal decision ."
`` I do n't believe in it AT ALL .
Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order ; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all .
"No , if I ca n't get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school ."
There are better ways of managing .
I shall try to win my pupils ' affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them . ''
`` But suppose they do n't ? ''
said practical Jane .
`` I would n't whip them anyhow .
I 'm sure it would n't do any good .
"Oh , do n't whip your pupils , Jane dear , no matter what they do . ''"
"`` What do you think about it , Gilbert ? ''"
demanded Jane .
`` Do n't you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then ? ''
"`` Do n't you think it 's a cruel , barbarous thing to whip a child ... ANY child ? ''"
"exclaimed Anne , her face flushing with earnestness ."
"`` Well , '' said Gilbert slowly , torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to Anne 's ideal , `` there 's something to be said on both sides ."
"` Then , ' said Peter , not without grimness , ` step in , if you feel so sure of her , ' and he helped Maimie into the Thrush 's Nest ."
` But why do n't you look at me ? '
"she asked , taking him by the arm ."
"Peter tried hard not to look , he tried to push off , then he gave a great gulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow ."
She went to him .
"` What is it , dear , dear Peter ? '"
"she said , wondering . '"
"O Maimie , ' he cried , ` it is n't fair to take you with me if you think you can go back !"
Your mother ' -- he gulped again -- ` you do n't know them as well as I do . '
"And then he told her the woeful story of how he had been barred out , and she gasped all the time ."
"` But my mother , ' she said , ' my mother -- ' ` Yes , she would , ' said Peter , ` they are all the same ."
I dare say she is looking for another one already . '
"Maimie said aghast , ' I ca n't believe it ."
"You see , when you went away your mother had none , but my mother has Tony , and surely they are satisfied when they have one . '"
"Peter replied bitterly , ` You should see the letters Solomon gets from ladies who have six . '"
"Just then they heard a grating creak , followed by creak , creak , all round the Gardens ."
"It was the Opening of the Gates , and Peter jumped nervously into his boat ."
"He knew Maimie would not come with him now , and he was trying bravely not to cry ."
But Maimie was sobbing painfully .
"` If I should be too late , ' she said in agony , ' O Peter , if she has got another one already ! '"
Again he sprang ashore as if she had called him back . '
"I shall come and look for you to-night , ' he said , squeezing close , ` but if you hurry away I think you will be in time . '"
"Then he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth , and covered his face with his hands so that he might not see her go ."
` Dear Peter ! '
she cried .
` Dear Maimie ! '
cried the tragic boy .
"She leapt into his arms , so that it was a sort of fairy wedding , and then she hurried away ."
"Oh , how she hastened to the gates !"
"Peter , you may be sure , was back in the Gardens that night as soon as Lock-out sounded , but he found no Maimie , and so he knew she had been in time ."
"For long he hoped that some night she would come back to him ; often he thought he saw her waiting for him by the shore of the Serpentine as his bark drew to land , but Maimie never went back ."
"She wanted to , but she was afraid that if she saw her dear Betwixt-and-Between again she would linger with him too long , and besides the ayah now kept a sharp eye on her ."
Do n't you think it 's about time I joined up ? ''
The pale mother looked at him .
`` Two of my sons have gone and one will never return .
"Must I give you too , Shirley ? ''"
The age-old cry -- `` Joseph is not and Simeon is not ; and ye will take Benjamin away . ''
How the mothers of the Great War echoed the old Patriarch 's moan of so many centuries agone !
"`` You would n't have me a slacker , mother ?"
I can get into the flying-corps .
"What say , dad ? ''"
The doctor 's hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for Abbie Flagg 's rheumatism .
"He had known this moment was coming , yet he was not altogether prepared for it ."
"He answered slowly , `` I wo n't try to hold you back from what you believe to be your duty ."
But you must not go unless your mother says you may . ''
Shirley said nothing more .
He was not a lad of many words .
"Anne did not say anything more just then , either ."
"She was thinking of little Joyce 's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour -- little Joyce who would have been a woman now , had she lived -- of the white cross in France and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her knee -- of Jem in the terrible trenches -- of Nan and Di and Rilla , waiting -- waiting -- waiting , while the golden years of youth passed by -- and she wondered if she could bear any more ."
She thought not ; surely she had given enough .
Yet that night she told Shirley that he might go .
They did not tell Susan right away .
"She did not know it until , a few days later , Shirley presented himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform ."
Susan did n't make half the fuss she had made when Jem and Walter had gone .
"She said stonily , `` So they 're going to take you , too . ''"
`` Take me ?
No .
"I 'm going , Susan -- got to . ''"
"Susan sat down by the table , folded her knotted old hands , that had grown warped and twisted working for the Ingleside children to still their shaking , and said : `` Yes , you must go ."
"I did not see once why such things must be , but I can see now . ''"
"`` You 're a brick , Susan , '' said Shirley ."
"He was relieved that she took it so coolly -- he had been a little afraid , with a boy 's horror of `` a scene . ''"
"He went out whistling gaily ; but half an hour later , when pale Anne Blythe came in , Susan was still sitting there ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' said Susan , making an admission she would once have died rather than make , `` I feel very old ."
"`` No , sir , '' replied the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . ''"
"`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` Tell us what you want . ''
"`` Well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ? ''"
"`` Like iron , '' answered the squire ."
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
"`` Then , as you 've heard me very patiently , saying things that I could not prove , hear me a few words more ."
They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold .
"Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?"
-- first point .
"Then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward ."
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ?
-- second point . ''
`` Any more ? ''
asked Mr. Trelawney .
"`` One more , '' said the captain ."
`` There 's been too much blabbing already . ''
"`` Far too much , '' agreed the doctor ."
"`` I 'll tell you what I 've heard myself , '' continued Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies -- '' And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly ."
"`` I never told that , '' cried the squire , `` to a soul ! ''"
"`` The hands know it , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Livesey , that must have been you or Hawkins , '' cried the squire ."
"`` It does n't much matter who it was , '' replied the doctor ."
And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations .
"Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island ."
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' continued the captain , `` I do n't know who has this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow ."
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . ''
"`` I see , '' said the doctor ."
"`` You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend 's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board ."
"In other words , you fear a mutiny . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put words into my mouth ."
The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat .
"He was a long time finding it , and when he did he went softly to the door ."
"With his hand on the knob , he paused and looked back ."
"`` Good-bye , Miss Rangely , '' he said softly ."
"But Katherine , whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge , did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone ."
"* * * * * Katharine felt that life was stale , flat and unprofitable when she alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening ."
She was not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her .
She walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered her room unannounced .
"Edith , who was lying on the bed , sprang up with a surprised greeting ."
"It was too dark to be sure , but Katherine had an uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying , and her heart quaked guiltily ."
Could Edith have suspected anything ?
"`` Why , we did n't think you 'd be up till the 8:30 train , and Ned and I were going to meet you . ''"
"`` I found I could catch an earlier train , so I took it , '' said Katherine , as she dropped listlessly into a chair ."
`` I am tired to death and I have such a headache .
"I ca n't see anyone tonight , not even Ned . ''"
"`` You poor dear , '' said Edith sympathetically , beginning a search for the cologne ."
`` Lie down on the bed and I 'll bathe your poor head .
Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill ?
And how did you leave Sid ?
Did he say anything about coming up ? ''
"`` Oh , he was quite well , '' said Katherine wearily ."
`` I did n't hear him say if he intended to come up or not .
"There , thanks -- that will do nicely . ''"
"After Edith had gone down , Katherine tossed about restlessly ."
She knew Ned had come and she did not want to see him .
"But , after all , it was only putting off the evil day , and it was treating him rather shabbily ."
She would go down for a minute .
"There were two doors to the parlour , and Katherine went by way of the library one , over which a portiere was hanging ."
Her hand was lifted to draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement .
A woman was crying in the room beyond .
It was Edith -- and what was she saying ?
"`` Oh , Ned , it is all perfectly dreadful !"
"` Shall I after him , captain , ' asked pathetic Smee , ` and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew ? '"
"Smee had pleasant names for everything , and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew , because he wriggled it in the wound ."
One could mention many lovable traits in Smee .
"For instance , after killing , it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon ."
"` Johnny 's a silent fellow , ' he reminded Hook ."
"` Not now , Smee , ' Hook said darkly ."
"` He is only one , and I want to mischief all the seven ."
Scatter and look for them . '
"The pirates disappeared among the trees , and in a moment their captain and Smee were alone ."
"Hook heaved a heavy sigh ; and I know not why it was , perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening , but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo ` sun the story of his life ."
"He spoke long and earnestly , but what it was all about Smee , who was rather stupid , did not know in the least ."
Anon he caught the word Peter .
"` Most of all , ' Hook was saying passionately , ' I want their captain , Peter Pan ."
'T was he cut off my arm . '
He brandished the hook threateningly .
` I 've waited long to shake his hand with this .
"Oh , I 'll tear him . '"
"` And yet , ' said Smee , ' I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands , for combing the hair and other homely uses . '"
"` Ay , ' the captain answered , ` if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that , ' and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other ."
Then again he frowned .
"` Peter flung my arm , ' he said , wincing , ` to a crocodile that happened to be passing by . ' '"
"I have often , ' said Smee , ` noticed your strange dread of crocodiles . '"
"` Not of crocodiles , ' Hook corrected him , ` but of that one crocodile . '"
He lowered his voice .
"` It liked my arm so much , Smee , that it has followed me ever since , from sea to sea and from land to land , licking its lips for the rest of me . '"
"` In a way , ' said Smee , ` it 's a sort of compliment . ' '"
"I want no such compliments , ' Hook barked petulantly . '"
"I want Peter Pan , who first gave the brute its taste for me . '"
"He sat down on a large mushroom , and now there was a quiver in his voice ."
"` Smee , ' he said huskily , ` that crocodile would have had me before this , but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it , and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt . '"
"He laughed , but in a hollow way ."
"` Some day , ' said Smee , ` the clock will run down , and then he 'll get you . '"
`` It 's Max Seeley .
"You need n't laugh , Al. ."
It 's a fact .
I noticed it the minute I introduced them .
"He 's plump and prosperous and she 's pinched and pale , but there 's a resemblance nevertheless ."
Look for yourself and see if it is n't so . ''
"Back in the big , cheery parlour the Thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways ."
"Max Seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to Miss Price , and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge ."
"Ernest Allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters , the `` uncles and cousins and aunts '' were all chattering to each other , and Mr. Seeley and Miss Price were quite unnoticed ."
"`` You will excuse me , wo n't you , Miss Price , if I ask you something about yourself ? ''"
he said eagerly .
"`` The truth is , you look so strikingly like someone I used to know that I feel sure you must be related to her ."
I do not think I have any relatives of your name .
Have you any of mine ? ''
"Bertha flushed , hesitated for an instant , then said frankly , `` No , I do not think so ."
"But I may as well tell you that Price is not my real name and I do not know what it is , although I think it begins with S. I believe that my parents died when I was about three years old , and I was then taken to an orphan asylum ."
The next year I was taken from there and adopted by Mrs. Price .
She was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter .
"I had a happy home with her , although we were poor ."
"Mrs. Price wished me to bear her name , and I did so ."
"She never told me my true surname , perhaps she did not know it ."
"She died when I was sixteen , and since then I have been quite alone in the world ."
That is all I know about myself . ''
Max Seeley was plainly excited .
`` Why do you think your real name begins with S ? ''
he asked .
"`` I have a watch which belonged to my mother , with the monogram ` B.S. ' on the case ."
It was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to Mrs. Price for me .
Here it is . ''
"Max Seeley almost snatched the old-fashioned little silver watch , from her hand and opened the case ."
An exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side .
"They looked like the initials M.A.S. `` Let me tell my story now , '' he said ."
"Let 's hear it , '' said Carol ."
"`` Let 's write letters -- rainy-day letters -- to everyone in the house , '' said Cyrilla ."
"`` You may depend all the rest of the folks under Mrs. Plunkett 's hospitable roof are feeling more or less blue and lonely too , as well as ourselves ."
"Let 's write them the jolliest , nicest letters we can compose and get Nora Jane to take them to their rooms ."
"There 's that pale little sewing girl , I do n't believe she ever gets letters from anybody , and Miss Marshall , I 'm sure she does n't , and poor old Mrs. Johnson , whose only son died last month , and the new music teacher who came yesterday , a letter of welcome to her -- and old Mr. Grant , yes , and Mrs. Plunkett too , thanking her for all her kindness to us ."
You knew she has been awfully nice to us in spite of the oil stove ukase .
That 's six -- two apiece .
"Let 's do it , girls . ''"
Cyrilla 's sudden enthusiasm for her plan infected the others .
"`` It 's a nice idea , '' said Mary , brightening up ."
`` But who 's to write to whom ?
I 'm willing to take anybody but Miss Marshall .
I could n't write a line to her to save my life .
"She 'd be horrified at anything funny or jokey and our letters will have to be mainly nonsense -- nonsense of the best brand , to be sure , but still nonsense . ''"
"`` Better leave Miss Marshall out , '' suggested Carol ."
`` You know she disapproves of us anyhow .
"She 'd probably resent a letter of the sort , thinking we were trying to play some kind of joke on her . ''"
"`` It would never do to leave her out , '' said Cyrilla decisively ."
"`` Of course , she 's a bit queer and unamiable , but , girls , think of thirty years of boarding-house life , even with the best of Plunketts ."
Would n't that sour anybody ?
You know it would .
"You 'd be cranky and grumbly and disagreeable too , I dare say ."
I 'm really sorry for Miss Marshall .
She 's had a very hard life .
Mrs. Plunkett told me all about her one day .
I do n't think we should mind her biting little speeches and sharp looks .
"And anyway , even if she is really as disagreeable as she sometimes seems to be , why , it must make it all the harder for her , do n't you think ?"
So she needs a letter most of all .
"I 'll write to her , since it 's my suggestion ."
We 'll draw lots for the others . ''
"Besides Miss Marshall , the new music teacher fell to Cyrilla 's share ."
"Mary drew Mrs. Plunkett and the dressmaker , and Carol drew Mrs. Johnson and old Mr. Grant ."
Then he looked sharply at his ward .
"`` Dick , '' said he , `` Y ' have seen this penny rhyme ? ''"
The lad replied in the affirmative .
"`` It bears your father 's name , '' continued the knight ; `` and our poor shrew of a parson is , by some mad soul , accused of slaying him . ''"
"`` He did most eagerly deny it , '' answered Dick ."
`` He did ? ''
"cried the knight , very sharply ."
`` Heed him not .
He has a loose tongue ; he babbles like a jack-sparrow .
"Some day , when I may find the leisure , Dick , I will myself more fully inform you of these matters ."
"There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it ; but the times were troubled , and there was no justice to be got . ''"
`` It befell at the Moat House ? ''
"Dick ventured , with a beating at his heart ."
"`` It befell between the Moat House and Holywood , '' replied Sir Daniel , calmly ; but he shot a covert glance , black with suspicion , at Dick 's face ."
"`` And now , '' added the knight , `` speed you with your meal ; ye shall return to Tunstall with a line from me . ''"
Dick 's face fell sorely .
"`` Prithee , Sir Daniel , '' he cried , `` send one of the villains !"
I beseech you let me to the battle .
"I can strike a stroke , I promise you . ''"
"`` I misdoubt it not , '' replied Sir Daniel , sitting down to write ."
"`` But here , Dick , is no honour to be won ."
"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war , and then ride to join me with the conqueror ."
"Cry not on cowardice ; it is but wisdom , Dick ; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion , and the king 's name and custody so changeth hands , that no man may be certain of the morrow ."
"Toss-pot and Shuttle-wit run in , but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o ' one side , waiting . ''"
"With that , Sir Daniel , turning his back to Dick , and quite at the farther end of the long table , began to write his letter , with his mouth on one side , for this business of the Black Arrow stuck sorely in his throat ."
"Meanwhile , young Shelton was going on heartily enough with his breakfast , when he felt a touch upon his arm , and a very soft voice whispering in his ear ."
"`` Make not a sign , I do beseech you , '' said the voice , `` but of your charity tell me the straight way to Holywood ."
"Beseech you , now , good boy , comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress , and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose . ''"
"`` Take the path by the windmill , '' answered Dick , in the same tone ; `` it will bring you to Till Ferry ; there inquire again . ''"
"And without turning his head , he fell again to eating ."
But with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called Master John stealthily creeping from the room .
"`` Why , '' thought Dick , `` he is a young as I. ` Good boy ' doth he call me ?"
"`` Ay , they hate Sir Daniel , and they hate every man that serves with him , '' said Appleyard ; `` and in the first order of hating , they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the bowman ."
"See ye here : if there was a stout fellow yonder in the wood-edge , and you and I stood fair for him -- as , by Saint George , we stand !"
"-- which , think ye , would he choose ? ''"
"`` You , for a good wager , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` My surcoat to a leather belt , it would be you ! ''"
cried the old archer .
"`` Ye burned Grimstone , Bennet -- they 'll ne'er forgive you that , my master ."
"And as for me , I 'll soon be in a good place , God grant , and out of bow-shoot -- ay , and cannon-shoot -- of all their malices ."
"I am an old man , and draw fast to homeward , where the bed is ready ."
"But for you , Bennet , y ' are to remain behind here at your own peril , and if ye come to my years unhanged , the old true-blue English spirit will be dead . ''"
"`` Y ' are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest , '' returned Hatch , visibly ruffled by these threats ."
"`` Get ye to your arms before Sir Oliver come , and leave prating for one good while ."
"An ye had talked so much with Harry the Fift , his ears would ha ' been richer than his pocket . ''"
"An arrow sang in the air , like a huge hornet ; it struck old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades , and pierced him clean through , and he fell forward on his face among the cabbages ."
"Hatch , with a broken cry , leapt into the air ; then , stooping double , he ran for the cover of the house ."
"And in the meanwhile Dick Shelton had dropped behind a lilac , and had his crossbow bent and shouldered , covering the point of the forest ."
Not a leaf stirred .
The sheep were patiently browsing ; the birds had settled .
"But there lay the old man , with a cloth-yard arrow standing in his back ; and there were Hatch holding to the gable , and Dick crouching and ready behind the lilac bush ."
`` D'ye see aught ? ''
cried Hatch .
"`` Not a twig stirs , '' said Dick ."
"`` I think shame to leave him lying , '' said Bennet , coming forward once more with hesitating steps and a very pale countenance ."
"`` Keep a good eye on the wood , Master Shelton -- keep a clear eye on the wood ."
The saints assoil us !
here was a good shoot ! ''
Bennet raised the old archer on his knee .
"He was not yet dead ; his face worked , and his eyes shut and opened like machinery , and he had a most horrible , ugly look of one in pain ."
"`` Can ye hear , old Nick ? ''"
asked Hatch .
"`` Have ye a last wish before ye wend , old brother ? ''"
"`` Pluck out the shaft , and let me pass , a ' Mary 's name ! ''"
"Some of them quite costly , too ; that is , they will cost me something , but I know I 'll be better off and richer after I 've paid the price ."
"That is what Mr. Grierson would call a paradox , is n't it ?"
I 'll explain all about it to you on Christmas Day . ''
"On Christmas Day , Clorinda went over to Aunt Emmy 's ."
"It was a faded brown Christmas after all , for the snow had not come ."
But Clorinda did not mind ; there was such joy in her heart that she thought it the most delightful Christmas Day that ever dawned .
She put the queer cornery armful she carried down on the kitchen floor before she went into the sitting room .
"Aunt Emmy was lying on the sofa before the fire , and Clorinda sat down beside her ."
"`` I 've come to tell you all about it , '' she said ."
Aunt Emmy patted the hand that was in her own .
"`` From your face , dear girl , it will be pleasant hearing and telling , '' she said ."
Clorinda nodded .
"`` Aunt Emmy , I thought for days over your meaning ... thought until I was dizzy ."
"And then one evening it just came to me , without any thinking at all , and I knew that I could give some gifts after all ."
I thought of something new every day for a week .
"At first I did n't think I could give some of them , and then I thought how selfish I was ."
"I would have been willing to pay any amount of money for gifts if I had had it , but I was n't willing to pay what I had ."
"I got over that , though , Aunt Emmy ."
Now I 'm going to tell you what I did give .
"`` First , there was my teacher , Miss Mitchell ."
I gave her one of father 's books .
"I have so many of his , you know , so that I would n't miss one ; but still it was one I loved very much , and so I felt that that love made it worth while ."
"That is , I felt that on second thought ."
"At first , Aunt Emmy , I thought I would be ashamed to offer Miss Mitchell a shabby old book , worn with much reading and all marked over with father 's notes and pencillings ."
I was afraid she would think it queer of me to give her such a present .
And yet somehow it seemed to me that it was better than something brand new and unmellowed -- that old book which father had loved and which I loved .
"So I gave it to her , and she understood ."
"I think it pleased her so much , the real meaning in it ."
She said it was like being given something out of another 's heart and life .
"`` Then you know Mrs. Martin ... last year she was Miss Hope , my dear Sunday School teacher ."
"She married a home missionary , and they are in a lonely part of the west ."
"Well , I wrote her a letter ."
"`` I take care of myself and Boo , and she looks after you ."
The house goes any way . ''
`` I should think so !
I nearly broke my neck over the parlor sofa in the hall to-night .
What is it there for ? ''
Molly laughed .
"`` That 's the joke , sir , Miss Bat is cleaning house , and I 'm sure it needs cleaning , for it is years since it was properly done ."
I thought you might have told her to . ''
`` I 've said nothing .
Do n't like house-cleaning well enough to suggest it .
I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint .
Is she going to upset the whole place ? ''
"asked Mr. Bemis , looking alarmed at the prospect ."
"`` I hope so , for I really am ashamed when people come , to have them see the dust and cobwebs , and old carpets and dirty windows , '' said Molly , with a sigh , though she never had cared a bit till lately ."
"`` Why do n't you dust round a little , then ?"
No time to spare from the books and play ? ''
"`` I tried , father , but Miss Bat did n't like it , and it was too hard for me alone ."
"If things were once in nice order , I think I could keep them so ; for I do want to be neat , and I 'm learning as fast as I can . ''"
"`` It is high time someone took hold , if matters are left as you say ."
"I 've just been thinking what a clever woman Miss Bat was , to make such a tidy little girl out of what I used to hear called the greatest tomboy in town , and wondering what I could give the old lady ."
"Now I find you are the one to be thanked , and it is a very pleasant surprise to me . ''"
"`` Give her the present , please ; I 'm satisfied , if you like what I 've done ."
"It is n't much , and I did n't know as you would ever observe any difference ."
"But I did try , and now I guess I 'm really getting on , '' said Molly , sewing away with a bright color in her cheeks , for she , too , found it a pleasant surprise to be praised after many failures and few successes ."
"`` You certainly are , my dear ."
"I 'll wait till the house-cleaning is over , and then , if we are all alive , I 'll see about Miss Bat 's reward ."
"Meantime , you go with Mrs. Grant and get whatever you and the boy need , and send the bills to me ; '' and Mr. Bemis lighted a cigar , as if that matter was settled ."
"`` Oh , thank you , sir !"
That will be splendid .
"Merry always has pretty things , and I know you will like me when I get fixed , '' said Molly , smoothing down her apron , with a little air ."
`` Seems to me you look very well as you are .
Is n't that a pretty enough frock ? ''
"Do you think you can like me a little , Mary ? ''"
"It may be that Mrs. Hayden was not very much surprised , because Harrington 's face had been like an open book the day they chased the pig out of the garden together ."
"As for what she said , perhaps Bobbles , who was surreptitiously gorging himself on Harrington 's strawberries , may tell you , but I certainly shall not ."
The little brown house among the apple trees is shut up now and the boundary fence belongs to ancient history .
Sarah King has gone also and Mrs. John Harrington reigns royally in her place .
"Bobbles and Ted have a small , blue-eyed , much-spoiled sister , and there is a pig on the estate who may die of old age , but will never meet his doom otherwise ."
It is Bobbles ' pig and one of the famous fourteen .
Mordecai still shambles around and worships Mrs. Harrington .
"The garden is the same as of yore , but the house is a different place and Harrington is a different man ."
"And Mordecai will tell you with a chuckle , `` It was them notorious pigs as did it all . ''"
Why Not Ask Miss Price ?
"Frances Allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother , who was making mincemeat ."
"Alma Allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask , `` What is the matter ?"
"You look as if your letter contained unwelcome news , Fan . ''"
`` So it does .
"It is from Aunt Clara , to say she can not come ."
She has received a telegram that her sister-in-law is very ill and she must go to her at once . ''
"Mrs. Allen looked regretful , and Alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air ."
`` That is too bad .
I feel as if our celebration were spoiled .
But I suppose it ca n't be helped . ''
"`` No , '' agreed Frances , sitting down and beginning to peel apples ."
"`` So there is no use in lamenting , or I would certainly sit down and cry , I feel so disappointed . ''"
`` Is Uncle Frank coming ? ''
"`` Yes , Aunt Clara says he will come down from Stellarton if Mrs. King does not get worse ."
So that will leave just one vacant place .
We must invite someone to fill it up .
Who shall it be ? ''
Both girls looked rather puzzled .
Mrs. Allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet .
She had handed the Thanksgiving dinner over to Frances and Alma this year .
They were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests .
"cried I. `` Rum , '' he repeated ."
`` I must get away from here .
Rum !
Rum ! ''
"I ran to fetch it , but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out , and I broke one glass and fouled the tap , and while I was still getting in my own way , I heard a loud fall in the parlour , and running in , beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor ."
"At the same instant my mother , alarmed by the cries and fighting , came running downstairs to help me ."
Between us we raised his head .
"He was breathing very loud and hard , but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour ."
"`` Dear , deary me , '' cried my mother , `` what a disgrace upon the house !"
And your poor father sick ! ''
"In the meantime , we had no idea what to do to help the captain , nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger ."
"I got the rum , to be sure , and tried to put it down his throat , but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron ."
"It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in , on his visit to my father ."
"`` Oh , doctor , '' we cried , `` what shall we do ?"
Where is he wounded ? ''
`` Wounded ?
A fiddle-stick 's end ! ''
said the doctor .
`` No more wounded than you or I .
"The man has had a stroke , as I warned him ."
"Now , Mrs. Hawkins , just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him , if possible , nothing about it ."
"For my part , I must do my best to save this fellow 's trebly worthless life ; Jim , you get me a basin . ''"
"When I got back with the basin , the doctor had already ripped up the captain 's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm ."
It was tattooed in several places .
"`` Here 's luck , '' `` A fair wind , '' and `` Billy Bones his fancy , '' were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm ; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it -- done , as I thought , with great spirit ."
"`` Prophetic , '' said the doctor , touching this picture with his finger ."
"`` And now , Master Billy Bones , if that be your name , we 'll have a look at the colour of your blood ."
"Jim , '' he said , `` are you afraid of blood ? ''"
"`` No , sir , '' said I. `` Well , then , '' said he , `` you hold the basin '' ; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein ."
A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him .
"First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown ; then his glance fell upon me , and he looked relieved ."
"But suddenly his colour changed , and he tried to raise himself , crying , `` Where 's Black Dog ? ''"
`` Never mind .
Please push up my table .
"I must write a letter , and I want you to post it for me to-night , and never say a word till I give you leave . ''"
"`` Oh , now you are going to have secrets and be mysterious , and get into a mess , are you ? ''"
"and Frank looked down at her with a suspicious air , though he was intensely curious to know what she was about ."
`` Go away till I 'm done .
"You will have to see the outside , but you ca n't know the inside till the answer comes ; '' and propping herself up , Jill wrote the following note , with some hesitation at the beginning and end , for she did not know the gentleman she was addressing , except by sight , and it was rather awkward : -- `` Robert Walker ."
"`` Dear Sir , I want to ask if Jack Minot came to see you last Friday afternoon ."
He got into trouble being seen with Jerry Shannon .
He paid him some money .
"Jack wo n't tell , and Mr. Acton talked to him about it before all the school ."
"We feel bad , because we think Jack did not do wrong ."
"I do n't know as you have anything to do with it , but I thought I 'd ask ."
Please answer quick .
"Respectfully yours , `` Jane Pecq '' To make sure that her despatch was not tampered with , Jill put a great splash of red sealing-wax on it , which gave it a very official look , and much impressed Bob when he received it ."
`` There !
"Go and post it , and do n't let any one see or know about it , '' she said , handing it over to Frank , who left his work with unusual alacrity to do her errand ."
"When his eye fell on the address , he laughed , and said in a teasing way , -- `` Are you and Bob such good friends that you correspond ?"
What will Jack say ? ''
"`` Do n't know , and do n't care !"
"Be good , now , and let 's have a little secret as well as other folks ."
"I 'll tell you all about it when he answers , '' said Jill in her most coaxing tone ."
`` Suppose he does n't ? ''
`` Then I shall send you up to see him .
"I must know something , and I want to do it myself , if I can . ''"
`` Look here ; what are you after ?
"I do believe you think -- '' Frank got no farther , for Jill gave a little scream , and stopped him by crying eagerly , `` Do n't say it out loud !"
"I really do believe it may be , and I 'm going to find out . ''"
`` What made you think of him ? ''
"and Frank looked thoughtfully at the letter , as if turning carefully over in his mind the idea that Jill 's quick wits had jumped at ."
`` Come here and I 'll tell you . ''
"Holding him by one button , she whispered something in his ear that made him exclaim , with a look at the rug , -- `` No !"
said Mrs. Danby .
"`` He lives down there at Four Winds , as they call it -- he and his daughter and an old cousin . ''"
"Isabel King bent forward , her brown eyes on Alan 's face ."
`` Did you see Lynde Oliver ? ''
she asked with suppressed eagerness .
Alan ignored the question -- perhaps he did not hear it .
`` Have they lived there long ? ''
he asked .
"`` For eighteen years , '' said Mrs. Danby placidly ."
`` It 's funny you have n't heard them mentioned .
"But people do n't talk much about the Captain now -- he 's an old story -- and of course they never go anywhere , not even to church ."
The Captain is a rank infidel and they say his daughter is just as bad .
"To be sure , nobody knows much about her , but it stands to reason that a girl who 's had her bringing up must be odd , to say no worse of her ."
"It 's not really her fault , I suppose -- her wicked old scalawag of a father is to blame for it ."
"She 's never darkened a church or school door in her life and they say she 's always been a regular tomboy -- running wild outdoors with dogs , and fishing and shooting like a man ."
Nobody ever goes there -- the Captain does n't want visitors .
"He must have done something dreadful in his time , if it was only known , when he 's so set on living like a hermit away down on that jumping-off place ."
Did you see any of them ? ''
"`` I saw Miss Oliver , I suppose , '' said Alan briefly ."
`` At least I met a young lady on the shore .
But where did these people come from ?
Surely more is known of them than this . ''
`` Precious little .
"The truth is , Mr. Douglas , folks do n't think the Olivers respectable and do n't want to have anything to do with them ."
"Eighteen years ago Captain Anthony came from goodness knows where , bought the Four Winds point , and built that house ."
He said he 'd been a sailor all his life and could n't live away from the water .
He brought his wife and child and an old cousin of his with him .
This Lynde was n't more than two years old then .
People went to call but they never saw any of the women and the Captain let them see they were n't wanted .
"Some of the men who 'd been working round the place saw his wife and said she was sickly but real handsome and like a lady , but she never seemed to want to see anyone or be seen herself ."
There was a story that the Captain had been a smuggler and that if he was caught he 'd be sent to prison .
"Oh , there were all sorts of yarns , mostly coming from the men who worked there , for nobody else ever got inside the house ."
"When I left the man , I worked for a couple of weeks with a farmer , but I thrashed his boy , and then the old man thrashed me , and I ran off again and walked here . ''"
`` All the way ? ''
"`` Yes , the man did n't pay me , and I would n't ask for it ."
"Took it out in beating the boy , '' and Dan laughed , yet looked ashamed , as he glanced at his ragged clothes and dirty hands ."
`` How did you live ?
"It was a long , long tramp for a boy like you . ''"
"`` Oh , I got on well enough , till I hurt my foot ."
"Folks gave me things to eat , and I slept in barns and tramped by day ."
"I got lost trying to make a short cut , or I 'd have been here sooner . ''"
"`` But if you did not mean to come in and stay with us , what were you going to do ? ''"
"`` I thought I 'd like to see Teddy again , and you ; and then I was going back to my old work in the city , only I was so tired I went to sleep on the hay ."
"I 'd have been gone in the morning , if you had n't found me . ''"
`` Are you sorry I did ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo looked at him with a half merry , half reproachful look , as she knelt down to look at his wounded foot ."
"The color came up into Dan 's face , and he kept his eyes fixed on his plate , as he said very low , `` No , ma'am , I 'm glad , I wanted to stay , but I was afraid you -- '' He did not finish , for Mrs. Bhaer interrupted him by an exclamation of pity , as she saw his foot , for it was seriously hurt ."
`` When did you do it ? ''
`` Three days ago . ''
`` And you have walked on it in this state ? ''
"`` I had a stick , and I washed it at every brook I came to , and one woman gave me a rag to put on it . ''"
"`` Mr. Bhaer must see and dress it at once , '' and Mrs. Jo hastened into the next room , leaving the door ajar behind her , so that Dan heard all that passed ."
"`` Fritz , the boy has come back . ''"
`` Who ?
Dan ? ''
"`` Yes , Teddy saw him at the window , and he called to him , but he went away and hid behind the hay-cocks on the lawn ."
"I found him there just now fast asleep , and half dead with weariness and pain ."
"He ran away from Page a month ago , and has been making his way to us ever since ."
"He pretends that he did not mean to let us see him , but go on to the city , and his old work , after a look at us ."
"It is evident , however , that the hope of being taken in has led him here through every thing , and there he is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back . ''"
`` Did he say so ? ''
"`` His eyes did , and when I waked him , he said , like a lost child , ` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . '"
"I had n't the heart to scold him , and just took him in like a poor little black sheep come back to the fold ."
"I may keep him , Fritz ? ''"
`` Will you do as I tell you then ? ''
"`` Yes , I will . ''"
`` Then get Joe on the long-distance at once and tell him to bring out a license and ring tonight . ''
"`` Oh , I could n't , '' wailed the aghast Miranda , `` it -- it would be so -- so indelicate . ''"
Rilla shut her little white teeth together with a snap .
"`` Heaven grant me patience , '' she said under her breath ."
"`` I 'll do it then , '' she said aloud , `` and meanwhile , you go home and make what preparations you can ."
When I ` phone down to you to come up and help me sew come at once . ''
"As soon as Miranda , pallid , scared , but desperately resolved , had gone , Rilla flew to the telephone and put in a long-distance call for Charlottetown ."
"She got through with such surprising quickness that she was convinced Providence approved of her undertaking , but it was a good hour before she could get in touch with Joe Milgrave at his camp ."
"Meanwhile , she paced impatiently about , and prayed that when she did get Joe there would be no listeners on the line to carry news to Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"`` Is that you , Joe ?"
"Rilla Blythe is speaking -- Rilla -- Rilla -- oh , never mind ."
Listen to this .
"Before you come home tonight get a marriage license -- a marriage license -- yes , a marriage license -- and a wedding-ring ."
Did you get that ?
And will you do it ?
"Very well , be sure you do it -- it is your only chance . ''"
Flushed with triumph -- for her only fear was that she might not be able to locate Joe in time -- Rilla rang the Pryor ring .
This time she had not such good luck for she drew Whiskers-on-the-moon .
`` Is that Miranda ?
Oh -- Mr. Pryor !
"Well , Mr. Pryor , will you kindly ask Miranda if she can come up this afternoon and help me with some sewing ."
"It is very important , or I would not trouble her ."
Oh -- thank you . ''
"Mr. Pryor had consented somewhat grumpily , but he had consented -- he did not want to offend Dr. Blythe , and he knew that if he refused to allow Miranda to do any Red Cross work public opinion would make the Glen too hot for comfort ."
"Rilla went out to the kitchen , shut all the doors with a mysterious expression which alarmed Susan , and then said solemnly , `` Susan can you make a wedding-cake this afternoon ? ''"
`` A wedding-cake ! ''
Susan stared .
"Rilla had , without any warning , brought her a war-baby once upon a time ."
"Was she now , with equal suddenness , going to produce a husband ?"
"`` Yes , a wedding-cake -- a scrumptious wedding-cake , Susan -- a beautiful , plummy , eggy , citron-peely wedding-cake ."
Subject : ` Is summer or winter best fun ? '
A lively pow-wow .
About evenly divided .
J. Flint fined five cents for disrespect to the Chair .
A collection of forty cents taken up to pay for breaking a pane of glass during a free fight of the members on the door-step .
"E. Devlin was chosen Secretary for the coming year , and a new book contributed by the Chairman . ''"
`` That 's all . ''
`` Is there any other business before the meeting ? ''
"asked Frank , as the reader closed the old book with a slam and shoved the new one across the table ."
"Ed rose , and glancing about him with an appealing look , said , as if sure his proposition would not be well received , `` I wish to propose the name of a new member ."
"Bob Walker wants to join , and I think we ought to let him ."
"He is trying to behave well , and I am sure we could help him ."
Ca n't we ? ''
"All the boys looked sober , and Joe , otherwise Brickbat , said , bluntly , `` I wo n't ."
"He 's a bad lot , and we do n't want any such here ."
Let him go with chaps of his own sort . ''
`` That is just what I want to keep him from !
"He 's a good-hearted boy enough , only no one looks after him ; so he gets into scrapes , as we should , if we were in his place , I dare say ."
"He wants to come here , and would be so proud if he was let in , I know he 'd behave ."
"Come now , let 's give him a chance , '' and Ed looked at Gus and Frank , sure that if they stood by him he should carry his point ."
"But Gus shook his head , as if doubtful of the wisdom of the plan , and Frank said gravely : `` You know we made the rule that the number should never be over eight , and we can not break it . ''"
`` You need n't .
"I ca n't be here half the time , so I will resign and let Bob have my place , '' began Ed , but he was silenced by shouts of `` No , no , you sha n't ! ''"
`` We wo n't let you off ! ''
"`` Club would go to smash , if you back out ! ''"
"`` Let him have my place ; I 'm the youngest , and you wo n't miss me , '' cried Jack , bound to stand by Ed at all costs ."
"`` We might do that , '' said Frank , who did object to small boys , though willing to admit this particular one ."
"`` Better make a new rule to have ten members , and admit both Bob and Tom Grant , '' said Ralph , whereat Grif grinned and Joe scowled , for one lad liked Merry 's big brother and the other did not ."
`` That 's a good idea !
"Put it to vote , '' said Gus , too kind-hearted to shut the door on any one ."
"`` First I want to ask if all you fellows are ready to stand by Bob , out of the club as well as in , for it wo n't do much good to be kind to him here and cut him at school and in the street , '' said Ed , heartily in earnest about the matter ."
`` I will ! ''
"`` It 's as sweet as yourself , dear child , '' she said tenderly ."
`` And it will be a joy to me all through the lonely winter days .
"You 've found out the best meaning of Christmas giving , have n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` Yes , thanks to you , Aunt Emmy , '' said Clorinda softly ."
"Cyrilla 's Inspiration It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and all the boarders at Mrs. Plunkett 's were feeling dull and stupid , especially the Normal School girls on the third floor , Cyrilla Blair and Carol Hart and Mary Newton , who were known as The Trio , and shared the big front room together ."
"They were sitting in that front room , scowling out at the weather ."
"At least , Carol and Mary were scowling ."
"Cyrilla never scowled ; she was sitting curled up on her bed with her Greek grammar , and she smiled at the rain and her grumbling chums as cheerfully as possible ."
"`` For pity 's sake , Cyrilla , put that grammar away , '' moaned Mary ."
"`` There is something positively uncanny about a girl who can study Greek on Saturday afternoons -- at least , this early in the term . ''"
"`` I 'm not really studying , '' said Cyrilla , tossing the book away ."
`` I 'm only pretending to .
I 'm really just as bored and lonesome as you are .
But what else is there to do ?
We ca n't stir outside the door ; we 've nothing to read ; we ca n't make candy since Mrs. Plunkett has forbidden us to use the oil stove in our room ; we 'll probably quarrel all round if we sit here in idleness ; so I 've been trying to brush up my Greek verbs by way of keeping out of mischief .
Have you any better employment to offer me ? ''
"`` If it were only a mild drizzle we might go around and see the Patterson girls , '' sighed Carol ."
`` But there is no venturing out in such a downpour .
"Cyrilla , you are supposed to be the brainiest one of us ."
"Prove your claim to such pre-eminence by thinking of some brand-new amusement , especially suited to rainy afternoons ."
That will be putting your grey matter to better use than squandering it on Greek verbs out of study limits . ''
"`` If only I 'd got a letter from home today , '' said Mary , who seemed determined to persist in gloom ."
`` I would n't mind the weather .
Letters are such cheery things : -- especially the letters my sister writes .
They 're so full of fun and nice little news .
The reading of one cheers me up for the day .
"Cyrilla Blair , what is the matter ?"
You nearly frightened me to death ! ''
"Cyrilla had bounded from her bed to the centre of the floor , waving her Greek grammar wildly in the air ."
"`` Girls , I have an inspiration ! ''"
she exclaimed .
`` Good !
"`` She 's bound to be across now , '' I whispered ."
"`` Na , '' said Alan , `` her foot still sounds boss * upon the bridge . ''"
* Hollow .
And just then -- `` Who goes ? ''
"cried a voice , and we heard the butt of a musket rattle on the stones ."
"I must suppose the sentry had been sleeping , so that had we tried , we might have passed unseen ; but he was awake now , and the chance forfeited ."
"`` This 'll never do , '' said Alan ."
"`` This 'll never , never do for us , David . ''"
"And without another word , he began to crawl away through the fields ; and a little after , being well out of eye-shot , got to his feet again , and struck along a road that led to the eastward ."
"I could not conceive what he was doing ; and indeed I was so sharply cut by the disappointment , that I was little likely to be pleased with anything ."
"A moment back and I had seen myself knocking at Mr. Rankeillor 's door to claim my inheritance , like a hero in a ballad ; and here was I back again , a wandering , hunted blackguard , on the wrong side of Forth ."
`` Well ? ''
"said I. `` Well , '' said Alan , `` what would ye have ?"
They 're none such fools as I took them for .
"We have still the Forth to pass , Davie -- weary fall the rains that fed and the hillsides that guided it ! ''"
`` And why go east ? ''
"said I. `` Ou , just upon the chance ! ''"
said he .
"`` If we cannae pass the river , we 'll have to see what we can do for the firth . ''"
"`` There are fords upon the river , and none upon the firth , '' said I. `` To be sure there are fords , and a bridge forbye , '' quoth Alan ; `` and of what service , when they are watched ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` but a river can be swum . ''"
"`` By them that have the skill of it , '' returned he ; `` but I have yet to hear that either you or me is much of a hand at that exercise ; and for my own part , I swim like a stone . ''"
"`` I 'm not up to you in talking back , Alan , '' I said ; `` but I can see we 're making bad worse ."
"If it 's hard to pass a river , it stands to reason it must be worse to pass a sea . ''"
"`` But there 's such a thing as a boat , '' says Alan , `` or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` Ay , and such a thing as money , '' says I. `` But for us that have neither one nor other , they might just as well not have been invented . ''"
`` Ye think so ? ''
said Alan .
"`` I do that , '' said I. `` David , '' says he , `` ye 're a man of small invention and less faith ."
"But let me set my wits upon the hone , and if I cannae beg , borrow , nor yet steal a boat , I 'll make one ! ''"
`` I think I see ye ! ''
"said I. `` And what 's more than all that : if ye pass a bridge , it can tell no tales ; but if we pass the firth , there 's the boat on the wrong side -- somebody must have brought it -- the country-side will all be in a bizz -- '' `` Man ! ''"
"`` Wake me up when she comes , '' said rob , and was fast asleep in five minutes with his head in Nan 's lap under the pinafore ."
"The little girl sat for some fifteen minutes , staring about her with anxious eyes , and feeling as if each second was an hour ."
"Then a pale light began to glimmer over the hill-top and she said to herself , `` I guess the night is over and morning is coming ."
"I 'd like to see the sun rise , so I 'll watch , and when it comes up we can find our way right home . ''"
"But before the moon 's round face peeped above the hill to destroy her hope , Nan had fallen asleep , leaning back in a little bower of tall ferns , and was deep in a mid-summer night 's dream of fire-flies and blue aprons , mountains of huckleberries , and Robby wiping away the tears of a black cow , who sobbed , `` I want to go home !"
I want to go home ! ''
"While the children were sleeping , peacefully lulled by the drowsy hum of many neighborly mosquitoes , the family at home were in a great state of agitation ."
"The hay-cart came at five , and all but Jack , Emil , Nan , and Rob were at the bars ready for it ."
"Franz drove instead of Silas , and when the boys told him that the others were going home through the wood , he said , looking ill-pleased , `` They ought to have left Rob to ride , he will be tired out by the long walk . ''"
"`` It 's shorter that way , and they will carry him , '' said Stuffy , who was in a hurry for his supper ."
`` You are sure Nan and Rob went with them ? ''
"`` Of course they did ; I saw them getting over the wall , and sung out that it was most five , and Jack called back that they were going the other way , '' explained Tommy ."
"`` Very well , pile in then , '' and away rattled the hay-cart with the tired children and the full pails ."
"Mrs. Jo looked sober when she heard of the division of the party , and sent Franz back with Toby to find and bring the little ones home ."
"Supper was over , and the family sitting about in the cool hall as usual , when Franz came trotting back , hot , dusty , and anxious ."
`` Have they come ? ''
he called out when half-way up the avenue .
`` No ! ''
and Mrs. Jo flew out of her chair looking so alarmed that every one jumped up and gathered round Franz .
"`` I ca n't find them anywhere , '' he began ; but the words were hardly spoken when a loud `` Hullo ! ''"
"startled them all , and the next minute Jack and Emil came round the house ."
`` Where are Nan and Rob ? ''
"cried Mrs. Jo , clutching Emil in a way that caused him to think his aunt had suddenly lost her wits ."
`` I do n't know .
"They came home with the others , did n't they ? ''"
"he answered , quickly ."
`` No ; George and Tommy said they went with you . ''
"`` Well , they did n't ."
Have n't seen them .
"We took a swim in the pond , and came by the wood , '' said Jack , looking alarmed , as well he might ."
"`` Call Mr. Bhaer , get the lanterns , and tell Silas I want him . ''"
"That was all Mrs. Jo said , but they knew what she meant , and flew to obey her orders ."
"I do n't mind ; I ai n't a little girl , I 'm older than you and Daisy ; so now , '' cried Nan , ungratefully ."
"`` Do n't preach , Deacon , you bully Posy every day of your life , '' called out the Commodore , who just then hove in sight ."
"`` I do n't hurt her ; do I , Daisy ? ''"
"and Demi turned to his sister , who was `` pooring '' Nan 's tingling hands , and recommending water for the purple lump rapidly developing itself on her forehead ."
"`` You are the best boy in the world , '' promptly answered Daisy ; adding , as truth compelled her to do , `` You hurt me sometimes , but you do n't mean to . ''"
"`` Put away the bats and things , and mind what you are about , my hearties ."
"No fighting allowed aboard this ship , '' said Emil , who rather lorded it over the others ."
"`` How do you do , Madge Wildfire ? ''"
"said Mr. Bhaer , as Nan came in with the rest to supper ."
"`` Give the right hand , little daughter , and mind thy manners , '' he added , as Nan offered him her left ."
`` The other hurts me . ''
`` The poor little hand !
what has it been doing to get those blisters ? ''
"he asked , drawing it from behind her back , where she had put it with a look which made him think she had been in mischief ."
"Before Nan could think of any excuse , Daisy burst out with the whole story , during which Stuffy tried to hide his face in a bowl of bread and milk ."
"When the tale was finished , Mr. Bhaer looked down the long table towards his wife , and said with a laugh in his eyes , `` This rather belongs to your side of the house , so I wo n't meddle with it , my dear . ''"
"Mrs. Jo knew what he meant , but she liked her little black sheep all the better for her pluck , though she only said in her soberest way , `` Do you know why I asked Nan to come here ? ''"
"`` To plague me , '' muttered Stuffy , with his mouth full ."
"`` To help make little gentlemen of you , and I think you have shown that some of you need it . ''"
"Here Stuffy retired into his bowl again , and did not emerge till Demi made them all laugh by saying , in his slow wondering way , `` How can she , when she 's such a tomboy ? ''"
"`` That 's just it , she needs help as much as you , and I expect you set her an example of good manners . ''"
`` Is she going to be a little gentleman too ? ''
asked Rob .
"`` She 'd like it ; would n't you , Nan ? ''"
added Tommy .
"`` No , I should n't ; I hate boys ! ''"
"said Nan fiercely , for her hand still smarted , and she began to think that she might have shown her courage in some wiser way ."
"`` I am sorry you hate my boys , because they can be well-mannered , and most agreeable when they choose ."
"Kindness in looks and words and ways is true politeness , and any one can have it if they only try to treat other people as they like to be treated themselves . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer had addressed herself to Nan , but the boys nudged one another , and appeared to take the hint , for that time at least , and passed the butter ; said `` please , '' and `` thank you , '' `` yes , sir , '' and `` no , ma'am , '' with unusual elegance and respect ."
"Nan said nothing , but kept herself quiet and refrained from tickling Demi , though strongly tempted to do so , because of the dignified airs he put on ."
"She also appeared to have forgotten her hatred of boys , and played `` I spy '' with them till dark ."
"Rilla , be awfully good to mother while I 'm away ."
It must be a horrible thing to be a mother in this war -- the mothers and sisters and wives and sweethearts have the hardest times .
"Rilla , you beautiful little thing , are you anybody 's sweetheart ?"
"If you are , tell me before I go . ''"
"`` No , '' said Rilla ."
"Then , impelled by a wish to be absolutely frank with Walter in this talk that might be the last they would ever have , she added , blushing wildly in the moonlight , `` but if -- Kenneth Ford -- wanted me to be -- '' `` I see , '' said Walter ."
"`` And Ken 's in khaki , too ."
"Poor little girlie , it 's a bit hard for you all round ."
"Well , I 'm not leaving any girl to break her heart about me -- thank God for that . ''"
Rilla glanced up at the Manse on the hill .
She could see a light in Una Meredith 's window .
She felt tempted to say something -- then she knew she must not .
"It was not her secret : and , anyway , she did not know -- she only suspected ."
Walter looked about him lingeringly and lovingly .
This spot had always been so dear to him .
What fun they all had had here lang syne .
"Phantoms of memory seemed to pace the dappled paths and peep merrily through the swinging boughs -- Jem and Jerry , bare-legged , sunburned schoolboys , fishing in the brook and frying trout over the old stone fireplace ; Nan and Di and Faith , in their dimpled , fresh-eyed childish beauty ; Una the sweet and shy , Carl , poring over ants and bugs , little slangy , sharp-tongued , good-hearted Mary Vance -- the old Walter that had been himself lying on the grass reading poetry or wandering through palaces of fancy ."
They were all there around him -- he could see them almost as plainly as he saw Rilla -- as plainly as he had once seen the Pied Piper piping down the valley in a vanished twilight .
"And they said to him , those gay little ghosts of other days , `` We were the children of yesterday , Walter -- fight a good fight for the children of to-day and to-morrow . ''"
"`` Where are you , Walter , '' cried Rilla , laughing a little ."
`` Come back -- come back . ''
Walter came back with a long breath .
"He stood up and looked about him at the beautiful valley of moonlight , as if to impress on his mind and heart every charm it possessed -- the great dark plumes of the firs against the silvery sky , the stately White Lady , the old magic of the dancing brook , the faithful Tree Lovers , the beckoning , tricksy paths ."
"`` I shall see it so in my dreams , '' he said , as he turned away ."
They went back to Ingleside .
"Mr. and Mrs. Meredith were there , with Gertrude Oliver , who had come from Lowbridge to say good-bye ."
"Everybody was quite cheerful and bright , but nobody said much about the war being soon over , as they had said when Jem went away ."
They did not talk about the war at all -- and they thought of nothing else .
"At last they gathered around the piano and sang the grand old hymn : `` Oh God , our help in ages past Our hope for years to come ."
Our shelter from the stormy blast And our eternal home . ''
"`` We all come back to God in these days of soul-sifting , '' said Gertrude to John Meredith ."
`` There have been many days in the past when I did n't believe in God -- not as God -- only as the impersonal Great First Cause of the scientists .
"`` God bless you , Rilla-my-Rilla , '' he said softly and tenderly ."
After all it was not a hard thing to fight for a land that bore daughters like this .
He stood on the rear platform and waved to them as the train pulled out .
"Rilla was standing by herself , but Una Meredith came to her and the two girls who loved him most stood together and held each other 's cold hands as the train rounded the curve of the wooded hill ."
Rilla spent an hour in Rainbow Valley that morning about which she never said a word to anyone ; she did not even write in her diary about it ; when it was over she went home and made rompers for Jims .
In the evening she went to a Junior Red Cross committee meeting and was severely businesslike .
"`` You would never suppose , '' said Irene Howard to Olive Kirk afterwards , `` that Walter had left for the front only this morning ."
But some people really have no depth of feeling .
I often wish I could take things as lightly as Rilla Blythe . ''
"CHAPTER XVI REALISM AND ROMANCE `` Warsaw has fallen , '' said Dr. Blythe with a resigned air , as he brought the mail in one warm August day ."
"Gertrude and Mrs. Blythe looked dismally at each other , and Rilla , who was feeding Jims a Morganized diet from a carefully sterilized spoon , laid the said spoon down on his tray , utterly regardless of germs , and said , `` Oh , dear me , '' in as tragic a tone as if the news had come as a thunderbolt instead of being a foregone conclusion from the preceding week 's dispatches ."
"They had thought they were quite resigned to Warsaw 's fall but now they knew they had , as always , hoped against hope ."
"`` Now , let us take a brace , '' said Susan ."
`` It is not the terrible thing we have been thinking .
I read a dispatch three columns long in the Montreal Herald yesterday that proved that Warsaw was not important from a military point of view at all .
"So let us take the military point of view , doctor dear . ''"
"`` I read that dispatch , too , and it has encouraged me immensely , '' said Gertrude ."
`` I knew then and I know now that it was a lie from beginning to end .
"But I am in that state of mind where even a lie is a comfort , providing it is a cheerful lie . ''"
"`` In that case , Miss Oliver dear , the German official reports ought to be all you need , '' said Susan sarcastically ."
`` I never read them now because they make me so mad I can not put my thoughts properly on my work after a dose of them .
Even this news about Warsaw has taken the edge off my afternoon 's plans .
Misfortunes never come singly .
I spoiled my baking of bread today -- and now Warsaw has fallen -- and here is little Kitchener bent on choking himself to death . ''
"Jims was evidently trying to swallow his spoon , germs and all ."
Rilla rescued him mechanically and was about to resume the operation of feeding him when a casual remark of her father 's sent such a shock and thrill over her that for the second time she dropped that doomed spoon .
"`` Kenneth Ford is down at Martin West 's over-harbour , '' the doctor was saying ."
"`` His regiment was on its way to the front but was held up in Kingsport for some reason , and Ken got leave of absence to come over to the Island . ''"
"`` I hope he will come up to see us , '' exclaimed Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` He only has a day or two off , I believe , '' said the doctor absently ."
Nobody noticed Rilla 's flushed face and trembling hands .
Even the most thoughtful and watchful of parents do not see everything that goes on under their very noses .
"""You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"" said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands."
He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.
"""So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"""
he said.
"""But what about the dragon and the griffin?"" asked the Princess."
"""Dear me,"" said Nigel. ""I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill them?"""
"""Don't be a silly boy,"" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. ""You haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!"""
"""Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"""
"""Why, yes,"" said the Princess, ""but only once in twenty-four hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the day before."""
"""What time does he sleep today?"" asked Nigel."
"""At eleven,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah,"" said Nigel, ""can you do sums?"""
"""No,"" said the Princess sadly. ""I was never good at them."""
"""Then I must,"" said Nigel. ""I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."""
"""Don't begin yet,"" said the Princess. ""You'll have plenty of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself."""
So he did. And then she told him all about herself.
"""I know I've been here a long time,"" she said, ""but I don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the griffin does the housework his wings are so convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does the cooking he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."""
"Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and a snorting sound. ""It's the dragon,"" said the Princess hurriedly."
"""Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done."" And she ran away and left him to his arithmetic."
"Now, the sum was this: ""If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls asleep?"""
"It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he could not feel sure which answer was right."
"And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was getting dark."
"""Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,"" she said, ""and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer to the sum."""
"She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she had scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:"
AFTER NINE DAYS         T ii. 24.
D ii. 27 Ans.
P.S. And the griffin is artificial. R.
He clapped his hands softly.
"""Dear Princess,"" he said, ""I know that's the right answer. It says R too, you see. But I'll just prove it."" So he hastily worked the sum backward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules he could think of. And it came right every time."
"""So now we must wait,"" said he. And they waited."
"And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans."
"""You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?"" said Nigel."
"The little Bats flitted along after her, and Papa Bat came behind them."
"They had been flying through the starlit forest all night, chasing the many small insects that come out after the sun has gone down, and passing in and out of the tangled branches without ever touching one."
"Indeed, Mamma Bat would have been ashamed if children of hers flew against anything in the dark. There might be some excuse for such a mistake in the daytime, for Bats' eyes do not see well then, but in the night-time! She would have scolded them well, and they would have deserved it, for Bats have the most wonderful way of feeling things before they touch them, and there are no other people in the forest who can do that. There are no other people who can tell by the feeling of the air when something is near, and the Bats made much fun of their friend, the Screech Owl, once, when he flew against a tree and fell to the ground."
And now the night was over and their mother had called them to go home.
"One of the little Bats hung back with a very cross look on his face, and twice his father had to tell him to fly faster. He was thinking how he would like to see the forest in the daytime. He had never seen the sun rise, and he wanted to do that. He had never seen any of the day-birds or the animals that awaken in the morning. He thought it was pretty mean to make poor little Bats go off to bed the minute the stars began to fade. He didn't believe what his father and mother said, that he wouldn't have a good time if he did stay up. He had coaxed and coaxed and teased and teased, but it hadn't made a bit of difference. Every morning he had to fold his wings and go to sleep in a dark crack in the rock of the cave, hanging, head downward, close to the rest of the family. Their father said that there never was a better place to sleep than in this same crack, and it certainly was easy to catch on with the hooks at the lower ends of their wings when they hung themselves up for the day. But now he just wouldn't go to bed, so there!"
"""It is your turn next,"" said Mamma Bat to him, when the rest of the children had hung themselves up."
"""I'm not going to bed,"" the little Bat answered."
"""Not going to bed!"" said his father. ""Are you crazy?"""
"""No,"" said the little Bat, ""I'm not."""
"""I don't believe the child is well,"" said Mamma Bat. ""He never acted like this before. I'm afraid he has overeaten."" And she looked very anxious."
"""I am well, and I haven't eaten too much,"" said the little Bat. ""I think you might let a fellow have some fun once in a while. I've never seen the sun in my life, and there are whole lots of birds and animals in the forest that I've only heard about."""
Papa and Mamma Bat looked at each other without speaking.
"""I won't go to bed!"" said the little Bat."
"""Very well,"" said his father. ""I shall not try to make you. Fly away at once and let us go to sleep."""
"After he had gone, Mamma Bat said, ""I suppose you did right to let him go, but it seems too bad that children have to find out for themselves the trouble that comes from disobedience."""
"The little Bat flew away feeling very brave. He guessed he knew how to take care of himself, even in daylight. He felt sorry for his brothers who were in the cave, but he made up his mind that he would tell them all about it the next night."
"The eastern sky grew brighter and brighter. It hurt his eyes to look at it, and he blinked and turned away. Then the song-birds awakened and began to sing. It was very interesting, but he thought they sang too loudly. The forest at night is a quiet place, and he didn't see the sense of shouting so, even if the sun were coming up. The night-birds never made such a fuss over the moon, and he guessed the moon was as good as the sun."
"Somebody went scampering over the grass, kicking up his heels as he ran."
"""That must be a Rabbit,"" thought the little Bat. ""The Screech Owl told me that Rabbits run in that way. I wish I could see him more plainly. I don't know what is the matter with my eyes."""
"Just then a sunbeam came slanting through the forest and fell on his furry coat as he clung to a branch. ""Ow!"" he cried. ""Ow! How warm it is!"
"I don't like that. The moonbeams do not feel so. I must fly to a shady corner."" He started to fly. Just what was the matter, he never knew. It may have been because he couldn't see well, it may have been because he was getting very tired, or it may have been because the strangeness of it all was beginning to frighten him; but at all events, he went down, down, down until he found himself pitching and tumbling around in the grass."
"A Crow had seen him fall, and cried loudly, ""Come! Come! Come!"" to his friends. The Rabbits, who were feeding near by, came scampering along, making great leaps in their haste to see what was the matter. The Goldfinches, the Robins, the Orioles, the Woodpeckers, and many other birds came fluttering up. Even a Blue Jay sat on a branch above the Bat and shrieked, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" to add to the excitement. And last of all, the Ground Hog appeared, coming slowly and with dignity, as a person who can remember his grandfather should do."
"""What is the cause of all this commotion?"" he asked. He might have said, ""What is the matter?"" and then they would have understood him at once, but he was too haughty for that. He thought he had to use big words once in a while to show that he could. If people didn't understand them, he was willing to explain what he meant."
"""We've found such a queer bird, sir,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, without waiting to find out what a ""commotion"" was. ""Just see him tumble around!"""
"""Bird? That is no bird,"" said a Woodpecker. ""Look at his ears and his nose. He hasn't even a bill."""
"""Well, he flies,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, ""because I saw him, so he must be a bird."""
"""Humph!"" said a Chipmunk. ""So does my cousin, the Flying Squirrel, in a way, yet he is no more bird than I am."""
"""And this fellow hasn't a feather to his skin!"" cried an Oriole."
"""I don't say that my son is right,"" said Papa Rabbit, ""but this creature has wings."" And he gave the Bat a poke that made him flutter wildly for a minute."
"""Yes, but what kind of wings?"" asked the Goldfinch. ""A pair of skinny things that grow on to his legs and have hooks on both ends."""
"""He must be a very stupid fellow, at all events,"" said the Ground Hog."
"""He doesn't talk, or walk, or eat, or even fly well. He must come of a very common family. For my part, I am not interested in persons of that kind."" And he walked away with his nose in the air."
"""It was only a short time after this that I had such trouble about making my fort. Whenever I started to dig in a place I would find some other Mole there ahead of me."""
"""And then you would have to go somewhere else, of course?"" said the Ground Hog."
"""I'd like to know why!"" said the Mole, with his glossy silver-brown fur on end. ""No indeed! I had a perfect right to dig wherever I wished, and I would tell them so, and they would have to go elsewhere. One Mole was bad-tempered enough to say that he had as much right in the meadow as anybody, and I had to tussle with him and bite him many times before he saw his mistake.... They are disagreeable people over there, but why are you going so soon? I thought we would have a good visit together."""
"""I promised to meet Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband, ""and must go."
"Good-night!"" and he trotted away."
"Not long afterward this highly respectable couple were feeding together in the moonlight. ""What do you think of the Mole?"" said she."
"""Well, er ahem,"" answered her husband. ""You know, my dear, that I do not like to talk against people, and I might better not tell you exactly what I think of him. He is a queer-looking fellow, and I always distrust anyone who will not look me in the eye. Perhaps that is not his fault, for the fur hides his eyes and he wears his ears inside of his head; but I must say that a fiercer or more disagreeable-looking snout I never saw. He has had trouble with all his old neighbors, and a fellow who cannot get along peaceably in one place will not in another. He is always talking about his rights and what he thinks  """
"""You have told me enough,"" said Mrs. Ground Hog, interrupting him."
"""Nobody ever liked a person who insists on his 'rights' every time. And such a person never enjoys life. What a pity it is!"" and she gave a sigh that shook her fat sides. ""Now, I had it all planned that he should marry and set up housekeeping, and that I should have another pleasant neighbor soon."""
"""Ah! Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband teasingly, ""I knew you would be thinking of that. You are a born matchmaker. Now I think we could stand a few bachelors around here, fine young fellows who have nothing to do but enjoy life."" And his eyes twinkled as he said it."
"""As though you did not enjoy life!"" answered his wife. ""Still, I could not wish any young Mole such a husband as this fellow. It is a great undertaking to marry a grumpy bachelor and teach him the happiness of living for others."" And she looked very solemn."
"""I suppose you found it so?"" said Mr. Ground Hog, sidling up toward her."
"""What a tease you are!"" said his wife. ""You know that I am happy."" And really, of all the couples on whom the moon looked that night, there was not a happier one than this pair of Ground Hogs; and there was not a lonelier or more miserable person than the Mole, who guarded his own rights and told people what he thought of them. But it is always so."
THE WILD TURKEYS COME
"The Wild Turkeys are a wandering people, and stay in one place only long enough to rear their young. One could hardly say that they lived in the Forest, but every year when the acorns and beechnuts were ripe, they came for a visit. It is always an exciting time when the Turkeys are seen gathering on the farther side of the river and making ready to fly over. Some of the Forest People have started for the warmer country in the South, and those who still remain are either talking over their plans for flight, or working hard, if they are to spend the winter in the North, to get their stores of food ready."
"It was so this year. One morning a Red-headed Woodpecker brought the news that the Turkeys were gathering. The Ground Hog heard of it just as he was going to sleep after a night of feeding and rambling in the edge of the meadow. One of the young Rabbits told him, and coaxed him to stay up to see the newcomers."
"""I've never seen Turkeys in my life,"" said the young Rabbit, ""and they say it is great fun to watch them. Oh, please come with me to the river-bank and see the Turkeys cross over. Please do!"""
"""Ah-h-h,"" yawned the Ground Hog. ""You might better ask somebody who has not been up all night. I am too sleepy."""
"""You won't be sleepy when you reach the river-bank,"" said the Rabbit."
"""Beside, I think there should be someone there to meet them."""
"At this, the Ground Hog raised his drooping head, opened his blinking eyes, and answered with great dignity: ""There should indeed be someone."
"I will go at once."""
"When they reached the river-bank there was a sight well worth seeing. On the farther side of the water were a great many Turkeys. Old Gobblers were there, and the mother Turkeys with their broods of children, all looking as fine as you please, in their shining black coats. When they stood in the shadow, one might think that they wore no color but the brilliant red of their heads and necks, where there were no feathers to cover their wrinkled skin. When they walked out into the sunshine, however, their feathers showed gleams of beautiful purple and green, and the Rabbit thought them the most wonderful great creatures he had ever seen."
"""Look at them now!"" he cried. ""Why do those largest ones walk up and down in front of the rest and scold them?"""
"""They are the Gobblers,"" answered the Ground Hog, ""and they are doing that to show that they are not afraid to cross the river. They strut and gobble, and strut and gobble, and say: 'Who's-afraid? Who's-afraid?'"
"until the rest are ready to fly over."""
"""Now the others are doing the same thing,"" said the Rabbit, as the mothers and young Turkeys began to strut back and forth."
"""That shows that they are willing to cross,"" answered the Ground Hog."
"""Now they will fly up to the very tops of the trees on the hill and visit there for a time. It is always so. They start from the highest point they can find. It will be some time before they come over, and I will take a short nap. Be sure to awaken me when they start. I want to welcome them to the Forest."" And the Ground Hog curled himself up beside a log and went to sleep."
The Rabbit wandered around and ate all the good things he could find.
"Then he fell to wondering how it would feel to be a bird. He thought it would be great fun to fly. To pass so swiftly through the air must be delightful, and then to sweep grandly down and alight softly on the ground without having people know that you were coming!"
"When he said this, all the Workers smiled, and even the Queen-Mother had to turn away her head. The Drones looked as solemn as possible. It would not do for them to laugh at their brother. They did not want him to laugh at them when they made excuses for staying at home. They even pretended not to hear one of the Workers when she said that it was funny how some people couldn't use their wings if one of their feet hurt them."
"""Yes,"" said another Worker, ""and it is funny, too, how some people can get along very well on three legs when they have to, while others are too helpless to do anything unless they can use the whole six."""
"The Drones began to talk together. ""I think that the whole swarm should fly at the Kingbird and sting him and drive him away,"" said one. ""There is no sense in allowing him to perch outside our home and catch us as we pass in and out. I say that we should make war upon him!"" He looked very fierce as he spoke, buzzing and twitching his feelers at every step."
"""Exactly!"" cried another Drone. ""If I had a sting, I would lead the attack. As it is, I may be useful in guarding the comb. It is a great pity that Drones have no stings."" You would have thought, to hear him speak, that if he had been given a sting like those of the Workers, not all the Bees in the tree could keep him from fighting."
"While the Drones were talking about war, some of the Workers sent to their Queen for advice. ""Tell us,"" they said, ""how to drive away the Kingbird. Should we try to sting him? You know it kills a Bee to sting anybody, and we don't want to if we can help it, yet we will if you say so."""
"The Queen-Mother shook her head. ""You must not bother me about such things,"" she said. ""I have all that I can do to get the eggs ready, and you must look after the swarm. Nobody else can do my work, and I have no time to do yours."" As she spoke, she finished the one hundred and seventeenth egg of that day's lot, and before night came she would probably have laid more than a thousand, so you can see she was quite right when she said she had no time for other things."
"This left the Workers to plan for themselves, and they agreed that a number of them should fly out together and see where the Kingbird was."
"Then they could decide about attacking him later. When one gave the signal, they dashed out as nearly together as possible."
"After the Workers returned with honey and pollen, the Drones crowded around them, asking questions. ""Where is he? What does he look like? Did he try to catch you?"" The Workers would not answer them, and said: ""Go and find out for yourself. We all came back alive."" Then they went about their work as usual."
"""I don't see how they dared to go,"" said a very young Bee who was just out of her cocoon and was still too weak to fly."
"""Pooh!"" said the big Drone. ""You wouldn't see me hanging around this tree if I were not lame."""
"""There is no use in stopping work even if you are scared,"" said one of the Workers. She smiled as she spoke, and whispered something to the Queen-Mother as she passed her. The Queen-Mother smiled also."
"""Why don't you Drones go for honey?"" she said. ""You must be getting very hungry."""
"""We don't feel very well,"" they answered. ""Perhaps it would be better for our health if we were to keep quiet for a while and save our strength. We will lunch off some of the honey in the comb if we need food."""
"""Not a bit of it!"" exclaimed the Workers. ""Stay in the tree if you want to for your health, but don't you dare touch the honey we have gathered for winter, when the day is clear and bright like this."" And whenever a Drone tried to get food from the comb they drove him away."
"The poor Drones had a hard day of it, and at night they were so hungry they could hardly sleep. The next morning they peeped out, and then rushed away to the flowers for their breakfast. They stayed out all day, and when they returned at night they rushed swiftly into the tree again."
"""There!"" they said; ""we escaped the Kingbird."""
"""What Kingbird?"" asked a Worker."
"""The one who was there yesterday,"" answered the Drones. ""Has he been back to-day?"""
"""There was no Kingbird near the tree yesterday,"" said the Worker."
"""What!"" cried the Drones."
"""No,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I was mistaken when I thought I heard him."
"The Workers told me after they had been out for honey. Perhaps they forgot to tell you."""
"But her eyes twinkled as she spoke, and all the Workers smiled, and for some reason the Drones did not know what to say."
THE STORY OF THE COW BIRD'S EGG
"On the edge of the forest next to the meadow, a pair of young Goldfinches were about to begin housekeeping. They were a handsome couple, and the birds who were already nesting near by were much pleased to see them tree-hunting there."
"Mr. Goldfinch was a fine, cheerful little fellow, every feather of whose black and yellow coat was always well oiled and lying in its proper place. His wife was dressed in a dull, greenish brown with a touch of yellow on her breast. ""Bright yellow and black does very well for Mr."
"Goldfinch,"" she would say, ""but for one who has to sit on the nest as long as I shall have to, it would never do. People would see me among the leaves and know just where to find my eggs."""
"Mr. Goldfinch thought that there was never a bird who had a prettier, dearer, or harder-working little wife than he, and he would wonder how he was ever happy before he knew her. That is a way that people have of forgetting the days that are past; and the truth is that Mr. Goldfinch had made fun of the Robins and other birds all spring, because they had to build nests and hunt worms for their babies, while he had nothing to do but sing and sleep and feed himself. In those days the Robins used to call after him as he flew away, ""Silly fellow! Silly fellow! Silly!"""
They knew that there is something sweeter in life than just taking good care of one's self.
"One afternoon Mr. Goldfinch saw a tiny green-brown bird on a sweetbriar bush, and as he watched her he thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. She had such a dainty way of picking out the seeds, and gave such graceful hops from one twig to another. Then Mr. Goldfinch fluffed up his feathers and swelled out his throat and sang her such songs as he had never sung before. He did not want her to speak to anybody else, and yet he could not help her doing so, for Goldfinches always go together in crowds until they have homes of their own, and at this time they were having concerts every morning. He showed her where the finest dandelion seeds could be found, and one bright and sunshiny day she became Mrs. Goldfinch, and they went together to find a place for their home."
"""You'll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won't go with you!"""
"""Don't be afraid! I'll hold you quite tight all the way."""
"Then said the crab to himself, ""If this fellow once got hold of fish, he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn't then I'll cut his throat, and kill him!"" So he said to him:"
"""Look here, friend, you won't be able to hold me tight enough; but we crabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you."""
"And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed. So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with a pair of blacksmith's pincers, and called out, ""Off with you, now!"""
"And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off towards the Varana-tree."
"""Uncle!"" cried the crab, ""the pond lies that way, but you are taking me this way!"""
"""Oh, that's it, is it?"" answered the crane. ""Your dear little uncle, your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every one of them, just so I will devour you as well!"""
"""Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,"" answered the crab; ""but I'm not going to let you eat me. On the contrary, is it you that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together; for I will cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!"" And so saying, he gave the crane's neck a grip with his claws, as with a vice."
"Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling with the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, ""O my Lord!"
"Indeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!"""
"""Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there."""
"And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the crab on the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then only entered the water!"
"When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair, he made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant voice the verse:"
"""The villain, though exceeding clever,     Shall prosper not by his villainy."
"He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,     But only as the Crane here from the Crab!"""
Loving Laili
"Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun, who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees."
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.
"One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his father, ""Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt."" His father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds."
"The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair."
"One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to her story. From that time she began repeating, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" Her father used to get quite vexed with her. ""Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?"" he would say."
"""He is the man I am to marry,"" said Laili. ""Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but Majnun."" And she was half mad."
"Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" The prince heard her, and turned round. ""Who is calling me?"" he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said to herself, ""I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am to marry."" And she went home to her father and said, ""Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the Prince Majnun I am to marry."""
"""Very well, you shall have him for your husband,"" said Munsuk Raja."
"""We will ask him to-morrow."" Laili consented to wait, although she was very impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country."
"All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;"" and so she wandered about for twelve years."
"At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir he was really an angel, but she did not know this who asked her, ""Why do you always say, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?"" She answered, ""I am the daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is."""
"""I think you will never get there,"" said the fakir, ""for it is very far from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it."" But Laili said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. ""Well,"" said the fakir, ""when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish, a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's country, or you will never reach it."""
"She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river."
"There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its stomach. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun."" At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and perched on his back, and said ""Caw, caw."" ""Oh, Mr. Crow,"" said the poor fish ""do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise."""
Cromwell and his Ironsides
"When Charles I came to the throne of England, it was soon seen that he was as bad a king as his father James I had been."
"He did not care at all for the good of his country and his people, but thought only of his own pleasure. He took away men's money and lands, and if they offended him he took their lives too."
"Englishmen would not bear this unjust treatment for long, and soon a war began between the king and the people, who were determined to be free."
"At first the king and his men were victorious everywhere, for they were all used to horses and arms, and fought so well and so bravely that the people could not stand against them. But at last a great leader arose among the people. This leader, who was called Oliver Cromwell, was a rough man, but he was just, good, and honest."
"He saw at once that the people would never gain the victory over the brave gentlemen-soldiers of King Charles, unless they had obedient and well-trained men to fight for them. So he chose a band of plain, hard-working men who feared God, and loved duty and right, and he spent all his money in fitting them with arms and horses, and in training them sternly, until they became the finest soldiers the world has ever known."
"Cromwell called his men his ""lovely company"", and others called them ""Ironsides"", for they were strong and firm as iron, and were never beaten. It was these brave, sober, obedient soldiers who at last defeated the king's army, and won freedom for the people of England."
The Spanish Armada
"The Armada was a great fleet which the King of Spain sent to attack England, in the days of Queen Elizabeth. There were more than a hundred ships, so large and high that they looked like towers on the sea; and they came sailing along arranged in the shape of a big half-moon."
"The great English admiral, Sir Francis Drake, was playing at bowls when messengers came hurrying to tell him that the Armada was approaching. He quietly finished his game, and then set sail to fight the Spaniards. His fleet was not so large as the Armada, and the ships were small, but they were light and fast. They met the Armada in the English Channel, and sailed round it, attacking any ship that dropped out of line, and speeding away before the clumsy Spanish vessels could seize them. In this way they did much harm to the enemy. Then, one night, when it was dark, and the Spanish vessels were lying quietly at anchor, Admiral Drake sent eight blazing fire-ships into their midst. In great fear, the Spaniards cut their anchor-ropes, and sailed out to the open sea, and the English ships followed, firing upon them as they fled. For two days the English chased the flying Spaniards. Then their powder and shot failed, and a storm arose; so they had to go back. The Armada sailed on, hoping to escape, but the wild tempest tossed many of the great vessels on the rocks and cliffs of the coast, and dashed them to pieces. Only a few, broken and battered, with starving and weary men on board, ever reached Spain again. And so England was saved."
The Defence of Lathom House
"Lathom House is an old English castle. When the war broke out between King Charles I and his people, the Earl of Derby, who was the master of this castle, went away to fight for the king. He left the Countess at home with her children, with a small band of armed men to guard her and the castle. One day an army of the people's soldiers came to the castle, and the leader of the army sent word to the Countess that she must give up the castle at once."
"But alas! he went out to die. In one battle, a small band of the English bravely attacked a large army of their enemies. The horse which Sidney was riding was killed under him, and as he mounted another, he was shot in the leg, and his thigh-bone was broken. The horse took fright and galloped away from the fight, but its wounded and bleeding rider held to his seat, and when he reached a place of safety was lifted from his horse, and gently laid upon the ground. He was faint from loss of blood, and in great pain, and his throat was parched with thirst."
"""Bring me water,"" said he to a friend."
"This was not easy to do, for there was not a stream near at hand, and in order to get to one it would be necessary to pass where the shot from the enemy's cannons was falling fast. But his friend was brave and went through the danger. Then he found some water, and brought it to him."
"Sidney eagerly held out his hand for the cup, and as he was preparing to drink, another poor wounded soldier was carried past. This man was dying; he could not speak, but he looked with longing eyes at the water."
"Sir Philip saw the look, and taking the cup from his own lips, passed it to the soldier, saying: ""Thy need is greater than mine."" The poor man quenched his thirst, and blessed him as he died."
"Sir Philip lived on for a few weeks, growing weaker every day, but he never came back to his own land, and the many friends who loved him."
"Sidney was great in many ways; very fair to see, very wise and good, and very clever and witty. He was one of the bravest fighters, one of the finest poets, and one of the best gentlemen who ever lived. He will always be remembered for his brave deeds, and his wise sayings, but most of all do men bless his name for this act of kindness to his poor dying comrade."
"The ""Revenge"""
"In the days of Queen Elizabeth, English sailors first began to find their way across the seas to new lands, from which they brought home many strange, and rich, and beautiful things. The Spaniards sailed across the seas too, to fetch gold and silver from the mines in Mexico, which belonged to the King of Spain. Sometimes the English ships met the Spanish ones, and robbed them of their gold, for it was thought quite right and fair in those days to take every chance of doing harm to the enemies of England. Of course the Spaniards hated the English for this, and whenever they met English ships which were weaker than theirs they attacked them, and robbed them, killing the sailors, or taking them prisoners."
"Once, a small ship, called the Revenge, was sailing home to England, when it met with fifty great Spanish vessels. The captain of the Revenge was Sir Richard Grenville, and he had a great many sick men on board. There was no time to escape from the Spanish ships, which soon surrounded the little Revenge. So there were only two courses which Sir Richard could take. One was to give up his ship to the Spaniards; the other was to fight with them till his men were all killed, or his ship sank."
"Some of the sailors wished him to take the first course, but the others, and all the sick men, said: ""Nay, let us fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of Spain."" This they said because they thought it better to die, than to be made prisoners by the cruel Spaniards."
"Sir Richard made up his mind to fight. It was after noon when the firing began, and all night long, until daylight came, the little English ship kept the fifty Spanish vessels at bay. Then it was found that all the powder was gone, and all the English were dead or dying."
"And then only was the flag of the Revenge pulled down, to show that she surrendered to her enemies."
"The brave Sir Richard was taken on board a Spanish ship, where he soon died of his wounds."
"These were his last words: ""Here die I, Richard Grenville, with a joyful and quiet mind, for I have ended my life as a good soldier ought. I have fought for my country and my queen, for honour, and for God."""
The Pilgrim Fathers
"There was a time when the people of England were not allowed to pray to God in the way they thought right, but were punished if they did not worship as the king ordered. This was very hard, and when James I was king, a little band of brave people, who found that they could not obey the king, left their country to make a new home across the sea, where they could be free. They are called the ""Pilgrim Fathers""."
"A hundred people men, women, and children set sail in a little ship called the Mayflower for the new world which a great explorer called Columbus had discovered away in the west, and which we now call America."
"They had a long and stormy voyage, but at last, in mid-winter, they landed on the shores of North America, and set up their huts."
"At first they had much trouble, for the ground was frozen and barren."
"They suffered from hunger and sickness, and the wild Indians who lived in that land came down upon them and tried to drive them away. But the Pilgrim Fathers did not lose courage. They were free, and they worked hard, and waited in patience for brighter days. By and by other ships from England brought food to keep them alive, and more people to help them. Then they made friends with the Indians, and when spring came they planted seeds and grew crops for themselves."
"After a time many other Englishmen, who wished to be free, followed the Pilgrim Fathers, and settled in America. They founded the colonies of New England, which are now a part of the United States."
Guy Fawkes
"In the time of James I, many of the English people were very hardly treated because of their religion. At last they could bear the ill-usage no longer, and they thought of a plan to get rid of the king and queen and their eldest son."
"Many barrels of gunpowder were secretly put into a cellar under the Parliament House, where James was to meet his lords and commons on November 5; and a man named Guy Fawkes was hired to set fire to it at the right time, and so to blow up the hall above, and all in it."
"All was ready, when one of the plotters remembered that a friend of his would be at the meeting next day. As he did not wish him to be killed, he sent him a letter, without signing his name, saying: ""Do not go to the House, for there shall be a sudden blow to many, and they shall not see who hurts them""."
"The lord who received this letter took it to the King's Council, and when King James saw it, he guessed what the ""sudden blow"" would be. Men were sent to search the cellars, and there, on the very night before the deed was to be done, Guy Fawkes was found waiting till the time should come to set fire to the powder. He was cruelly tortured to make him tell all he knew, but he was a brave man, and he died without betraying his friends."
"Since that time, every year, on the 5th of November, bonfires have been lighted in many places in England, and ""guys"" burned, to remind people how an English king was once saved from a great danger."
"The forts, now threatened in the rear by Butler's army, surrendered, and Farragut went up to Baton Rouge and took possession of it. General Butler's occupation at New Orleans has been variously commented upon by both friend and foe, but we are only able to learn from this and the entire record of the war, in fact, that it is better to avoid hostilities unless one is ready to accept the unpleasant features of combat. The author, when a boy, learned this after he had acquired the unpleasant features resulting from combat which the artist has cleverly shown on opposite page."
"General Butler said he found it almost impossible to avoid giving offence to the foe, and finally he gave it up in despair."
"The French are said to be the politest people on the face of the earth, but no German will admit it; and though the Germans are known to have big, warm, hospitable hearts, since the Franco-Prussian war you couldn't get a Frenchman to admit this."
"In February Burnside captured Roanoke Island, and the coast of North Carolina fell into the hands of the Union army. Port Royal became the base of operations against Florida, and at the close of the year 1862 every city on the Atlantic coast except Charleston, Wilmington, and Savannah was held by the Union army."
"The Merrimac iron-clad, which had made much trouble for the Union shipping for some time, steamed into Hampton Roads on the 8th of March."
"Hampton Roads is not the Champs-Elysées of the South, but a long wet stretch of track east of Virginia, the Midway Plaisance of the Salted Sea. The Merrimac steered for the Cumberland, rammed her, and the Cumberland sunk like a stove-lid, with all on board. The captain of the Congress, warned by the fate of the Cumberland, ran his vessel on shore and tried to conceal her behind the tall grass, but the Merrimac followed and shelled her till she surrendered."
"The Merrimac then went back to Norfolk, where she boarded, night having come on apace. In the morning she aimed to clear out the balance of the Union fleet. That night, however, the Monitor, a flat little craft with a revolving tower, invented by Captain Ericsson, arrived, and in the morning when the Merrimac started in on her day's work of devastation, beginning with the Minnesota, the insignificant-looking Monitor slid up to the iron monster and gave her two one-hundred-and-sixty-six-and-three-quarter-pound solid shot."
"The Merrimac replied with a style of broadside that generally sunk her adversary, but the balls rolled off the low flat deck and fell with a solemn plunk in the moaning sea, or broke in fragments and lay on the forward deck like the shells of antique eggs on the floor of the House of Parliament after a Home Rule argument."
"Five times the Merrimac tried to ram the little spitz-pup of the navy, but her huge iron beak rode up over the slippery deck of the enemy, and when the big vessel looked over her sides to see its wreck, she discovered that the Monitor was right side up and ready for more."
"The Confederate vessel gave it up at last, and went back to Norfolk defeated, her career suddenly closed by the timely genius of the able Scandinavian."
"The Peninsular campaign was principally addressed toward the capture of Richmond. One hundred thousand men were massed at Fort Monroe April 4, and marched slowly toward Yorktown, where five thousand Confederates under General Magruder stopped the great army under McClellan."
"After a month's siege, and just as McClellan was about to shoot at the town, the garrison took its valise and went away."
"On the 5th of May occurred the battle of Williamsburg, between the forces under ""Fighting Joe"" Hooker and General Johnston. It lasted nine hours, and ended in the routing of the Confederates and their pursuit by Hooker to within seven miles of Richmond. This caused the adjournment of the Confederate Congress."
"But Johnston prevented the junction of McDowell and McClellan after the capture of Hanover Court-House, and Stonewall Jackson, reinforced by Ewell, scared the Union forces almost to death. They crossed the Potomac, having marched thirty-five miles per day. Washington was getting too hot now to hold people who could get away."
It was hard to say which capital had been scared the worst.
"The Governors of the Northern States were asked to send militia to defend the capital, and the front door of the White House was locked every night after ten o'clock."
"But finally the Union generals, instead of calling for more troops, got after General Jackson, and he fled from the Shenandoah Valley, burning the bridges behind him. It is said that as he and his staff were about to cross their last bridge they saw a mounted gun on the opposite side, manned by a Union artilleryman. Jackson rode up and in clarion tones called out, ""Who told you to put that gun there, sir? Bring it over here, sir, and mount it, and report at head-quarters this evening, sir!"""
"The artilleryman unlimbered the gun, and while he was placing it General Jackson and staff crossed over and joined the army."
"One cannot be too careful, during a war, in the matter of obedience to orders. We should always know as nearly as possible whether our orders come from the proper authority or not."
"No one can help admiring this dashing officer's tour in the Shenandoah Valley, where he kept three major-generals and sixty thousand troops awake nights with fifteen thousand men, saved Richmond, scared Washington into fits, and prevented the union of McClellan's and McDowell's forces. Had there been more such men, and a little more confidence in the great volume of typographical errors called Confederate money, the lovely character who pens these lines might have had a different tale to tell."
"May 31 and June 1 occurred the battle of Fair Oaks, where McClellan's men floundering in the mud of the Chickahominy swamps were pounced upon by General Johnston, who was wounded the first day. On the following day, as a result of this accident, Johnston's men were repulsed in disorder."
"General Robert E. Lee, who was now in command of the Confederate forces, desired to make his army even more offensive than it had been, and on June 12 General Stuart led off with his cavalry, made the entire circuit of the Union army, saw how it looked from behind, and returned to Richmond, much improved in health, having had several meals of victuals while absent."
"Hooker now marched to where he could see the dome of the court-house at Richmond, but just then McClellan heard that Jackson had been seen in the neighborhood of Hanover Court-House, and so decided to change his base. General McClellan was a man of great refinement, and would never use the same base over a week at a time."
"He had hardly got the base changed when Lee fell upon his flank at Mechanicsville, June 26, and the Seven Days' battle followed. The Union troops fought and fell back, fought and fell back, until Malvern Hill was reached, where, worn with marching, choked with dust, and broken down by the heat, to which they were unaccustomed, they made their last stand, July 1. Here Lee got such a reception that he did not insist on going any farther."
"But the Union army was cooped up on the James River. The siege of Richmond had been abandoned, and the North felt blue and discouraged."
"Three hundred thousand more men were called for, and it seemed that, as in the South, ""the cradle and the grave were to be robbed"" for more troops."
"Lee now decided to take Washington and butcher Congress to make a Roman holiday. General Pope met the Confederates August 26, and while Lee and Jackson were separated could have whipped the latter had the Army of the Potomac reinforced him as it should, but, full of malaria and foot-sore with marching, it did not reach him in time, and Pope had to fight the entire Confederate army on that historic ground covered with so many unpleasant memories and other things, called Bull Run."
"For the second time the worn and wilted Union army was glad to get back to Washington, where the President was, and where beer was only five cents per glass."
"Oh, how sad everything seemed at that time to the North, and how high cotton cloth was! The bride who hastily married her dear one and bade him good-by as the bugle called him to the war, pointed with pride to her cotton clothes as a mark of wealth; and the middle classes were only too glad to have a little cotton mixed with their woollen clothes."
"Lee invaded Maryland, and McClellan, restored to command of the Army of the Potomac, followed him, and found a copy of his order of march, which revealed the fact that only a portion of the army was before him. So, overtaking the Confederates at South Mountain, he was ready for a victory, but waited one day; and in the mountains Lee got his troops united again, while Jackson also returned. The Union troops had over eighty thousand in their ranks, and nothing could have been more thoughtful or genteel than to wait for the Confederates to get as many together as possible, otherwise the battle might have been brief and unsatisfactory to the tax-payer or newspaper subscriber, who of course wants his money's worth when he pays for a battle."
"The first year of the war had taught both sides a few truths, and especially that the war did not in any essential features resemble a straw-ride to camp-meeting and return. The South had also discovered that the Yankee peddlers could not be captured with fly-paper, and that although war was not their regular job they were willing to learn how it was done."
"In 1862 the national army numbered five hundred thousand men, and the Confederate army three hundred and fifty thousand. Three objects were decided upon by the Federal government for the Union army and navy to accomplish, viz., 1, the opening of the Mississippi; 2, the blockade of Southern ports; and 3, the capture of Richmond, the capital of the Southern Confederacy."
"The capture of Forts Henry and Donelson was undertaken by General Grant, aided by Commodore Foote, and on February 6 a bombardment was opened with great success, reducing Fort Henry in one hour. The garrison got away because the land-forces had no idea the fort would yield so soon, and therefore could not get up there in time to cut off the retreat."
"Fort Donelson was next attacked, the garrison having been reinforced by the men from Fort Henry. The fight lasted four days, and on February 16 the fort, with fifteen thousand men, surrendered."
"Nashville was now easily occupied by Buell, and Columbus and Bowling Green were taken. The Confederates fell back to Corinth, where General Beauregard (Peter G. T.) and Albert Sidney Johnston massed their forces."
"General Grant now captured the Memphis and Charleston Railroad; but the Confederates decided to capture him before Buell, who had been ordered to reinforce him, should effect a junction with him. April 6 and 7, therefore, the battle of Shiloh occurred. Whether the Union troops were surprised or not at this battle, we cannot here pause to discuss."
"Suffice it to say that one of the Federal officers admitted to the author in 1879, while under the influence of koumys, that, though not strictly surprised, he believed he violated no confidence in saying that they were somewhat astonished."
"It was Sunday morning, and the Northern hordes were just considering whether they would take a bite of beans and go to church or remain in camp and get their laundry-work counted for Monday, when the Confederacy and some other men burst upon them with a fierce, rude yell. In a few moments the Federal troops had decided that there had sprung up a strong personal enmity on the part of the South, and that ill feeling had been engendered in some way."
"All that beautiful Sabbath-day they fought, the Federals yielding ground slowly and reluctantly till the bank of the river was reached and Grant's artillery commanded the position. Here a stand was made until Buell came up, and shortly afterwards the Confederates fell back; but they had captured the Yankee camp entire, and many a boy in blue lost the nice warm woollen pulse-warmers crocheted for him by his soul's idol. It is said that over thirty-five hundred needle-books and three thousand men were captured by the Confederates, also thirty flags and immense quantities of stores; but the Confederate commander, General A."
"S. Johnston, was killed. The following morning the tide had turned, and General P. G. T. Beauregard retreated unmolested to Corinth."
"General Halleck now took command, and, as the Confederates went away from there, he occupied Corinth, though still retaining his rooms at the Arlington Hotel in Washington."
"The Confederates who retreated from Columbus fell back to Island No. 10 in the Mississippi River, where Commodore Foote bombarded them for three weeks, thus purifying the air and making the enemy feel much better than at any previous time during the campaign. General Pope crossed the Mississippi, capturing the batteries in the rear of the island, and turning them on the enemy, who surrendered April 7, the day of the battle of Shiloh."
"May 10, the Union gun-boats moved down the river. Fort Pillow was abandoned by the Southern forces, and the Confederate flotilla was destroyed in front of Memphis. Kentucky and Tennessee were at last the property of the fierce hordes from the great coarse North."
"General Bragg was now at Chattanooga, Price at Iuka, and Van Dorn at Holly Springs. All these generals had guns, and were at enmity with the United States of America. They very much desired to break the Union line of investment extending from Memphis almost to Chattanooga."
"Bragg started out for the Ohio River, intending to cross it and capture the Middle States; but Buell heard of it and got there twenty-four hours ahead, wherefore Bragg abandoned his plans, as it flashed over him like a clap of thunder from a clear sky that he had no place to put the Middle States if he had them. He therefore escaped in the darkness, his wagon-trains sort of drawling over forty miles of road and ""hit a-rainin'."""
"September 19, General Price, who, with Van Dorn, had considered it a good time to attack Grant, who had sent many troops north to prevent Bragg's capture of North America, decided to retreat, and, General Rosecrans failing to cut him off, escaped, and was thus enabled to fight on other occasions."
"The two Confederate generals now decided to attack the Union forces at Corinth, which they did. They fought beautifully, especially the Texan and Missouri troops, who did some heroic work, but they were defeated and driven forty miles with heavy loss."
"October 30, General Buell was succeeded by General Rosecrans."
"The battle of Murfreesboro occurred December 31 and January 2. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the whole conflict, and must have made the men who brought on the war by act of Congress feel first-rate. About one-fourth of those engaged were killed."
"An attack on Vicksburg, in which Grant and Sherman were to co-operate, the former moving along the Mississippi Central Railroad and Sherman descending the river from Memphis, was disastrous, and the capture of Arkansas Post, January 11, 1863, closed the campaign of 1862 on the Father of Waters."
"General Price was driven out of Missouri by General Curtis, and had to stay in Arkansas quite a while, though he preferred a dryer climate."
"General Van Dorn now took command of these forces, numbering twenty thousand men, and at Pea Ridge, March 7 and 8, 1863, he was defeated to a remarkable degree. During his retreat he could hardly restrain his impatience."
"Some four or five thousand Indians joined the Confederates in this battle, but were so astonished at the cannon, and so shocked by the large decayed balls, as they called the shells, which came hurtling through the air, now and then hurting an Indian severely, that they went home before the exercises were more than half through. They were down on the programme for some fantastic and interesting tortures of Union prisoners, but when they got home to the reservation and had picked the briers out of themselves they said that war was about as barbarous a thing as they were ever to, and they went to bed early, leaving a call for 9.30 A.M. on the following day."
The red brother's style of warfare has an air about it that is unpopular now. A common stone stab-knife is a feeble thing to use against people who shoot a distance of eight miles with a gun that carries a forty-gallon caldron full of red-hot iron.
CHAPTER XXVI.
SOME MORE FRATRICIDAL STRIFE.
"The effort to open the Mississippi from the north was seconded by an expedition from the south, in which Captain David G. Farragut, commanding a fleet of forty vessels, co-operated with General Benjamin F. Butler, with the capture of New Orleans as the object."
"Mortar-boats covered with green branches for the purpose of fooling the enemy, as no one could tell at any distance at all whether these were or were not olive-branches, steamed up the river and bombarded Forts Jackson and St. Philip till the stunned catfish rose to the surface of the water to inquire, ""Why all this?"" and turned their pallid stomachs toward the soft Southern zenith. Sixteen thousand eight hundred shells were thrown into the two forts, but that did not capture New Orleans."
"Farragut now decided to run his fleet past the defences, and, desperate as the chances were, he started on April 24. A big cable stretched across the river suggested the idea that there was a hostile feeling among the New Orleans people. Five rafts and armed steamers met him, and the iron-plated ram Manassas extended to him a cordial welcome to a wide wet grave with a southern exposure."
"Farragut cut through the cable about three o'clock in the morning, practically destroyed the Confederate fleet, and steamed up to the city, which was at his mercy."
"Under the pink and white,"
Love in her eyes alight;
Love and the Spring and Kensington Gardens:
Hey for the heart’s delight!
REWARDS.
"BECAUSE you cried, I kissed you, and,"
Ah me! how should I understand
That piteous little you were fain
To cry and to be kissed again?
"Because you smiled at last, I thought"
That I had found what I had sought.
"But soon I found, without a doubt,"
No man can find a woman out.
"I kissed your tears, and did not stay"
Till I had kissed them all away.
"Ah, hapless me! ah, heartless child!"
She would not kiss me when she smiled.
PERFUME.
"""Yes.... I remember it...."""
Then the old man leaned to one side and gazed at the other with a
"serious, suspicious glance."
"""There were the Amalekites, do you remember?"""
"""Well?"""
"""Where are they now?"""
"""Disappeared ... Tyapa ... died out ..."""
"The old man was silent, then asked again: ""And where are the"
"Philistines?"""
"""These also ..."""
"""Have all these died out?"""
"""Yes ... all ..."""
"""And so ... we also will die out?"""
"""There will come a time when we also will die,"" said the teacher"
indifferently.
"""And to what tribe of Israel do we belong?"""
"The teacher looked at him, and began telling him about Scythians and"
Slavs....
A PENSIVE photograph
Watches me from the shelf:
"Ghost of old love, and half"
Ghost of myself!
How the dear waiting eyes
Watch me and love me yet:
"Sad home of memories,"
Her waiting eyes!
"Ghost of old love, wronged ghost,"
"Return, though all the pain"
"Of all once loved, long lost,"
Come back again.
"Forget not, but forgive!"
"Alas, too late I cry."
"We are two ghosts that had their chance to live,"
"And lost it, she and I."
SECOND THOUGHTS.
"WHEN you were here, ah foolish then!"
"I scarcely knew I loved you, dear."
"I know it now, I know it when"
You are no longer here.
"""Maybe there isn't a seat."""
"""Wouldn't that be terrible?"""
"""Then we'll have to wait over."""
"""Why don't you go and see?"""
Five minutes later they were walking down the west tunnel to gate
twenty-six.
"Frank Corson grinned. ""Come on, woman, I'm going to take you across"
"state lines for immoral purposes."""
"""How wonderful,"" she breathed."
*       *       *       *       *
Brent Taber was human and his triumph had been a thing of satisfaction
to him--but only momentarily. Now it had a slightly sour taste.
Not that he was unhappy. He was content and almost relaxed as he sat in
Doctor Entman's patio and worked on a Scotch and soda.
"""A nice night,"" Entman said."
"""Beautiful. Those stars are about ready to fall into our laps."""
"""Menace out there? It seems unthinkable."""
"""Doesn't it?"""
AFTER LOVE.
"O TO part now, and, parting now,"
Never to meet again;
"To have done for ever, I and thou,"
"With joy, and so with pain."
"It is too hard, too hard to meet"
"As friends, and love no more;"
Those other meetings were too sweet
That went before.
"And I would have, now love is over,"
"An end to all, an end:"
"I cannot, having been your lover,"
Stoop to become your friend!
ALLA PASSERETTA BRUNA.
"IF I bid you, you will come,"
"If I bid you, you will go,"
"You are mine, and so I take you"
"To my heart, your home;"
"Well, ah, well I know"
I shall not forsake you.
"""I wish this confounded thing hadn't happened. It spoils our win."""
"The Chief Justice nodded, and whistled a bar or two of some sad ditty."
"""I'm glad she's dead, poor soul, Perry,"" he said."
"""There's the girl,"" said Sir Robert."
"""Ay, there's the girl."""
"They did not speak again till they were just parting, when the Chief"
"Justice broke out,"
"""Why the deuce couldn't the fellow take his beastly photograph with"
"him?"""
"""It's very absurd,"" answered Sir Robert, ""but I feel just the same about"
"it."""
"""I'm hanged if you're not a gentleman, Perry,"" said the Chief Justice,"
"and he hastened away, blowing his nose."
CHAPTER XXIV.
THREE AGAINST THE WORLD.
"Though the House had risen early that evening, the Central Club sat very"
"late. The smoking-room was crowded, and tongues wagged briskly. Every"
"""Speak to me!"""
"""Ilaria!"""
"""Raniero?"""
"""Dead!"""
A great silence held for a moment. The woman's head sank upon the
man's shoulder. Madness had passed. Her eyes were fixed upon his with
"a wonderful earnestness, a splendid calm."
"""Is this a dream?"""
"""It is the truth!"""
Through the forest aisles rode the Duke of Spoleto.
He saw and paused.
"""I return beyond the Alps to join the forces of Rudolf of Hapsburg. My"
"men are at your disposal. I shall wait for you on yonder hillock."""
He wheeled about and was gone.
Again silence held for a pace.
Presently Ilaria gave a great sigh and looked strangely at the sun.
"""I have dreamed a dream,"" she crooned, ""and all was dark and fearful."
"Death seemed near; lurid phantoms,--things from hell! I knew not what"
"I did, nor where I wandered, nor what strange stupor held my soul. All"
"A frolic Faun that must be hid,"
"Shyly, in some fantastic shade,"
Where pity droops a tender lid
On laughter of itself afraid.
MORBIDEZZA.
"WHITE girl, your flesh is lilies"
"Grown ’neath a frozen moon,"
So still is
The rapture of your swoon
"Of whiteness, snow or lilies."
"The virginal revealment,"
"Your bosom’s wavering slope,"
"Concealment,"
"’Neath fainting heliotrope,"
"Of whitest white’s revealment,"
"Is like a bed of lilies,"
"A jealous-guarded row,"
Whose will is
"Simply chaste dreams:—but oh,"
The alluring scent of lilies!
PASTEL.
THE light of our cigarettes
Went and came in the gloom:
It was dark in the little room.
"Dark, and then, in the dark,"
"Sudden, a flash, a glow,"
And a hand and a ring I know.
"And then, through the dark, a flush"
"Ruddy and vague, the grace—"
A rose—of her lyric face.
HER EYES.
BENEATH the heaven of her brows’
"Unclouded noon of peace, there lies"
A leafy heaven of hazel boughs
In the seclusion of her eyes;
Her troubling eyes that cannot rest;
And there’s a little flame that dances
(A firefly in a grassy nest)
In the green circle of her glances;
LOVE’S DISGUISES.
LOVE IN SPRING.
"GOOD to be loved and to love for a little, and then"
"Well to forget, be forgotten, ere loving grow life!"
"Dear, you have loved me, but was I the man among men?"
"Sweet, I have loved you, but scarcely as mistress or wife."
"Message of Spring in the hearts of a man and a maid,"
Hearts on a holiday: ho! let us love: it is Spring.
"Joy in the birds of the air, in the buds of the glade,"
Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing.
"Well, but to-morrow? To-morrow, good-bye: it is over."
"Scarcely with tears shall we part, with a smile who had met."
Tears? What is this? But I thought we were playing at lover.
Play-time is past. I am going. And you love me yet!
GIPSY LOVE.
"THE gipsy tents are on the down,"
The gipsy girls are here;
And it’s O to be off and away from the town
unconquerable.
"""I should have climbed that peak long ago if you, Miss Torsen, hadn't"
"forbidden me,"" said the lawyer."
"""You'd never have made it,"" said Mrs. Molie in an indifferent tone. This"
was probably her revenge. She turned to the Dane again as though ready to
believe him capable of anything.
"""I shouldn't want anyone to think of climbing that peak,"" said Miss"
"Torsen. ""It's as bare as a ship's mast."""
"""What if I tried it, Gerda?"" the manufacturer asked his wife with a smile."
"""After all, I'm an old sailor."""
"""Nonsense,"" she said, smiling a little."
"""Well, I climbed the mast of a schooner last spring."""
"""Where?"""
"""In Iceland."""
"""What for?"""
"""I don't know, though--all this mountain climbing--I haven't much use for"
"it,"" said the manufacturer."
"""What did you do it for? What did you climb the mast for?"" his wife"
repeated nervously.
The manufacturer laughed.
AT FONTAINEBLEAU.
"IT was a day of sun and rain,"
Uncertain as a child’s quick moods;
And I shall never pass again
So blithe a day among the woods.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed for very joy to know
"Her child was with her; then, grown sad,"
"She wept, because her child must go."
And you would spy and you would capture
The shyest flower that lit the grass:
The joy I had to watch your rapture
Was keen as even your rapture was.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed and wept for joy and woe.
This was the welcome that you had
Among the woods of Fontainebleau.
ON THE HEATH.
HER face’s wilful flash and glow
Turned all its light upon my face
"""Yes, he was. Kilshaw seemed to know all about him."""
"""He was talking to Miss Medland."""
"""And the Premier had her away from him in no time. Queer start, Sir"
"John?"""
"""Oh, well, he seems to have been a loose fellow, and I suppose was"
murdered for the money he had on him. But I mustn't talk about it. I may
"have to try it."""
"""Gad! you'll be committing contempt of yourself,"" suggested the Captain."
"""Like that snake that swallows itself, eh?"""
"""What snake?"" asked the Captain, with interest."
"""The snake in the story,"" answered the Chief Justice; and he added in an"
"undertone--""Why can't that fellow sit still?"""
"Mr. Coxon had wandered to the window again, and was thrumming on the"
panes. He turned on hearing some one enter. It was Sir Robert Perry.
"""Well,"" he began, ""I bring news of the event of the day."""
"""About to-night?"" asked Coxon eagerly."
"""To-night! That's not the event of the day. Ministers are a deal"
"commoner than murders. No, last night."""
Coxon turned away disappointed.
And very soon the French and English skippers were talking to each
"other at the rate of knots, while Hart sat in a crowd of Frenchmen"
and told them all about everything.
It was close on sundown when Jones returned to the _Potluck_.  He had
to be helped up the side by some of the crew.
"""Ain't we under arrest?"" they asked.  ""Does we dare come out?"""
Jones hiccupped.
"""I releases you on your own recognition,"" he said.  ""So down you come"
"and 'elp."""
"When he put his foot on the deck, he mustered all hands aft."
"""And you, Lampert, and you, Simcox!"""
The two mates came out of their cabins.
"""And where's Hart?"""
"""If you please, sir, he's drunk,"" said Billy."
"""Arrest 'im,"" said the skipper; ""what's 'e mean by it?  Now, look"
"'ere, you bally lot, what does you think of yourselves?"""
The crew appeared uneasy.
"""I went all by my lone,"" said the skipper, hanging on to the poop"
"ladder, ""all by my lone I went, and I brings back peace!  Do you"
"other's twin--elderly, soberly dressed, his only distinction a sword"
and pistol in his girdle and a white shoulder sash.
'Herr Krapp?' I said.
"'The same,' he answered, eying me gravely."
"'I am the Countess of Heritzburg's steward,' I said. I began to see"
the need of explanation. 'Doubtless you have heard that she is in the
city?'
"'Certainly,' he answered. 'In the Ritter Strasse.'"
"'Yes,' I replied. 'A fortnight ago she missed a young woman, one of"
"her attendants. She was lost in a night adventure,' I continued, my"
throat dry and husky. 'A few minutes ago I saw her looking from one of
your windows.'
'From one of my windows?' he exclaimed in a tone of surprise.
"'Yes,' I said stiffly."
He opened his eyes wide. 'Here?' he said. He pointed to his house.
I nodded.
"'Impossible!' he replied, shutting his lips suddenly. 'Quite"
"impossible, my friend. My household consists of my two sons and"
"myself. We have a housekeeper only, and two lads. I have no young"
women in the house.'
"'Yet I saw her face, Herr Krapp, at your window,' I answered"
"and rather looking on than taking part. 'What is it?' I said, shaking"
him roughly by the arm. 'What is the matter here?'
"'Hallo!' he answered, starting as he turned to me. 'Is it you again,"
my friend?'
I had hit on Herr Krapp!' Yes!' I cried breathlessly. 'What is it?
what is amiss?'
"He shrugged his shoulders. 'They are hanging a spy,' he answered."
"'Nothing more. Irregular, but wholesome.'"
I drew a deep breath. 'Is that all?' I said.
"He eyed me curiously. 'To be sure,' he said. 'What did you think it"
was?'
"'I feared that there might be something wrong at my lady's,' I said,"
beginning to get my breath again. 'I left her alone at sunset. And
when I saw this crowd before the house I--I could almost have cut off
"my hand. Thank God, I was mistaken!'"
"He looked at me again and seemed to reflect a moment. Then he said,"
'You have not found the young woman you were seeking?'
I shook my head.
"'Well, it occurred to me afterwards--but at which window did you see"
her?'
"'At a window on the first floor; the farthest from the door,' I"
answered.
Upon the mounts of Paradise.
"Her dark face, calm as carven stone."
"The face that twilight shows the day,"
"Brooded, mysteriously alone,"
And infinitely far away.
Inexplicable eyes that drew
"Mine eyes adoring, why from me"
"Demand, new Sphinx, the fatal clue"
That seals my doom or conquers thee?
PATTIE.
"COOL comely country Pattie, grown"
"A daisy where the daisies grow,"
No wind of heaven has ever blown
Across a field-flower’s daintier snow.
Gold-white among the meadow-grass
The humble little daisies thrive;
"I cannot see them as I pass,"
But I am glad to be alive.
"And so I turn where Pattie stands,"
A flower among the flowers at play;
"I’ll lay my heart into her hands,"
And she will smile the clouds away.
"with him, and going alone was such a bore. He did not conceal that the"
young woman meant something to him.
"Solem approached, and lifted his cap in greeting. Then he looked round"
"quickly and began to talk to the lawyer--politely, as became his position"
of a servant:
"""The Danish gentleman is going to climb the peak tomorrow. I'm to take a"
"rope and go with him."""
The lawyer was startled.
"""Is he--?"""
"The blankness of the lawyer's face was a remarkable sight. His small,"
athletic brain failed him. A moment passed in silence.
"""Yes, early tomorrow morning,"" said Solem. ""I thought I'd tell you."
"Because after all it was your idea first."""
"""Yes, so it was,"" said the lawyer. ""You're quite right. But now he'll be"
"ahead of me."""
Solem knew how to get round that.
"""No, I didn't promise to go,"" he said. ""I told him I had to go to the"
"village tomorrow."""
"""But we can't deceive him. I don't want to do that."""
"""Pity,"" said Solem. ""Everybody says the first one to climb the Blue Peak"
"will be in all the papers."""
I 'll grind his bones to make my bread.”
“Why do people frighten children with stories of ogres and wicked
"fairies and all the rest of it, when the real world they live in is so"
beautiful?”
"“Pure cussedness,” answered John, unable otherwise to give a"
satisfactory explanation.
"“Cussedness is silly,” said Stellamaris."
There was a little pause. Then she put both her hands on his and pressed
it.
"“Oh, it's lovely to have you here again, Great High Belovedest; and I"
have n't thanked you for your letter. It's the most heavenly one you've
ever written to me.”
It might well have been. He had taken two hours to write it.
CHAPTER IV
"THE most heavenly of all letters,” Stellamaris repeated, as Risca made"
no reply. “I loved it because it showed me you were very happy.”
“Have you ever doubted it?” he asked.

Something in his tones brought to his hostess one of those swift fits of
repentance that were apt to wait for her whenever she allowed herself to
treat this visitor with friendliness. He was so very prompt in
responding!
"""She is not very well,"" she answered, rather coldly."
"""I--I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing her?"""
Mr. Coxon's wishes were fulfilled to the moment. The door opened and
Alicia came in. On seeing him she stopped.
"""Come in, Alicia,"" said Lady Eynesford. ""Here's Mr. Coxon come to be"
"congratulated."""
Coxon stood up with a propitiatory smile.
"""How do you do, Mr. Coxon?"" said Alicia, giving him a limp hand. ""Shall"
"I ring for tea, Mary?"""
"""They'll bring it. You haven't wished him joy."""
"""Oh, are you in the new Ministry?"""
"""I have that honour, Miss Derosne. I hope you are on our side?"""
"""I don't quite know which side you are on--now,"" observed Alicia, in"
slow but distinct tones.
Coxon grew red.
"Frank Corson sat down. He saw the man and he saw Rhoda, but they seemed"
unimportant. Something had happened to his mind and he was busy
struggling with it. That was all that was important.
The strange lethargy that came like a cloud over his mind was beyond
understanding.

Captain Abrams looked into the closet and back at Brent Taber. His lips
"were back a little off his teeth. With Abrams, this indicated anger."
"""All right. What does Washington do about this one? Does Washington tell"
"us to be good little boys and go hand out parking tickets?"""
"""It wasn't like that,"" Taber said."
"""It doesn't much matter how it was. The thing is--how is it going to be"
"now?"""
"""You got a murder, friend. Plain and simple. What do the New York police"
"do when they get a murder?"""
"Abrams spoke bitterly. ""Sometimes they let a panel truck drive in and"
"haul the body away and that's that."""
"""Let's save the sarcasm until later. I called you in. It's your case."
"What do you want me to do?"""
"""Talk a little, maybe. The other one--now this one. The same killer?"""
"""Oh, I'm--I'm--sick!"" broke in Pola."
"""Sit up straight and talk and you won't think about it,"" commanded"
"Mart, so sternly that Pola straightened, her white face wan in the"
darkness.
"""I don't see how you _can_ talk when you're--may be--going--to die!"""
"""Well, talking helps you more than crying."""
"""But I--I don't _want_ to--die."""
"""Who does?"" retorted Mart roughly. Nevertheless, touched by Pola's"
"helplessness, she found Pola's hand and held it close in hers. ""But"
"let's face whatever happens with our heads up!"""
"""To the wind,"" breathed Sidney, shivering."
"""I--I just can't be brave like you two. I--I'm an awful coward. I can't"
help it. I've always been afraid to even try to swim. I'm afraid of
"lots of things. Oh, I'm afraid to--to--"""
Sidney caught Pola's other hand.
"""Don't say it, Pola. Maybe someone will find us. And probably you can't"
"help feeling afraid."""
Mart suddenly remembered the cookies she had brought. She found them
where she had hidden them at the back of one of the bunks.
"""Here, eat a cookie and you'll forget things. I'm hungry, aren't you,"
"too?"""
“Well?”
“Does it not seem odd to you?”
"“Not at all. A relation of her first husband’s, I suppose. In fact"
Yvonne said as much.”
"“I could not help being struck by the name, Everard. It is so peculiar."
I remembered it from the publication of the banns.”
"“I compliment you on your memory, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
"Mrs. Winstanley drew herself up, offended."
"She walked from the window where they were standing to a table, and"
fetched from it a newspaper.
“Do you remember the Christian name of Yvonne’s first husband?”
"The Canon drew himself up too, and frowned."
"“What is the meaning of all this, Emmeline? What are you trying to"
insinuate?”
"“If I thought you were going to adopt this tone, Everard, I should have"
kept my suspicions to myself.”
"“I certainly wish that you had,” said he, growing angry. “It is an"
insult to Yvonne which I cannot permit. My wife is above suspicion.”
"“Like Caesar’s,” said the lady with a curl of the lip. “Do you know that"
My stomach is not good;
But sure I think that I can drink
With him that wears a hood.
"Though I go bare, take ye no care,"
I am nothing a-cold;
I stuff my skin so full within
Of jolly good ale and old.
"Back and side go bare, go bare,"
Both foot and hand go cold:
"But belly, God send thee good ale enough,"
Whether it be new or old.

[HODGE _hears of the loss of the needle on his return home from the
fields._]
_Hodge._ Your nee'le lost? it is pity you should lack care and
endless sorrow.
"Gog's death, how shall my breeches be sewed? Shall I go thus"
to-morrow?
"_Gammer._ Ah, Hodge, Hodge, if that ich could find my nee'le, by"
"the reed,"
"Ch'ould sew thy breeches, ich promise thee, with full good"
"double thread,"
And set a patch on either knee should last this moneths twain.
"Now God and good Saint Sithe, I pray to send it home again."
"_Hodge._ Whereto served your hands and eyes, but this your nee'le"
to keep?
"What devil had you else to do? ye keep, ich wot, no sheep."
"insects.  Each of these bright frail, growing things had life and"
individuality like herself!
The sound of footsteps on the gravel made her turn.  Rosek was coming
"from the drawing-room window.  Rather startled, Gyp looked at him over"
her shoulder.  What had brought him at eleven o'clock in the morning?  He
"came up to her, bowed, and said:"
"""I came to see Gustav.  He's not up yet, it seems.  I thought I would"
"speak to you first.  Can we talk?"""
"Hesitating just a second, Gyp drew off her gardening-gloves:"
"""Of course!  Here?  Or in the drawing-room?"""
Rosek answered:
"""In the drawing-room, please."""
"A faint tremor passed through her, but she led the way, and seated"
herself where she could see Betty and the baby.  Rosek stood looking down
"at her; his stillness, the sweetish gravity of his well-cut lips, his"
spotless dandyism stirred in Gyp a kind of unwilling admiration.
"""What is it?"" she said."
"""Bad business, I'm afraid.  Something must be done at once.  I have been"
"trying to arrange things, but they will not wait.  They are even"
"threatening to sell up this house."""
"With a sense of outrage, Gyp cried:"
"Under our feet as we walked in the night,"
And the shadows beneath us were stirred by the breeze
In the magical light;
"And the moon was a silver fire,"
"And the stars were flickers of flame,"
Golden and violet and red;
"And the night-wind sighed my desire,"
And the wind in the tree-tops whispered and said
In her ear her adorable name.
"But her heart would not hear what I heard,"
"The pulse of the night as it beat,"
"Love, Love, Love, the unspeakable word,"
In its murmurous repeat;
"She heard not the night-wind’s sigh,"
"Nor her own name breathed in her ear,"
"Nor the cry of my heart to her heart,"
"A speechless, a clamorous cry:"
“Love! Love! will she hear? will she hear?”
"O heart, she will hear, by and by,"
"When we part, when for ever we part."
FÊTES GALANTES.
AFTER PAUL VERLAINE.
"“By the way, I think your old admirer, Severance, must be about to put"
"himself in silken fetters, as Boswell would say. I caught him buying an"
unusually fine sapphire in Tiffany’s yesterday. Said it was for his
sister. H’m—h’m.”
“Ah! I wonder who it can be?”
“Don’t know. Hasn’t looked at a woman since you left. But I have a
strong suspicion that it is some one here in Newport.”
“Here! I wonder if it can be Edith?”
"“Miss Decker? Sure enough. Never seemed to pay her much attention,"
though. She’s not my style; too much like sixteen dozen other New York
girls.”
"He buttoned up his coat, braced himself against it, and gave his"
moustache a frantic twist.
"“Mrs.—Jessica!” he ejaculated desperately, “you are engaged to"
me—won’t you—won’t you—”
She drew herself up and glanced down upon him from her higher chair with
a look of sad disapproval.
"“I did not think it of you, Teddy,” she said. “And it is one of the"
things of which I have never approved.”
"“But why not?” asked Teddy, feebly."
“I thought you knew me better than to ask such a question.”
"“Oh, I have been worried to death!” murmured Teddy in her other ear."
“That wretched doctor had not only moved but gone out of town; and when
I came back at last and found—”
"“Mr. Severance,” exclaimed Trent, “you have my chair.”"
“Is this your chair? You have good taste. A remarkably comfortable
chair.”
“You would oblige me—”
"“By keeping it? Certainly. You were ever generous, but that I believe is"
a characteristic of genius.”
"“Mrs. Pendleton,” said Boswell, plaintively, “as Mr. Dedham has taken my"
"chair, I will take this stool at your feet.”"
"Trent was obliged to lean his elbow on the mantelpiece, for want of a"
"better view of Mrs. Pendleton, and Miss Decker sat on the other side of"
Dedham.
"“How are you, Teddy?” she said."
“Young and happy. You must let me congratulate you.”
“For what?”
"“I see you wear Severance’s ring. Ah, Sev, did the ring suit your"
sister?”
“To a T. Said it was her favourite stone.” He stopped abruptly. “What
the deuce—” below his breath; and Jessica whispered hurriedly:—
"columns of smoke close together, and you ought to know what that means.”"
“Indian sign! Boy Scout sign! Means ‘Help is wanted’!” exclaimed Harry.
“We’ve got to go and see what it is.”
"“It may be Jimmie,” Jack suggested."
"“It’s either Jimmie or that messenger boy,” Frank said. “If it’s Jimmie,"
"he’s really in trouble, and if it’s the messenger boy, he’s doing it to"
get more of us into his clutches.”
"“Then we’d better go well armed and ready for any kind of a reception,”"
Jack advised. “No knowing what we’ll find.”
“What’ll we do with Gilroy?” asked Frank.
"“Aw, let him sleep,” advised Harry."
"“Sure, let him sleep,” Jack put in. “He’ll be all right ’till we get"
back. No one will molest the camp in daytime.”
"“Seems to me that we ought to leave someone here,” Frank said."
"“All right, you can stay if you want to!” Jack declared. “Harry and I"
are going down there to see what the trouble is about.”
"“Aw, come on, Frank!” Harry urged. “There won’t anything happen to"
"Gilroy! He may have a bad dream, but that’s about all.”"
“How far do you suppose that signal is from here?” asked Frank.
"“Not more than half a mile,” Harry explained."
"What did it mean? Hastily, I could fill in “Dearest Nettie,” and “I am"
"dying to see you.” Kennedy added, “The Recherche to-day,” that being"
"the name of a new apartment uptown, as well as “love and many kisses.”"
But “—rman”—what did that mean? Could it be Herman—Herman Schloss?
She was returning and we resumed our seats quickly.
Kennedy took the jewel case from her and examined it carefully. There
was not a mark on it.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said slowly, rising and handing it back to her,"
“have you told me all?”
"“Why—yes,” she answered."
Kennedy shook his head gravely.
“I’m afraid not. You must tell me everything.”
"“No—no,” she cried vehemently, “there is nothing more.”"
"We left and outside the Deluxe he paused, looked about, caught sight of"
a taxicab and hailed it.
“Where?” asked the driver.
"“Across the street,” he said, “and wait. Put the window in back of you"
"down so I can talk. I’ll tell you where to go presently. Now, Walter,"
sit back as far as you can. This may seem like an underhand thing to
"do, but we’ve got to get what that woman won’t tell us or give up the"
case.”
"""Why, I saw him with Mr. Puttock."""
"""Yes; but Mr. Puttock knows nothing of him, except that he said he came"
from Shepherdstown. That's why Puttock was civil to him. The place is in
"his constituency."""
"""Got any idea, sir?"" the subordinate ventured to ask."
"The Superintendent was about to answer in the negative, when a detective"
entered the room.
"""Well, I've found one missing man for you,"" he said, in a satisfied"
tone.
"""One missing man!"" echoed his superior, scornfully. ""In a place o' this"
"size I'd always find you twenty."""
"The sergeant went on, unperturbed,"
"""François Gaspard, known as politician and agitator, didn't go home to"

"""Left no address, sir."""
"""How did he go, and where?"""
"""Not known, sir."""
"""Awake, Alice?"" Norton asked brightly."
"""Awake again,"" she said unhappily. ""For.... What is it? The ninth day?"""
"""Eighth,"" he said. ""Can't go on much longer."""
"""I hope not."""
"""You look all in,"" he said softly. He sat down on the edge of the"

Unexpectedly he bent and kissed her chastely on the forehead. Alice
"tensed at first, but relaxed almost immediately because the warmth of"
"that honest affection made her feel less alone and cold, in the depths"
"of uncharted space. Some of the worry and concern was erased, at least."
She stretched warmly as he rubbed her forehead with his cheek.
Then he sat up and looked down at her. He put his hand on her cheek
"gently and said, ""We'll be all right, kid."""
"""Eight days,"" she said in a hoarse whisper."
"He nodded solemnly. ""Every hour means they must be coming closer and"
"closer. Every lonely hour means that it can't be many more, because"
"they've covered all the places where we weren't. Follow me, Alice?"""
She shook her head unhappily.

"""First rate!"" said the crew.  ""That'll give 'em the jumps."""
"""And how am I to translate it?"" asked the miserable Simcox."
"""That's your look-out,"" said the Guffin, with a hiccup.  ""Shall I"
"keep a dog and bark myself?  Now, 'urry and get it hover.  And let"
"hevery one 'ave a weapon, 'andspikes and belayin' pins.  Now go,"
"Simcox!"""
"""Hart, come along with me,"" said Simcox."
"And as the ""old man"" was engaged in keeping his balance, he made no"
objection.
"""Exactly. Now read this,"" and he gave him the copy of a certificate of"
marriage between George Benyon and Margaret Aspland.
"""Quite so,"" nodded Kilshaw."
"""And this."""
"Kilshaw took the slip of newspaper, old and yellow. It contained a few"
"lines, briefly recording that Mrs. Benyon had left her home secretly by"
"night, in her husband's absence, and could not be found."
Kilshaw nodded again.
"""It doesn't surprise me,"" he said. ""I knew all this. I was in Mr."
"Benyon's confidence."""
"""Perhaps you can tell us how he lived?"" hazarded the Superintendent,"
with a shrewd look.
Mr. Kilshaw looked doubtful.
"""The inquest is fixed for to-morrow. The more we know now, the less it"
"will be necessary to protract it."""
"""I have been helping him lately,"" admitted Kilshaw; and he added, ""Look"
"here, Superintendent, I don't want that more talked about than"
"necessary."""
"""You needn't say a word to me now unless you like, sir; but I only want"
"to make things as comfortable as I can. You see, the coroner is bound to"
"look into it a bit. Had you given him money lately?"""
"happened here, and we want your assistance."""
"In an instant he became grave, for I suppose my tone showed him that I"
was in no humour for joking.
"""What's the nature of the affair?"" he asked."
"""Death,"" I replied seriously.  ""A lady here--a friend of mine--has died"
"mysteriously."""
"""A mystery--eh?"" he exclaimed, instantly interested.  ""Tell me about"
"it."""
"""This place,"" I replied, ""belongs to the Countess de Foville, a lady"
"whom I knew well when I was at the Brussels Embassy, and it is her"
"daughter Yolande who has been found dead in this room this evening."""
"""Yolande de Foville!"" he repeated, with knit brows.  ""She was a friend"
"of yours once, if I mistake not?"" he added, looking me straight in the"
face.
"""Yes, Dick, she was,"" I responded.  ""I told you of her long ago."""
"""You loved her once?"""
"""Yes,"" I answered with difficulty, ""I loved her once."""
"""And how did the unfortunate affair occur?"" he asked, folding his arms"
"and leaning back against a chair.  ""Tell me the whole story."""
"""I called here this afternoon, and spent half an hour or so with her,"" I"
"said.  ""Then I left and returned straight to the Embassy--"""
"""Ye-es?  Whom 'ave I--?"""
"""Mrs. Fiorsen."""
"""Ow!""  The sound of his breathing could be heard distinctly; he twisted a"
chair round and said:
"""Take a seat, won't you?"""
Gyp shook her head.
In Mr. Wagge's face a kind of deference seemed to struggle with some more
"primitive emotion.  Taking out a large, black-edged handkerchief, he blew"
"his nose, passed it freely over his visage, and turning to his daughter,"
muttered:
"""Go upstairs."""
"The girl turned quickly, and the last glimpse of her white face whipped"
"up Gyp's rage against men.  When the door was shut, Mr. Wagge cleared his"
throat; the grating sound carried with it the suggestion of enormously
thick linings.
He said more gruffly than ever:
"""May I ask what 'as given us the honour?"""
"""I came to see your daughter."""
"His little piggy eyes travelled from her face to her feet, to the walls"
"of the room, to his own watch-chain, to his hands that had begun to rub"
"""Come and help us!"" he called excitedly to the group of guests."
"""What's happened?"" somebody asked."
"""He fell off."""
How tired Solem was and drenched to the skin! But what could we do? Rush
up the mountainside and look at the accident too?
"""Can't he walk?"" somebody asked."
"""No, he's dead,"" said Solem, looking from one to another of us as though"
"to read in our faces whether his message seemed credible. ""He fell off; he"
"didn't want me to help him."""
A few more questions and answers. Josephine was already halfway across the
field; she was going to the village to telephone for the doctor.
"""We shall have to get him down,"" said the Danish mountaineer."
So he and I improvised a stretcher; Solem was instructed to take brandy
"and bandages to the site of the accident, and the Bergensians, the"
"Associate Master, Miss Torsen, and Mrs. Molie went with him."
"""Did you really say nothing to Solem about climbing the peak today?"" I"
asked the Dane.
"""No,"" he replied. ""I never said a word about it. If I had meant to go, I"
"should certainly not have wanted company...."""
Later that afternoon we returned with the lawyer on the stretcher. Solem
"""A mother's tender hand,"" said the King of Euralia,"
"""is--er--never--good gracious!  What's that?"""
There was a sudden rush of air; something came for a moment between
his Majesty and the sun; and then all was quiet again.
"""What was it?"" asked Hyacinth, slightly alarmed."
"""Most extraordinary,"" said the King.  ""It left in my mind an"
impression of ginger whiskers and large boots.  Do we know anybody
"like that?"""
"""The King of Barodia,"" said Hyacinth, ""has red whiskers, but I don't"
"know about his boots."""
"""But what could he have been doing up there?  Unless----"""
There was another rush of wind in the opposite direction; once more
"the sun was obscured, and this time, plain for a moment for all to"
"see, appeared the rapidly dwindling back view of the King of Barodia"
on his way home to breakfast.
Merriwig rose with dignity.
"""You're quite right, Hyacinth,"" he said sternly; ""it _was_ the King of"
"Barodia."""
Hyacinth looked troubled.
"""He oughtn't to come over anybody's breakfast table quite so quickly"
"as that.  Ought he, Father?"""
"“Cheer up, Andrew,” he cried."
Blotte smiled wearily; he roused from his brooding; he was very pale:
“Where’s the bar?” he asked gloomily.
Rippley laughed:
"“Vanity Fair has not opened her drinking-saloons yet,” he said. “We’re"
all before our welcome.”
"Blotte sighed, and said absently:"
“I have come to tell Pangbutt I cannot sup with him to-night.” He
"smiled a pale sad smile; and, rousing, added moodily: “I came into my"
Irish estates last night--took over the keys of my castle in Spain....
"Last night I slept under the blue quilt, and filled my belly with the"
"north wind. And,” he added hoarsely, “to-night I sup with the gods.”"
"Rippley shook the moody man by the shoulders, and gripping them in his"
"big kind hands, he said:"
"“Shut up, Blotte; you’ve got to sup with _us_ to-night--gods are a"
"large order, even Aubrey is not yet translated.”"
Blotte roused; laughed; strode into the middle of the great room. He
turned gloomily:
"“No--I go to a mighty banquet, old friend. I go to sup with the gods"
to-night.”
"""Gee, how'd you ever get away?"" asked Lav, admiringly, but Sidney had"
"no opportunity to explain for at that moment Mart joined them, eager"
and excited.
"""I put some cookies in my pocket,"" she exclaimed. ""You can't tell"
"what'll happen."""
"""Good. And I've got matches."""
Sidney wished she had thought of something to bring. Lav went on:
"""It isn't dark enough to go out yet. We got to be awful careful. You"
"girls sort o' walk up the beach as though we weren't all together."""
Lavender was actually pale and his eyes burned fiercely. Sidney looked
at him admiringly. She knew he was not thinking of the reward but of
the fair name of the Cape.
"Obediently the girls strolled up the beach. And, as they turned, a"
voice hailed them. To their consternation Pola came flying toward them.
At sight of her Sidney bit her lips with vexation. She gave a sidewise
glance at Mart and saw Mart's chin set stubbornly.
"""Sidney--wait a minute!"" Pola called and Sidney could do nothing but"
wait until Pola came up to them.
"""I thought you were going to stay in Chatham tonight."""
"""I should say _not_!"" Pola had enough breath to make her answer"
"expressive. ""I was never so bored in my life. Those Truxton girls are"
"""Charmed to see you in London, _mon confrère_,"" said he. ""Have you yet"
"discovered your man?"""
"""I am hard at his heels,"" the detective answered, his eyes searching"
"Slyne's as if, Sallie thought, for some sign that that shaft had hit"
home.
"But Slyne's expression was one of ingenuous simplicity. He bowed, as if"
with deep respect.
"""I caught a glimpse of some one most amazingly like myself, one day on"
"the Faubourg St. Honoré, as I was passing through Paris,"" he mentioned"
reflectively.
"""Thanks,"" returned Dubois. ""It was he, no doubt. And--he's in London"
"now."""
"Slyne did not wince, even at that."
"""He was dining at the Savoy to-night,"" said Dubois indifferently. ""How"
"does your own affair progress?"""
"""_Assez bien_,"" Slyne answered in an even voice. ""I have followed my"
"quarry home and am awaiting developments."""
"""You will be in London for a little, then?"""
"""For the next week or ten days, I expect,"" Slyne lied with perfect"
aplomb.
"""We shall meet again, in that case,"" declared the detective, glancing at"
"Sallie; and, ""_Au plaisir de vous revoir, monsieur_,"" Slyne returned"
never accepts my invitations.  I cannot tell why.  I don't fancy he
"considers me his friend."""
"""Sibyl was at your reception the other evening,"" I remarked suddenly."
"""She told me she met a man who was a stranger in Paris.  His name, I"
"think she said, was Wolf--Rodolphe Wolf.  Who is he?"""
"""He was introduced by de Wolkenstein, the Austrian Ambassador,"" she"
"replied quickly.  ""I did not know him."""
"""Have you never met him before?""  I asked, looking sharply into her"
eyes.
"""Once, I think, but I am not certain,"" she said, with a palpable effort"
to evade my question.
I smiled.
"""Come, madame,"" I said good-humouredly, ""you know Rodolphe Wolf quite as"
"well as I do.  When you last met, his name was not Wolf.  Is not that"
"so?"""
"""Well,"" she answered, ""now that you put it in that manner I may as well"
"admit that your suggestion is correct."""
"""And what is the object of his sudden visit to Paris?"""
"""I cannot make out,"" she replied in a more confidential tone.  ""As I"
"tell you, de Wolkenstein introduced him, but, as m'sieur knows, I am"
"very quick to detect a face that I have once seen, and I recognised him"
"in an instant."""
Rockman's and another on Teal's and no knowin' how many in the bay!
"Every constable on the Cape's here, damn them! And old Davies's been"
"'round all day and he ain't rigged up for any picnic!"""
"""If we don't take it off tonight Lav Green may find it--or that girl--"""
"At that someone laughed, horribly. ""Huh--_him_! Why we could twist"
"every crooked bone in his body until he wouldn't know 'em. Him--ha,"
"that's a joke! Why, a look 'ud scare him to a pulp. The girl, too."""
"Sidney, reaching her hand out instinctively, caught Lavender's and held"
it tight. She felt the writhing of his body.
"A new voice broke in above them. ""I got a better scheme. Listen."
"We'll--"" But the voices suddenly died to silence; the footsteps moved"
away.
"The four, huddled in the darkness of the cabin, drew long trembling"
breaths.
"""Lav, those diamonds are on this boat!"""
"""Sh--h. I know it. But we got to be careful. They haven't gone yet. We"
got to wait. And we'll wait until we find 'em. Damn them _I'll_ show
"them who's crooked!"""
"""Hush,"" implored Sidney. ""Of course you will"""
"""Isn't it most morning? I--I wish I was home,"" quavered Pola; but no"
one paid any heed to her.
"With the howling of the wind, the slap-slap of the water, it was"
"""What have you got?"" she asked."
"""One pair,--aces. What have you?"""
"""Nothing,"" throwing her cards upon the table."
"With just a flicker of a smile, the Sheriff once more gathered up the"
"pack, saying smoothly:"
"""Even now,--we're even."""
"""It's the next hand that tells, Jack, ain't it?"""
"""Yes."""
"""It's the next hand that tells me,--I'm awfully sorry,--"" the words"
"seemed to come awkwardly; her glance was troubled, almost contrite, ""at"
"any rate, I want to say jest now that no matter how it comes out--"""
"""Cut!"" interjected Rance mechanically."
"""--that I'll always think of you the best I can,"" completed the Girl"
"with much feeling. ""An' I want you to do the same for me."""
"Silently, inscrutably, the gambler dealt the ten cards, one by one. But"
"as the Girl started to draw hers toward her, his long, thin fingers"
reached across once more and closed not ungently upon hand and cards.
"""The last hand, Girl!"" he reminded her. ""And I've a feeling that I"
"win,--that in one minute I'll hold you in my arms."" And still covering"
"her fingers with his own, he stole a glance at his cards."
more.
"""You know,"" she began, ""there's more to marriage than just--"""
"""So there is,"" he cut in. ""Well, we can try each other for taste."" And"
"he pulled her in, both of his great hands practically covering her"
"slim, straight back."
Neither of them said anything for a bit after he let go. Butt spoke up
first.
"""Now, me,"" he said, ""I'd vote yes."""
Sis ran the tip of her tongue kind of delicately from side to side
of her mouth. Then she stepped back slowly and looked at him as if
she were figuring out how many feet high he was. She kept on moving
"backward, tapping her chin, while Butt and I got more and more"
"impatient. When she touched the lifeboat door, she pushed it open and"
jumped out.
*       *       *       *       *
"Butt ran over and looked down the crossway. After a while, he shut the"
"door and came back beside me. ""Well,"" he said, swinging to a bunk,"
"""that's sort of it."""
"""You're better off, Butt,"" I burst out. ""You shouldn't have a woman"
"like Sis for a wife. She looks small and helpless, but don't forget"
"she was trained to run an underwater city!"""
"""Wasn't worrying about that,"" he grinned. ""_I_ grew up in the fifteen"
"long years of the Blue Chicago Rising. Nope."" He turned over on his"
"her waist: ""Ah, my Gyp!  I shall be a different being, now."""
"And Gyp went on smiling.  Between that, and stabbing these false raptures"
"to the heart, there seemed to be nothing she could do. The moment his"
"hands relaxed, she got up and said:"
"""You know there's a baby in the house?"""
He laughed.
"""Ah, the baby!  I'd forgotten.  Let's go up and see it."""
Gyp answered:
"""You go."""
She could feel him thinking: 'Perhaps it will make her nice to me!' He
turned suddenly and went.
"She stood with her eyes shut, seeing the divan in the music-room and the"
"girl's arm shivering.  Then, going to the piano, she began with all her"
might to play a Chopin polonaise.
"That evening they dined out, and went to ""The Tales of Hoffmann."" By such"
devices it was possible to put off a little longer what she was going to
"do.  During the drive home in the dark cab, she shrank away into her"
"corner, pretending that his arm would hurt her dress; her exasperated"
nerves were already overstrung.  Twice she was on the very point of
"crying out: ""I am not Daphne Wing!""  But each time pride strangled the"
words in her throat.  And yet they would have to come.  What other reason
could she find to keep him from her room?
There was a titter.
“Sharles ze Foorst--risen from ze dead!” announced Rippley.
“I say”--the affected drawl discovered Ffolliott. “Rippley told me it
"was a--fancy-dress--affair,” he said plaintively. “And to come early.”"
There was a wild shout of laughter.
"Ffolliott looked round nervously at the strange faces, and recognising"
"Aubrey at last, by the mirror, he said peevishly:"
“I am exceedingly displeased with Rippley--he--he chose my dress.”
Rippley wiped the tears from his eyes:
"“Well--don’t you see we are nearly all in disguise? ... except Aubrey,"
who thinks that because he looks like an ass no one will know him.” He
"turned to the others: “I say, boys,” he added, chuckling, “things are"
beginning to move at last. This _is_ going to be a unique night.”
“Hush!”
"They had all turned to Blotte, and a strange silence fell upon the room."
"Andrew Blotte stood listening, as to some strange sounds. He roused:"
"“Ay, I sup with the gods to-night.... And I can hear the guests"
arriving--all the clever fellows that have made the world a
delight--and with them come the dear dead companions that worked with
"us, and sang with us, and drank with us--in Paris.... I know them--they"
"haven't we, Tommy?"""
"""Double it,"" Tommy laughed. ""We agreed last night that you looked like a"
"million-dollar bill to us!"""
"""Oh, my boys,"" Monsieur sputtered with embarrassment and pleasure, ""you"
"disarm my power to thank you--see, I blush!"""
"""Damned if he isn't,"" Tommy grinned at me. ""What d'you know about this"
"little gezabo, anyhow!"""
Monsieur's face grew more composed as he showed his interest in a new
word.
"""You say--gazebo?"" he asked, blandly. ""Is that not a belvedere?"""
"""Gazebo is, yes; but I said gezabo--that's you!"""
"""Your American Indian language?"""
"""Sure thing. Pure talk. If you're interested in Indians, stick around."
"Why not get the Havana police to help us hunt the kiddie?""--I had known"
that before long Tommy would be using a first personal pronoun.
"""Bah! They are of no value! But even I have small hope of finding her."
"The report was written nearly six years ago, and she has been gone"
"upwards of twenty years."""
"""So it's a she,"" Tommy looked over at me and nodded. ""Well, nearly six"
"years, and upwards of twenty, plus what she was when she left home,"
leads me to believe the lady's almost old enough to take care of
"herself!"""
"ROUNDSIVEL, CAPTAIN GEORGE."
Of the Bahama Islands.
He refused to avail himself of King George's pardon to all pirates in
"1717, and went off again on the ""main chance"" till captured."
"ROW, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"In 1679, at the Boca del Toro, was with the buccaneer fleet that attacked"
"and sacked Santa Maria. Row commanded a small vessel of twenty tons, a"
"crew of twenty-five men, and no guns."
RUIZ.
"One of Captain Gilbert's crew in the pirate schooner _Panda_, which"

"hanged on September 12th, 1835."
RUPERT. Prince of the Rhine.
"After an adventurous life as a soldier on the Continent, he sailed from"
Ireland in 1648 with seven ships. His own ship was the _Swallow_. He was a
"man of boundless energy, who was never happy if not engaged in some"
"enterprise, and as legitimate warfare gave him few opportunities he turned"
"pirate. He spent five years at sea, largely in the West Indies, meeting"
with every kind of adventure.

"“By Pegasus?” sneered Aubrey, raising ironic eyebrows."
Lovegood laughed:
"“No--by omnibus,” said he. “Let us all be winged asses to-night. Fosse"

From the great doorway:
“Mistair and Mrs. Nezzerbie Gomme!” announced Rippley; and as the pair
"were greeted by all near them, Rippley stepped to the head of the great"
"stairs, and going up to a pompous man as that worthy set foot on the"
"topmost step, he said to him confidentially:"
"“I say, mister, would you mind running down the stairs and telling the"
fellar with the red hair that I want him?”
Sir Tankerton Wollup swelled slowly:
"“Pooh--pooh!” said he, drawing himself up; and he strutted to the door."
“Poof--poof!” said Rippley. “Giddy old thing!”
"He glanced over the balustrade down to the next landing, and caught"
Doome’s eye:
“Beelzebub!” he growled--“the whole town’s coming to this silly
"theatrical affair.... I say, we ought to go and see that Andrew"
Blotte’s mixing the hats thoroughly. Hullo! There’s Anthony Baddlesmere
"just arrived. Wait, I’ll come down. I want to see him.”"
_stupid_. And I kept wondering what you were doing. I coaxed mother to
let Shields bring me back and she said she would provided I came and
stayed with you tonight. Can you squeeze me in? Dug will give me his

"Sidney cast a wild glance toward Mart. She started to answer, then"
stopped. Pola looked from her to Mart and back again to Sidney.
"""What's the mystery? If you don't want me I'll go to the hotel."""
"""Oh, Pola, it isn't that. It's--it's--"""
"""Sidney Romley I'll bet you're up to something! And if you are, you"
simply have got to let me in on it! I'm just pepped up to some
"excitement. Tell me what's up."""
"The girls turned slowly and walked toward Lav and the dory, Pola"
between them.
"""It isn't any fun,"" Sidney explained slowly. ""It's something"
serious--and--and dangerous. And you'll have to ask Mart and Lav if you
"can come with us."""
"""You'll let me go, won't you, Mart?"" Pola begged with friendly"
"entreaty, forgetting she had ever thought Mart a riot."
Sidney introduced Pola to Lavender and turned away that she might not
see the pain that flashed across Lavender's face.
"""Pola came back to stay all night with me. She wants to go with us and"
"if she doesn't I guess I'll have to go back home."""

"""I'm sorry to say, sir,"" said the Superintendent, ""that the detective"
sergeant conducting the search took upon him to open this packet in the
presence of one or two persons. It ought to have been opened by no one
"but----"""
"""Myself."""
"""Pardon me, but myself,"" said the Superintendent, with a slight smile."
"""Owing to the inexcusable blunder, I'm afraid something about what it"
"contains may leak out prematurely. Those pests, the reporters, are"
"everywhere; you can't keep 'em out."""
"""Well, what does it contain?"" asked Kilshaw. He was annoyed at this"
"unsought publicity, but he saw at once that he must show no sign of"
vexation.
"""That, for one thing,"" and the Superintendent handed Kilshaw a"
"photograph of two persons, a young woman and a young man. ""Look at the"
"back,"" he added."
"Kilshaw looked, and read--""My wife and M."""
"""That's the deceased's handwriting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""And you know the persons?"""
"""I've no doubt about them. It's the Premier--and--and Mrs. Medland."""
Something of the light of triumph came stealing back to the old
tear-stained face.
“And Julia?” he asked.
"“I’ve sent her out to get tickets for the theatre,” she said drily."
“They will want amusing badly to-night--and the tuning of the fiddles
"would always rouse my Netherby.... But you’d better go up and see him,"
Noll--you used to know the way.”
Noll made a pause to take breath at the top of the stairs (how he and
Betty had raced up those steps!). He pushed open the attic door.
"In the midst of the smudgy dusk that filled the room, his head in his"
"hands, elbows on knees, sat the dim figure of Netherby Gomme, sobbing"
pitifully.
"Noll shut the door softly, and went up to the bowed man:"
"“Good God, Netherby!” said he--“what’s this?”"
"He gripped his hand upon the other’s shoulder, affectionately."
Gomme signed him to a seat:
"“Sit down, Noll--I’ll be all right in a minute.” He blew his nose."
"“No--better still, light the gas. I must stop. Tears will not bring"
"back one’s dead, nor grief annul the things that are done. Light up! A"
man can only cry comfortably in the dark.”
"Noll struck a light, turned on the tap of the wrought-iron gas-jet; and"
The last sheet of notations was covered. Then John Dennis sat motionless
"for a minute, his frown and uncertainty returning. ""It's hard to project"
"the details,"" he said. ""All this detail. Difficult."""
He dropped the last sheet and got up and poured himself another Scotch.
"""They will make an army now,"" he said. The Scotch went down smoothly. He"
"went to the window and looked out. ""This planet is different. The sun"
"there is blue and the air is very thin. Their bodies are nothing, but"
their heads are very big. Now they will create an army and take this
"planet."""
Frank Corson was shaking his head slowly like a groggy fighter. Rhoda
"sat huddled on the sofa, her mind such a mixture of tumbling emotions"
that it seemed to be trying to tear itself out of her head. John Dennis
"came back and stood in the middle of the room. He swayed drunkenly. ""So"
many things I don't understand. I see people I know--or I should know.
"I--"" He turned his eyes--eyes no longer empty--on Rhoda."
"""I want to make love!"""
Frank Corson got up from his chair and hurled himself on Dennis.
Rhoda screamed.

Senator Crane sat at his desk. There were a pile of newspapers in front
of him. The first one carried a front page story with the headline:
SENATOR CRANE WARNS OF SPACE INVASION

"stomach; as when digestion is going on, the contents of the stomach are"
acid in reaction and if alkalies are given combinations take place and
"salts are formed. If alkalies are given before digestion begins,"
"diffusion of the acid-forming constituents of the blood takes place, and"
in this way the acidity of the gastric juice is promoted; likewise acids
given before meals increase the diffusion of the alkaline constituents
of the blood.

Myre went suddenly dumb....
"Sir Gilders Persimmon had shuffled over to Fosse, who was wetting his"
"lips, eager to leap into the debate, when Myre’s yawing should give"
"opportunity, and, button-holing the fussy little man, the deaf old"
gentleman asked him:
"“You said, sir, that the reformed rake did what?”"
"“No, Sir Gilders--I said that the man who does not play whist is laying"
up a sad old age----”
The old gentleman poked him slyly in the lean ribs:
"“Makes the best husband, eh! Indeed, yes--very likely--very likely. But"
it’s dangerous doctrine--it’s----”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” shrieked the perspiring little man--“I say the man"
"who does not play _whist_.” He coughed--his voice breaking. “Oh, damn"
"this old gentleman!” he added, moving irritably away from him...."
Quogge Myre turned to Pangbutt:
"“Now, Pangbutt, mind you, I don’t say that this Anthony Bickersteth is"
a Balzac; but he has the true genius for literature. How can you define
"these things? It is there, or it is not there!”"
Fosse skipped up to the group:
“What _I_ say--what _I_ say----”

ACT I
The SCENE is the pretty drawing-room of a flat.  There are two
"doors, one open into the hall, the other shut and curtained."
"Through a large bay window, the curtains of which are not yet"
"drawn, the towers of Westminster can be seen darkening in a"
summer sunset; a grand piano stands across one corner.  The
"man-servant PAYNTER, clean-shaven and discreet, is arranging two"
tables for Bridge.
"BURNEY, the maid, a girl with one of those flowery Botticellian"
"faces only met with in England, comes in through the curtained"
"door, which she leaves open, disclosing the glimpse of a white"
"wall.  PAYNTER looks up at her; she shakes her head, with an"
expression of concern.
PAYNTER.  Where's she gone?
"BURNEY.  Just walks about, I fancy."
PAYNTER.  She and the Governor don't hit it!  One of these days
she'll flit--you'll see.  I like her--she's a lady; but these
thoroughbred 'uns--it's their skin and their mouths.  They'll go till
"they drop if they like the job, and if they don't, it's nothing but"
jib--jib--jib.  How was it down there before she married him?
"BURNEY.  Oh!  Quiet, of course."
"""Yuri Andreevich, she's here and she's Soviet."" The chief mechanic"
"followed him. ""Some believe she arrived this morning with the CEO, but"
"nobody knows who she is. One rumor is she's Vera Karanova."""
"""Who?"" The name was vaguely familiar."
"""T-Directorate. Like I said, no one knows for sure, but that's what"
"we've heard."""
"""Impossible."" He halted and turned back, frowning."
"""That's just it, Yuri Andreevich,"" he sighed. ""Those KGB bastards are"
not supposed to even know about this project.
That was everybody's strict understanding. We were to be free of them
"here. But now . . ."" He caught the sleeve of Androv's flight jacket and"
"pulled him aside, out of the flow of pedestrian traffic in the hallway."
"""My men were wondering. Maybe you could find a way to check her out?"
"You have better access. Everybody wants to know what's going on."""
"""KGB? It doesn't make any sense."""
"""If she's really . . . I just talked to the project kurirovat, Ivan"
"Semenovich, and he told me Karanova's now number three in T-"
"Directorate."""
"""Well, there's nothing we can do now, so the hell with her."" He waved"
"his hand and tried to move on. ""We've both got better things to worry"
"about."""
"""Just keep your antenna tuned, my friend, that's all. Let me know if"
"you can find out anything. Is she really Karanova? Because if she is,"

Sossing and possing in the dirt still from day to day.
A hundred things that be abroad cham set to see them well:

"_Hodge._ The devil he burst both Gib and Tib, with all the rest;"
"Cham always sure of the worst end, whoever have the best."
"Where ha' you been fidging abroad, since you your nee'le lost?"
"_Gammer._ Within the house, and at the door, sitting by this same"
post;
"Where I was looking a long hour, before these folks came here."
"But, wellaway! all was in vain; my nee'le is never the near."

Knee-deep in the water he tried to shout but he had no strength. A
"terrible faintness was creeping over him. His arms outstretched, he"
"stumbled forward toward the voices. Oh, he must _not_ yield to that"
overpowering sleepiness until he had made them know!
"""Help--help!"" he gasped, reeling toward the shadowy forms."
"""What the blazes--"" A man ran forward. Two others came at his heels."
"""Why, _it's Lav Green_!"" one of them cried."
"""The _Arabella_--adrift out there--Sidney's on it--oh--_help_! And then"
Lavender slipped into the strong arms that reached out to catch him.
"""Quick, the _Sally_! She's at Rockman's!"" Captain Davies ran toward"
"Rockman's wharf. Before Jed Starrow's men, concealed behind the shed"
"could guess their intention, three men had jumped into the big motor"
boat and had swung her free of the wharf.
"""What the hell--"" shouted an ugly voice after them, but the _Sally_"
only chugged out into the darkness of the bay.
*       *       *       *       *
"""Look, Sid--light! It's--it's--morning!"" Mart's voice came in a thin"
whisper. For a long time the girls had lain huddled against the
"taff-rail of the boat, too weary and disheartened to even talk."
Sidney lifted her face to the tiny streak of light that gleamed palely
in the east.
Then she shook Pola ever so slightly. Poor Pola had fallen into a sleep
"board H.M.S. _King Fisher_. Eventually he reached Bristol, where he"
"bought, with his share of booty, a horse and two pistols, with which to go"
on the highway.
"Hanged on June 17th, 1747, for stealing an old silver watch and 5s. from"
Mr. Francis Sleep at Dunstable.
"SKIPTON, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded a pirate ship, in which he sailed in company with Captain"
"Spriggs. Being chased by H.M.S. _Diamond_ off the coast of Cuba, Skipton"
"ran his sloop on to the Florida Reef. Escaping with his crew to an island,"
"they were attacked by the Indians, and many of them were captured and"
"eaten. The survivors, embarking in a canoe, were caught by the man-of-war"
and taken prisoner.
"SKYRM, CAPTAIN JAMES. Welsh pirate."
Hanged at the advanced age--for a pirate--of 44.
"Commanded the _Ranger_, one of Captain Roberts's ships that cruised in"
1721 and 1722 off the West Coast of Africa. In the fight with the King's
"ship that took him he was very active with a drawn sword in his hand, with"
which he beat any of his crew who were at all backward. One of his legs
"was shot away in this action, but he refused to leave the deck and go"
below as long as the action lasted. He was condemned to death and hanged
in chains.
"SMITH, GEORGE. Welsh pirate."
"als wir--He's no better than we are!"""
"""Did you ever see him?"""
"""Yes, he came into the trenches a week ago and gave us cakes and"
"cigars."""
"""But that was jolly sporting of him, wasn't it?"""
"""He can keep his cigars--_he_ doesn't have to lie in shell holes for"
"days on end."""
"""War's no good,"" said a small man with a protruding forehead and keen"
"eyes and wearing a red-cross on his arm. ""Ich danke meinem Gott--I thank"
"my God that I've never taken up a rifle during the whole war, and I've"
been in it since the beginning. No human being has lost his life through
"me, thank God."""
"""Was für'n Zweck hat es--What's the good of shooting each other like"
"this? The heads ought to come and fight it out amongst themselves."""
"""It's good for politicians and profiteers--für die ist's gut."""
"""Ask them what they think of the submarines."""
A Lieutenant of the Prussian Guard answered contemptuously that he
didn't think much of them. He didn't believe stories of food-shortage in
"England, he didn't believe anything the papers said, they were all full"
of lies.
"""Ask them if they're satisfied with their treatment."""
"“Now, Mrs. Moulton,” he said gently, “I’m afraid I must trouble you to"
go with me. I am going over to a pawnbroker’s on the Bowery.”
"“The Bowery?” she repeated, with a genuinely surprised shudder. “Oh,"
"no, Mr. Kennedy. Don’t ask me to go anywhere to-night. I am—I am in no"
condition to go anywhere—to do anything—I—”
"“But you must,” said Kennedy in a low voice."
“I can’t. Oh—have mercy on me. I am terribly upset. You—”
"“It is your duty to go, Mrs. Moulton,” he repeated."
“I don’t understand.” she murmured. “A pawnbroker’s?”
"“Come,” urged Kennedy, not harshly but firmly, then, as she held back,"
"added, playing a trump card, “We must work quickly. In his hands we"
found the fragments of a torn dress. When the police—”
"She uttered a shriek. A glance had told her, if she had deceived"
"herself before, that Kennedy knew her secret."
"Antoinette Moulton was standing before him, talking rapidly."
“Some one has told Lynn. I know it. There is nothing now that I can
conceal. If you had come half an hour later you would not have found
"me. He had written to Mr. Schloss, threatening him that if he did not"
leave the country he would shoot him at sight. Mr. Schloss showed me
the letter.
"“It had come to this. I must either elope with Schloss, or lose his"
"""Were you just like what you are now when you were young?"" asked"
Kuvalda simply.  The other's nostrils twitched.  Ivan Andreyevitch
"sighed, passed his hand over his eyes and said:"
"""Oh!  When I was young I had to undergo a great many difficulties ..."
"Work!  Oh!  I did work!"""
"""And you cheated, too, I suppose?"""
"""People like you?  Nobles?  I should just think so! They used to grovel"
"at my feet!"""
"""You only went in for robbing, not murder, I suppose?"" asked the"
"Captain.  Petunikoff turned pale, and hastily changed the subject."
"""You are a bad host.  You sit while your guest stands."""
"""Let him sit, too,"" said Kuvalda."
"""But what am I to sit on?"""
"""On the earth ... it will take any rubbish ..."""
"""You are the proof of that,"" said Petunikoff quietly, while his eyes"
shot forth poisonous glances.
"And he went away, leaving Kuvalda under the pleasant impression that"
the merchant was afraid of him.  If he were not afraid of him he would
long ago have evicted him from the dosshouse.  But then he would think
"twice before turning him out, because of the five roubles a month. And"
the Captain gazed with pleasure at Petunikoff's back as he slowly
"retreated from the courtyard. Following him with his eyes, he noticed"
again.
"""I s'pose they had one o' them little lovers' quarrels an' that made 'er"
"tell you, eh?"" She laughed a forced little laugh, though her heart was"
"beating strangely as she kept on: ""He's the kind o' man who sort o'"
"polkas with every girl he meets."" And at this she began to laugh almost"
hysterically.
"Rance, who resented her apologising to anyone but himself, stood"
scowling at her.
"""What are you laughing at?"" he questioned."
"""Oh, nothin', Jack, nothin',"" half-cried, half-laughed the Girl. ""Only"
"it's kind o' funny how things come out, ain't it? Took in! Nina"
Micheltoreña! Nice company he keeps--one o' them Cachuca girls with
"eyelashes at half-mast!"""
"Once more, she broke out into a fit of laughter."
"""Well, well,"" she resumed, ""an' she sold 'im out for money! Ah, Jack"
"Rance, you're a better guesser'n I am!"" And with these words she sank"
down at the table in an apathy of misery. Horror and hatred and
hopelessness had possession of her. A fierce look was in her eyes when a
"moment later she raised her head and abruptly dismissed the boys,"
saying:
"""Well, boys, it's gittin' late--good-night!"""
Sonora was the first to make a movement towards the door.
"""Come on, boys,"" he growled in his deep bass voice; ""don't you intend to"
"""No doubt.  As soon as she returned she began to talk of him."""
And next instant I recollected the strange effect the news of his
"arrival in Paris had had upon Yolande, and the curiously tragic event"
which had subsequently occurred.  All was puzzling--all inscrutable.
A silence fell between us.  I was revolving in my mind whether I should
ask this wizen-faced old leader of Society a further question.  With
sudden resolve I turned to her again and asked:
"""O Baronne, I had quite forgotten.  Do you chance to know the Countess"
"de Foville, of Brussels?  They have a chateau down in the Ardennes, and"
"move in the best set in Belgium?"""
"""De Foville?  De Foville?"" she repeated.  ""What, do you mean the mother"
"of that little witch Yolande?"""
"""Yes.  But why do you call her a witch?""  I demanded, with feigned"
laughter.
"""Why?"" cried the old woman, the expression of her face growing dark with"
"displeasure.  ""Well, I do not know whether she is a friend of yours, but"
"all I can tell you is that should she be, the best course for you to"
"pursue is to cut her acquaintance."""
"""What do you mean?""  I gasped."
"""I mean exactly what I have said."""
"""But I don't understand,"" I cried.  ""Be more frank with me,"" I implored."
"“Don’t quote the critics, for Heaven’s sake,” said Severance. “It is"
enough to have read them.”
"“Oh, Mrs. Pendleton,” exclaimed Teddy, “if you could have been at the"
"yacht race! Such excitement, such—”"
"“To change the subject,” said Trent, with determination in his eye,"
"“Mrs. Pendleton, did you receive all the marked papers I sent you"
"containing my speeches, especially the one on Jesuitism in Politics?”"
"“Don’t bother Mrs. Pendleton with politics!” exclaimed Boswell, whose"
own egotism was kicking against its bars. “You did not think my book too
"long, did you? One purblind critic said—”"
"“Good night, Mrs. Pendleton,” said Severance, rising abruptly. “Good"
"evening,” and he bowed to Miss Decker and to the men. Jessica rose"
suddenly and went with him to the door.
"“I am going to walk on the cliffs—‘Forty Steps’—at eleven to-morrow,”"
"she said, as she gave him her hand. “This may be unconventional, but _I_"
choose to do it.”
He bowed over her hand. “Mrs. Pendleton will only have set one more
"fashion,” he said. “I shall be there.”"
"As he left the room by one door, Jessica crossed the room and opened"
another.
"“Good night,” she said to the astounded company, and withdrew."

PROCEDURE
"Having settled upon a definite plan, the indexer seats himself at a"
"The foreigners, perceiving that the Englishman was on an errand of"
"peace, gathered about the case, and soon discovered from the"
stencilled inscription that it at any rate pretended to come from
Cognac.
"""Goddam,"" said the little red-capped Frenchman who had first"
"discovered them.  ""Cognac!  I spik English--brandee, Por'smout',"
"Lon-don!"""
Jones made signs that he presented the case to them.
"""I ain't above makin' a concession or two,"" he remarked"
"confidentially to the French captain; ""but if I'd listened to my lot"
"on board, it would 'ave been blood up to the neck."""
The Frenchman shook his head.
"""You bet it would 'ave bin,"" said Jones earnestly, ""but what d'ye say"
"to 'avin' a drink?  Billy, gimme your knife."""
"And with it he started opening the case, while the Frenchmen's eyes"
gleamed in pleasing anticipation.  They had not had a drink for
weeks.  And as they carried the case down to the ship with Jones and
"their own captain in the rear, they concluded that the English were"
not such bad chaps after all.
"""But where's my man 'Art!"" asked Jones, when he came to the French"
camp.
"""'Ere I be,"" cried Hart, who was lashed hard and fast to a round"
"rock.  ""Lord, captain, but I've 'ad a time.  Can't you cut me adrift,"
her hands on his arm. The boy's form in its light underwear showed
pitifully crooked but Sidney saw him straight and she saw the gleam in
his eyes. Suddenly she remembered what Vick had said so lightly about
"the Grail. Ah, she was seeing its gleam now, transcendently beautiful,"
in Lav's eyes! She dropped her hold of his arm.
"""You see, I've _got_ to try it, Sid."" And she understood. He went on:"
"""I'll swim for the lighthouse. They can telephone from there to"
Rockman's. You girls find a light and signal with it. Don't lose your
"nerve, Sid."" He poised for an instant on the rail then plunged into the"
black water.
"""Oh, _Lav_,"" cried Sidney. She leaned far over the side of the boat."
"She could see nothing but a crest of foam. ""Mart, he's--he's--drowned!"""
Pola screamed again.
CHAPTER XX
"""THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!"""
In the sunny embrasure of Mrs. White's morning room Trude Romley sorted
"over the mail that Pepper, the butler, had brought in. So gay and"
"colorful was the room itself with its cretonnes, its soft tinted walls,"
"its singing birds, in wicker cages, that it seemed a part of the"
fragrant garden that crowded close to the French windows. A tiny
fountain splashed azure blue water over delicately sculptured nymphs; a
flowering vine trailed around the windows.
“At the Hotel Excelsior. We are staying there. Will you come?” “All
right.”
"Laura accepted, and they went to the Via Veneto with the Englishman"
riding beside them.
They went into the hotel and passed through to the “hall” full of
"people, Marchmont sent word to his wife by a servant, to come down."
Laura and Cæsar seated themselves with the Englishman.
"“This hotel is unbearable,” exclaimed Marchmont; “there is nothing here"
but Americans.”
"“Your wife, however, must like that,” said Cæsar."
"“No. Susanna is more European every day, and she doesn’t care for the"
"shrieking elegance of her compatriots. Besides, her father is here, and"
that makes her feel less American.”
"“It is an odd form of filial enthusiasm,” remarked Cæsar."
"“It doesn’t shock me. I almost think it’s the rule,” replied Marchmont;"
“at home I could see that my brothers and sisters hated one another
"cordially, and that every member of the family wanted to get away from"
the others. You two who are so fond of each other are a very rare
instance. Is it frequent in Spain that brothers and sisters like one
another?”
"“Yes, there are instances of it,” answered Cæsar, laughing."
"Mrs. Marchmont arrived, accompanied by an old man who evidently was her"
"sir?"""
Jones shook his head.
"""You interferin' galoot, it serves you right.  And as for that, the"
"'ole crew's under arrest, where I put 'em for mut'ny, and I don't see"
as I should so pick and choose among 'em as to use my hinfluence to
"'ave you let go.  At any rate, bide a bit, and I'll see."""
For it was obvious that the drinking was going to begin.  The French
"captain served the liquor out in a small glass to every one, and"
presently some of his melancholy disappeared.  He gave an order to
"one of his men who brought two more glasses, one for the English"
"captain, and one for himself."
"""I looks towards you,"" said Jones."
"""À votre santé,"" cried the Frenchman.  ""Monsieur, vous êtes un homme"
"de coeur quand mêne."""
"""I don't savvy, but I dessay you means well,"" said the captain."
"""Now, if I'd thought to bring along the signal book we might 'ave 'ad"
quite a talk.  But time enough; I dessay afore we're took off I shall
"patter your lingo like blazes.  Shall I cut my man loose there?"""
"He pointed to Hart, and though two of the Frenchmen, who had black"
"eyes, remonstrated against the deed of mercy, Hart was unlashed and"
given a drink.
"""Here's to you, old cocklywax,"" said Hart, with a scrape of his leg."
"""I bears no grudge, not me."""

REVENGE IN AN ALIEN WORLD
When Gail Loring chose Bill Drake to be her husband--in name only--for
"the duration of the flight to Mars, she didn't know that she had just"
signed his death warrant.
"Jealous Dr. Spartan, leader of the expedition, swore to get revenge and"
force Gail to share his maniacal plan for power.
"Bound together in space, five men and a woman strained against the"
powerful tug of twisted emotions and secret ambitions.
But all plans were forgotten when they landed on the Red Planet and
"encountered the Martians--half animal, half vegetable, with acid for"
blood and radar for sight.
"Thus died a monster of cruelty, who would, had he lived to-day, have been"
confined in an asylum for lunatics.
NEAL.
A fisherman of Cork.
"Mutinied in a French ship sailing from Cork to Nantes in 1721, and, under"
"the leadership of Philip Roche, murdered the captain and many of the crew"
and became a pirate.

"NELSON, CAPTAIN."
"Born on Prince Edward Island, where his father had a grant of land for"
"services rendered in the American war. He was a wealthy man, a member of"
the Council and a Colonel of the Militia. In order to set his son up in
"life he bought him a captaincy in the Militia and a fine farm, where young"
"Nelson married and settled down. Buying a schooner, he used to sail to"
Halifax with cargoes of potatoes and fruit. He seems to have liked these
"trips in which he combined business with pleasure, for we learn that on"
"these visits to Halifax he ""was very wild, and drank and intrigued with"
"the girls in an extravagant manner."" Getting into disgrace on Prince"
Of London.
One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy at
"Charleston on November 8th, 1718, and found ""not guilty."""
"NONDRE, PEDRO."
"Hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in February, 1823. At the time of execution"
it was observed that he was covered with the marks of deep wounds. On the
"scaffold he wept bitterly. An immensely heavy man, he broke the rope, and"
had to be hanged a second time.
"NORMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"Served under Morgan in 1670, and after the fall of Chagres Fort, Norman"
"was left in charge with 500 men to hold it, while Morgan crossed the"
"isthmus to attack Panama. Norman soon ""sent forth to sea two boats to"
"exercise piracy."" These hoisted Spanish colours and met a big Spanish"
"merchant ship on the same day. They chased the ship, which fled for safety"
"into the Chagres River, only to be caught there by Norman. She proved a"
"valuable prize, being loaded with all kinds of provisions, of which the"
garrison was in sore need.
"NORTH, CAPTAIN NATHANIEL."
"Born in Bermuda, and by profession a lawyer, Captain North was a man of"
"remarkable ability, and in his later calling of piracy he gained great"
"notoriety, and was a born leader of men. His history has been written"
"""We've got his horse,"" he said pointedly."
"""An' I never knowed one o' these men to separate from his horse,"""
"commented Sonora, still smarting under the Girl's reprimand."
"""Right you are! And now that we've got his horse and this storm is on,"
"we've got him,"" said Rance, triumphantly. ""But the last seen of"
"Johnson,"" he went on with a hasty movement towards the Girl and eyeing"
"her critically, ""he was heading this way. You seen anything of him?"""
The Girl struggled hard to appear composed.
"""Heading this way?"" she inquired, reddening."
"""So Nick said,"" declared Sonora, looking towards that individual for"
proof of his words.
But Nick had caught the Girl's lightning glance imposing silence upon
him; in some embarrassment he stammered out:
"""That is, he was--Sid said he saw 'im take the trail, too."""
"""But the trail ends here,"" pointed out Rance, at the same time looking"
"hard at the Girl. ""And if she hasn't seen him, where was he going?"""
At this juncture Nick espied a cigar butt on the floor; unseen by the
"others, he hurriedly picked it up and threw it in the fire."
"""One o' our dollar Havanas! Good Lord, he's here!"" he muttered to"
himself.
"""Rance is right. Where was he goin'?"" was the question with which he was"

"""Yes, I suppose,"" he observed seriously."
"""An' figgers about bein'--well, Oh, you know--about bein' settled. An'"

"knowed each other standin' on the road to Monterey. I said that day,"
"he's good, he's gran' an' he can have me."""
"""I could have you,"" murmured Johnson, meditatively."
The Girl nodded eagerly.
There was a long silence in which Johnson was trying to make up his mind
"to tear himself away from her,--the one woman whom he loved in the"
"world,--for it had been slowly borne in upon him that he was not a fit"
mate for this pure young girl. Nor was his unhappiness lessened when he
"recalled how she had struggled against yielding to him. At last,"
"difficult though it was, he took his courage in both hands, and said:"
"""Girl, I have looked into your heart and my own and now I realise what"
"this means for us both--for you, Girl--and knowing that, it seems hard"
"to say good-bye as I should, must and will . . ."""
At those clear words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide his
"""I'm a domestic man,"" he said suddenly.  ""A domestic man in a serious"
line of life; and I never thought to have anything like this in my
"family--never!  It's been--well, I can't tell you what it's been!"""
Gyp took up her sunshade.  She felt that she must get away; at any moment
he might say something she could not bear--and the smell of mutton rising
fast!
"""I am sorry,"" she said again; ""good-bye""; and moved past him to the door."
"She heard him breathing hard as he followed her to open it, and thought:"
'If only--oh! please let him be silent till I get outside!'  Mr. Wagge
passed her and put his hand on the latch of the front door.  His little
piggy eyes scanned her almost timidly.
"""Well,"" he said, ""I'm very glad to have the privilege of your"
"acquaintance; and, if I may say so, you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty"
"sympathy.  Good-day."""
"The door once shut behind her, Gyp took a long breath and walked swiftly"
"away.  Her cheeks were burning; and, with a craving for protection, she"
"put up her sunshade.  But the girl's white face came up again before her,"
and the sound of her words:
"""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I was dead!  I DO!"""

"Gyp walked on beneath her sunshade, making unconsciously for the peace of"
"“Now, now,” said Fluffy Reubens, sprawling in two chairs. “Chuck it,"
Blotte--you make me feel as cold as a dead undertaker.... Lor!” he
"yawned, “this is precious slow.” He yawned again: “Paul Pangbutt’s a"
"confounded long time, ain’t he? Scenting his beard, I suspect!”"
"Andrew Blotte roused from his mood, and he began to pace up and down"
the room as before: “No more Italian waiters for me--with cursèd oily
"locks,” he cried--“no more grease-spots on dingy grey tablecloths that"
hide their offences under smiling napkins!... To-night I shall be
waited upon by the gods.... Never again the boiled potato; never again
"the homely bun, damn them!... This is the night of life--a night for"
"music and gaiety and minstrelsy.... Hunger shall cease, and pain----”"
"Rippley went up to him and took him by the shoulder, kindly:"
"“Stop it, Blotte. Aren’t you well, old man?”"
Blotte laughed:
“Well?... Psha! I am like a boy. The new genius arrives to-night. And I
go off--to sup with the gods.... The world has forgotten Andrew Blotte.”
"Rippley turned, a twinkle in his eye, to the others:"
"“I say, boys,” said he--“as it’s to be a unique night, and Blotte"
"about to be translated, and may be in the papers in the morning----”"
"Blotte laughed grimly, where he paced:"
"“Oh, yes,” he growled--“I shall be in the papers to-morrow. Have no"
fear of it.”
"""I--I have joined Sir Robert Perry's Ministry,"" he answered."
"""Of course he has, Alicia,"" interposed Lady Eynesford hastily."
"Alicia seated herself on the sofa, remarking as she did so,"
"""Well, you do change a good deal, don't you?"""
"""Really, Miss Derosne,"" he stammered, ""I don't understand you."""
"""Oh, I only mean that you were first with Sir Robert, then with Mr."
"Medland, and now with Sir Robert again! And presently with Mr. Medland"
"again, I suppose?"""
"""She doesn't appreciate the political reasons,"" began Lady Eynesford,"
"with troubled brow and smiling lips; but Coxon, frowning angrily, broke"
"in,"
"""Not the last, I promise you, anyhow, Miss Derosne."""
"""What, you think he's finally beaten then?"""
"""That's not the question. Beaten or not, he is discredited, and no"
"respectable man would act with him."""
"""We needn't discuss--"" began Lady Eynesford again, but this time Alicia"
"was the interrupter. She spoke in a cold, hard way, very unlike her own."
"""If he won, you would all be at his feet."""
Coxon was justified in being angry at her almost savage scorn of him;
"regardless of anything except his wrong, he struck back the sharpest"
"confidence, all these fellows take themselves too seriously to-day."
Look at Rippley! he’s utterly uncultured--he hasn’t an aitch in his
composition.”
Gomme nodded:
"“But there isn’t an aitch in composition,” he said demurely."
"“N-no.” Fosse stammered, becoming nervous. “But he can’t even pronounce"
the names of the ancients whose gods he models!”
Gomme smiled:
“No--but he can model ’em.”
Fosse was puzzled for an answer:

hinders septic decomposition by killing the germs that produce it or by

THE ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN
[Footnote: Often known as the Lower Silurian.]
THE ORDOVICIAN
In North America the Ordovician rocks lie conformably on the
"Cambrian. The two periods, therefore, were not parted by any"
"deformation, either of mountain making or of continental uplift."
The general submergence which marked the Cambrian continued into
the succeeding period with little interruption.
"SUBDIVISIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Ordovician series, as"
"they have been made out in New York, are given for reference in"
"the following table, with the rocks of which they are chiefly"
composed:
5 Hudson . . . . . . . . shales
4 Utica  . . . . . . . . shales
3 Trenton  . . . . . . . limestones
2 Chazy  . . . . . . . . limestones
1 Calciferous  . . . . . sandy limestones
These marine formations of the Ordovician outcrop about the
"Cambrian and pre-Cambrian areas, and, as borings show, extend far"
and wide over the interior of the continent beneath more recent
strata. The Ordovician sea stretched from Appalachia across the
"Mississippi valley. It seems to have extended to California,"
although broken probably by several mountainous islands in the
west.
"that scoundrel, not if you do divorce 'im.  No; she'll have her disgrace"
"for nothing."""
"Gyp, who had listened with her head a little bent, raised it suddenly,"
and said:
"""There'll be no public disgrace, Mr. Wagge, unless you make it yourself."
If you send Daphne--Daisy--quietly away somewhere till her trouble's
"over, no one need know anything."""
"Mr. Wagge, whose mouth had opened slightly, and whose breathing could"
"certainly have been heard in the street, took a step forward and said:"
"""Do I understand you to say that you're not goin' to take proceedings,"
"ma'am?"""
"Gyp shuddered, and shook her head."
"Mr. Wagge stood silent, slightly moving his face up and down."
"""Well,"" he said, at length, ""it's more than she deserves; but I don't"
"disguise it's a relief to me.  And I must say, in a young lady like you,"
"and--and handsome, it shows a Christian spirit."" Again Gyp shivered, and"
"shook her head.  ""It does.  You'll allow me to say so, as a man old"
"enough to be your father--and a regular attendant."""
He held out his hand.  Gyp put her gloved hand into it.
"""I'm very, very sorry.  Please be nice to her."""
"Mr. Wagge recoiled a little, and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing"
his hands together and looking from side to side.
"know--"""
"""Daphne Wing?"""
"""Yes.  A child is coming.  They have made her tell.  It means the"
"cancelling of her engagements, of course--and other things."""
Gyp uttered a little laugh; then she said slowly:
"""Can you tell me, please, what this Mr.--Wagge can do?"""
Again Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
"""He is rabid--a rabid man of his class is dangerous.  A lot of money will"
"be wanted, I should think--some blood, perhaps."""
"He moved swiftly to her, and said very low:"
"""Gyp, it is a year since I told you of this.  You did not believe me"
"then.  I told you, too, that I loved you.  I love you more, now, a"
"hundred times!  Don't move!  I am going up to Gustav."""
"He turned, and Gyp thought he was really going; but he stopped and came"
back past the line of the window.  The expression of his face was quite
"changed, so hungry that, for a moment, she felt sorry for him.  And that"
"must have shown in her face, for he suddenly caught at her, and tried to"
"kiss her lips; she wrenched back, and he could only reach her throat, but"
"that he kissed furiously.  Letting her go as suddenly, he bent his head"
and went out without a look.
"Gyp stood wiping his kisses off her throat with the back of her hand,"
"dumbly, mechanically thinking: ""What have I done to be treated like this?"
"Sawkins, who never knew what fear meant, stormed the town at the head of"
"his men, but was killed by a musket-ball."
"Basil Ringrose, the buccaneer who wrote the narrative of this voyage,"
"describes Sawkins as being ""a man who was as valiant and courageous as any"
"man could be, and the best beloved of all our company""; and on another"
"occasion he speaks of him as ""a man whom nothing on earth could terrifie."""
"SAWNEY, CAPTAIN."
A pirate of New Providence Island in the Bahamas. In this pirate republic
"this old man lived in the best hut, and was playfully known as ""Governor"
"Sawney."""
"DE SAYAS, FRANCISCO."
"A Spanish pirate hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823."
"SCOT, LEWIS."
Distinguished as being the first pirate to carry on the trade on land as
well as at sea. Before this time pirates were never known to be anything
"but harmless drunkards when on shore, whatever they might be on board"
their ships. Scot changed all this when he sacked and pillaged the city of
Campeachy. So successful was he that his example was quickly followed by
"Mansfield, John Davis, and other pirates."
"SCOT, ROGER."
"occasional little voyage, taking a ship or two, or burning an Arab"
"village, North's career as a pirate may be considered to have terminated,"
"as, indeed, his life was shortly afterwards, being murdered in his bed by"
"a treacherous native. North's friends the pirates, shocked at this"
"cold-blooded murder, waged a ruthless war on the natives for seven years:"
thus in their simple way thinking to revenge the loss of this estimable
"man, who had always been the natives' best friend."
"NORTON, GEORGE."
"One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy in June, 1704, at the"
Star Tavern at Boston.
"NUTT, JOHN."
One of Captain John Phillip's original crew of five pirates in the
_Revenge_ in 1723. Nutt was made master or navigator.
OCHALI. Barbary renegade.
In 1511 he sailed from Algiers with a fleet of twenty-two vessels and
"1,700 men to raid Majorca. The Moors landed at Soller and pillaged it."
"Before they could get back to their ship, the pirates were attacked by the"
"Majorcans, headed by Miguel Angelats, and completely routed, 500 of them"
being killed.
"ODELL, SAMUEL."
"""Solem has gone now,"" Josephine replied."
"""Lucky for him!"""
"""Why?"" asked Josephine."
"""Oh, he's a dreadful creature!"""
How agitated she was! But in the course of the day she calmed down. Her
"anger dissolved, and there was neither weeping nor a scene; only she did"
"not walk proudly, as was her habit, but preferred to sit in silence."
"That passed too; she roused herself briskly soon after Solem's departure,"
"and in a few days she was the same as ever. She took walks, she talked and"
"laughed with us, she made the actor swing her in the children's swing, as"
in the lawyer's day....
"I went out one evening, for there was good weather and darkness for"
walking; there was neither a moon nor stars. The gentle ripple of the
little Reisa river was all the sound I heard; there were God and Goethe
"and _über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh'_ that night. On my return, I was in"
"the mood to walk softly and on tiptoe, so I undressed and went to bed in"
the dark.
"Then they came again to my window, those two lunatics, the lady and the"
actor. What next? But it was not he that chose this spot; of that I was
sure. She chose it because she was convinced I had returned. There was
something she _wanted_ me to hear.
Why should I listen to him still pleading with her?
"""I've had enough of this,"" he said. ""I'm leaving tomorrow."""
her scrupulously selected and daintily bound library the volume of
Tennyson and read aloud the idyll of Lancelot and Elaine. And the
"sea-wind blew about his head and fluttered the brown hair on the pillow,"
"and the log-fire blazed in the chimney, and the great dog slept, and a"
noontide hush was over all things. And Risca read the simple poem with
"the heart of the girl of fifteen, and forgot everything else in the"
world.
"When he had finished, the foolish eyes of both were moist. “The dead"
"oar'd by the dumb,” with the lily in her hand,--dead for the love of"
"Lancelot,--affected them both profoundly."
"“I think I should die, too, like that, Great High; Belovedest,” said"
"Stellamaris, “if any one I loved left me.”"
"“But what Lancelot is going to leave you, dear?” said John."
She shook the thistledown of sadness from her brow and laughed.
“You and Walter are the only Lancelots I've got.”
"“The devil 's in the child to-day,” said Risca to himself."
There was a short pause. Then Stella said:
"“Belovedest dear, what was the particular thing that Walter said you had"
to tell me?”
"“It 's of no consequence,” said John. “It will do to-morrow or the day"
after.”
"Stella started joyously,--as much as the rigid discipline of years would"
"suspicious nature would connect George with the rescue, and would lead"
him to conclude that Hamilton must be in England.
"A maid of Lady Castlemain's told Rochester, who in turn told me, that the"
king had again set his men to work searching for Hamilton. That being the
"case, George was in danger, and should he be found by the king's secret"
"agents, who, I understood, were prowling all over England in the hope of"
"obtaining a reward, his life would not be worth a week's purchase."
"George knew the risk he ran by remaining in England, but it was a part of"
his reckless courage to take delight in it. Later on this recklessness of
disposition induced him to take a far greater risk. But of that in its
turn.
*       *       *       *       *
"After supper, I found Hamilton in his bedroom, which was connected"
by a hidden stairway with the room of the sinking floor. He wore his
"Quaker's disguise, and on the table beside him were the Bible and a few"
"theological works dear to the hearts of his sect. I gave him the box,"
telling him its history. The letter was brief and was written in cipher.
George translated it thus:--
"""MASTER GEORGE HAMILTON:"
"""Monsieur le Grand wishes you to pay him a visit immediately."
"""DE CATANET."""
"""You probably know Monsieur le Grand?"" I asked."
"""Do you remember Pancorbo?"" said Ramon Garcia."
"Rollo could not hear the answer, but he caught the outlaw's next"
question.
"""And have you forgotten El Sarria, who, having a certain Miguelete under"
"the point of his knife, let him go for his sweetheart's sake, because"
"she was waiting for him down in the valley?"""
"The sentry's reply was again inaudible, but Rollo was fully awake now."
"Ramon Garcia had not abandoned hope, and why should he? When there was"
"anything to be done, none could be so alert as Rollo Blair."
"""I am El Sarria the outlaw,"" Ramon went on, ""and these are my"
"companions. We are no traitors, but good Carlists to a man. Our papers"
"are----"""
"Here the words were spoken so low that Rollo could not hear more, but"
the next moment he was nudged by Ramon on the leg.
"""Write a note to Concha Cabezos, telling her to bring the papers here at"
"once if she would save our lives. You are sure she is faithful?"""
"""I am sure!"" said Rollo, who really had no reason for his confidence"
except the expression in her eyes.
"He had no paper, but catching the sentry's eye, he nodded across to"
where Etienne was still diligently rolling cigarettes.
"""Alcoy?"" he whispered."
"The sentry shouldered his piece and took a turn or two across the floor,"
mind.  Vaviloff also liked Petunikoff's straightforward manner of
"addressing him without any pretensions, as if he were his own brother,"
"though Vaviloff understood well enough that he was his superior, he"
"being only a soldier.  Looking at him, he grew fonder and fonder of"
"him, and, forgetting for a moment the matter in hand, respectfully"
asked Petunikoff:
"""Where did you study?"""
"""In the technological institute.  Why?"" answered the other, smiling:"
"""Nothing.  Only ... excuse me!""  The soldier lowered his head, and then"
"suddenly exclaimed, ""What a splendid thing education is!"
"Science--light.  My brother, I am as stupid as an owl before the sun"
"...  Your honour, let us finish this job."""
With an air of decision he stretched out his hand to Petunikoff and
said:
"""Well, five hundred?"""
"""Not more than one hundred roubles, Egor Terentievitch."" Petunikoff"
"shrugged his shoulders as if sorry at being unable to give more, and"
touched the soldier's hairy hand with his long white fingers.  They
"soon ended the matter, for the soldier gave in quickly and met"
Petunikoff's wishes.  And when Vaviloff had received the hundred
"roubles and signed the paper, he threw the pen down on the table and"
"said, bitterly:"
"""Now I will have a nice time!  They will laugh at me, they will cry"
"shame on me, the devils!"""

3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.
"The ancient Eastern Church developed a rich hymnody, rising steadily in"
the fourth century until it reached its culmination in the eighth and
"ninth centuries. Since it employed the Greek and Syriac languages, its"
hymnic treasures remained almost completely hidden and unknown to the
English speaking churches for many centuries. It is only in recent
"years, through the efforts of scholars like John Mason Neale and Edward"
Caswall that some of the Eastern hymns have been translated and made
available for modern use. Eastern hymns are characterized by an
"objective, dignified, contemplation of God. Except when confessing sin"
"and unworthiness, they contain nothing of the subjective feelings of the"
worshipper such as is found in many modern hymns. Though there is very
"little in the _Hymnary_ from the Eastern Church, our collection is"
enriched by the inclusion of a small number of hymns from this source.

“But if it will kill you?”
"“Bah. What do I care? When one lives, one amuses oneself. And I have"
"well amused myself, eh, Yvonne? For the rest, _je m’en fiche!_”"
He went on talking with airy cynicism. To Yvonne it seemed some horrible
"dream. The husband she had looked upon as dead was before her, gay,"
"mocking, just as she had known him of old. And he greeted her after all"
these years with the-same lightness as he had bidden her farewell.
"“_Et toi, Yvonne?_” said he at length. “_Ça roule toujours?_ You"
look as if you were brewing money. Ravishing costume. _Crépon_--not
twenty-five centimes a yard! A hat that looks like the Rue de la Paix!
_Gants de reine et petites bottines de duchesse!_ You must be doing
"golden business. But speak, _petite_, since I assure you I am not a"
ghost!”
"Yvonne forced a faint smile. She tried to answer him, but her heart was"
thumping violently and a lump rose in her throat.
"“I am doing very well, Amédée,” she said. The dreadfulness of her"
position came over her. She felt sick and faint. What was going to
happen? For some moments she did not hear him as he spoke. At last
perception returned.
"“And you are pretty,” Amédée Bazouge was saying. “_Mais jolie à"
croquer_--prettier than you ever were. And I--I am going down the hill
"at the gallop. _Tiens_, Yvonne. Let us celebrate this meeting. Come and"
see me safe to the bottom. It won’t be long. I have money. I am always
_bon enfant._ Let us remarry. From to-day. _Ce serait rigolo!_ And I
will love you--_mais énormément!_”
"""What is your name, Girl--your real name?"""
"""Min--Minnie; my father's name was Smith,"" she told him, her eyes cast"
down under delicately tremulous lids.
"""Oh, Minnie Sm--"""
"""But 'twa'n't his right name,"" quickly corrected the Girl, and"
"unconsciously both rose to their feet. ""His right name was Falconer."""
"""Minnie Falconer--well, that is a pretty name,"" commented Johnson; and"
raising her hand to his lips he pressed them against it.
"""I ain't sure that's what he said it was--I ain't sure o' anythin' only"
"jest you,"" she said coyly, burying her face in his neck."
"""You may well be sure of me since I've loved--"" Johnson's sentence was"
"cut short, a wave of remorse sweeping over him. ""Turn your head away,"
"Girl, and don't listen to me,"" he went on, gently putting her away from"
"him. ""I'm not worthy of you. Don't listen but just say no, no, no, no."""
"The Girl, puzzled, was even more so when Johnson began to pace the"
floor.
"""Oh, I know--I ain't good enough for you !"" she cried with a little"
"tremour in her voice. ""But I'll try hard, hard . . . If you see"
"anythin' better in me, why don't you bring it out, 'cause I've loved you"
"ever since I saw you first, 'cause I knowed that you--that you were the"
"right man."""
"""The right man,"" repeated Johnson, dismally, for his conscience was"
"“Gracious, father! What a fright you gave me! Have you just come home?"
Why isn’t Charles here to help you off with your coat?”
"Her cheeks were crimson from playing, her eyes glittered, the hair fell"
over her forehead. And she breathed as though she had come running
through the dark and was frightened. Old Mr. Neave stared at his
youngest daughter; he felt he had never seen her before. So that was
"Lola, was it? But she seemed to have forgotten her father; it was not"
for him that she was waiting there. Now she put the tip of her crumpled
handkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it angrily. The telephone
rang. A-ah! Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past him. The door of
"the telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte called,"
"“Is that you, father?”"
"“You’re tired again,” said Charlotte reproachfully, and she stopped the"
rocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel pecked
"his beard, Marion’s lips brushed his ear."
"“Did you walk back, father?” asked Charlotte."
"“Yes, I walked home,” said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of the"
immense drawing-room chairs.
“But why didn’t you take a cab?” said Ethel. “There are hundreds of
cabs about at that time.”
"“My dear Ethel,” cried Marion, “if father prefers to tire himself out,"
I really don’t see what business of ours it is to interfere.”
"“Children, children?” coaxed Charlotte."
Two or three days later Cæsar met the Spaniard Cortés in the Piazza
"Colonna. They bowed. The thin, sour-looking painter was walking with a"
"beardless young German, red and snub-nosed. This young man was a painter"
"too, Cortés said; he wore a green hat with a cock’s feather, a blue"
"cape, thick eyeglasses, big boots, and had a certain air of being a"
blond Chinaman.
“Would you like to come to the Doria gallery with us?” asked Cortés.
“What is there to see there?”
“A stupendous portrait by Velázquez.”
“I warn you that I know nothing about pictures.”
"“Nobody does,” Cortés declared roundly. “Everybody says what he thinks.”"
“Is the gallery near here?”
"“Yes, just a step.”"
In company with Cortés and the German with the green hat with the cock’s
"feather, Cæsar went to the Piazza del Collegio Romano, where the Doria"
palace is. They saw a lot of pictures which didn’t seem any better to
"Cæsar than those in the antique shops and the pawnbrokers’, but which"
drew learned commentaries from the German. Then Cortés took them to a
cabinet hung in green and lighted by a skylight. There was nothing to
be seen in the cabinet except the portrait of the Pope. In order that
"people might look at it comfortably, a sofa had been installed facing"
it.
"Frances was the last girl in the world, save, perhaps Sarah, who I should"
"have supposed capable of languishing and dying of love, but the former"
"she did before my eyes, and the latter I almost began to fear if news did"
not reach us soon from George.
"Betty came up to see Frances nearly every day, and the kissing and"
embracing that ensued disgusted Sarah.
"""Now, if Frances were a man, I could understand it,"" said Sarah. ""The"
"little barmaid must be tempting to a man, being pretty and--"""
"""Beautiful, Sarah!"" I interrupted."
"""Yes, beautiful, if you will."""
"""Her eyes--"" I began, again interrupting Sarah."
"""Oh, yes!"" cried Sarah, impatiently. ""Her eyes are fine enough, but their"
"expression comes from their color, their size, and their preposterously"
long eyelashes. Black long lashes often give a radiance to the eyes which
"passes for expressiveness, and I doubt not--"""
"""Nonsense, Sarah!"" I cried, half angrily. ""Bettina's eyes are expressive"
"in themselves. As you say, their soft dark brown is the perfection of"
"color, and they certainly are large. But aside from all that, their"
"expression is--"""
"""There is no intellect in them!"" cried Sarah."
"""There is tenderness, gentleness, love, and truth in them,"" I answered,"
with as careless an air as I could assume.
"""Yes--the diamonds. That's why we went out on the _Arabella_--"" In"
broken sentences Sidney told the story; she wanted Mr. Dugald to know
that they had cared most for the honor of Cape Cod!
"""And we found them--a big box--at least we _think_ it's the diamonds!"
"Cap'n Phin Davies says it's _something_ queer!"""
Dugald Allan's exclamation had much the character of an explosion.
"""_Diamonds!_ What nonsense! You've risked bereaving three homes for"
what is probably nothing more than a case of rum. If ever a girl needed
"a big brother to keep her in check, you do!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
DIAMONDS
During the early morning hours of that summer day that Sidney was
"destined never to forget, the girl passed through every emotion that a"
fifteen-year-old heart can suffer.
"First, to her dismay no one at the cottage had seemed to rejoice, as"
"the crowd on the wharf had rejoiced, at her rescue. When Mr. Dugald led"
her in Miss Vine was making coffee at the stove and all she said was:
"""Well, you're all right! Better go to bed now as quick as you can and"
"keep out from under foot."" Then Mr. Dugald had taken Pola back to the"
hotel. Aunt Achsa was with Doctor Blackwell and Lavender. Sidney had
tried to summon sufficient courage to ask Miss Vine's forbidding back
Then Dugald Allan spied Pola shivering forlornly behind Mart and
"Sidney. ""_You_--"" he cried, pushing Sidney aside. ""I thought you were"
"at Chatham!"" His mouth tightened in a straight, stern line. ""What is"
"all this? But wait, I must get Sidney back to Aunt Achsa. You shall"
"explain things as we go along."""
"He hurried the girls through the crowd which parted, smilingly, to let"
"them pass. On Commercial Street he hailed old Hiram Moss, who with an"
"eye to business in the midst of tragedy, had harnessed his horses to"
his ancient cab and had them ready for an emergency.
After he had bundled his charges in Dugald Allan turned to Sidney.
"""Now give me some inkling of what started this crazy adventure. Thank"
God it has not ended as it might have ended though Lavender is still
"fighting for his life! Answer me, Sidney."""
But before Sidney could begin her tale she had to know what had
happened to Lavender.
"""Fighting for his life? But--he _got here_, didn't he?"""
"""Yes--he reached shore, by an effort so great as to completely"
"prostrate him. They took him home. I left Doctor Blackwell with him."""
Dugald Allan spoke shortly and his crisp sentences had the effect of
"stunning poor Sidney. She shivered and leaned close to him. Her voice,"
"when she spoke, came with a childish tremor."
"""Oh, Lavender _can't_ die. If he does--it will be all my fault! I"
"started everything. I--I told him about the diamonds--"""
"""_Diamonds_--"""
Mrs. White was all concern. She summoned Pepper and instructed him to
find out the first train; she sent her maid to Trude's room to pack her
clothes. And last she wrote a generous check.
"""You may need it, my dear. It is nothing. Don't thank me. I wish I"
could do more. Somehow your shoulders seem too young to carry so much
"responsibility!"""
So on the selfsame day that Sidney and the others set out upon their
adventure Trude was journeying to Cape Cod. She missed connections at
"Boston and hired an automobile to take her to Provincetown, in her"
heart thanking Mrs. White for the check that made this possible. Two
blow-outs delayed her journey so that it was midnight when she reached
her destination. She could scarcely hunt out the Greens and Sidney at
that hour. She took a room at the hotel for the night and sat for a
while at its window straining her eyes out into the darkness. The
howling of the wind intensified her apprehension; somewhere out in that
strange blackness that enwrapped her was her little sister. Perhaps
Sidney needed her that very moment!
Finally she crept into bed and fell into a troubled sleep. She did not
hear the running steps that passed under her window or the muffled
voices of excited men.
CHAPTER XXI
"""WHAT THE NIGHT HELD"""
"After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. ""You're right. I've also"
"become a male outside the law. We're in this together."""
He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found
myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis
insists such things have always had for men.
"""Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll"
"call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown."""
"I liked the sound of Ford. ""Is Butt a nickname, too?"""
"""Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a"
"blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the"
eighties--the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named
"all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the"
"name they were saving for a girl."""
"""You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?"""
"He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. ""Oh, a nestful. Of course, they"
were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys--all
except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.
Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down
"the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up."""
I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of
"the blaster above the firing button. ""Have you killed a lot of men with"
"that, Mr. Butt?"""
"""Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford."" He frowned and sighted at"
over tomorrow. We can stay there for a few days. I shall welcome the
"change for this place has been very stupid for me, my dear."""
"""Poor mamma! I've been selfish. It'll be a lark seeing Cora Truxton"
"again!"" Pola had explained to Sidney: ""We met the Truxtons at Nice."
"Cora and Millicent are both older, but they're the _cutest_ girls. Will"
"we go in the morning, mamma?"""
Pola's manner had indicated that the coming of the Truxtons into their
plans raised a barrier that now excluded Sidney. Throughout the dinner
she had talked exclusively of the trip on the morrow and the renewing
of that acquaintance that had begun in Nice. But Sidney felt nothing
but a sense of escape.
She found Aunt Achsa alone in the cottage on Sunset Lane. She was
"sitting on the doorstep, ""coolin' off."" Sidney sat down beside her."
"""Where's Lavender?"" she asked, wishing Lavender was at home that she"
"might begin her ""making up"" at once."
"""Don't know. And I wish I did. Don't know what's gotten into that boy."
"I'm as worried as can be."""
"""About Lav? Oh, what's the matter?"" For Aunt Achsa was close to tears."
Something must have happened to break her habitual optimism.
"""He's acted so queer like lately. Cal'late you'd of noticed it if you"
hadn't been off so much with Mr. Dugald's folks. I thought it might a'
"been his stomach and I put a powder into his coffee, but he ain't been"
"a mite different--"""
"""But what does he do, Aunt Achsa? He looks all right--"""
"was disloyal and had come there with hostile intent, but because she"
felt that she must be absolutely sure of her ground before she revealed
the fact that Johnson was in the cabin. She let some moments pass before
she replied:
"""I don't know nothin' about your master. Who is he?"""
An indulgent smile crossed the Mexican's face.
"""That ver' good to tella other peoples; but I know 'im here too much."
"You trusta me--me quita safe."""
All this was said with many gestures and an air that convinced the Girl
that he was speaking the truth. But since she deemed it best that the
"invalid should be kept from any excitement, she resolved to make the"
Mexican divulge to her the nature of his important errand.
"""How do you know he's here?"" she began warily. ""What do you want 'im"
"for?"""
The Mexican's shifty eyes wandered all over the room as if to make
certain that no inimical ears were listening; then he whispered:
"""I tella you something--you lika the _Maestro_?"""
"Unconsciously the Girl nodded, which evidently satisfied the Mexican,"
for he went on:
"""You thinka well of him--yees. Now I tella you something. The man Pedro"
'e no good. 'E wisha the reward--the money for Ramerrez. 'E and the
"woman--woman no good--tell Meester Ashby they thinka 'im 'ere."""
to Test Pilot Fayburn. A space egg had smashed through the cockpit
Plexi-glass and then pierced his pressurized suit.
"Blood on the pilot's seat indicated that he had been injured, but there"
was no wound. The loss of pressure in the cockpit and in his suit should
"have killed him instantly--yet here he was, alive and unharmed, but"
definitely a changed man.
"Always a mild, considerate person he had, in a matter of minutes, become"
a madman. What had brought about the change? Was he still human or was
he now OUT OF THIS WORLD?
Only time would tell as he daringly laid siege to an important air base
and began using his frightening power to force men and women to serve
his evil purpose.

TEN FROM INFINITY
Ten men walked Earth--ten men in different cities in the United States.
Each one was the exact replica of the other--from the tips of his
fingers down to the beating of his twin hearts.
"I must go, Dad."""
Winton nodded.
"""Well, I'll come too,"" he said.  ""The girl can go back in the cab and say"
"we're on the way."""
"Taking a parting look at her baby, Gyp thought bitterly: 'My fate? THIS"
"is my fate, and no getting out of it!'  On the journey, she and Winton"
were quite silent--but she held his hand tight.  While the cook was
"taking up to Rosek the news of their arrival, Gyp stood looking out at"
her garden.  Two days and six hours only since she had stood there above
"her pansies; since, at this very spot, Rosek had kissed her throat!"
"Slipping her hand through Winton's arm, she said:"
"""Dad, please don't make anything of that kiss.  He couldn't help himself,"
"I suppose.  What does it matter, too?"""
"A moment later Rosek entered.  Before she could speak, Winton was saying:"
"""Thank you for letting us know, sir.  But now that my daughter is here,"
"there will be no further need for your kind services.  Good-day!"""
"At the cruel curtness of those words, Gyp gave the tiniest start forward."
She had seen them go through Rosek's armour as a sword through brown
"paper.  He recovered himself with a sickly smile, bowed, and went out."
Winton followed--precisely as if he did not trust him with the hats in
"the hall.  When the outer door was shut, he said:"
"""I don't think he'll trouble you again."""
"Gyp's gratitude was qualified by a queer compassion.  After all, his"
"and peered in, shielding her candle with a trembling hand. For a long"
while she sat in the window straining her eyes into the darkness. The
cats came and rubbed her bare ankles and Nip meowed plaintively. She
picked him up and cuddled him to her.
Suddenly a moving object in the lane caught her attention. It separated
"itself into the forms of men, men moving slowly as though they bore a"
burden. They turned into the garden patch.
"""Lavender!"" Aunt Achsa cried, jumping up quickly, shaking. ""Oh--my boy!"""
But that was the only sound she made. She opened the door as though she
had been waiting for these men with their limp burden. She directed
them to carry the boy to his own room. She moved aside for Doctor
"Blackwell who had come with the others, an old pair of flannel trousers"
drawn over his night shirt. She felt Mr. Dugald put a restraining arm
"over her shoulders and nodded as though to say: ""I'm all right--just"
"look out for Lavender."""
One of the men coming back from Lavender's room offered an explanation.
"""Those young 'uns were on the _Arabella_ and it broke from its"
"moorin's. The boy swum ashore to give an alarm. Plucky, I say--don't"
"know how he did it."""
"""Those young ones--_who_?"" cried Dugald Allan."
"""Why, I cal'late that gal Sidney and I don't know who else--"""
"""Sidney went with Miss Vine!"" protested Achsa."
"But at that moment Miss Letty appeared in the door, as scantily clad as"
the doctor had been. From her window which faced Doctor Blackwell's

"“Father never talks his business over with any one,” Jack broke in."
"“If we had only known about the outlaws being here in the hills,” Harry"
"suggested, “we might have kept out of sight of them for a long time."
"But, you see, they found us first.”"
"“And they used a nice, crooked little spy to do it with!” Frank"
exclaimed. “This little alleged Boy Scout who stole our provisions last
"night, and crept into the woods to tell Jimmie and I to beat it, and"
"then brought a note to Ned to get him away from the camp, must be"
playing a leading part for the sneaks.”
“He’s doing all of that!” Jack agreed. “I don’t believe he’s a Boy Scout
at all. He’s just picked up a word or two and a sign.”
"“Perhaps we’ll run across him again,” Frank said. “If we do, I’ll find"
out whether he’s a Boy Scout or not!”
"“Well,” Jack exclaimed, springing to his feet, “are we going to sit here"
all day and let Jimmie do all the hunting? We ought to get out in the
mountains and help find Ned.”
"“Look here, boys!” Harry cried, “do you see anything to the east there"
that looks at all familiar?”
“Do you mean the smoke coming up over the tops of the trees?” asked
Frank. “I noticed that several minutes ago.”
"“Well, just keep your eye on it,” Harry advised, “and see if it brings"
anything to your mind.”
"“Sure it does!” shouted Frank, all excitement now. “There are two"
"adopt her now,” said Miss Lindon, with an illuminating flash of logic."
"“Quite so,” replied John."
There was a span of silence. John mechanically drew his pipe from his
"pocket, eyed it with longing, and replaced it. Miss Lindon took the aged"
black-and-tan terrier in her arms and whispered to it in baby language.
She was a million leagues from divining the object of her nephew's
visit. John looked at her despairingly. Had she not a single grain of
"common sense? At last he strode across the room, a Gulliver in a new"
"Lilliput, and sat down again by her side."
"“Look here, 'Aunt Gladys,” he said desperately, “if I adopt a young"
"woman of sixteen, I must have another woman in the house--a lady, one"
of my own family. I could n't have people saying horrid things about her
and me.”
Miss Lindon assented to the proposition. John was far too young and
"good-looking (“Oh, Lord!” cried John)--yes, he was--to pose as the"
"father of a pretty, grown-up young woman."
"“The poor child is n't pretty,” said he."
"“It does n't matter,” replied Miss Lindon. “Beauty is only skin deep,"
and I 've known plain people who are quite fascinating. There was
Captain Brownlow's wife--do you remember the Brownlows? Your poor mother
was so fond of them--”
"“Yes, yes,” said John, impatiently. “He had wet hands, and used to mess"
"my face about when I was a kid. I hated it. The question is, however,"
whom am I going to get to help me with Unity Blake?”

"and named Cortés; the other, large, ordinary, fleshy, and coarse, seemed"
rather a bully.
"Giovanni Battista was not able to be long outside the workshop, no doubt"
"because his conscience troubled him, and though with difficulty, he got"
"up and left. Kennedy, Cæsar, and the two Spaniards went toward the"
"Piazza, del Campidoglio, and Buonacossi marched off in the opposite"
direction.
"On reaching the Via Nazionale, Kennedy took his leave and Cæsar"
"remained with the two Spaniards. The red, fleshy one, who had the air of"
"a bully, started in to make fun of the Italians, and to mimic their bows"
and salutes; then he said that he had an engagement with a woman and
made haste to take his leave.
"When he had gone, the grave Spaniard with the sour face, said to Cæsar:"
“That chap is like the dandies here; that’s why he imitates them so
well.”
Afterwards Cortés talked about his studies in painting; he didn’t get
"on well, he had no money, and anyway Rome didn’t please him at all."
"Everything seemed wrong to him, absurd, ridiculous."
"Cæsar, after he had said good-bye to him, murmured: “The truth is that"
we Spaniards are impossible people.”
XVI. THE PORTRAIT OF A POPE
"""Waynsford, by Jove!"" ejaculated Terence. ""Bless you, Dick, I never"
"expected to see you here and in this rig. What has happened?"""
"""Oh, I chucked the Motor Boat Reserve,"" declared Waynsford. ""It was a"
"bit too dull. They sent me to Southampton, and that was the limit. A"
"superannuated postman could have done my job, which was delivering"
letters to transports. So I applied for the Naval Air Service. It's
"more in my line."""
"""Been across yet?"" asked Terence, indicating the twenty odd mile"
strip of water that separated Great Britain from the scene of land
hostilities.
"""Dunkirk twice,"" replied Waynsford. ""Was there when the Germans"
started shelling the place. But we're off again early to-morrow
"morning."""
"""Yes, I heard,"" said Aubyn. ""Big operations. We are to engage the"
Zeebrugge and Ostend batteries while the Allied airmen play with the
"German lines of communication. So I may see something of you."""
"""I hope so--after the fun is over,"" replied the young airman. ""Well,"
I must be moving. Early hours and a good night's rest are essential
"to this sort of work."""
"The two friends parted, Terence making for the hotel, while Waynsford"
"walked off in the direction of the castle, in which the airmen"
detailed for the great raid were temporarily quartered.
Precisely at one hour before sunrise the first British waterplane
rose from the surface of Dover Harbour. Almost simultaneously an Army
"aeroplane ""kicked off"" from the sloping ground beyond the chalk"
"The Frenchmen ""jabbered"" a bit among themselves."
"""Quoi donc?  Marcher?"" asked their skipper."
"""We, old son,"" said Hart; ""marshay if you like.  Just pack up and"
quit.  We gives you an hour to gather up your dunnage.  Now do you
"understand?"""
Whether the Frenchmen understood or not it was tolerably obvious they
"did not like the tone with which Hart spoke, or the looks of evident"
disfavour he cast at them.  The captain turned away.
"""Stop!"" said Hart, and he went in for a dumb pantomime, in which he"
vaguely suggested that over yonder hill was an army of Englishmen.
"""And we mean 'avin' our rights,"" he ended with.  And just then old"
Jones appeared in sight.
"""Are they jossers goin' to evacuate or not?"" he bellowed.  ""What's"
their captain say to the _statues quo_?  Don't they know the first
thing about diplomatics?  Tell 'em that to prepare for peace we makes
"war."""
"""War it is,"" said Hart, and he launched himself at a crowd of"
"Frenchmen, as his mates came tumbling down the hill."
"The fight was short, sharp, and pretty decisive, for the _Potluck's_"
"crowd numbered ten able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and two boys, or"
"with the captain and the two mates, sixteen in all.  Against this"
"array there were twenty-one Frenchmen, and though Hart, in his first"
"onslaught, knocked down two, he was himself stretched out by a third"
armed with a broken hand-spike.  And Simcox fled with the infuriated
"carefully kept his eyes to this side and to that, as if examining the"
"flowers, but noted all the same that Fiorsen had receded from the window."
Rapid thought told him that the fellow would come back there to see if he
"were gone, and he placed himself before a rose-bush, where, at that"
"reappearance, he could make a sign of recognition.  Sure enough, he came;"
and Winton quietly raising his hand to the salute passed on through the
"drawing-room window.  He went quickly into the hall, listened a second,"
"and opened the dining-room door.  Fiorsen was pacing up and down, pale"
"and restless.  He came to a standstill and stared haggardly at Winton,"
who said:
"""How are you?  Gyp not in?"""
"""No."""
"Something in the sound of that ""No"" touched Winton with a vague--a very"
vague--compunction.  To be left by Gyp!  Then his heart hardened again.
"The fellow was a rotter--he was sure of it, had always been sure."
"""Baby looks well,"" he said."
Fiorsen turned and began to pace up and down again.
"""Where is Gyp?  I want her to come in.  I want her."""
Winton took out his watch.
"""It's not late.""  And suddenly he felt a great aversion for the part he"
"was playing.  To get the baby; to make Gyp safe--yes!  But, somehow, not"
this pretence that he knew nothing about it.  He turned on his heel and
walked out.  It imperilled everything; but he couldn't help it.  He could
not stay and go on prevaricating like this.  Had that woman got clear?
"Nick rose high above the other sounds of the night, calling,"
"""Min-Minnie-Girl, let us in!"" she hurriedly brushed past him and yelled"
through the door:
"""What do you want?"""
Again Johnson's hand went up imperatively.
"""Don't let him come in!"" he whispered."
"But even then she heard not his warning, but silently, tremulously"
"listened to Sonora, who shouted through the door: ""Say, Girl, you all"
"right?"" And not until her answering voice had called back her assurance"
that she was safe did she turn to the man at her side and whisper in a
voice that showed plainly her agitation and fear:
"""Jack Rance is there! If he was to see you here--he's that jealous I'd"
"be afraid--"" She checked her words and quickly put her ear close to the"
"door, the voices outside having become louder and more distinct."
"Presently she spun round on her heel and announced excitedly: ""Ashby's"
"there, too!"" And again she put her ear to the door."
"""Ashby!"" The exclamation fell from Johnson's lips before he was aware of"
it. It was impossible to deceive himself any longer--the posse had
tracked him!
"""We want to come in, Girl!"" suddenly rang out from the well-known voice"
of Nick.
"""But you can't come in!"" shouted back the Girl above the noise of the"
"storm; then, taking advantage of a particularly loud howl of the blast,"
"she turned to Johnson and inquired: ""What will I say? What reason will I"
"grunted: ""It's been in two days!"""
By the time they reached the _Arabella_ Sidney's remorse was yielding
"to a spark of indignation. Lav needn't be _quite_ so mad for, after"
"all, it had been his own precious Mr. Dugald who had thrown her and"
Pola so constantly together! And if Lav had not hidden himself away he
most certainly would have been included in all the plans. It was not
fair in Lav to act so cross.
"""I know you came out to read, Lav, and I've some thinking to do, so I'm"
"going up in the bow and leave you quite to yourself,"" Sidney said as"
"they boarded the _Arabella_, and if in her tone there was something of"
"Mart's tartness, it may be forgiven for Sidney had been punished enough."
"""I don't care if you hang 'round,"" Lav conceded. ""It's too hot to read,"
"anyways. I thought maybe there'd be a breeze out here. What's that?"""
For he had suddenly spied an object lying on the deck close to the rail
as though it had dropped there from someone's pocket.
"At almost the same moment Sidney spied it, too. Both darted for it."
Lavender reached it first and picked it up and examined it with
frowning eyes.
"""It's a knife!"" cried Sidney, at his elbow."
"""Sure it's a knife. Anybody can see that. What I want to know--"""
"""Let me look at it. Isn't it Mr. Dugald's?"""
"""No, it isn't Mr. Dugald's. He hasn't been out here for a week. And"
"that knife wasn't here yesterday for I'd a' seen it."""
series of rapid flashes followed by an equal number of detonations. The
"upper air was filled with a blending of high notes--a whizzing, droning,"
"and sibilant buzzing, and pipings that died down in faint wails. The"
"little white speck moved on. It entered a film of straggling cloud, but"
soon re-emerged. It grew smaller and smaller. Our eyes lost it for a
moment and found it again. Then they lost it altogether and nothing
remained save the whitish blurs in the blue sky and a hardly audible
booming in the far distance.

"several times, he openly confessed:"
"""I cannot play without cheating ... it is a habit of mine."""
"""Habits do get the better of you,"" assented Deacon Taras.  ""I always"
"used to beat my wife every Sunday after Mass, and when she died I"
cannot describe how extremely dull I felt every Sunday.  I lived
"through one Sunday--it was dreadful, the second I still controlled"
"myself, the third Sunday I struck my Asok....  She was angry and"
threatened to summon me.  Just imagine if she had done so!  On the
"fourth Sunday, I beat her just as if she were my own wife!  After that"
"I gave her ten roubles, and beat her according to my own rules till I"
"married again!"" ..."
"""You are lying, Deacon!  How could you marry a second time?"""
interrupted Abyedok.
"""Ay, just so...  She looked after my house...."""
"""Did you have any children?"" asked the teacher."
"""Five of them....  One was drowned ... the oldest ... he was an amusing"

"began explaining why this was so, and they laughed till they nearly"

almost a cry for help. She was growing old and soured and worn by
"perpetual conjugal wranglings. John, her kinsman, counted for a great"
deal in a life none too rich. John and Stella were nearest to her in the
"world--first Stella, naturally, then John. To the woman of over fifty"
the man of under thirty is still a boy. For many years she had nursed
the two together in her heart. And now he was going from her. What
"would she, what would Stella, do without him? Her husband's direct"
interpellation aroused her from her reverie.
"“Julia, what was the name of the chap we met in St. Kitts who had been"
sheep-farming in Queensland?”
They had sailed away from St. Kitts in 1878. Lady Blount reminded
him tartly of the fact while professing her oblivion of the man from
Queensland. They sparred for a few moments. Then she rose wearily and
said she was going to bed. Sir Oliver looked at his watch.
“Nearly twelve. Time for us all to go.”
"“As soon as I' ve written my morning letter to Stellamaris,” said"
Herold.
"“I must write, too,” said Risca."
For it was a rule of the house that every visitor should write
"Stellamaris a note overnight, to be delivered into her hands the first"
thing in the morning. The origin of the rule was wrapped in the mists of
history.
So John Risca sat down at Sir Oliver's study-table in order to indite
his letter to Stellamaris. But for a long time he stared at the white
"paper. He, the practised journalist, who could dash off his thousand"
Suddenly a postmark on one of the letters on the little table at her
elbow caught her eye. Provincetown. Trude caught it up apprehensively.
That letter might be from their Cousin Achsa! She turned it over and
"over, wishing she might open it."
"""Good morning, my dear! I get up with the birds myself and find that"
"you're up before me!"""
"Trude laughed, to cover her anxiety. ""I told Jonathan I'd inspect his"
"new beds this morning."""
"""There, didn't I say you were supplanting me in Jonathan's esteem? But"
he only wants you to admire them and smile at him. He knows you know
"nothing about gardens, even though you are a very wise young woman! Ah,"
"the mail--is there anything there worth looking at before breakfast?"""
"""Two cards, three advertising envelopes and--and two personal letters."""
"Trude held out the two letters, her heart beating in her throat."
Mrs. White glanced at them indifferently. She turned one as though to
"tear open the envelope, then stopped to play with Mitie. Next she gave"
her attention to Pepper who appeared in the door to summon her to
breakfast. And all the time Trude's eyes were beseeching her to open
them--to open _one_ of them quickly.
Trude followed her into the breakfast room and sat down across from
her. After she had eaten her fruit Mrs. White took up the envelope that
was postmarked Provincetown and studied it while Trude waited.
"""Why, that's from Laura Craig--a cousin of mine. I remember now she"
said she was going to study in a summer school on Cape Cod. I hope the
Simonetta gave her mother what was indispensable for household expenses
and managed the rest herself.
Kennedy retailed this information the first day they went to Giovanni
"Battista Lanza’s house. Cæsar could see Simonetta keeping the books,"
"while the small brother, in a white blouse that came to his heels, was"
"chasing a dog, holding a pipe in his hand by the thick part, as if it"
"were a pistol, the dog barking and hanging on to the blouse, the small"
"boy shrieking and laughing, when Signora Vittoria came bawling out."
"Kennedy presented Simonetta to his friend Cæsar, and she smiled and"
gave her hand.
“Is Signore Giovanni Battista here?” Kennedy asked Signora Vittoria.
"“Yes, he is in the court.” she answered in her gloomy way."
“Is something wrong with your mamma?” said Kennedy to Simonetta.
“Nothing.”
"They went into the court and Giovanni Battista arose, very dignified,"
and bowed to Cæsar. The elder son and the two workmen in white blouses
"and paper caps were busy with water and wires, cleaning a plaster mould"
they had just emptied.
The mould was a big has-relief of the Way of the Cross. Giovanni
Battista permitted himself various jocose remarks about the Way of
"the Cross, which his son and the other two workmen heard with"
great indifference; but while he was still emptying his store of
"anti-Christian irony, the voice of Signora Vittoria was heard, crying"
"There young Charles was waiting for him. Carefully, as though"
"everything depended on it, he was tucking a towel round the hot-water"
can. Young Charles had been a favourite of his ever since as a little
red-faced boy he had come into the house to look after the fires. Old
"Mr. Neave lowered himself into the cane lounge by the window, stretched"
"out his legs, and made his little evening joke, “Dress him up,"
"Charles!” And Charles, breathing intensely and frowning, bent forward"
to take the pin out of his tie.
"H’m, h’m! Well, well! It was pleasant by the open window, very"
pleasant—a fine mild evening. They were cutting the grass on the tennis
court below; he heard the soft churr of the mower. Soon the girls would
begin their tennis parties again. And at the thought he seemed to hear
"Marion’s voice ring out, “Good for you, partner.... Oh, _played_,"
"partner.... Oh, _very_ nice indeed.” Then Charlotte calling from the"
"veranda, “Where is Harold?” And Ethel, “He’s certainly not here,"
"mother.” And Charlotte’s vague, “He said—”"
"Old Mr. Neave sighed, got up, and putting one hand under his beard, he"
"took the comb from young Charles, and carefully combed the white beard"
"over. Charles gave him a folded handkerchief, his watch and seals, and"
spectacle case.
"“That will do, my lad.” The door shut, he sank back, he was alone...."
And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights
"that led to a glittering, gay dining-room. What legs he had! They were"
"like a spider’s—thin, withered."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family.”"
"But if that were true, why didn’t Charlotte or the girls stop him? Why"
"""By Jove,"" he cried, ""the news'll be at the House by now! Come along,"
"man, come along!"""
"And, as they went, they read the rest; for the paper had it all--even a"
copy of that marriage certificate.
CHAPTER XXIII.
AN ORATOR'S RIVAL.
"The House was crowded, and every gallery full. Lady Eynesford and"
"Eleanor Scaife, attended by Captain Heseltine, occupied their appointed"
seats; the members of the Legislative Council overflowed from their
proper pen and mingled with humbler folk in the public galleries;
"reporters wrote furiously, and an endless line of boys bearing their"
slips came and went. The great hour had arrived: the battle-field was
reached at last. Sir Robert Perry sat and smiled; Puttock played with
the hair chain that wandered across his broad waistcoat; Coxon
"restlessly bit his nails; Norburn's face was pale with excitement, and"
he twisted his hands in his lap; the determined partisans cheered or
groaned; the waverers looked important and felt unhappy; all eyes were
"steadily fixed on the Premier, and all ears intent on his words."
For the moment he had forgotten everything but the fight he was
"fighting. No thought of the wretched Benham, who lay dead, no thought of"
"his daughter, who watched him as he spoke, no thought of Alicia"
"Derosne, who stayed away that she might not see him, crossed his brain"
"Dagoes, and Dutchmen and Calashees, I'd 'ave showed you and Salisbury"
"'ow to 'andle mixed sweets.  Vig'lance, difficulties, bright"
"look-out, and the rule o' the road.  And look at the chart!  That's"
"me!"""
"And very shortly afterwards the triple conversation ceased, for the"
captain lay snoring in his cabin.
"The _Potluck_ was a barque of eleven hundred tons' register, and was"
"bound for Adelaide, with a general cargo of all mixed things under"
heaven and on earth.  Now she was engaged in running down her
"easting, and, as her skipper believed, was somewhere about Lat. 44°"
"30' S., Long. 50° E., and not far off the Crozets.  The westerly"
"winds were blowing hard, but had the worst chill of winter off, for"
"the month was September.  Nevertheless, as old Jones, the skipper,"
"was on a composite track, with a maximum latitude of 45° S., and was"
bound farther south still it might have been to the advantage of all
"concerned if he had drunk less, talked little, and minded his own"
business instead of arguing foreign politics.
But to each man Fate often gives his chance of proving what he boasts
to be his particular skill in the universe.
"When Lampert relieved Simcox at midnight, the weather was thick, and"
"neither man's temper was of the sweetest, so they had a bit of a"
breeze.
"""What kind of a relief d'ye call this?' growled Simcox."
"""I call it a very good relief,"" replied Lampert, ""and a darned sight"
"better one than you deserve.  You owe me ten minutes even now."""
"Robbins laughed gently, and winked to the others:"
"“We _are_ a trifle early, Dukes, I am afraid,” said he, going up to the"
dignified old man--“but if Mr. Rippley _will_ insist on sitting between
"the reins on the top of the hansom, the cabby drives hard to escape the"
"inquisitive attention of the police--a body of men, Dukes, that live"
feverishly anxious to catch something and are bored with the greyness
of the popular virtue.”
He tapped the old man on the shirt-front.
"The butler bowed stiffly, and withdrew."
Fluffy Reubens strode airily into the middle of the room and surveyed
it:
"“I say,” said he--“portrait painting seems to pay, eh?”"
Lovegood coughed:
"“H’m--n’yes,” he grunted; and added tragically: “When you can paint"
portraits.”
"“Get out!” said Fluffy, and flung himself into an easy-chair."
Rippley strolled round the room and tested the electric lights; his
hands itching to be at any devilment:
“Oho!” said he--“so the curtain is to go up to-night and discover the
real Anthony Bickersteth--the man of mystery--the writer of _the_
book!... I suppose it ain’t Pangbutt himself!”
"In the streets, the lamps were lighted, but daylight was not quite gone."
"He walked unsteadily, toward Piccadilly.  A girl of the town passed and"
"looked up at him.  Staring hard, he hooked his arm in hers without a"
"word; it steadied him, and they walked on thus together.  Suddenly he"
said:
"""Well, girl, are you happy?""  The girl stopped and tried to disengage her"
arm; a rather frightened look had come into her dark-eyed powdered face.
"Fiorsen laughed, and held it firm.  ""When the unhappy meet, they walk"
together.  Come on!  You are just a little like my wife.  Will you have a
"drink?"""
"The girl shook her head, and, with a sudden movement, slipped her arm out"
of this madman's and dived away like a swallow through the pavement
traffic.  Fiorsen stood still and laughed with his head thrown back.  The
second time to-day.  SHE had slipped from his grasp.  Passers looked at
"him, amazed.  The ugly devils!  And with a grimace, he turned out of"
"Piccadilly, past St. James's Church, making for Bury Street.  They"
"wouldn't let him in, of course--not they!  But he would look at the"
"windows; they had flower-boxes--flower-boxes!  And, suddenly, he groaned"
aloud--he had thought of Gyp's figure busy among the flowers at home.
"Missing the right turning, he came in at the bottom of the street.  A"
fiddler in the gutter was scraping away on an old violin.  Fiorsen
"stopped to listen.  Poor devil!  ""Pagliacci!""  Going up to the man--dark,"
"lame, very shabby, he took out some silver, and put his other hand on the"
man's shoulder.
"""Brother,"" he said, ""lend me your fiddle.  Here's money for you. Come;"
"lend it to me.  I am a great violinist."""
"""Vraiment, monsieur!"""
The Further Adventures of Peggy of Spinster Farm
_By Helen M. Winslow_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated, net $1.25; postpaid $ 1.40_"
Miss Winslow calls us again away from the strenuous and noisy
"confusion of modern cities to the charm and contentment of life ""under"
"the greenwood tree."" Peggy's adventures had only just begun in the"
"first book. In this new record of life at Spinster Farm and ""Elysium,"""
"""At the Sign of the Town Pump,"" there is plenty of romantic adventure"
of the kind that proves truth to be stranger sometimes than fiction.
"There is humor, too, in even greater quantities than in the preceding"
"book, sparkling humor that places the author well up in the list of"
"our New England humorists. ""At the Sign of the Town Pump"" will be"
welcomed not only by those who enjoyed making the acquaintance of
"Spinster Farm, but by thousands of new readers who appreciate a clever"
story and a fascinating heroine.
"_On ""Peggy at Spinster Farm"" the Press opinions are as follows_:"
"""Very alluring are the pictures she draws of the old-fashioned"
"house, the splendid old trees, the pleasant walks, the gorgeous"
"sunsets, and--or it would not be Helen Winslow--the"

such a wicked delight in adding to his father's discomfiture.  He did
not even once look in their direction.
"""The young spider has himself well in hand,"" remarked Abyedok, watching"
young Petunikoff's every movement and action.  Having taken all the
"measurements he desired, Ivan Andreyevitch knit his brows, got into the"
"cart, and drove away.  His son went with a firm step into Vaviloff's"
"eating-house, and disappeared behind the door."
"""Ho, ho!  That's a determined young thief! ...  What will happen next,"
"I wonder ...?"" asked Kuvalda."
"""Next?  Young Petunikoff will buy out Egor Vaviloff,"" said Abyedok with"
"conviction, and smacked his lips as if the idea gave him great pleasure."
"""And you are glad of that?"" Kuvalda asked him, gravely."
"""I am always pleased to see human calculations miscarry,"" explained"
"Abyedok, rolling his eyes and rubbing his hands with delight.  The"
Captain spat angrily on the ground and was silent. They all stood in
"front of the tumble-down building, and silently watched the doors of"
the eating-house.  More than an hour passed thus.  Then the doors
opened and Petunikoff came out as silently as he had entered.  He
"stopped for a moment, coughed, turned up the collar of his coat,"
"glanced at the men, who were following all his movements with their"
"eyes, and then went up the street towards the town."
"The Captain watched him for a moment, and turning to Abyedok said,"
smilingly:
"""Probably you were right after all, you son of a scorpion and a"

"on one of the possible, and probable, lines of development of Croce's"
"philosophy; which, however, will not become actual until the historical"
"problems of the living nature shall not urge Croce himself, or one of"
"his successors, as powerfully as the problems of human history have"
"moved him. At present, with very rare exceptions, the students of"
the history of nature are occupied in transforming their historical
experience into classes and types and laws; but a time may come when
from the naturalistic constructions we shall be able more frequently
"to recreate the life of which these are but the dead spoils, the"
"accumulated vestiges, by the same process by which history re-kindles"
"the old chronicles into new, contemporary life. That such a development"
"is implied in Croce's own theory of history can hardly be questioned,"
"though, when realized, it will undoubtedly react on more than one point"
of Croce's logic.

"""You better stop that laughin', Jack Rance, or I'll send you to finish"
"it in some place where things ain't so funny."""
Something in the Girl's altered tone so struck the Sheriff that he
"obeyed her. He said nothing, but on his lips were the words, ""By Heaven,"
"the Girl means it!"" and his eyes showed a smouldering admiration."
"""He doesn't hear you,--he's out of it. But me--me--I hear you--I ain't"
"out of it,"" the Girl went on in compelling tones. ""You're a gambler; he"
"was, too; well, so am I."" She crossed deliberately to the bureau, and"
"laid her pistol away in the drawer, Rance meanwhile eyeing her with"
"puzzled interest. Returning, she went on, incisively as a whip lash:"
"""I live on chance money, drink money, card money, saloon money. We're"
"gamblers,--we're all gamblers!"" She paused, an odd expression coming"
"over her face,--an expression that baffled Rance's power to read."
"Presently she resumed: ""Now, you asked me to-night if my answer was"
"final,--well, here's your chance. I'll play you the game,--straight"
"poker. It's two out o' three for me. Hatin' the sight o' you, it's the"
"nearest chance you'll ever get for me."""
"""Do you mean--"" began Rance, his hands resting on the table, his"
hawk-like glance burning into her very thoughts.
"""Yes, with a wife in Noo Orleans all right,"" she interrupted him"
"feverishly. ""If you're lucky,--you'll git 'im an' me. But if you"
"lose,--this man settin' between us is mine--mine to do with as I please,"

against his will.
"The end of Roberts's career was now in sight. A King's ship, the _Swallow_"
"(Captain Chaloner Ogle), discovered Roberts's ships at Parrot Island, and,"
"pretending to fly from them, was followed out to sea by one of the"
"pirates. A fight took place, and after two hours the pirates struck,"
"flinging overboard their black flag ""that it might not rise in Judgement"
"over them."" The _Swallow_ returned in a few days to Parrot Island to look"
"for Roberts in the _Royal Fortune_. Roberts being at breakfast, enjoying a"
"savoury dish of solomongundy, was informed of the approach of the ship,"
"but refused to take any notice of it. At last, thoroughly alarmed, he cut"
"his cables and sailed out, but most of his crew being drunk, even at this"
"early hour, the pirates did not make as good a resistance as if they had"
been sober. Early in the engagement Roberts was hit in the throat by a
"grape-shot and killed; this being on February 10th, 1722. His body, fully"
"dressed, with his arms and ornaments, was thrown overboard according to"
"his repeated request made during his lifetime. Thus the arch-pirate died,"
"as he always said he wished to die, fighting. His motto had always been ""A"
"short life and a merry one."" One good word can be said for Roberts, that"
he never forced a man to become a pirate against his wish.

With the greatest diffidence I have at last made up my mind to write
the story of my small campaign with the Sarhad Raiders in 1916.
This campaign sinks into utter insignificance when compared with the
great deeds done in other theatres of war by men who said nothing
"about them. But, insignificant as it was, it forms part of the mosaic"
"of the Great War, and for this reason may be of some general interest."
I take this opportunity of paying a tribute to all the officers who
"took part in this little campaign. Their untiring devotion to duty,"
and their efforts to do their utmost under conditions that were often
"more than trying, accounts for its success."
"I would like, in particular, to mention Major Landon of the 35th"
"Scinde Horse, whose great knowledge of the people and their country"
was invaluable; Major Sanders of the 36th Sikhs; Colonel Claridge of
"the 28th Light Cavalry; Captain Brownlow and Captain Hirst, both of"
the 28th Light Cavalry; Major Lang; Captain Moore-Lane; Lieutenant
"Bream of the Hazara Pioneers, and Captain English, R.A."
"In addition I would mention how much, not only I, but the old country"
"owes to Khan Bahadur, the Sarhad-dar, and to Idu, non-commissioned"
officer of the Chagai Levies.
The photographs are from snapshots taken by various officers during
the campaign.

"I hitched myself up to him and we sat on the bunk, glooming away at"
each other. Then we heard the tramp of feet in the crossway.
Butt swung down and headed for the control compartment in the
nose of the lifeboat. He had his blaster out and was cursing very
"interestingly. I started after him, but he picked me up by the seat"
of my jumper and tossed me toward the door. The Captain came in and
tripped over me.
I got all tangled up in his gold braid and million-mile space buttons.
"When we finally got to our feet and sorted out right, he was breathing"
"very hard. The Captain was a round little man with a plump, golden face"
"and a very scared look on it. He _humphed_ at me, just the way Sis"
"does, and lifted me by the scruff of my neck. The Chief Mate picked me"
up and passed me to the Second Assistant Engineer.
"Sis was there, being held by the purser on one side and the Chief"
"Computer's Mate on the other. Behind them, I could see a flock of"
wide-eyed female passengers.

"Famous for his piratical activities off the coast of North America,"

"In 1718, when Woodes Rogers was sent by the English Government to break up"
"the pirate stronghold in the Bahama Islands, all the pirates at New"
Providence Island surrendered to Rogers and received the King's pardon
"except Vane, who, after setting fire to a prize he had, slipped out of the"
bay as Rogers with his two men-of-war entered. Vane sailed to the coast of
"Carolina, as did other West Indian pirates who found their old haunts too"
warm for them.
Vane is first heard of as being actively engaged in stealing from the
Spaniards the silver which they were salving from a wrecked galleon in the

Since the standard of music and words in the Gospel Songs is
considerably below that which prevails in our best hymnals as well as in
"secular music and literature taught in the public schools, churches"
should seriously consider the ultimate effect of their too frequent use.
It is a fallacy to assert that the people will respond to nothing
"better. Gospel Songs have a legitimate place, particularly in special"
"services and revivals, but they leave much to be desired in the total"
work and worship of the church. Neither the music nor the words possess
the strength and dignity entirely adequate for the worshipful praise of
the Eternal.
The principal names associated with Gospel Songs are the following:
"_Authors._ Fanny J. Crosby, Philip P. Bliss, Robert Lowry, Katherine"
"Hankey, E. A. Hoffman, and many others. Most of the words, though not"
"all, were written by Americans during the latter part of the nineteenth"
century. Miss Crosby was by far the most prolific of them all and many
of her works are found in all modern hymnals of denominations that use
"this type of music. In Germany, Ernst Gebhardt became the leader of the"
"gospel song movement, composing words and music, publishing numerous"
"song books, and serving as song leader in great revival meetings."
"_Music._ William B. Bradbury, Robert Lowry, W. H. Doane, Philip Philips,"
"James McGranahan, George C. Stebbins, P. P. Bliss, D. W. Towner, Wm. J."
"Kirkpatrick, and others."
"_Song Leaders._ P. P. Bliss, Ira Sankey, James McGranahan, George C."
"Stebbins, Charles Alexander, Homer Rodeheaver."

Kennedy related the history of the Farnese Palace to Cæsar. They went
through the Via del Mascherone and came out into the Via Giulia.
"“This Via Giulia is a street in a provincial capital,” said Kennedy;"
“always sad and deserted; a Cardinal or two who like isolation are still
living here.”
"At the entrance to the Via dei Farnesi, Cæsar stopped to look at two"
marble tablets set into the wall at the two sides of a chapel door.
"Cut on the tablets were skeletons painted black; on one, the words:"
"“Alms for the poor dead bodies found in the fields,” and on the other:"
“Alms for the perpetual lamp in the cemetery.”
“What does this mean?” said Cæsar.
“That is the Church of the Orison of the Confraternity of Death. The
tablets are modern.”
"They passed by the “Mascherone” again, and went rambling on until they"
reached the Synagogue and the Theatre of Marcellus.
They went through narrow streets without sidewalks; they passed across
"tiny squares; and it seemed like a dead city, or like the outskirts of a"
village. In certain streets towered high dark palaces of blackish stone.
These mysterious palaces looked uninhabited; the gratings were eaten
"with rust, all sorts of weeds grew on the roofs, and the balconies were"
"covered with climbing plants. At corners, set into the wall, one saw"
"niches with glass fronts. A painted madonna, black now, with silver"

"As for El Sarria, death was his _métier_, his familiar friend. He had"

"ordering his going, that he might not in these last things disgrace his"
nation and his upbringing. Etienne and Ramon were following him. Still
"the young Scot lingered. Cabrera, nervously fingering his accoutrement"
"and signing papers at a folding table, found time to eye him with"
curiosity.
"""Did he mean to make a last plea for mercy?"" he thought."
Cabrera smiled contemptuously. A friend of Nogueras might know Ramon
Cabrera of Tortosa better. But Rollo had no such thought. He had in his
"fingers Etienne's last slip of Alcoy paper, in which the cigarette of"
"Spain, unfailing comforter, is wrapped. To fill it he had crumbled his"
last leaf of tobacco. Now it was rolled accurately and with lingering

"In company with three other mariners--Cullen, Wife, and Neale--this Irish"
"pirate shipped himself on board a French snow at Cork in November, 1721,"
"for a passage to Nantes. Owing to Roche's briskness, genteel manners, and"
"knowledge of navigation, the master used occasionally to place him in"
charge of the vessel. One night a few days out a pre-arranged mutiny took
"place, the French crew being butchered and thrown overboard. The captain,"
"who pleaded for mercy, was also thrown into the sea. Driven by bad weather"
"to Dartmouth, the new captain, Roche, had the ship repainted and"
"disguised, and renamed her the _Mary_. Then sailing to Rotterdam he sold"
"the cargo of beef and took on a fresh cargo with the owner, Mr. Annesly."
"The first night out of port they threw Mr. Annesly overboard, and he swam"
alongside for some while pleading to be taken in. On going into a French
"port, and hearing that an enquiry was being made about his ship, Roche ran"
"away. The crew took the ship to Scotland, and there landed and"
"disappeared, and the ship was seized and taken to the Thames."
"Later on Roche was arrested in London and committed to Newgate Prison,"
"found guilty of piracy, and hanged on August 5th, 1723, at Execution Dock,"
"at the age of 30. The hanging was not, from the public spectators point of"
"view, a complete success, for the culprit ""was so ill at the time that he"
could not make any public declaration of his abhorrence of the crime for
"which he suffered."""

"Mr. Coxon may be forgiven for being, on this same important Monday, in a"
state of some nervous excitement. He had a severe attack of what are
"vulgarly called ""the fidgets,"" and Sir John, who was spending the"
"morning at the Club (for his court was not sitting), glanced at him over"
his eye-glasses with an irritated look. The ex-Attorney-General would
"not sit still, but flitted continually from window to table, and back"
"from table to window, taking up and putting down journal after journal."
"Much depended, in Mr. Coxon's view, on the event of that day, for Sir"
"John spoke openly of his approaching retirement, and an appointment"
sometimes thought worthy of a Premier's acceptance might be in Coxon's
"grasp before many weeks were past, if only Medland and his noxious idea"
of getting a first-class man out from England could be swept together
into limbo.

of his restless turns the brooding politician passed near.

And Pola had snubbed her. It had indeed been a cruel fate that had
brought Pola out on the wharf at that precise moment!
"She spent a lonely afternoon in Top Notch, too miserable to even pour"
"out her heart to ""Dorothea."" Then she helped Aunt Achsa prepare supper"
"and after supper, which was lonely, too, for neither Lavender nor Mr."
"Dugald were there, she insisted upon clearing up the dishes while Aunt"
Achsa went down to Tillie Higgins'.
Swishing her hands in the soapy water Sidney pondered sadly the things
she had longed to learn of Pola. Her name--why she hadn't even found
out her name! What had her teacher said of that theme she had written
on her visit to the Romley house? Where did Pola live? Of course she
might see her again--Pola had said that they'd be in Provincetown for a
"few days, but she did not _want_ to see her; she did not want Pola to"
see Sunset Lane and the little gray cottage and Aunt Achsa and
Lavender. Pola would laugh at them and she would hate her!
At that moment footsteps crunched the gravel of the path and a shadow
fell across the kitchen door. Sidney turned from the table. There stood
Mr. Dugald and with him--Pola.
"""I've brought my cousin, Sidney. She blew out to the Cape with that"
ill-wind we felt this morning. If you know what we can do with her I'll
"be your slave for life."""
Playfully pushing Dugald Allan aside Pola walked into the kitchen.

"would you? I told him how we'd met, even before this morning. He'd"
written home that Miss Green's cousin was here but I never dreamed it

relating to Naval Prize of War.
Whereas at the Second Peace Conference held at The Hague in the year

5. Hymns of the Bohemian Brethren.
"The followers of John Hus who came to be known as the Bohemian Brethren,"
"and later as the Moravians, were the first Protestant group to introduce"
congregational singing into their worship. They also published the first
"Protestant hymnbooks, one in 1501 and another in 1505, containing 89 and"
"400 hymns, respectively, in their native Bohemian tongue. Their efforts"
to introduce congregational singing were sternly opposed by the Roman
hierarchy. The Council of Constance condemned Hus to be burned at the
"stake and warned his successor, Jacob of Misi, to cease the singing of"
hymns in the churches. It decreed:
"If laymen are forbidden to preach and interpret the Scriptures, much"
more are they forbidden to sing publicly in the churches.
"As a result of their persecution, the Brethren in 1508 sent out"
messengers to search for true Christian people into whose communion they
"might apply for admission—one to Russia, one to Greece, one to Bulgaria,"
and one to Palestine and Egypt. All returned unsuccessful. No such
"Christians had been found. They therefore remained in their own country,"
giving themselves assiduously to the translation and printing of the
Bible.
In 1522 the Brethren sent two messengers to Luther to greet him and ask
his advice. Luther became interested in them and welcomed their
fellowship. He was impressed with the hymnbook the Brethren had
"published, and later used some of the hymns in his own work."
"Upon my insistence, he accepted the gold and gave me the ten guineas he"
"had borrowed from Lilly, asking me to return them."
Frances was making an entire failure of her effort to hold herself in
"check, and George was having difficulty in restraining himself, so, to"
"bring the interview to an end, he gave me his hand, saying:--"
"""Thank you, Ned, and good-by. I wish I could hope ever to see you again,"
"but if Le Grand fails me, I shall go to the new world and lose myself in"
"the Canadian woods."""
"""No, no!"" cried Frances, imploringly."
"""I hope not,"" began George, but he could not finish, so he took Frances"
"in his arms for a moment, and when he released her, thrust us both out"
"the door, saying: ""Please leave me at once. If you do not, I fear I shall"
"never let her go. Take care of her, Ned. Good-by!"""
"The door closed on us, and when Frances had put on her vizard, she"
followed me upstairs to see Betty.
"I was not admitted to Betty's room, so I went back to the printing shop"
"for a moment, and George gave me the key to the cipher, in which we were"
"to write to each other. His letters were to be sent under cover to Lilly,"
and mine were to go to an address in Paris which George would send to me.
"Long afterwards George told me of his adventures in making his escape,"
but I shall give them now in the order of their happening rather than in
the order of time in which I learned them.
"Leaving the Old Swan within ten minutes after I had said good-by to him,"
from above.  No sound of the dogs.  He would go up and see the baby.
"While he was crossing the hall, there came a ring.  He opened the door"
himself.  A telegram!  He tore the envelope.
"""Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.--WINTON."""
"He gave a short laugh, shut the door in the boy's face, and ran upstairs;"
why--heaven knew!  There was nobody there now!  Nobody! Did it mean that
she had really left him--was not coming back?  He stopped by the side of
"Gyp's bed, and flinging himself forward, lay across it, burying his face."
"And he sobbed, as men will, unmanned by drink.  Had he lost her?  Never"
to see her eyes closing and press his lips against them!  Never to soak
"his senses in her loveliness!  He leaped up, with the tears still wet on"
"his face. Lost her?  Absurd!  That calm, prim, devilish Englishman, her"
father--he was to blame--he had worked it all--stealing the baby!
He went down-stairs and drank some brandy.  It steadied him a little.
"What should he do?  ""Letter follows.""  Drink, and wait? Go to Bury"
Street?  No.  Drink!  Enjoy himself!
"He laughed, and, catching up his hat, went out, walking furiously at"
"first, then slower and slower, for his head began to whirl, and, taking a"
"cab, was driven to a restaurant in Soho.  He had eaten nothing but a"
"biscuit since his breakfast, always a small matter, and ordered soup and"
a flask of their best Chianti--solids he could not face.  More than two
"hours he sat, white and silent, perspiration on his forehead, now and"
"then grinning and flourishing his fingers, to the amusement and sometimes"
"the alarm of those sitting near.  But for being known there, he would"
"have been regarded with suspicion.  About half-past nine, there being no"
"more wine, he got up, put a piece of gold on the table, and went out"
without waiting for his change.
"Panama is divided into seven provinces, Bocas del Toro, Cocle, Colon,"
"Chiriqui, Los Santos, Panama and Veragua. Its total population by the"
"census of 1911 was 386,749, a trifle more than the District of Columbia"
"which has about one five-thousandth of its area, and almost precisely"
the same population as Montana which has less than half its size. So it
"is clearly not over-populated. Of its population 51,323 are set down by"
"its own census takers as white, 191,933 as mestizo, or a cross between"
"white and Indian, 48,967 as negro; 2313 Mongol, and 14,128 Indian. The"
"census takers estimated that other Indians, living in barbarism remote"
"from civilization and unapproachable by the enumerators, numbered"
"36,138."
[Illustration: NATIVE FAMILY IN CHORRERA]
All these figures have to be qualified somewhat. The mestizos are
"theoretically a cross between whites and Indians, but the negro blood is"
"very generally present. It is doubtful, too, whether those classed as"
white are not often of mixed blood.
A singularly large proportion of the population lives in the towns. In
"12 towns, exceeding 7000 inhabitants each, are more than 150,000 people."
"More than one-third of the people therefore are town dwellers, which is"
to say they are unproductive citizens. Meanwhile more than five-eighths
of the arable land in the country is not under cultivation.

"RINGROSE, BASIL. Buccaneer, pirate, and author."
Sailed in 1679 to the West Indies. A year later Ringrose had joined the
"buccaneers at their rendezvous in the Gulf of Darien, where they were"
preparing for a bold enterprise on the Spanish Main. They landed and
"marched to the town of Santa Maria, which they plundered and burnt."
Thence they travelled in canoes down the river to the Bay of Panama. After
"attacking the Spanish fleet and laying siege to the city, the buccaneers"
"cruised up and down the West Coast of South America for eighteen months,"
sacking towns and attacking Spanish ships. All this while Ringrose kept a
"very full and graphic journal, in which he recorded not only their"
"exploits, but also their hardships and quarrels, and gave descriptions as"
"well of the various natives and their customs, and drew charts and"
sketches.
"In 1681 Ringrose was still with Captain Sharp, and sailed through the"
"Straits of Magellan, and on January 30th of the same year anchored off"
"Antigua. Here he got a passage in a ship to England, landing safely at"
Dartmouth on March 26th.
"A year later he published an account of his voyage, as a second volume to"
"Esquemeling's, ""Bucaniers of America."" In 1684 he went to sea again in the"
"_Cygnet_ (Captain Swan), to traffic with the Spanish colonies. But the"
"Spaniards refused to trade with them. In October, 1684, they met the"
"famous Captain Edward Davis at that favourite haunt of the buccaneers, the"
Isle of Plate. The two captains agreed to join forces and to go together
"""on the account,"" so all the cargo was thrown overboard the _Cygnet_, and"
the ships set out to make war on any Spanish ships they might meet with.
"The Girl felt the colour leave her cheeks, though she made a gesture for"
him to proceed.
"""Pedro not 'ere any longer,"" smiled the Mexican. ""Me senda 'im to the"

"""An' the woman?"" gasped the Girl."
"""She gone--got away--Monterey by this time,"" replied Castro with evident"
"disappointment. ""But Meester Ashby 'e know too much--'ees men everywhere"
"searched the camp--no safa 'ere now. To-norrow--"" Castro stopped short;"
the next instant with a joyful gleam in his eyes he cried out:
"""_Maestro_!"""
"""Castro's right, Girl,"" said Johnson, who had waked and heard the"
"Mexican's last words; ""it is not safe a moment more here, and I must"
"go."""
With a little cry of loving protest the Girl abruptly left the men to
"talk over the situation and sought the opposite side of the room. There,"
her eyes half-closed and her lips pressed tightly together she gave
herself up to her distressing fears. After a while it was made plain to
"her that she was being brought into the conversation, for every now and"
"then Castro would look curiously at her; at length, as if it had been"
"determined by them that nothing should be undertaken without her advice,"
"Johnson, followed by his subordinate, came over to her and related in"
detail all the startling information that Castro had brought.
"Quietly the Girl listened and, in the end, it was agreed between them"

that Castro should go at once with the understanding that he should

9. English Hymnody.
"The youthful, courageous Isaac Watts, 1674-1748, an ardent dissenter,"
pioneered the movement which resulted in a flood of hymns and hymnbooks
in the English churches. Watts was not satisfied with the psalm singing
"of his time, which by now had become formal and lifeless. Parts of the"
"psalter, he pointed out, were obviously not written in the spirit of the"
"Gospel. “By keeping too close to David,” he wrote in one of his"
"Prefaces, “the vail of Moses is thrown over our hearts.” Watts removed"
"that “vail,” Christianizing the psalms and composing during his lifetime"
"more than 600 original hymns, expressing in the language of the time,"
"the thoughts of the worshippers. Through his influence, his age, the"
"18th century, became the first age of hymn singing in England."
"John and Charles Wesley, following Watts, made enormous use of hymn"
"singing in their evangelistic work, giving the movement for"
congregational singing a powerful impetus. Charles is said to have
"composed over 6,000 hymns."
"From the Wesleys onward through the 19th century, the hymn writers in"
England became numerous. The restrictive shackles of psalm singing had
been broken and the creative urge to worship in new forms resulted in a
vast number of original religious lyrics and the publication of hundreds
of hymnbooks. The development can be summarized here only in outline
form.

10. American Hymns.
The English speaking colonists who settled in America during the 17th
century continued the psalm singing traditions of their forebears in
England. The practice prevailed in their churches for two hundred years.
"The first book printed by them was the _Bay Psalm Book_, in 1640, at"
"Cambridge, Massachusetts. It contained no original hymns. The singing of"
"psalms, and later of hymns borrowed from England made up nearly the"
entire repertory of church music until the middle of the 19th century.
"On the other hand, the German speaking colonists, including the"
"Mennonites, had brought with them the hymn books of the Lutheran"
tradition and continued the use of the German chorales in their worship.
"The two streams of hymnody, English psalms and German chorales, went"
"their independent courses for two centuries, scarcely influencing each"
other.
In the meantime there was very little original hymnody produced in
"America, with the exception of the work of the Wesleys during their"
"brief experiment in Georgia, and the composition of certain hymns and"
"tunes by the German people of Pennsylvania, which have remained, until"
"recently, in manuscript form. Timothy Dwight’s hymn on the church, “I"
"love Thy Kingdom, Lord” (275) is probably the earliest American hymn"
still in use.
After the middle of the 19th century the number of hymn writers became
"large and their works came into increasing use, some choice examples"
finding their way into English hymnbooks. America’s original
"""Don't be afraid, Sidney,"" Mart spoke calmly. ""You sort o' belong to"

"expect to, sometime--"" But here her voice broke with a tremble. ""I--I"
was thinking of gran'ma. I wish I'd been better to her. I talk back to
"her lots of times when I shouldn't."""
"""But you _are_ good to her, Mart. And--_I_ was thinking of Aunt Achsa."
I shouldn't have deceived her--about coming out here. I fooled myself
into thinking that even a lie didn't matter considering what we were
trying to do. But the honor of Cape Cod isn't worth anything happening
to Lav. And if anything does happen there won't be anyone to tell about
"Jed Starrow, anyway! Oh, Mart, I can't bear to _think_ about Lav. Why"
"did we let him do it? Dear old Lav. I've been mean to him, too. He"
adores poetry and I--I never even told him that my father was a poet
and that I know lots and lots of poems and--and--that I've written most
"a book myself."""
"""Honest, Sid, was your father a poet? And you can write it yourself?"
"Gee,"" softly. ""I wish I could do something like that. I'd rather be"
like that than anything else. I just pretend that I hate school and
books and such things--it's because I had to stop going to school to
stay with gran'ma that I've put on that I didn't have any use for it.
"Even when I was sort of laughing at you, Sid, down in my heart I was"
feeling aw'fly proud that you'd want to fool 'round with anyone like
"me--I'll _always_ be proud."""
"""Oh, Mart--"" Sidney faltered. ""I wish I could put into words what Mr."
Dugald taught me when I first came here. That it's the big inside
things that really count. He told me so's I'd see Aunt Achsa and Lav as
"they really are. And, Mart, your giving up school to take care of your"
"grandmother is a big thing, a real thing! You don't want to forget it."""

eight years old. In our private life we always spoke Italian or
"French, German was our official language. I know that language well,"
"of course, but it is not my mother tongue. Italian or French, and"
afterwards English--I speak and write all three equally well; which of
the three I shall use when I come to die and one reverts to the speech
"of the nursery and schoolroom, I cannot say; it will depend upon whom"
those are that stand about my deathbed.
"When I was eight years old, my father, Captain ---- (no, I will not"

that great Devonshire seaport. I was young enough to absorb the rich
"English atmosphere, nowhere so rich as in that county which is the"
"home and breeding-ground of your most splendid Navy. I was born again,"
a young Elizabethan Englishman. My story to you of my origin was true
in one particular--I really was educated at Blundell's School at
Tiverton. Whenever--and it has happened more than once--I have met as
Trehayne old schoolfellows of Blundell's they have accepted without
"comment or inquiry my tale that I had become an Englishman, and had"
"anglicised my name. Among the peoples which exist on earth to-day, you"
English are the most nobly generous and unsuspicious. The Prussians

"and the Abbé said he would leave his credentials with my Lord Clarendon,"
"and would be at Whitehall at the hour suggested by the king, for the"
purpose of making the French king's offer.
"Most of the guests went home between two men, very late at night, but"
fortunately I was able to walk home by myself.
I was both glad and disappointed not to find George in the gown of the
Abbé. I was glad because of the risk he would have taken had he come to

graciously taking my arm and leading me to a window overlooking the

Is _Alice in Wonderland?_  Is _Treasure Island?_  These are
"masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how"
much more pleasure when we are grown-up.  In any case what do we mean
"by ""children""?  A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of"
fourteen--are they all to like the same thing?  And is a book
"""suitable for a boy of twelve"" any more likely to please a boy of"
twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven;
"even if the novel be described truly as ""suitable for a man of"
"thirty-seven""?  I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult"
problems.
But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which
"children will like, unless he write it for himself first.  That being"
"so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups.  How"
grown-up I did not realise until I received a letter from an unknown
reader a few weeks after its first publication; a letter which said
"that he was delighted with my clever satires of the Kaiser, Mr. Lloyd"
"George and Mr. Asquith, but he could not be sure which of the"
characters were meant to be Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Bonar Law.
Would I tell him on the enclosed postcard?  I replied that they were
thinly disguised on the title-page as Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton.  In
"fact, it is not that sort of book."
"But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what"
sort of book it is.  Perhaps no explanation is necessary.  Read in it
what you like; read it to whomever you like; be of what age you like;

or you won't.
It is that sort of book.

"themselves together, back to her breast, higher than which they dared not"
mount.  Their infinite embarrassment struck Gyp.  She could almost hear
"him thinking: 'Now, how can I discuss it with this attractive young"
"female, wife of the scoundrel who's ruined my daughter?  Delicate-that's"
what it is!'  Then the words burst hoarsely from him.
"""This is an unpleasant business, ma'am.  I don't know what to say. Reelly"
"I don't.  It's awkward; it's very awkward."""
Gyp said quietly:
"""Your daughter is desperately unhappy; and that can't be good for her"
"just now."""
"Mr. Wagge's thick figure seemed to writhe.  ""Pardon me, ma'am,"" he"
"spluttered, ""but I must call your husband a scoundrel.  I'm sorry to be"

"should be able to control myself--I don't indeed.""  Gyp made a movement"
"of her gloved hands, which he seemed to interpret as sympathy, for he"
"went on in a stream of husky utterance: ""It's a delicate thing before a"
"lady, and she the injured party; but one has feelings.  From the first I"
said this dancin' was in the face of Providence; but women have no more
sense than an egg.  Her mother she would have it; and now she's got it!

"mark 'im.  An' what to say to you, I'm sure I don't know. That my"
"daughter should be'ave like that!  Well, it's made a difference to me."

here give translated:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""I reached Paris three weeks ago and was received by Monsieur Le G."
"most graciously. Although I cannot give definite news, I hope for great"
"improvement in my fortune soon, and perhaps may write you more fully"
thereof before the week is spent.
"""Good fortune has but one meaning for me, of which you already know. I"
beg you to say to one that a letter from her hand would give me greater
"joy than she can know, and that I would now send one to her if I felt"
"safe in so doing. Please send all letters in cipher, addressed: 'Monsieur"

"on the Rue St. Antoine, counting nine doors from the street corner"

"When George wrote that he hoped for good fortune, I knew he had"
"sound reason to expect it, for he was one who never permitted a mere"
"possibility to take the form of hope, nor hope, however assuring, to"
"take the aspect of certainty. Knowing this to be true, I found great"
"joy in the letter, and when I told Frances, she did not pause even to"
"give me one smile of thanks, but broke into a flood of tears and seemed"
to take great happiness in her tribulation.
"I told Frances that we should answer the letter at once, and suggested"

"men-of-war as a petty officer. Until July, 1723, when 40 years of age,"
"Upton lived a perfectly honest life, but his wife dying, Upton found she"
had contracted various debts and that he was in danger of being arrested
"by the creditors. Leaving his four orphans, Upton hurried to Poole in"
"Dorsetshire, and was taken on as boatswain in the _John and Elizabeth_"
"(Captain Hooper), bound for Bonavista in Newfoundland. He seems to have"
"continued to sail as an honest seaman until November 14th, 1725, when"
"serving as boatswain in the _Perry_ galley, on a voyage between Barbadoes"
"and Bristol, the vessel was taken by a pirate, Cooper, in the _Night"
Rambler_. At his subsequent trial witnesses declared that Upton willingly
"joined the pirates, signed their articles, and was afterwards one of their"
most active and cruel men.
"Upton kept a journal, which was his only witness for his defence, in which"
he described how he was forced to sign the pirates' articles under threats
"of instant death. If his journal is to be believed, Upton escaped from the"
"pirates at the first opportunity, landing on the Mosquito coast. After"
"being arrested by the Spaniards as a spy, he was sent from one prison to"
"another in Central America, at last being put on board a galleon at Porto"
"Bello, to be sent to Spain. Escaping, he got aboard a New York sloop and"
"arrived at Jamaica in December, 1726. While at Port Royal he was pressed"
"on board H.M.S. _Nottingham_, serving in her for more than two years as"
"quartermaster, until one day he was accused of having been a pirate. Under"
"this charge he was brought a prisoner to England in 1729, tried in London,"
"and hanged, protesting his innocence to the last."

"Fiorsen, who had leaped out of bed, put his hand to his head.  The cursed"
"fellow!  Cursed be every one of them--the father and the girl, Rosek and"
all the other sharks!  He went out on to the landing.  The house was
"quite still below.  Rosek had gone--good riddance!  He called, ""Gyp!""  No"
answer.  He went into her room. Its superlative daintiness struck his
fancy.  A scent of cyclamen! He looked out into the garden.  There was
"the baby at the end, and that fat woman.  No Gyp!  Never in when she was"
"wanted.  Wagge!  He shivered; and, going back into his bedroom, took a"
brandy-bottle from a locked cupboard and drank some.  It steadied him; he
"locked up the cupboard again, and dressed."
"Going out to the music-room, he stopped under the trees to make passes"
with his fingers at the baby.  Sometimes he felt that it was an adorable
"little creature, with its big, dark eyes so like Gyp's. Sometimes it"
"excited his disgust--a discoloured brat.  This morning, while looking at"
"it, he thought suddenly of the other that was coming--and grimaced."
Catching Betty's stare of horrified amazement at the face he was making
"at her darling, he burst into a laugh and turned away into the"
music-room.
"While he was keying up his violin, Gyp's conduct in never having come"
there for so long struck him as bitterly unjust.  The girl--who cared
about the wretched girl?  As if she made any real difference!  It was all
"so much deeper than that.  Gyp had never loved him, never given him what"
"he wanted, never quenched his thirst of her!  That was the heart of it."
No other woman he had ever had to do with had been like that--kept his
thirst unquenched. No; he had always tired of them before they tired of
him.  She gave him nothing really--nothing!  Had she no heart or did she
give it elsewhere?  What was that Paul had said about her music-lessons?

unprogressive owing to constant feuds. Even as late as 1670 Leyden
"refused to let the Harle Maer be drained, because it would"
advantage other cities; and Amsterdam in turn opposed the reopening
of the old Rhine channel because it would make Leyden maritime
"(Temple, _Observations_, i, 130, ch. iii)."
"As regards the early factions of the ""Hooks"" and the ""Codfish"" in"
"the Dutch towns, the historic obscurity is so great that historians"
are found ascribing the names in contrary ways. Grattan (p. 49)
"represents the Hooks as the town party, and the Codfish as the"
"party of the nobles; Motley (p. 21) reverses the explanation,"
"noting, however, that there was no consistent cleavage of class or"
"of principle (cp. M'Cullagh, pp. 99, 100). This account is"
"supported by Van Kampen, i, 170, 171. The fullest survey of the"
"Hook and Cod feud is given by Wenzelburger, _Geschichte der"
"Niederlande_, i, 210-42. As to feuds of other parties in some of"
"the cities see Van Kampen, i, 172. They included, for example, a"
class feud between the rich _Vetkooper_ (fat-dealers) and the poor
"_Schieringer_ (eel-fishers). See Davies, i, 180."
"Thus dissident, and with feudal wars breaking out in every generation,"
the cities and provinces could win concessions from their feudal chiefs

consciousness to an objective rhythm.]

"of the stapedius muscle, leading to a change in the ampullae which might"

caught the sound of the muscular contraction. The opinion of so acute an

Rossiter waiting for her in his motor and Honoria in hers; had
"thanked them both for their never-to-be-forgotten kindness, and had"
insisted on walking away in her rather creased and rumpled clothes
of the previous year with Bertie Adams; she sought the hospitality
"of Praddy at Hans Place. The parlour-maid received her sumptuously,"
and Praddy's eyes watered with senile tears.

"""To-morrow"" was the 12th of August, and Dora was not yet in being to"
interpose every possible obstacle in the way of the civilian
"traveller. Down to the Battle of the Marne in September, 1914, very"
"little difficulty was made about crossing the Channel, especially"
off the main Dover-Calais route.
So in the radiant noon of that August day Vivie looked her last on
"the brown-white promontories, cliffs and grey castle of Dover,"
"scarcely troubling about any anticipations one way or the other, and"
"Edward Island, and losing his commission, he went to live near Halifax,"
"and became a lieutenant in the Nova Scotia Fencibles, while his wife"
"remained on the island to look after his estates, which brought him in"
"£300 a year. Meeting with a Scotchman called Morrison, together they"
"bought a ""pretty little New York battleship,"" mounting ten guns. Manning"
"this dangerous toy with a crew of ninety desperate characters, the"
"partners went ""on the account,"" and began well by taking a brig belonging"
"to Mr. Hill, of Rotherhithe, which they took to New York, and there sold"
both ship and cargo.
"They next cruised in the West Indies, taking several English and Dutch"
"ships, the crews of which they treated with the greatest brutality."
"Landing on St. Kitts Island, they burnt and plundered two Dutch"
"plantations, murdering the owners and slaves. Sailing north to"
"Newfoundland they took ten more vessels, which they sold in New York."
After further successful voyages in the West Indies and off the coast of
"Brazil, Nelson felt the call of home ties becoming so strong that he"
"ventured to return to Prince Edward Island to visit his wife and family,"
where no one dared to molest him.
"By this time Nelson had been a pirate for three years and had, by his"
"industry, won for himself a fortune worth £150,000, but his Scotch"
"partner, Morrison, being a frugal soul, had in the meantime saved an even"
larger sum. Eventually their ship was wrecked in a fog on a small barren
"island near Prince Edward Island, and Morrison and most of the crew were"
"drowned, but Nelson and a few others were saved. At last he reached New"
"York, where he lived the rest of his life in peaceful happiness with his"

"of reaching a solution of the social problem as any other, and visibly"

"bear on the vital lines of conduct, though still in the stage of curing"
over-population by emigration. Given continued peaceful political
"evolution in the direction first of democratic federation, and further"
"of socialisation of wealth, they may reach and keep the front rank in"

of dire vicissitude.
FOOTNOTES:
"[Footnote 638: As in Carlyle's _Early Kings of Norway_, the _caput"
mortuum_ of his historical method. Much more instructive works on
Scandinavian history are available to the English reader. The two
volumes on _Scandinavia_ by Crichton and Wheaton (1837) are not yet
"superseded, though savouring strongly of the conservatism of their"
"period. Dunham, who rapidly produced, for Gardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia"
"series, histories of _Spain and Portugal_ (5 vols.), _Europe during the"
"Middle Ages_ (4 vols.), and the _Germanic Empire_ (3 vols.), compiled"
"also one of _Denmark, Sweden, and Norway_ (3 vols. 1839-40), of inferior"
"quality. But Geijer's _History of Sweden_, one of the standard modern"
"national histories of Europe, is translated into English as far as the"
period of Gustavus Vasa (3 vols. of orig. in one of trans. 1845); and
the competent _History of Denmark_ by C.-F. Allen is available in a
"French translation (Copenhagen, 2 tom. 1878). Otté's _Scandinavian"
"History_, 1874, is an unpretending and unliterary but well-informed"
"work, which may be used to check Crichton and Wheaton. The more recent"
"work of Mr. R. Nisbet Bain, _Scandinavia: a Political History of"
maintain a mission of its own in Congoland. Kind Mme. Trouessart
"(née Walcker), distressed and unusually moved at the sad"
"circumstances of Mrs. Warren's death, had called in her uncle the"
Baptist pastor (who also in some unexplained way seemed to hold a
brief for the Salvation Army). He prayed silently by the death-bed
"which, under the circumstances, was more tactful than open"
intercession. He helped greatly over all the formalities of the
"funeral, and he took upon himself the arrangement of the ceremony,"
"so that everything was done decorously, and certainly to the"
"satisfaction of the Belgians, who attended. Such people would be"
"large-minded in religion--you might be Protestant, if you were not"
"Catholic, or you might be Jewish; but a funeral without some outward"
sign of faith and hope would have puzzled and distressed them.
"To Vivie's great surprise, there was a considerable attendance at"
the ceremony. She had expected no more than the company of Minna--an
"unprofessing but real Christian, if ever there were one, and the"
equally Christian if equally hedonist Mme. Trouessart. But there
"came in addition quite a number of shopkeepers from the Rue Royale,"
"the Rues de Schaerbeek, du Marais, de Lione, and de l'Association,"
"with whom Mrs. Warren had dealt in years gone by. ""C'etait une dame"
"_très_ convenable,"" said one purveyor, and the others agreed. ""Elle"
"me paya écus sonnants,"" said another, ""et toujours sans"
"marchander."" There was even present a more distinguished"
acquaintance of the past: a long-retired Commissaire de Police of
the Quartier in which Mrs. Warren's hotel was situated.
"He appeared in the tightly-buttoned frock-coat of civil life, with a"
"minute disc of some civic decoration in his button hole, and an"
incredibly tall chimney-pot hat. He came to render his _respectueux
hommages_ to the maîtresse-femme who had conducted her business
"within the four corners of the law, ""sans avoir maille à partir avec"
"after the summer of 1915, she lived very much alone, except that she"
had the Adams children from Marylebone to spend the day with her
occasionally.
"Poor Mrs. Adams, though a valiant worker, was very downcast and"
unhappy. She confided to Mrs. Rossiter that although she dearly
"loved her Bert--""and a better husband I defy you to find""--he never"
"seemed all hers. ""Always so wrapped up in that Miss Warren or 'er"
"cousin the barrister."" And no sooner had war broken out than off he"
"was to France, as a kind of missionary, she believed--the Young"
"Men's Christian Something or other; ""though before the War he didn't"
"seem particular stuck on religion, and it was all she could do to"
get him sometimes to church on a Sunday morning. Oh yes: she got 'er
money all right; and she couldn't say too much of Mr. and Mrs.
"Rossiter's kindness. There was Bert, not doin' a stroke of work for"
"the Professor, and yet his pay going on all the same. Indeed she was"
"putting money by, because Bert was kep' out there, and all found."""
However his two pretty children were some consolation to Mrs.
"Rossiter, whom they considered as a very grand lady and one that was"
lavishly kind.
Mrs. Rossiter tried sometimes in 1915 having working parties in her
house or in the studio; and if she could attract workers gave them
such elaborate lunches and plethoric teas that very little work was
"done, especially as she herself loved a long, aimless gossip about"
the Royal Family or whether Lord Kitchener had ever _really_ been in
"love. Or she tried, since she was a poor worker herself--her only"
jersey and muffler were really finished by her maid--reading aloud
"to the knitters or stitchers, preferably from the works of Miss"
Charlotte Yonge or some similar novelist of a later date. But that
was found to be too disturbing to their sense of the ludicrous. For
"Morgan was essentially a man of action, and a regular life on shore proved"
"irksome to him, for we learn from a report sent home by Lord Vaughan in"
"1674 that Morgan ""frequented the taverns of Port Royal, drinking and"
"gambling in unseemly fashion,"" but nevertheless the Jamaican Assembly had"
voted the Lieutenant-Governor a sum of £600 special salary. In 1676
Vaughan brought definite charges against Morgan and another member of the
"Council, Robert Byndloss, of giving aid to certain Jamaica pirates."
"Morgan made a spirited defence and, no doubt largely owing to his"
"popularity, got off, and in 1678 was granted a commission to be a captain"
of a company of 100 men.
"The Governor to succeed Vaughan was Lord Carlisle, who seems to have liked"
"Morgan, in spite of his jovial ""goings on"" with his old buccaneer friends"
"in the taverns of Port Royal, and in some of his letters speaks of"
"Morgan's ""generous manner,"" and hints that whatever allowances are made to"
"him ""he will be a beggar."""
"In 1681 Sir Thomas Lynch was appointed to be Governor, and trouble at once"
began between him and his deputy. Amongst the charges the former brought
"against Morgan was one of his having been overheard to say, ""God damn the"
"Assembly!"" for which he was suspended from that body."
"In April, 1688, the King, at the urgent request of the Duke of Albemarle,"
"ordered Morgan to be reinstated in the Assembly, but Morgan did not live"
"long to enjoy his restored honours, for he died on August 25th, 1688."
"An extract from the journal of Captain Lawrence Wright, commander of"
"H.M.S. _Assistance_, dated August, 1688, describes the ceremonies held at"
"Port Royal at the burial of Morgan, and shows how important and popular a"
man he was thought to be. It runs:
"1915; H. Wildon Carr, _The Philosophy of B. Croce_, London, 1917. The"
"first is an able, but very cursory sketch; the second examines Croce's"
philosophy from the standpoint of neoscholasticism; the third is an
ample summary written by a distinguished writer well acquainted with
the various currents of modern thought. Each of them ought to be read
with a critical and discriminating eye.
"In the English-speaking world, Croce's fame rests emphatically on his"
"Ã¦sthetics, and its applications to literary criticism. His influence"
on English and American critical thought has already gone much deeper
than a mere list of writings on his theories would show; especially in
"England, his ideas are, so to speak, in the air, and appear in many"
writers who have no direct knowledge of his work. The best exposition
of this phase of his philosophy is to be found in E. F. Carritt's
"book, _The Theory of Beauty_, 1914, chap. XIV. The writings of A. B."
"Walkley, and of J. E. Spingam, contain the most vigorous prosecution"
"of his thought as applied, respectively, to English and to American"
scholarship and criticism.
"For the general history of Italian thought, to which many a reference"
"is made in the course of this book, the best helps, besides Croce's"
"essay on Vico, and B. Spaventa, _La filosofia italiana_, recently"
"reprinted, Bari, 1909, are the historical works of Giovanni Gentile,"
"and especially his _Storia della filosofia italiana_, Milano, n."
d. Gentile is one of the most profound and earnest modern European
"thinkers, and it is desirable that his theoretical works, similar in"
"tendency to, but widely divergent in temper from those of Croce, should"
"become better known to the Anglo-Saxon world. Two of his books, _La"
"Riforma dell' Educazione_ and _Teoria generale dello Spirito_, are soon"
to appear in English. Croce's judgment on Gentile's Actual Idealism is
"expressed in _Una discussione tra filosofi amici_, in _Conversazioni"
"Critiche_, II, pp. 67-95. But a complete understanding of the vital"
"foundling hospitals, apparently), in 1890 the total Swedish rate was"
"slightly below 1 to 10, while in Norway it was 1 to 14. The modern"
facilities for emigration have further affected conjugal habits.
"Latterly, however, there are evidences of a new growth of intelligent"
control.
In recent years the statistics of emigration and population tell a
fairly plain story. In Norway and Sweden alike the excess of births over
"deaths reached nearly its highest in 1887, the figures being 63,942 for"
"Sweden and 29,233 for Norway. In 1887, however, emigration was about its"
"maximum in both countries, 50,786 leaving Sweden and 20,706 leaving"
"Norway. Thereafter the birth-rate rapidly fell, and the emigration,"
"though fluctuating, has never again risen in Sweden to the volume of"
"1887-88, though it has in Norway. But when, after falling to 43,728 in"
"1892, the excess of Swedish births over deaths rises to 60,231 in 1895,"
"while the emigration falls from 45,000 in 1892 to 13,000 in 1894, it is"
clear that the lesson of regulation is still very imperfectly learned.
"Norway shows the same fluctuations, the excess of births rising from"
"23,600 in 1892 to nearly 32,000 in 1896, and again from 27,685 in 1908"
"to 29,804 in 1909, doubtless because of ups and downs in the harvests,"
"as shown in the increase of marriages from 12,742 in 1892 to 13,962 in"
1896.
In Denmark the progression has been similar. There the excess of births
"over deaths was so far at its maximum in 1886, the figures being 29,986"
"in a population of a little over 2,000,000; whereafter they slowly"
"decreased, till in 1893 the excess was only 26,235. All the while"
"emigration was active, gradually rising from 4,346 in 1885 to 10,382 in"
"1891; then again falling to 2,876 in 1896, when the surplus of births"
"over deaths was 34,181--a development sure to force more emigration. In"
"1911 the population was 2,775,076--a rapid rise; and in 1910 the surplus"
"of births over deaths was 40,110. The Scandinavians are thus still in"
"their independence (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 375, 376; Geijer, pp."
"50, 81, 89, 97, 103), so that they ultimately enabled Gustavus Vasa"
to throw off the Danish yoke. Yet they had at first refused to
"recognise him, being satisfied with their own liberties; and"
"afterwards they gave him much serious trouble (Otté, _Scandinavian"
"History_, 1874, pp. 228, 235; Geijer, pp. 109, 112, 115, 116, 118,"
"120-24). Slavery, too, was definitely abolished in Sweden as early"
"as 1335 (Geijer, pp. 57, 86; Crichton and Wheaton, i, 316, 333). As"
"regards the regal power, the once dominant theory that the Swedish"
"kings in the thirteenth century obtained a grant of all the mines,"
"and of the province of the four great lakes (Crichton and Wheaton,"
"i, 332), appears to be an entire delusion (Geijer, pp. 51, 52)."
Such claims were first enforced by Gustavus Vasa (_id._ p. 129). As
"regards the clergy, they appear from the first, _quâ_ churchmen, to"
"have been kept in check by the nobles, who kept the great Church"
"offices largely in the hands of their own order (Geijer, p. 109),"
though Magnus Ladulas strove to strengthen the Church in his own
interest (_id._ pp. 52-53). Thus the nobles became specially
"powerful (_id._ pp. 50, 56, 108); and when in the fifteenth century"
"Sweden was subject to Denmark, they specially resented the"
"sacerdotal tyranny (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 356)."
"In Sweden, as in the other Scandinavian States, however, physical strife"
and mental stagnation were the ruling conditions. Down till the
"sixteenth century her history is pronounced ""a wretched detail of civil"
"wars, insurrections, and revolutions, arising principally from the"
"jealousies subsisting between the kings and the people, the one striving"
"to augment their power, the other to maintain their independence.""[670]"
"The same may be said of the sister kingdoms, all alike being torn and"
drained by innumerable strifes of faction and wars with each other. The
occasional forcible and dynastic unions of crowns came to nothing; and
"the Union of Calmar (1397), an attempt to confederate the three kingdoms"
"Beatae Mariae Virginis_"" among the many relics to be seen in the"
"Church of SS. Cosmo and Damiano, near the Forum."
[Sidenote: No Women Admitted.]
It is a curious illustration of Romish wrong-headedness that women
"are never allowed to enter the Chapel of St. Helena, in the Church"
"of S. Croce, except on the festival of the Saint, August 18th,"
"notwithstanding the fact that St. Helena herself was a woman, and that"
the church owes its existence to her and is also indebted to her for
"the piece of the true cross which it boasts, and which has given it its"
"name. So while men are permitted to go inside the chapel of St. Helena,"
women are stopped at the entrance and only allowed to peer through the
railing. The same degrading discrimination is made in the Church of S.
"Prassede (who also was a woman) as to entering the splendid chapel,"
"Orto del Paradiso, which contains the column of blood jasper to which"
"Christ was bound, and which was ""given by the Saracens to Giovanni"
"Colonna, cardinal of this church, and legate of the Crusade, because"
"when he had fallen into their hands and was about to be put to death,"
"he was rescued by a marvellous intervention of celestial light."""
Females are never allowed to enter this chapel except upon Sundays in
"Lent, but are permitted to look at the relic through a grating.[12]"
[Sidenote: Four Other Stones of Great Interest.]
The mention of this column reminds me of the two columns in the Church
"of S. Maria Transpontina, on the other side of the Tiber, near St."
"Peter's, which bear inscriptions stating that they were the pillars to"
"which St. Peter and St. Paul were fastened, respectively, when they"
suffered flagellation by order of Nero. A little farther on towards
"St. Peter's is the Piazza Scossa Cavalli, with a pretty fountain."
"""Its name bears witness to a curious legend, which tells how when S."
"lock the Pope into his chamber, and take the key with her!"" She finally"
"""deserted him on his death-bed, making off with the accumulated spoils"
"of his ten years' papacy, which enabled her son, Don Camillo, to build"
"the Palazzo Doria Pamfili, in the Corso, and the beautiful Villa Doria"
"Pamfili,"" west of the Janiculan Hill. This villa, with its casino,"
"garden, lake, fountain, pine-shaded lawns and woods, and its fine view"
"of St. Peter's standing out against the green Campagna beyond, and"
"the blue Sabine mountains in the distance, is to this day one of the"
"loveliest villas in Italy, and the favorite resort of the latter-day"
Romans and visitors to their city on the two afternoons of the week on
which it is open to pedestrians and two-horse carriages.
"The notorious Simony practiced by the popes, in which, as we have just"
"seen, Olympia became such an adept, gave rise to the biting Latin"
couplet--
"""An Petrus Romæ fuerit, sub judice lis est;"
"Simonem Romæ nemo fuisse negat."""
Some of the modern methods of making use of the Pope for purposes
of gain are less objectionable than those of Olympia. Dr. Alexander
"Robertson, in his _Roman Catholic Church in Italy_, just published,"
"says: ""One of the very latest novelties of the 'Pope's Shop' is a"
penny-in-the-slot blessing machine. Specimens of this were lately to be
"seen in the Corso, Rome, about half way between the Piazza Colonna and"
"the Piazza del Popolo. A penny is dropped into it. The cinematograph,"
"or wheel of life, goes round, when, lo! there appears a long procession"
"of richly clothed cardinals and monsignori, and then the Pope in a"
"sedan chair, accompanied by his Swiss Guards. As he is carried past"
"the spectator, he turns towards the window of his chair, a smile"
"overspreads his face, he raises his hands, and gives his blessing. On"
these machines there is an inscription to the effect that the blessing
Spanish Governor has never been decided. After three weeks the buccaneers
"started back on their journey to San Lorenzo, with a troop of 200"
"pack-mules laden with gold, silver, and goods of all sorts, together with"
a large number of prisoners. The rearguard on the march was under the
"command of a kinsman of the Admiral, Colonel Bledry Morgan."
"On their arrival at Chagres the spoils were divided, amidst a great deal"
"of quarrelling, and in March, 1671, Morgan sailed off to Port Royal with a"
"few friends and the greater part of the plunder, leaving his faithful"
"followers behind without ships or provisions, and with but £10 apiece as"
their share of the spoils.
"On May 31st, 1671, the Council of Jamaica passed a vote of thanks to"
"Morgan for his successful expedition, and this in spite of the fact that"
"in July, a year before, a treaty had been concluded at Madrid between"
"Spain and England for ""restraining depredations and establishing peace"" in"
the New World.
"In April, 1672, Morgan was carried to England as a prisoner in the"
"_Welcome_ frigate. But he was too popular to be convicted, and after being"
"acquitted was appointed Deputy Governor of Jamaica, and in November, 1674,"
he was knighted and returned to the West Indies. In 1672 Major-General
"Banister, who was Commander-in-Chief of the troops in Jamaica, writing to"
"Lord Arlington about Morgan, said: ""He (Morgan) is a well deserving"
"person, and one of great courage and conduct, who may, with His Majesty's"
"pleasure, perform good public service at home, or be very advantageous to"
"this island if war should again break forth with the Spaniards."""
While Morgan was in England he brought an action for libel against William
"Crooke, the publisher of the ""History of the Bucaniers of America."" The"
result of this trial was that Crooke paid £200 damages to Morgan and
published a long and grovelling apology.
"Herrick, who studied his own dreams for many months, found that the"
"essential element is the emotional, and not the ideational, and that,"
"indeed, when recalled _at once_, with closed eyes and before moving,"
they were nearly devoid of intellectual content (_Journal of Comparative
"Neurology_, vol. iii. p. 17, 1893). R. MacDougall considers that dreaming"
is 'a succession of intense states of feeling supported by a minimum of
"ideational content,' or, as he says again, more accurately, 'the feeling"
is primary; the idea-content is the inferred thing' (_Psychological
"Review_, vol. v. p. 2). Grace Andrews, who kept a record of her dreams"
"(_American Journal of Psychology_, October 1900), found that dream"
emotions are often stronger and more vivid than those of waking life; 'the
dream emotion seems to me the most real element of the dream life.' P.
"Meunier, again ('Des Rêves Stéreotypés,' _Journal de Psychologie Normale"
"et Pathologique_, September-October 1905), states that 'the substratum of"
a dream consists of a cœnæsthesia or an emotional state. The intellectual
"operation which translates to the sleeper's consciousness, while he is"
"asleep, this cœnæsthesia or emotional state is what we call a dream.']"
[Footnote 88: The night-terrors of children have frequently been found
to have their origin in gastric or intestinal disturbance. Graham Little
"brings together the opinions of various authorities on this point,"
though he is himself inclined to give chief importance to heart disease
"producing slight disturbances of breathing, since he has found that"
in nearly two-thirds of his cases (17 out of 30) night-terrors were
"associated with early heart disease (Graham Little, 'The Causation of"
"Night-Terrors,' _British Medical Journal_, 19th August 1899). It should"
be added that night-terrors are more usually divided into two classes:
"(1) idiopathic (purely cerebral in origin), and (2) symptomatic (due to"
"reflex disturbance caused by various local disorders); see _e.g._ Guthrie,"
"'On Night-Terrors,' _Clinical Journal_, 7th January 1899. J. A. Symonds"

I love you.
Bye!
What are you doing?
I'm brushing.
No!
No!
It's nasty!
No!
Ok!
Fine!
Hold on!
Just hold on.
Why is it so hard today?
It's your period isn't it?
"Oh yeah, hold on."
How did you know?
We have the same cycle.
Oh yeah.
What dress are you going to wear?
Who's the designer?
I didn't pick one yet.
You'll look good in anything.
Really?
Thank you.
What are you thinking?
You?
I...
Umm...
Right there.
Did the construction in Bang Bae pass?
What?
Let me see.
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.
"Mr. Heisenberg, I presume."
Time to move?
Not till we see the exchange.
"No, no."
"Oh, shit!"
- What?
- Now he shows.
"Okay, let's do this."
"No, no."
"Oh, my God."
Jimmy is on the wrong bench.
Crap!
We're screwed!
What are you doing?
"Hey, what are you doing?"
I don't get it.
What's the holdup?
"Where's the stuff, man?"
- Where are we going?
- Just shut up.
Get out.
Go stop him.
The DEA is right there.
"If they see me, we're screwed."
Get out.
I'll do something.
- What?
- Just go!
Get your cold beer!
Right over here!
I'll tell you when!
"Come on, Nelson!"

Anything wrong with the view?
Break it up!

"All right, boys, break it up!"
Get him!

I knew it!
You fink!
Break it up!

- Okay.
- Please just get this off me.
- Okay.
Lift.
- Don't get it on my hair.
Yeah.
"I won't, I won't, I won't."
There you go.
There you go.
Okay.
We got it off.
There we go.
- And my shorts.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
Okay.

We got this.

There we go.

[Wren] I can't.
Here I come.
Here I come.
Here I come.
- I'm not doing anything.
- Ohh!
Get out of the way!
Just pivot out!
Pivot... come on.
That's not gonna help you.
What do you want to do?
You tell me.
"I mean, we could do mitts."
"We could just hit the mitts, or you can learn how to fight."
Got it.
Move.
Breathe and move.
Don't cross your feet.
Turn it over.
Turn it over.
- Turn it over.
- Okay.
Good.
Hook.
Come on.
"Ah, ah."
You're loading up on me.
You're loading up on me.
All I need is this... boop.
- Nice and easy.
"- Okay, sorry."
"Okay, don't apologize."
Right hand.
You think you're smarter.
Don't you?
- No.
You want to manipulate me.
You're playing stupid games.
I love you.
Eva.
No.
You don't.
You don't love anyone.
You don't know what it means to love.
Hello.
Kevin.
Hello.
Mr Thomas.
How are you?
- Fine.
You have my order?
- Yes.
We didn't have any Kefir Lyofi left.
only Bulgarian Lyofi.
You like Bulgarian?
- Yes.
Fine.
Are you sure?
If not.
I'll take it back.
And we'll send you some later.
No.
Bulgarian is fine.
OK.
Then.
Lift.
"Pull, gentlemen, pull."
"Come on, gentlemen, put your backs into it, we can move this."
Pull.
Lift it!
"- Come on, gentlemen."
- Pull!
Pull!
That's it.
That's it.
Go!
Go!
She's coming.
- She's moving.
That's good.
That's good.
- Yes.
It's moving.
"Now, gently, slowly, slowly."
That's good.
That's good.
Excellent work.
"Keep it going, keep it going."
Pull.
Pull.
HOWARD:
Good work.
"Keep lifting it, Pecky, come on."
Another foot and we can tie it off.
Now tie it off.
Tie it off.
Have you ever seen anything more beautiful?
If you're wrong...
I betrayed him.
I...
I understand it.
I... [beep]
Any action?
Well...
Huh.
You have no idea.
"When I was a young man,"
"I used to piss, it was like a river."
Coffee?
There you go.
It's on the house.
[clicking]
[phone rings] [ring]
What?
"Oh, good."
"Well, I certainly look forward to meeting her."
Hi.
Oh!
[chatter]
What the fuck do you want?
[chatter]
Don't fucking talk to me like that.
Fuck!
You know what?
You just leave the fucking bar.
I'm j...
Which one?
Fuck you.
"Yeah, fuck you."
Just go.
Where'd he go?
Where the hell'd he go?
Wait.
Got him.
Looks like it's going down.
Take 'em!
Freeze.
Right there.
Don't move!
That's there.
Let's go.
Jesus.
I think they bought it.
Absolutely.
"Textbook bust, sir."
"Yes, sir."
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
And Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.
Hey.
"You weren't home, so"
I let the delivery guys in.
I hope that's okay.
Absolutely.
So you bought a bed.
Yes.
What is that?
A king?
Pillow top?
Oh.
"Ooh, OK."
Hello.
- Hello.
"You spoke to a friend of ours, Mitchell, about..."
- This must be Adam.
Yeah.
"Oh, come inside, young man."
Wipe your feet.
- Right.
Richard!
"Well, well, well, well!"
"So, this is young Adam?"
"Oh, but look at you!"
"Darling, fetch the decanter."
Oh.
"Oh, not for me."
I'm driving.
This is nice.
"Oh, Richard, I told you to use the Waterford."
"Oh, is that not it?"
"Oh, well."
"Here we are, there you go."
Right.
Drawn just an hour ago.
There you go.
- Soon put you straight.
"- Oh, that's the ticket."
- There we go.
- Oh.
- All better now?
- Course he is.
What're you doing?
What're YOU doing?
I was in my hut and there was that flash...
I saw it!
I came to check it out.
Not again!
What're you doing?
Let's go!
It's a ball...
That's obvious.
What do we do?
"Yusuki, you touch it."
It's fine.
Just touch it.
Don't.
We don't know what it is.
You're all useless.
Stop!
Don't!
Leave it!
What is it?
Tetra meets Yusuki.
Tetra?
Tetra waited for you.
"Toshi, can I take it home?"
Why you?
"Please, please"
Yusuki is our robot freak.
It's gotta be him.
- Shall we let him?
- Can I?
Really?
Come on.
Come on.
There's no one up here.
Take your shirt off.
Come on.
"Come on, take it off."
What are you scared of?
You scared of me?
- Just let me go.
- It's me.
Leonard.
- Don't touch me.
- Let's have some fun.
Wanna have some fun?
Wanna be safe out there?
- I won't say nothing.
- Strip down for your commanding officer!
I don't like this.
Get away!
Wake up.
You're having a bad dream.
You're having a bad dream.
Wake up.
- Get away.
Get away from me!
- What are you doing?
"- Maggie, stop."
- Get off of me!
I hate you!
- Help me!
Help me.
- Shut up.
I think it'd be a neat idea.
"- Stand up, Josh."
- OK.
- I'm gonna show you how to take a punch.
- I know how to take a punch.
I'm gonna show you the right way to take a punch.
"OK, hit me."
- Where?
- Right in my stomach.
"Hit me as hard as you can, just at my stomach."
That wasn't as hard as I can.
I know.
I hope not.
Hit me again.
Harder.
Seriously.
"- Yeah, OK."
- Go.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Harder?
- Go.
Harder.
I'm fine.
"What I did was essentially, breathing is key."
"- Think of it as, like..."
- Just hit me.
"- All right, you ready?"
OK.
- Yeah.
One...
Two...
"Well, I think I'll be off."
Why?
"I don't confuse you, do I, lvy?"
"I believe I do confuse you, don't I?"
I ain't confused by nobody.
Let go.
Do you hear?
Let go.
"Let go, you hear?"
"- What's he doing, lvy?"
"- Oh, you let go too!"
"Watch out, lvy love."
"- Here, here."
What's this all about?
- It's him.
He insulted her.
"- He's lying, I tell you!"
- He tried to break her arm.
"- He did, did he?"
"- Yes, yes."
Tried to break her arm.
You will?
You want another one?
No!
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
"I'll stop it, sir."
"Hey, boys!"
"Now, boys!"
"Boys, will you...?"
I can't understand what happened.
Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
"- Jimmy, over here!"
- Hey!
"- Hey, Tillie."
- Dammit!
- Did he see us?
Is he coming back?
- Forget it.
- What's up?
- Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
- I didn't expect this to happen.
"- Yeah, sure!"
We've only got 50 yards to the bottom.
"Now, let's move."
- Come on!
- I can't move.
- What?
- I can't move.
"All right, let me look."
It's probably broken.
Great!
"- Here, take one of these."
- What is it?
- A pain pill.
- I don't want it.
- Shut up and take it.
- I don't want it!
Now I'll have to think of something else.
We're going to lower you down.
I saved my job.
That's good.
But how?
"Well, last night I showed my work."
I will be promoted soon.
Congratulations.
So today's dinner is your treat.
Okay?
Done.
Tell Carol as well.
Cool.
How did you come here?
"Wow, Carol!"
It's amazing!
I also feel like doing something.
Shall I go for a shoulder massage?
Very funny.
Go out.
We will meet for dinner.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
We will meet for dinner.
But what about lunch?
I am very busy right now.
I can't.
Please go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Give me some money then.
What?
Here we go.
Hey.
"Yeah, baby."
[Laughing]
We are the champions
My friends

Till the end
Damn the torpedoes!
Full speed ahead!

We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
"- So far, so good."
Let's go.

[Loud Crashing]
I'm not gonna look.
- I think that's a good idea.
- Yup.
[ Chattering ]
"- Easy, easy."
- I got it.
Let's get him up.
"- Dick, where's the ticket?"
- [ Moans ]
- Answer me.
- He can't.
He's been sedated.
Why did you do that?
Here.
Why do you still go home?
What have you been doing?
Sleeping.
Reading.
Waiting.
What for?
You taste of sleep.
You taste of car.
New car?
- Want to take a look?
- Later.
- Wait... the car.
- Later.
Are you driving?
Are you kidding?
I'm drunk.
"Well, then you've got a long way to go."
What's wrong?
"I want to come, too."
Don't start that again.
I'm frightened.
Why?
In case she doesn't come back.
Listen.
Lizzy will get well again.
That's why I'm taking her to the vet.
Anyone there?
Come on.
Just one more hour.
I can tell you're still tired.
Luis to Dad.
Look at you!
And the other students?
Haven't seen them since the dojo closed.
Watch it!
We've grown up.
It must be hard for you.
Look what happened to Iwai.
Stay in touch.
Where do you want this?
Over there.
hello.
Ni Hao.
Fried rice please.
It's a busy day!
Better than playing soccer.
You're right.
Teacher!
Teacher?
What teacher?
Teacher!
I know you're here.
You can't go in there.
Fried rice!
The soup's coming!
It's Rin!
Welcome back!
Teacher!
"Teacher, the dojo?"
Did you go?
It's in ruins.
What happened?
You must be starving!
That's all right.
- Did I hurt you?
"- No, you didn't spill a drop."
- I guess...
- That's funny?
I guess it's funny.
Do you think we could turn the TV off?
That's better.
- We have to relax.
- I agree.
- How are classes?
- Going well.
- And your book?
- The outline is actually...
It's coming along.
It's almost there.
It's not at all what I expected.
It's harder than I thought.
But I'll...
I'm sure that I'll get there.
I want you to get there.
What did you say?
- Rose.
- Talk to me.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, no."
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Rose."
"- No, no, no."
"- Yes, yes, yes."
I don't want to do this!
"I'm sorry, Rose."
- Say yes to me.
Come here.
- Yeah.
All right.
Here we go.
"- Hey, hey!"
I couldn't find it.
- Come here.
What?
I couldn't find a phone.
I couldn't find a phone anywhere.
I couldn't find a phone.
Come here.
Come on.
"All right, listen."
"You go in there, and you find a phone."
"You call 911, and you stay here till help gets here."
You understand?
Go!
Let's go!
You all right?
"Hey, hey!"
"Hey, buddy!"
- I sang it four times.
- I knew you could do it.
"Hey, stay awake!"
You gotta stay awake for me.
"Come on, you gotta stay awake!"
"All right, this will do the trick."
We'll use this jack to get your leg out.
So are you a Cubs fan?
Yeah?
"Um, not enough... natural light."
Thank you.
This is it.
What's up?
- She's in there.
- Yeah.
"Okay, whatever happens..."
- Good luck.
"- Yeah, man, you too."
"All right, mother-frickin' Avon calling."
"Let's meet Julia and her husband, John."
"John, you love your wife a lot, right?"
Just a minute.
All right.
Yeah?
That'll be $16.75.
- Here you go.
- Great.
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
Do you know this woman?
Are you kidding me?
She's my wife.
No way.
Is she dead?
- What?
- No.
"- No, wait."
"- Hold on, hold on."
"We want to ask you some questions, please."
Open this door...
No!
No!
No!
Mayawati Chowtala's information can never be wrong!
Tek Chand!
- Come on!
"Tell me, Albert."
Where is the bomb?
He is a child.
What will he know?
Get lost!
We don't even know who he is!
There is no bomb here!
- Who are you?
There is a bomb!
Which bomb?
- The one whose battery is this!
Which battery?
- For the remote!
Oh no!
This is not a bomb's remote!
- Then what remote is this?
This is a TV remote!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Where is the TV?
- There is no TV!
TV..
We have the remote.
We have to buy the TV.
- We will buy it later.
Again.
Aah!
Come on.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Again.
Good.
Just get that elbow up.
Over the shoulder.
Good.
- Aah!
- Nice.
Good.
[Clippers buzzing]
"What the fuck, man?"
"Would you go in a stall or something, please?"
I'm almost done.
[Buzzing stops]
"High and tight, per the lady's request."
Ooh-ah!
So...
"Young man, why are you here?"
I have a tennis lesson.
"Mm, ha, ha, ha, ha."
Very funny.
Very funny.
"You're supposed to be healing up, Nate."
I feel fine.
"You know, eat, drink."
- What's the rush?
- I have a fight.
Who with?
A guy Juan hooked me up with.
You all got it?
Get out there.
You know you can do this.
"Let's go, girls."
One-two-three...
Panthers!
TAMl:
That's you.
"All right, girls!"
That's what I'm talking about!
"All right, keep it together!"
Keep it together!
"You had fun, right?"
Good job!
Good job!
How about that?
So what?
"They're like, what?"
One and seven now?
Why you got to be like that for?
Mom is one and one!
The team is one and seven.
It's one and 0!
One for one!
Ready?
Hey.
"What's up, boys?"
"Let's just get this over with, all right?"
Here's your money.
"How you doing, Billy?"
It's good to see you.
"All right, it's all there."
- I do?
- Yeah.
Would it be OK with you if we still just sit here for a while?
As long as you want.
The kids wake you up?
No.
I just couldn't sleep.
You want to talk?
No.
"It's all right, Joe."
You don't have to stay up.
You'll get through this.
Everyone's so mad at me.
"Mom, Kitty, Uncle Saul."
I don't have you.
You know?
I'm right here.
- Justin.
"- Hey, Mom."
Justin.
- I'm fine.
- Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm just exhausted.
- OK.
- Hey.
I told Tyler it would be all right if she waited here.
I'll give you guys privacy.
I'll be upstairs if you need me.
- All right.
I love you.
I'm OK.
"Alice, I love you."
Just you and me.
"And we'll see how it turns out, yes?"
Just let me get the hell out.
"What, just you going?"
"Well, turn around."
Hi dear.
Nice to see you!
Hi.
Enjoy the party.
Thank you.

Hold on one second.
I'm just gonna--

Where?
"No, I can't hear you."
There a lot of people there?
Yeah.
"I guess, like, 15, 20 or so."
Shrimp cocktail and something else.
"No, I didn't see any crab cakes."
-Do you want to come up?
-No.
I probably won't.
No.
"No, stay."
"Yeah, yeah, I'm sure."
Okay.
I will.
I promise.
Were you trailing me?
Maybe.
Why didn't you catch up to me?
Sara?
I was sublimating you.
You're not meant to be in a band.
You're meant to work in a bank.
And everything else is happening.
I'm not usually so aggressive.
-I don't believe that.
-I'm not.
I just....
Holy crap.
That was...
Holy crap!
"All right, that bought us some time."
"But they'll be back, and there'll be more of them."
And it won't be near as easy next time.
Easy?
You thought that was easy?
Jake.
Dad?
Clear the table!
Clear it!
Clear it!
I'm gonna go get Kenchy.
Get my mom!
We'll need towels.
And some antiseptic and some alcohol.

That's...
Tommy?
"Tommy, mate."
Tommy.
"Oh, fuck."
"Don't do this to me, Tommy."
Tommy!
All up!
Don't let them see me like this.
Rose and Frankie.
- I'm serious.
- All right.
"OK, OK."
He's in the hospital.
I'm off to see him now.
"Well, I'm not going."
OK.
If he thinks having a heart attack can make up for...
"Well, he can think again."
Maybe you should go and see him.
- Why?
- I don't know.
You never know when you'll see him again.
Like I care.
What if something happens?
What if it was the last time?
- I'll see you later.
- No... you won't.
"- I will, I promise."
- No.
"I mean, I don't want to."
Oh...
"What's gotten into you, fella?"
Oh.
"- Oh, I see."
- [Barks]
"[Eric] Are you OK, miss?"
I'm sorry if this knucklehead scared you.
"He's harmless really, uh..."
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?
[Max barks]
We have met.
I knew it.
"You're the one, the one I've been looking for."
What's your name?
What's wrong?
What is it?
You can't speak?
Oh!
"Oh, then you couldn't be who I thought."
- [Sighs] - [Sighs]
What is it?
You're hurt?
"No, no."
You need help?
"Whoa, whoa, careful!"
"Careful, easy."
"Gee, you must have really been through something."
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll help you.
Come on.
Come on.
"Hey, uh..."
I'm sorry you kids had to see that.
"But, uh... it's a hard life on the rails."
"Yup, yup, so true."
So wise.
You should teach a class.
Bye!
I should.
You guys sure you don't want any more juice?
We don't want any more juice.
"Get out of here, Ethan."
"Okay, okay."
"See you next week, Rudy."
We cool?
"Yeah, yeah."
We're cool.
Just go.
All right.
Doesn't sound like we're cool.
We're cool!
"Okay, bye."
"Everybody, open your mouths."
Delicious.
It's so delicious.
"Num, num, num..."
Pace yourself.
Pace yourself.
Who are you?
I know we've met.
You're embarrassing me.
"All right, Rick."
Stop stalling.
"Oh, no!"
We don't want any today.
- Don't want any what?
- I don't know who you are.
- (Whispers) Go away!
- Of course you know who I am.
- I don't!
(Go away!
)

You haven't forgotten the other night?
You got me out of bed!
"Well, didn't you?"
"Don't, Bill."
No!

"Don't, please, Bill!"
"Bill, please!"
Don't!
Please...
Bill!
"Please, come here!"
All right.
All right.
"I'll leave him alone, and I'll tell you for why."
We're through!
Finished!
Finito!
Understand?
"Good afternoon, sir."
(Upper class accent) Good afternoon.
I'm having a day's rough shooting and want some bullets.
Yeah.
Sure.
I'm down.
Totally cool.
We can just bypass the whole little coffee thing.
Yeah right.
Kind of awkward yeah...
I know.
Wash?
Hola!
Wash?
No I didn't pee on my hands.
Yo mama.
Hey did you see ZACH?
He's over there in the corner booth.
Ah no I didn't see him.
Did you see JP?
Yep.
I saw him.
He looks really hot tonight.
Did you talk to him?
Did you just say he looks hot?
Sorry it was really tacky.
Wasn't it?
So what's the deal with you and ZACH?
Have you guys ever hooked up before?
ZACH?
- Yep.
"Um, no not really."
Seriously?
"Yeah seriously, why are you asking?"
I just can't believe you've never hooked up with him before.
Call my assistant to set up a meeting.
Know what?
I'm good.
"Besides, I think your next picture's gonna be a prison drama."
"- Hey, still pissed at me?"
- Yep.
"Oh, come on."
I'll make it up to you the next time I'm in town.
You better.

Happy Birthday.

- Maybe.
But I've no wheels.

I've got pussy going.
You'll have to take 10 grams minimum.
- We'll take 20.
If we go now.
- That'll be 2500 in cash.
- I haven't got it.
- We haven't got that much.
Then I can't help you.
Here.

So we'll skip class tomorrow and go hiking?
I was kind of hoping to give my legs a day off.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
I know this off-leash trail.

My pug.

Ten rounds of jumping jacks!

He's in the kitchen with Nicole's mom.
"OK, those two fingers on those..."
That...
Yeah.
Second fret.
Your pinky goes on the third fret there.
Hit it.
Hit again.
Where the hell did he go?
"Oh, wait."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Got him.
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.
Freeze!
"Hey, right there."
Don't move.
"Come on, let's get him up."
Jesus!
I think they bought it.
Absolutely.
"Textbook bust, sir."
"Yes, sir."
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
"Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?"
James Kilkelly.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.
Hey.
"You weren't home, so I let the delivery guys in."

So you bought a bed.
Yeah.
"What is that, a king?"
Pillow top?
"Oh, my God."
You really are a chemistry teacher.
You mind?
About me.

Good morning.
Welcome to kindergarten.
I couldn't feel stupider.
I graduated magna cum laude.
Obviously not from art school.
- How long do we have to do this?
"- What, you don't like art therapy?"
"Nice, Edward."
I see you've chosen to draw a house.
- Is this your childhood home?
"- Yeah, that's where I was born."
"No, no, no, no."
Fired?
"Wait, no."
Don't fire him.
Look.
See?
I'm moving it.

Not now.
Okay?
Come on.
"It's too late, Billy."
I'm sorry.
I'm apologizing.
Mr. Logan has been terminated.
I don't want him back in the building.
You make sure you get his security pass and keys.
Get him out of here!
Stan.
Listen to me.
"It was my fault, too."
I tripped over the cable.
I...
"Natalie, this is not about you."
I've been warning this guy all summer.
"Come on, people!"
Let's get that stage reset.
Make it look good.

"Breathe, damn it!"
"All right, here we go."
Come here.
Help me out.
"Get him up, get him up."
I got him.
I got him.

Possible fracture to the left lower extremity.
Don't jostle him.
He's hypothermic.
You can cause an arrhythmia.
I'm Dr. Ross.
I work in County ER.
I need a number six ET tube.
There we go.

- Nobody has done nothing.
What?
- What did you say?
- No a. ..
- You have triggered the alarm?
You can't tell me I'm not paying for it.
What do you want?
"Coke, speed, anything."
You might as well have the good stuff.
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Leave me.
Just get away from here.
Get help.
Get help.
"Paul, Paul, Paul..."
"Stop being so bloody noble, okay?"
Fuck!
"Help me, please!"
"Make an effort, Paul, please!"
"Hey, Mr. Gimp."
"Hey, Mr. Gimp."
"Still got one bullet left, soldier boy."
Use it.
Good idea.
You're magnificent.
I'm not finished yet.
Let's just go.
I want a word with Felix first.
He's crippled now.
He's bloody paralysed.
Just let him be.
"- Wait in the car, Paul."
I won't be long
"- No, no."
"Just go, please."
We've got to be going now.
See you later.
Look at the way she walks.
That is bad.
"That is very, very bad."
Are you running away?
No.
What are you doing?
I'm organizing the fund-raiser.

Are you crazy?
You're getting carried away.
I'm just a goon-on-hire for father.
Goon!
If he finds out he'll sell his property... and give me my final payment.
I know my father.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Father's self respecting.
He'll be stubborn.
Go on.
Tell him you got out of jail on your own.
Go.
Why?
What about your happiness?
Your feelings?

All I want is to get water what else?

Thanks.
"All he knows, it went dark."
"If he'd have turned around, Frank, they'd have hanged us for it."
"And something, something put that cop there."
"It's an act of God, those lights went out."
Don't look back.
-What?
-Don't look back.
It's a cop.
-His red light's on.

Are you guys like girlfriends?
Maybe.
You look like you could be sisters.
- Maybe we're sisters and girlfriends.
"- Yeah, that'd be pretty cool."
But that's pretty unlikely.
- How old are you guys anyways?

Ok?
Come on.

Where is she?
Fine.
"Elias, let's make a deal."
I'll play along again.
I'll talk to Lukas again.
Lukas will be alive.
"I'll make you both breakfast, put out your clothes."
"We'll do things, like before."
But you have to believe me that I'm your mom.
You won't really do that.
I promise.
Elias...
It's not your fault Lukas died.
The accident wasn't your fault.
Do you really believe her?
Hmm?
Hmm?
She's lying.
Let her prove she's our mom.
What am I doing?
What's Lukas doing?
But I can't see him!
What's he doing?
Elias...
Mom would know that.
Mom could see him.
She'd know what he's doing.
"No, Elias."
Don't!
"Elias, don't!"

It's the way I talk.
"""Talk."" See?"

No!
No!
- Artie.
- Yeah.
"Oh, my God. okay, we have to get you to a hospital."
Wh--what did you do to yourself?
"Well, it was the only way I knew how to get the sword."
What if we didn't get here in time?
"Yeah, I thought you would."
"So just--right now, could you just hurry up,"
Pull it out?
Wait.
Wait.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
Now wait a minute.
Are you sure?
"Yeah, it's the sharpest sword ever made."
It should slide out just like butter.
"Just--just do it really, really, really, really fast."
Okay!
Not like butter!
You all right?
"You'll be back on Monday, right?"
Not for three weeks?
Thailand?

Say hi to dad.
'Bye.
I want to cancel my card.
It got stolen tonight.
Where is your friend?
Just get it over with.
Stay down.
Is that all you've got?
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Fine.
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.
I've felt weird lately.
Are you feeling better now?
It was a crazy night.
Maybe too crazy.
What happened to your face?
Nothing I didn't ask for.
It's Marc.
There's an after-party at Peter Skjoldmark's.
Maybe we should just stay here.
I'm quite tired.
Marc's got coke.
Come on.
I'll look after you.
Can I come back to your place afterwards?
I can't go home.
I think that's enough excitement for today.
"Thank you, Adam."
It's so kind of you.
This way.
Mind your head.
[Cranking motor]
[Exhales]
Perhaps we should phone Mr. Bennett.
Certainly not.
Is the choke full out?
I don't know.
Oh...
Ursula.
There's the choke.
"Now, come on, old girl."
[Engine starts]
[Footsteps]
I've got a job for you.
You put the peel in here and the spuds in here.
"You have done this before, haven't you?"
No.
You put the peel in here and the spuds in here.
"""Spuds""?"
Yes.
"Proper name is potato, but we call them spuds."
Potato.
Potato!
Oh.
[Speaks Polish]
What?
[Repeats word]
Right.
"Catch that brat, be quick!"
- Whom do you mean?
-That Major!
Be quick!
I was at the door.
Nobody came in or out.
Nobody?
"You slept on duty, didn't you?"
No.
Nobody came in.
The second post.
We're clear.
There is nobody here.
The third post.
We're clear.
"Really, Igor Alexandrovitch..."
Nobody came in.
Get out of here!
This is me!
Igor?
What...
Where are you going?
Stop!
Stop!
Igor!
It's fine.
We need to backdate the papers for title to the mega-centre in your name.
What for?
We need to backdate the papers in your name!
Calm down please.
It's all right.
They won't get anything.
- You did?
- I sold flowers pretending to be blind.
"Helene, you have to tell her."
Jorgen doesn't want us to.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Here comes breakfast.
It turns out I was hungry after all.
May I see?
You look so beautiful.
You're so lovely.
"Yes, you are."
And you're so soft.
And you smell so nice.
I forgot your juice.
That's all we needed.
That dumb juice.
I'm sorry...
There.
Jacob.
Right there.
- There.
- Thank you.
"Jorgen, here you go."
Thanks.
Does anyone have a pen?
Thanks.
"Anna signed yesterday, so now I'm a poor man."
Almost.
- Your daughter is here.
- Anna?
Then show her in.
Hey!
Where did he go?
Jong-gu!
I gotta catch him.
Gotta catch that bastard.
Catch that bastard.
I can't believe this...
- Gotta save my baby.
- Come on.
Let's go down.
I gotta save my little girl.
- We'll get him.
"- I've gotta find him, and save my baby."
"- Don't worry, we will."
- Okay?
"Get your act together, man."
We gotta save her.
"I know, man."
I know.
I have to save my daughter...
"Come on, man."
I have to catch that bastard.
"Don't cry, man."
"Dammit, Jong-gu!"

Shit!
Was that a person?

You okay?
This has got to be Air...
Airdrie?

What does that leave us?
That leaves this Igle down the bottom .
"Let's go for that now, and see what happens."
Bung that one in now.
And...
It might be the red herring.
What's going on down here?
Nigle?
50 seconds.
"No, that's not working, is it?"
I don't...
I'm wondering whether...
Aberdeen?
Aberdeen!
Aberdeen...
I think...
That would put... 30 seconds.
We'd have to have a lot wrong if it were going to be Aberdeen.
I think that's a red herring.
What's this Y for then?
Something-dray?
20 seconds.
Bay?
There's Ayr...
No.
Yeah!
"Yes, Ayr, yes."
You said that before.
"No, no!"
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!
Did I ever bust his balls?
I could've dropped a dime a million times.
Don't call the cops.
You're talking crazy.
You got money for that commercial!
You don't got my fucking money?
"Jimmy, he's gonna pay you."
I'll fucking kill you!
"Give me the money, cocksucker."
Pay me!
"He'll pay, he'll pay."
Morrie's.
Who's this?
He's here.
"Jimmy, I'm sorry."
You should be sorry.
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!
You hear me?
Give me the fucking money!
I'll give you....
"You've got it, kid."
"You've got it, believe me."
"Karen, slow down."
Where?
Stay there.
Don't move.
"It's Karen, Jimmy."
What happened?
What happened?
That's him.
"Wong Fei-hung, I'm not afraid of you!"
You're not?
How about this?
It's time to build up your confidence!
"Relax, follow me."
- Lock him up!
- Yes!
"Marshal, which one?"
"- Numbskull, the one behind you!"
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Nothing to do with you.
Excuse me!
You dare to retaliate?
!
Don't be afraid.
Fight!
- You bast...
"- Sorry, sorry, sorry!"
"Marshal, are you OK?"
Nifty footwork.
You ambushed me with your No Shadow Kick!
Give me my weapon!
Let me go!
Lift your leg.
You told me to lift my leg.
Here's a punch-bag.
You want to practise?
"- No, not really."

Um...

We cross paths.
I have a lot of work.
I have work too.
We managed before.
There's nothing.
If you want to talk...
I'm looking for Gilles.
Alain!
Gilles went to London.
Andrew knows Leslie's parents.
This is his place.
He's back for the trimester.
It wasn't planned.
His kids are coming.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
When did Gilles leave?
Last week.
I wrote him.
I know.
I don't have his address.
I'll forward the letter once I do.
- A number?
- We can't call him.
He calls.
You left Jean-René?
You can spend the night.
No thanks.
I'd rather not.
"Yes, please."
I'd be grateful for some fresh milk.
All right.
I'm disturbing you.
Don't worry.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."
What a fine house.
Make yourself at home.
is this Kakrahman's house?
No.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I was told to get milk from him.
It's next door.
Where is Kakrahman's house?
Next door.
"Sorry, I didn't understand."
It's next door.
Thank you very much.
is this Kakrahman's house?
Welcome.
Good luck.
I was sent here for milk.
Can you give me some?
Go down to the cellar...
Watch your head.
This way?
Go on down.
Mind your head.
All right.
Why is it so dark here?
"There's a hurricane lamp, it's not dark."
"Yeah, I'm always in a good mood."
Like when?
Like always.
Like the night you were born.
- And then... today.
- Yep.
Okay.
Off you go to school.
"Bye, darling."
I love you so much.
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye.
"See you later, alligator."

"Good morning, ladies."
What's wrong?
You're smiling.
What do you mean?
I always smile.
No.
No you don't.
"No, it's something else."
Wait a minute-- did you have sex?
"Marly, I think you're right."
"Look, her neck muscles have relaxed and she's not doing that crazy thing with her eyes."
Admit it.
Maybe I did... and maybe I didn't.
You did.
When did you get a boyfriend?
"You don't need a boyfriend to have sex, Peggy Sue."
"Oh, yes."
Don't get angry!
Don't get angry!
"Batlya brother, you don't interfere."
"Look, you are like my younger son."
Yes.
That's why I am telling you.
Who killed your Hiralal?
We did it.
Now where did Hiralal hide the jewellery?
We don't know!
Tell me!
You know something.
Memory has become weak!
Which diamond?
What diamond?
What car?
"One, two, three."
- This was the one!
"One, two, three."
"One, two, three."
"Papa, they both are the one!"
Tell me!
Where is the diamond?
I don't know!
"Very good, Chandu!"
Don't tell him!
Even if you have to lay down your life!
Don't tell him!
Okay!

-Can.
Can't.
Can't.
Can't!
"I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!"
"-Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it."
"-All right, then, I will."
"Stand back, everyone!"
To infinity and beyond!
-Can!
-Whoa!
"Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!"
-I found my moving' buddy.

That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

Is it ready?
Yes.
Let's celebrate the reunion.
Where?
Come sit with me.
They're waiting for me.
I'm in a rush.
"So, don't forget:"
"- Tuesday, at ""3 Caïmans""."
- All right!
We'll have a good time.
- How much is it?
- 1200 FM.
Where are you going tonight?
"To the ""3 Caïmans""."
We could go together.
"You need to rest, you've had a hard day."
Sure!
There's always an excuse.
"- All right, then, get dressed!"
"This is a club, not a boxing ring."
The cunt walked right into us.
- Where's your booze?
- So you beat him up?
- You let too many losers in.
- He owns three restaurants.
I'm spending 30 grand here tonight.
I can beat up anyone I want.
Have we finished?
Come on.
"Hey, T!"
Send up a couple of bottles.
"Fuck, man."
- Fucking Paki.
- We taught him good.
- Hi.
"- What's up, Hanne?"
I was wondering...
can I have a line?
Help yourself.
- I'm in the mood now.
- For what?
A fuck.
- Who says I am?
- You were just now.
That was then.
But if you want you can give me a hand job.
- OK.
Where shall we go?
- Do it right here.
- Here?
- Hey?
Is this enough?
- Plenty.
And a donut or some churros.
Keep them lucid.
- And for you?
- Another beer.
I'd better not mix anymore.
"Well, okay."
Give me both.
- What time is it?
- Late.
Get up.
They gave us a car while they fix ours.
FAIR WAGES
I heard last night the girls wanted to leave town.
- People talk a lot when they drink.
- And go where?
Anywhere.
Their father wasn't very happy with them.
Rocio.
Give these gentlemen some wine.
Say when.
When.
- For you?
"- No, thank you."
Smells good.
What is it?
- River crabs.
- Spicy?
- So what now?
- Which is their bedroom?
May I?
She brought me some milk.
There.
Do you want me to give you some?
"No, thank you kindly."
She brought it for you.
I think Farhad dug Biston on his own.
Do you know him?
Yes.
"He's a local, he lives three miles away."
A local?
Well done.
But it wasn't Farhad who dug Biston.
I know.
Who then?
It was love.
The love of Shirin.
Bravo.
You know love too.
A man without love cannot live.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Where are you going?
"As usual, we're going to eat strawberries."
- Where's Jahan?
"- Sleeping, as usual."
You'll bring him back?
"You know, he doesn't eat strawberries."
Who called?
- Mrs Godarzi.
- What did she say?
Greetings.
She wanted news.
This is to make amends.
Around 7 grand.
I'll see you out.
"Thanks, Leo."
I won't forget.
"The guy you're looking for, Dragan."
I know where he is.
At a chick's place on Borrego St.
Don't ask how I know.

"This is dumb, Silien."
You got 3 weeks to do.
Watch the road.
Neat vodka.
You kept Dragan to yourself.
Was that wrong?
"Don't they say, it takes two to tango?"
We're not dancing anymore.
"Anyway, he was a bum lead."
How do you know?
I know.
That's all.
Silien here.
Not red.
"Ok, bye."
Hey.
Sounds like we got here just in time.
"How can we help, maid of honor?"
I am so late.

Make sure she makes it all the way to the elevator and out the front door.
Today's the big day!
"Ok, so the funny thing about pantyhose is, there isn't a... tag."
How do you tell which way...

You really can't with these things.
Hi.
Is there a beautiful bride in here?
"Oh, look at you."
Nice suit.
"Oh, shut up."
You're the one who looks beautiful.
It's your day.
Gosh.

Everything's all right. lt's all right. lt's okay.
"-Go, go..."
-Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
(breathing heavily)
-Did we do it?
-l think so.
-Will I die?
"-No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
(GRUNTlNG)
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Oh!
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.

It's just a matter of time.
"Well, that's great."

"Which door are you getting in, Bob?"
Oh.

Are you gonna roll my fat ass in here?
No.
Not if I can help it.
What does that mean?
Are you calling me fat?

Hold them in the Blue Room.
Maintain positions.
Keep the hallways clear.

No one goes anywhere till we lift the crash.

I gotta get her.

- We're on lockdown!
- Can't hear you!
You gotta be kidding me.
Movie time is over.
Shut this down!
Let's go.
"Bobby, sync watches, 60 seconds."
Silencer.
Let's go.
"- Say, if my wife answers, don't tell her."
- I won't.
- I'm getting this as a surprise for the family.
- I'm wise.
- Wait till you meet.
I got the cutest wife and kid you ever saw.
So long.
"Congratulations, Joe."
"Good luck, kid."
Good luck.
Congratulations.
I'm glad to see you get it.
Best to you.
"- Hey, Frank."
"Come here and meet out new foreman, Joe Dombrowski."
"- Nice going, Joe."
- Thank you.
He won't feel like going.
Best thing is to leave him alone.
He'll get over it.
"Oh, come on."
At least we can try and help him.
- Come on.
- All right.
"- Hey, anybody home?"
"Hello, Ed."
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Come on.
How about a movie?
"- No, thanks."
- Why don't you and Buddy go?
I seem to have left my keys in the lab.
You're gonna get it.
Who 's there?
Come on!
Stupid antenna.
Invaders from Mars!
Honey?
help!
help!
Stop!
help!
Don't you know better than to wander off at night alone?
What if something happened?
"I'm sorry, Mom."
Don't you ever do that to me again.
I was so scared.
I thought I'd lost you.
You won't believe this.
Something ate our TV antenna.
No!
I'm serious!
"It's not Sputnik, Iike Mr. Stutz thought."
"No, it's a robot!"
"No, really, it is!"
"And the robot, it's 1 00 feet high!"
And it eats metal!
Stop it!
Just...
... stop.
I'm not--
I'm not in the mood.
Come on.
You can't back out now.
Get the money for the ritual.
Where is she?
At home.
Where else would she be?
I asked the old lady next door to watch her.
You left her alone with a stranger?
Are you out of your minds?
Don't move.
Hyo-jin.
Baby.
- What's the matter?
- Oh my God!
Hyo-jin!
Hyo-jin!
Hyo-jin!
"Drop that, baby."
Don't cry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It'll be okay.
Quick!
Call 911!
This is all the work of that Jap.
"Ever since we went to his house, my body's been in pain."
I'm burning up.
I'm seeing things.
A man's face comes out of the wall.
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
I do!
I do!
All gone!
That's all... the next one!
Gé!
That's for Gerrit of course!
A real clodhopper's name.
Damn it!
"Christine, my girl..."
She's had...
She's been married twice!
She's been fucking married twice!
Why didn't you tell me?
What a god awful movie... I don't like nature films...
Gé... I've had Gé... I'll try Henk.
Hello Henky!
I'm the first talking goldfish.
Another one!
Another wedding?
She didn't tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
Three times why didn't you tell me?
Married three times...
What a mess!
I'd prefer porn!
I'm in there too...
"Tiddle-dee, tiddle-door, who is number four?"
"Christine, darling..."
What's this?
What are you doing here?
"Sorry, I thought you were Christine."
The back's the same.
Reason why should be showing her
Off in public anytime soon.
"OK, bye bye."
Sir.
Sir!
Yes?
You have to pay.
"No, no."
It's OK.
I'm a fireman.
With 62 truck.
We already don't get paid enough
As it is.
And God forbid this store catch
"On fire, I would be the one to"
Run in here and save all of you.
"So, I mean, I think"
The least that you can do is
"Offer me some free food, you"
"Know, as reward."
"OK, and buddy, that comb over,"
It's not fooling anyone.
"Good luck, God bless."
"Good night, new York."
"Hey, what's up, man?"
This your car?
"Yeah, it's cool, right?"
Sorry?
The car.
"It's cool, right?"
You know what color that is?
Copper.
.
I just got tired earlier.
Would you like me to take you home?
.
"That is if it's okay with you, Bela."
Don't worry about me.
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"Bela is beautiful, isn't she?"
Yes.
"Yes, and she's kind."
She's really kind.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
Not really but I just didn't know she was your ex.
Come on Joy!
"Joy, Joy..."
Listen to me.
Listen...
"Don't ever think about her, okay?"
She's gone.
"She's past, as in already erased."
It's gone.
And you...
You are my present and my future.
It's only you.
Is that okay?
-What?
Want to go inside?
"-No, I still have duty tomorrow."
-Are you sure?
.
-I might lack sleep.
Go ahead.
"Baby, I'm thirsty."
Give me your drink.
Please.
One sip.
It's poison.
It was a joke.
"Okay, he.."
He caught me on that.
"- But everyone copies my style, baby."
- Please.
- Everybody.
- You can flaunt your style...
But I'll be the one taking her home.
Wow!
You're learning pretty quick...
- I like him.
- Yeah?
He's learning pretty quickly.
Very very quickly.
Zak a.k.a. Zakir Merchant.
Multimillionaire.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
I have found out everything.
Are you thinking about him?
Are you drunk?
It's a ladies' loo.
You'll get beaten up.
"No, I am not going anywhere."
I am missing you a lot.
"Anyway, I won't be able to meet you for a week."
Why a week?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hello.
"Oh, it's you."
I...
"I'm awful sorry, Skeets, that I didn't talk to you in the lab, but, you see, Aunt Nancy was watching."
"Oh, that's okay, Wilbur."
"Are you going to dance with me tomorrow night, Wilbur?"
"Sure, I'd like that."
You like to dance?
"Oh, gee, I..."
I'd rather dance than eat.
Would you like to see a real good step?
"Oh, I'd love to, Wilbur."
All right.
"Real gone, man."
"Oh, that was nothing."
I could dance a lot better if I had music.
"Hey, wait a minute."
I got a portable radio in my room!
Yeah?
Only it's against the rules for me to leave the switchboard.
(SCATTING)
I'll be right back.
Crazy.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Siri?
"The number you called, not ..."
You see?
Whether they find?
-We Need to confess.
"-No Need, no!"
My father would kill me.
-what Are you doing?
-help Me.
Play more.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-was Zana.
She was alone in the E6 after the killing.
-Five Miles away?
There is logic?
-Geir Tangen is on the line.
This is not the best time.
-And About Zana ...
-I do not think she was in shoals.
It was a professional as the gunman.
She would not escape.
Or be released.
What if she has been freed before?
-So How she made it to the E6?
She wanted to find her father.
Were you looking for me?
Not here!
You brought your stuff?
The car is there.
Why do you not answer me?
-The Battery is dead.
Pushing down on me.
Pressing down on you.
No man asks for.
Under pressure.
That tears a nation down.
Splits a family in two.
Puts people on streets.
People on streets.
People on streets.
It's the terror of knowing What this world is about.
Watching some good friends scream.
ALL:
Let me out.
GLORIA:
Pray tomorrow.
Take me higher.
Pray tomorrow.
Take me higher
[ROARING]
You hear that?
They're doing it again.
- Doing what?
- This.
[KAUGHS]
Fascinating.
What is it?
I have no idea.
Wow!
What's it for?
Perhaps it's a momentary relief from the existential terrors of existence.
- Oh.
What?
Kaan?
Take Sinan and get out.
Candan is coming out.
I can't believe this.
What was it?
I can't believe it...
I have lost my voice too.
"Try a little harder, Candan."
Hello?
Candan just left.
Okay.
Continue with the operation.
God damn it.
Is it okay?
Did you get it?
"Yeah, you wish."
We are screwed.
It's a different bag.
"What do you mean ""a different bag""?"
I'm saying that it's a different bag.
The old one had 2 digits and this has 3.
Why is she changing her bag?
Okay.
Wait a second.
What is it?
They've finished.
They're leaving.
How are things with you?
It's not good at all.
Try and delay her.
I'm hanging up ...
How am I going to delay her?
"No, not for you."
Ready now?
Hold on.
What?
Snacks.
THANK YOU...
You're not to have one.
"Yeah, yeah."
Watch your language.
Whatever.
You handled that well.
We should be okay now.
"Look, here he is!"
Walking by himself!
He did it!
So cute!
"Tetra, bodywork complete."
Tetra wants to use the internet.
But no-one's got a computer.
How about at school?
"It was stolen, remember?"
The new one's kept locked.
Especially during vacation.
How do you know?
"Well, I just know..."
What about PlayStation2?
No way!
Can you?
Even though it ain't a computer?
I read it somewhere.
You sure?
- How do you do it?
"Apart from you, we don't have anyone here."
I don't know. I have exams.
"All right, off you go."
I'll see what I'll do.
Thanks anyhow.
Good-bye.
Take care.
All right.
Hello.
Have a good day.
I've brought water from the spring.
Thank you. I've brought fresh bread.
Thank you very much.
Put it over there.
I'll put it here!
I'll get breakfast.
I'll go and wake my colleagues then.
"Yesterday, I asked your sister to bring us milk."
She probably forgot.
It was me.
"No, I spoke to your sister."
"No, it was me."
- lt was you?
- Yes.
She was pregnant.
I was pregnant.
It was you?
"Yes, in person."
Seriously!
"Yes, I've had the baby and I've come back here to work."
Where is it?
- ls that your baby?
Hello.
Okay.
He asked me to come in.
My daughter!
- Stop!
Don't hurt her.
Have you brought the money?
Who is that?
!
Who is the that?
!
He is someone I know.
Just give him the money.
They might hurt her.
Give it to him.
- How much have you brought?
How much?
- It's not cash.
It's jewellery.
Jewellery?
Are you mocking me?
I asked for cash.
Are you trying to trap me with the jewels?
"Oldie, looks like you don't want your daughter back alive!"
Leave her!
Time out!
Collect her pieces and go!
The jewels are worth more than the money they owe you!
Don't rush.
Let her go!
Please!
Take it and leave her!
No.
"No, my mom's out of town, and my dad's working late."
You busy?
For you?
Never.
I just want to say that I thought you were great with the Myers.
"Well, they're good people."
I owe them a lot.
Tracy told me that you were the one that introduced them that shelter in Haiti.
People are complicated.
"Well, you maybe."
Not me.
- I think you're complicated.
"- Well, you're wrong."
You just don't understand me.
Where are you headed?
Got a date.
Does that give you a twinge?
No.
Bye.
"Honey, you home?"
Shh!
Okay.
Shh!
"Hi, dad."
"Um, this is my friend Miles."
You think I don't recognize the smell of weed.
Dad.
Get out.
Hey.
What is it?
What do you mean?
- Two months?
Two weeks.
Two months?
Connor.
"Connor, come in."
I don't see him.
How long has it been?
Just a few minutes.
Did he forget how to pick a lock?
That's not a rhetorical question.
"Yeah, no, I agree."
That's a fair question.
Hang on.
You stay in the van.
You don't need to bring that.
You're not the boss.
"Hey, Blair, maybe I should come down there."
"No, we got this, all right."
"It just, something's not right."
"Stay put, stick with the plan."
"Blair, can you hear me?"
Blair?
"Blair, Blair."
Hello?
"Hello, hello, hello, hello."
"Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair."
Shit.
Just stick to the plan.
Just stick to the plan.
"Yeah, we'll stick to the plan."
We're good.
We'll just ah...
"I love you, too."
Where's Nick?
He's downstairs.
Apparel was half-off at the gift shop.
Oh.
"So glad you finally made it, bro."
"Thanks for being here, man."
"Yeah, man."
I got this scene under control.
She's at nine centimeters... and I'm at 16.
Why are you two holding hands?
They slept together.
You will do anything to steal focus.
"Okay, we're getting close now."
I'm gonna need you to push.
The breathing's not working.
I don't think I can do this.
Rub her back.
Get her some ice chips.
Rub her back with ice chips.
"Oh, I'm passing out."
What?
He's passing out.
Are you okay?
Gone.
Oh!
"Okay, yeah, get him out of here."
"In fact, everybody out."
But...
Yeah.
"Bye, everyone."
Come on.
Breathe.
Melitta!
"Melitta, breathe."
"Melitta, breathe!"
No!
Domina.
Melitta...
The wine...
It was the wine.
Take her.
Oenomaus must not know she came to your cell.
She was never with you.
Return to the ludus.
Go!

Four years ago
You know the drill.
No large purchases.
No boats.
No cars.
"No down payments on that dream condo down in Boca, huh?"
Nothing that'll red flag I.A. or the I.R.S.
Where's Kate?
Right behind you.
You're late.
I had to cover my tracks.
Your fiance still in the dark?
Good girl.
Let's keep it that way.
I hear there's rumblings about north beach.
What are you going to show me tonight?
Eh?
Cameron!
- How long?
- Less than a minute.
Too late.
He's gone.
(PHONE CLATTERS ON FLOOR)
What time is it?
"Well, it's late."
- He said he'd only be an hour.
- Yeah.
I need the loo.
No key.
(SIGHS)
Aren't you tired?
Opposite.
You?
- I'm absolutely knackered.
- Get some sleep.
"Lie down, chill out, make yourself at home."
"Yeah, wake up and find all my credit cards gone."
How do you know him?
That gavver?
- Gavver?
- Smurf.
Billy Filth.
"Cos you're obviously not one of them, no offence whatever."
No offence taken.
"Well, um... it's a long story."
So give me the edited highlights.
OK.

What are you talking about?
Everything.
Wait!

Wait for me!

From that weird guy?
"He works there, doesn't he?"
Weird?
"He looks a bit strange, don't you think?"
Yeah.
Did you talk to him?
A bit.
At least he gave you free tickets.
Right.
So do you want to come?
I can't.
Marco's coming.
"You don't like Marco, do you?"
"Yes, I do."
It's just that...
I don't really understand what he wants.
From me?
No... just generally.
"Sometimes I don't know, either... if he's honest."
-Would you give me the friggin lighter.
Jacob let me do it.
"Don't hit anyone, Hyder."
D'you shut up.
The retard's gonna hit his own face.
Shut up you asshole.
-Holy shit no more house arrest.
"Gimme the bat, let me show you how it is done."

But no handcuffs this time.
You've gotten a lot harder since you've been away.
Lvan was all over me after you left tonight.
He kept asking me stuff.
Did I talk to you?
What did I say?
He's like something that crawls out of an old pipe.
It's okay.
"in a few days, this will all be behind us."
"Uh, I can't do It."
I'm not Mikhail.
He's dead.
Come here.
Shit!
"Look, I'm positive the girl went up to 323."
The room is empty.
I was just up there.
You saw her come in.
When did she leave?
I don't-
Do you recognize this man?
Yeah.
He checked in across the hall.
- Room 305.
- Room 305.
"Okay, good."
Let's go.
Found this.
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Where did he go?
Tell me!
"Actually, I wouldn't..."
I wouldn't mind if we just cemented over the ocean.
I hate fish.
"Speaking of oceans, who wants to take a dip?"
Oh!
"- Yeah, now we're talking."
- Here we go.
Get in.
Get in.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid to swoop.
I feel like such a man right now.
Oh.
"Guys, you might wanna start small,"
- because I just put a piece in...
- Oh.
- And I'm already buzzing.
- Whoo!
"Is that mint, or is that just, like, coffee?"
I'm buzzing really hard right now.
That's good.
"Oh, my brain hurts a little."
I'm tingling.
We should s'go right now.
S'go!
- S'go!
- Yeah.
Ooh.
[Grunting]
"Yeah, baby!"
"Oh, this song..."
- Actually sucks pretty bad.
Ooh!
Now all we gotta do is find it.
Oh...
"Let's go, Larry."
Very good.
"Yes, here we are."
No one sees us.
"Good, good."
Yes.
"Okay, Larry."
Here we go.
Let's go.
That's good.
Okay.
Oh.
Larry.
"Oh, pardon my vigor."
"Now, Larry, if we meet any other boaters, let me do the talking."
"Hang on, Larry, I'll be right back."
"Don't go anywhere, lover."
Everything will be fine.
"I've got everything under control, Larry."
One day we'll look back on this and laugh.
"Ah, there we are, perfect."
"Okay, Larry, here we go."
"Help me out here, Lar."
Scooch over.
That's good.
Okay.
What?
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, Larry."
Of course you'll still be attractive to me after the autopsy.
"Yes, to Lázaro Cárdenas."
How long is it going to take?
OK.
Bye.
How much money do you think the Old Lady has?
I bet it's a lot.
I don't know.
"Where were you, Beto?"
"Yeah, it's really good."
It's like...
It comes out sizzling.
Sizzling?
"Yeah, it'II..."
It'll save your life.
It's amazing.
Weird.
It'll definitely help with physics.
Hi.

Hi.

Didn't know you were working today.
This is a surprise.
"Yeah, shift change."
"So, can I start you all, you know, with some water before I come and take your order?"
It sounds great to me.
Yeah.
Just water.
All right.
Just working on some physics here.
"So, we need some..."
- Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven´t had the chance to talk to her myself yet.

"Ah, you know, they're in"
Disneyland for 10 days.

"Oh, hey, man."
"Don't even sweat it, you know"
What I mean.
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Blond hair ― that's all I can tell.
It was in the young woman's left fist.
But she herself had brown hair?
So add that to the poster:
"""Suspect has fine blond hair."""
Take this to the chief.
Room 62.
What's wrong?
What is it?
It's not my fault.
What's wrong?
"You mustn't get upset, Franz."
Don't start yelling right away.
What is it?
What is it?
It's not my fault!
"""Murder in Freienwalde."""
It's not my fault!
It's...
"It's Mieze, isn't it?"
Our little Mieze.
It's all over now.
Now they've done it.
Who was it?
Who was it?
I don't know.
"All I read was ""blond hair,"""
and blond hair has to mean Reinhold.
I don't know.
I don't want to accuse anyone.
It was Reinhold.
Drop the bat.
-Lance.
Sit the fuck down.
"-What the hell are you doing, lance?"
Put that gun down.
"-Are you okay, man."
Oh shit Hyder.
"-Is he okay, roger?"
"Well, I hope he's okay, bitch."
-Just put the gun down please.
This bitch hit Hyder.
-No I didn't know it was him.
Where the hell 'd'you get a gun?
Stop talking.
-Lance.
What are you doing?
"-She's gonna call the cops, man, we're all going to Juvie."
I'm not calling anybody.
-Sit the fuck down.
Jacob.
"-Lance, chill out."
"Shut the hell up, sit back."
Lance I got it chill out.
Okay.
What are you doing.
-I'm sorry.
"[Muffled] What are you doing, Jacob stop."
"Stop that, stop fighting him."
"Quit moving, quit moving."
"Quit moving, lay the fuck down."
"It's okay, it's okay."
What are you doing?
I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy!
"Well, I'll say!"
Look how red he is.
"I think he needs a new coat of poly, man."
"- Are you sick, buddy?"
- You are lookin' peaked.
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
- Hey!
What are you doin'?
- It's OK.
"You can trust me, right?"
"I trust you, all right."
It's him I'm worried about.
Hmm...
I trust him.
"- Come on, let's take a drive."
- A drive?
"Yeah, a drive."
Don't you big city racecars ever just take a drive?
Ah...
No.
"No, we don't."
"Hey, Stickers!"
You comin' or what?
Mm-hm!
- And you thought he was gonna run.
"- Hey, can you believe it, man?"
He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar!
That's so too much!
"OK, you got me out here."
Where are we goin'?
I don't know.
Er...
Maybe I should let you talk.
You tell me what you feel
- and... and... and how I let you down.
"- Please, not now."
"Right, right."
It's not my call.
Er...
"Erm... the thing is, Frances..."
I hate meself for what I've done.
Much more than you ever could.
You know?
I know that doesn't change anything or make it better...
"God, I'm terrible at this!"
All I want to say is...
"I've been... a terrible father... but... that doesn't mean I, er... don't care or... feel..."
What the fuck?
Jesus!
You...
Get out!
Get out!
- Get out of my room!
- Stop it!
- Don't start!
- Get out!
He was in the bed!
"I don't care, don't even..."
- What do you mean?
- Paul!
Bastard.
"Oh... oh, fuck!"
"Come back, you little bastard!"
You seem like you do.
-Cut it out.
-What?
She wants to swim.
-She's afraid to get wet.
-I'm not afraid.
You little tart.
"You know what, you've had it."
-Shit!
God!
I can't believe you!
-See what I have to put up with?
"-It's not so bad, is it?"
-It's freezing.
"That's because your clothes are wet, silly."
-You really are a jackass.
God!
-No.
No name-calling now.
We're all adults here.
"-That's better, isn't it?"
"-Well, it's definitely warmer."
I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world.
"You're so polite, Alex."
It's okay to leave the ivory tower and live a little.
-Yes.
I can drive.
"-Well, you shouldn't."
You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I drank less than you.
"No, you did not."
"We finally got it to stop growing, but I can tell  it still hurts her."
And there's not a goddamn thing i can do about it.
That's my job: to protect her.
And I am completely powerless.
You make me feel safe.
What?
You make me feel safe.
I just thought you should know that.
-Can I see it?
- [SUSAN] Not yet.
"[SUSAN] All right, you ready?"
Close your eyes.
[LAUGHTER]
"[SUSAN] OK, you ready?"
"Turn, turn."
Stop.
"- [SUSAN] Ready, OK, open."
"- [LING] Oh, my room!"
My room!
I love it!
"Oh, my god."
Come here!
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
I'm calling Bender!
[EVAN] Hey.
"It's OK, it's OK."
She's happy.
You made her really happy.
Look at her.
Who would do that to someone?
I don't know.
I just don't understand.
"""Atlantis anaduotai."""
"""Atlantis rises."""
We've found the medal.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
What?
Wait.
"Oh, what, you want a photograph?"
Thank you.
That's not what I had in mind.
What?
"Just hang on a second, will you?"
Hello.
What is it?
Uh...
Hm.
What's that?
That's neat.
Neat?
Yeah.
Huh.
At last.
"At last, it's wonderful."
Let's get out of here.
All in good time.
I must take a closer look at this ingenious...device.
Absolutely marvelous workmanship.
Fiendishly clever.
"Eh, what sort of trap do you suppose it sets off?"
No.
Hey.
"I'll entertain any ideas, MacGyver."
MacGyver.
"Sure, let's go."
I can't figure this out anyway.
Reinhold's a fine young man.
"We can all be wrong about people sometimes, you know?"
Let's go.
- You go.
I'll be right there.
All right.
See you later.
- Where are we going?
- Pankow.
But first we're picking up two guys.
I can't be gone long.
Cilly's waiting.
We'll go get her later.
Good Lord!
She'll be furious!
Henschke?
Henschke.
Isn't Reinhold here?
They all drove off together.
- What about Biberkopf?
- Him too.
What's wrong?
"Why so upset, Miss Cilly?"
They just want to have a little fun.
Nothing wrong with that.
- What's wrong?
- What if Franz messes things up?
We've just gotta help him.
"God, I'm thirsty!"
The boys are waiting.
- I hardly think so.
- Oh.
Let me introduce myself.
"My name is Mayley, Lord Mayley, and this is Miss Right."
"Oh, congratulations!"
"No, no."
That's her name.
Her name?
"Oh, how do you do?"
Yes...
Would you care for a glass of sherry while you wait?
"Yes, please."
"Er, has Mrs Ransom been a widow very long?"
"Oh, yes."
Many years.
Yes.
"Many, many, years."
Her poor husband died out east in rather mysterious circumstances.
- Oh?
- Yes.
"Drowned, poor fellow."
- Oh!
- Flora was in England at the time.
Oh.
- (Doorbell)
- Ah!
That may be she.
She's... (Chuckles) She's apt to forget her keys.
Let me do the talking.
"Good morning, sir."
Mrs Ransom?
"She's out but we expect her back, if you'd care to come in."
"Wags, not too far behind with five."
"This time, I'm looking for two answers to get the points."
"Wags, over to you."
Find...
Reveal the hive.
I can see femur there...
But I can't see leg...
Thigh...
Thigh...
Femur...
"No, there's no thigh."
"So, er, clavicle..."
Three points now.
Shoulder is there.
Shoulder.
Shoulder and...
What's the...?
Scapula!
Yeah.
Your answers?
It's shoulder and scapula.
Show me your first letters.
For two points...
"Scapula and shoulder, very well done, excellent."
"Lutrophiles, over to you."
Find...
What have we got?
Minerva and Athena?
"Are they there, though?"
Minerva and...
"Oh, where's Athena?"
Athena...
It's him.
"It's him, he's my friend."
"Here, hold onto it."
For your son.
Don't lose it.
"Don't lose it, Pedro."
Well?
How about that drink?
You're a hero now.
Your photos.
There's somebody else but you can't see who.
It's just a spot.
To Truman Capote.
To Truman Capote.
You were misinformed.
It wasn't him.
It was an accident.
A gift.
This enlargement came out better.
Taken the day the girl was killed at the protest.
They called him the Crow.
He alone tortured over 100 people.
And he was the best at it.
"Take care, Pedro."
Jesus made us some food for the road.
"- Here, I owed you this."
- What is it?
Bambi stew.
- Watch yourself.
- You too.
"We're good, right?"
[LAUGHS]
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.
"Oh, please, give me another chance."
I just couldn't stand it.
Couldn't...
I can't do any more time.
"Please, turn me out of here."
We'll do what we can for you.
Go along now.
Next man.
[¶¶¶]
I don't know.
I don't know anything about it.
Honest.
I didn't have anything to do with it.
That's the truth.
"You gotta believe me, fellas."
I'm waiting.
I don't know.
"Don't, Stacey, don't."
"All right, I'll tell!"
Spill it!
"It was Carlisle, Polecat Carlisle."
Hanley had him do it.
I didn't have no part in it.
I just fingered him.
I didn't know what they was gonna do with him.
You can't blame me.
Polecat.
Yeah.
"- Hi, girls."
- Hi.
Look who I found!
"Hi, Simon!"
- Can I have a drink?
- Have mine.
- So sweet.
- As always.
So I'd noticed.
Too strong?
- Where's my sister?
- Sofie?
- I haven't seen her for days.
- We thought she was with you.
Hasn't she been home?
"Tommy, my top was brand new."
I told you to come on my tummy.
You've ruined it.
- Dry clean it.
- In the middle of the night?
- Look what Tommy did!
- I told you to use a rubber.
- He didn't want to.
- Wear this.
- Josephine's got a bottle for us.
- You forgot something.
What?
- Give me a break.
- What's up with you?
I'm not kissing a sperm mouth.
It was your sperm.
- I'm not a fucking faggot.
"Me too, buddy."
Me too.
"Me too, buddy."
Me too.
It's just I promised the girls I'd be there.
It's just I promised the girls I'd be there.
"Barb, I told you."
It's not a problem.
Just go to the meeting.
It's fine.
"Barb, I told you."
It's not a problem.
Just go to the meeting.
It's fine.
I don't want to be late.
I don't want to be late.
Well...
"Yeah, he'll be OK."
Well...
"Yeah, he'll be OK."
(DINGS BELL)
(DINGS BELL)
He will.
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)
He will.
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)
"Look, I'll be home at 7:00 on the dot, and that is a solid promise."
"Look, I'll be home at 7:00 on the dot, and that is a solid promise."
Will you give Horrie his tablet?
"Yeah, leave it with me."
Will you give Horrie his tablet?
"Yeah, leave it with me."
Get rid of it.
Not there!
"No, not there!"
Get rid of it!
"Here, get rid of it!"
Don't let her catch you with it!
"Drink it, drink it!"
Good boy.
"Oh, it's you."
Come in.
"Well, the sign says..."
"Oh, come on in."
What are you doing?
A little spying.
"Spying, on who?"
On Gretchen.
"You see, Bob can't figure out why he hasn't been called back to active duty."
Mr. Miles?
Yeah.
Bob?
Yeah.
He's in the Army?
"Well, sure."
He's in the reserves.
"Gee, now, if they called him back to active duty, then Nancy and me..."
What?
"Oh, I was just wondering to myself."
How come he wasn't called back?
"Well, read this."
It's from Gretchen to Colonel Blair's wife.
You shouldn't read other people's mail.
That's not very nice.
Son of a bitch!
Look out!
Jong-go?
Now what?
Starting to see the light?
I'll give you three days.
"Get out, or you'll end up like your goddamned dog."
Translate.
Translate what I said.
How long has it been like this?
Just a few days.
$0?
The symptoms- they're the same as the others'.
There's gotta be an explanation for what she has.
They say they don't know.
What is it?
Oh God!
Who the fuck did this?
What?
!
You Okay?
Get your husband.
Who did this?
Who the fuck did this?
Jong-go!
Jong-go!
What's the matter!
Does he drink a lot?
It's nothing to worry about.
I'll take the needles out in 20 minutes.
Cut back on the drinking.
Yeah.
How is your social life?
It's been a bit easier over the phone.
"Everything seems to indicate - that you have severe exhaustion, in other words, burnout."
Take one of these in the morning.
Things are a bit better now.
"Well, it varies, you see."
Any hobbies?
-No.
Relatives?
No.
Wife?
No.
There must be more to life than work.
Perhaps a small trip?
Doctor's orders.
I know where I could go.
And forget the fires for a while.
Look...
I've got one.
-You do?
This is part two.
JESSE SUCKS
Greetings to the doctor.
Jerk!
-Hakkarainen!
"Take it easy, man!"
-Fuck you.
"Take it easy, moron!"
Peach.
Dad...
It's Jesse.
Remember me?
Let's go.
MAN:

LLOYD KAUFMAN:

TRENT HAAGA:
You're right.
Let's go.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
No.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Let's go.
Smoke!
Lights!
Everyone get ready.
This isn't how you make a movie.
MAN:
"This isn't fun, no."
"I'm telling you right now, man."
This-- this is how you make a movie.
Get people to argue with another.
"And then you go, (IMITATING LLOYD) what"
"Is this, a fucking debate squad?"
Is this debating club?
Am I standing in the middle of debating club?
"I'm like, you fucking died."
"That was pretty good, huh?"
"Dude, there's no way."
"Oh, he's gonna kill me when he sees this, man."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yeah, we'll shoot."
We'll shoot it.
It's been 3 weeks.
What?
!
Stay calm.
You are alright now.
In fact there is a surprising.
You've had an eye surgery.
You are going to get your sight back!
Your bandages will be removed today.
Can you please be clear?
- Doctor is here.
What is he saying?
He has isn't able to understand what's happening.
He is tensed.
"Nothing to worry, Mr.Varun."
You are absolutely fine.
Just relax.
"Open your eyes, slowly."
"Varun, give it a try."
Slowly...
Try...
Are you able to see?
Can you see?
One.
Two.
- Yes!
Varun!
I was scared!
Let him take rest.
I'll come back later.
It's Sadhana.
Mom.
"That's why I am saying, dear."
The life that you were leading in Jaipur..
..you will have to change that when you go to Mumbai.
Well.
Take this.
What is this?
- It's a calendar.
Read it.
And this is a diary.
"Dear, I just want you to begin a new life."
And record each moment of your life in this diary.
Okay?
"Yes, mom."
I will write.
Anything else?
"And yes, tell Pia I miss her a lot."
"Yes, mom."
"Mumbai, yeah!"
Come on.
"Coming, Pia."
Two minutes.
And how is it going in Jaipur?
Everything is fine.
Jaipur is still the same old Jaipur.
How are mom and dad?
- Very well.
Very good.
Yeah?
- Excuse me.
"Gul, whose call was it?"
Two hours ago he was my boyfriend.
You will never change.
He gets what he wants.
And I guess he wanted me.
You know what?
I've really missed you over the years.
Me too.
You know you're the only person I was ever able to talk to.
After Jesse...
Why didn't you contact me when you came back ?
"You know, no bullshit, Pru."
Just the real reason.
I don't know...
I just thought...
The past was better left there.
It's Slade.
Just checking to see if you're OK.
Where are you ?
I'm just out.
- Out where ?
- I'm just out with a friend.
A friend ?
"Yes, Slade, a friend."
I do have them.
Put her on.
Sorry ?
Pru.
Put her on.
"Hi, Pru."
How is he doing ?
He didn't seem too good the other night.
"Yeah he's fine, considering."
- Did he speak much about Jesse ?
- Not really.
- But you have to do it.
- Listen.
- You have to do this.
You promised.
Do it!
Put the.

"Addons Thi time has expired, Dave."
Damn.
"- No, no."

I do it just to stop it.
He wants to ...
I do it just to stop it.
Addons Thank you for participating in the game ...
"Addons ""Resist or Die""."
Now you understand.
"Addons Unfortunately, the failure of Dave, and failure is You are so ..."
Sarah should be dead.

Let's move it.
We've cut.
"It's a little too late to be careful, sir."
"I'm sorry, I..."
"Oh, what is going on here?"
Will somebody get the security guards?
"I can't tell you how sorry I am, sir..."
"Would you mind very much, sir for making this disturbance."
I really can't tell you.
My name is Columbo.
I'm from the police.
We're ready when you are.
- Do I know you?
"- No, I don't think so."
"I'm her daughter, Rebecca."
Right.
I thought you'd look more like your mom.
- I'm Sarah Walker.
- It's nice to meet you.
You too.
So...
Holly?
"Oh, um..."
- I have no idea where she is.
- OK.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Rebecca.
Um...
Do you have a minute?
Could I talk to you?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Becca."
Where you been?
I stopped by Ojai today.
I wanted to check out your new digs.
- You did?
- Yeah.
I got the address from some papers you had lying around.
Thought I'd surprise you.
"Well, I'm sorry that I missed you."
I was out meeting with a distributor and I didn't want to drive all the way back to the office.
"So, um, would you like me to make lunch for both of us?"
No.
Fall in!

That's Aunt Gretchen.
Gretchen?
"Oh, here you are."
You're just in time.
I was about to fix some tea.
"Oh, I can't stay."
I'm late for my class now.
I just come over to deliver Wilbur.
"Well, if you can't."
Have a good time.
Thank you.
You...
You're him...
The world is coming to an end.
We all must pay the price.
"Casshern must pay, as will we."
So Casshern has awakened?
Indeed.
We knew it would happen.
Your business will be booming for a while.
Beautiful...
--Me?
--Yeah.
"Are you a human, mister?"
"Then you must be a robot, right?"
I... suppose...
You don't know?
Are humans...?
Beats me.
I haven't seen many of them.
That's why I thought you might be one.
Since you're so beautiful.
"What's your name, mister?"
My name?
I'm Ringo!
I'm...
Kill Casshern!
Casshern...
Kill Casshern!
Casshern.
Casshern?
You waves are so mean!
I had them all lined up!
- I'll take three.
"- Mm, good boy."
Get some flesh on those bones.
How's everything in here?
All right?
"You off, then?"
Oh.
"Er... yes, if you're sure you're all right."
- He won't want for anything.
- It's Adam's decision.
Are you having a laugh?
"Look around, George."
I'm a pig in shit.
- Adam.
- Sorry.
Hm.
"- Right, I'll show you to the door."
"- No, no, that's OK, we can find it."
"Of course, yes."
Like tracker dogs.
- Um... excuse me?
!
"- No, come on."
"Cheers for bringing me here, though."
Look after him.
We don't need you to tell us that.
OK?
See you.
- Shall I feed the boy now?
"- Oh, not yet, Seven."
We're going to make a night of it.
"After all, Adam's finally where he belongs."
Do you work every day after school?
That's gotta be tough.
"Um, no, just three days."
My moms don't want me to work any more than that.
- Moms?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- It is.
"Oh, don't worry, I'll grab that."
"Oh, thanks."
See you soon.
"Oh... down the street, I'm telling you."
- You're really good.
- Not good enough.
"I thought you did great, way better than me."
I'm supposed to be good at this.
- Damn!
- What?
- Someone left us a hundred-dollar tip!
- What?
"- A hundred dollars, yo!"
"- Oh, my God!"
Who do you think it was?
I don't know.
Vanilla milkshake?
He sure was chatting you up.
- Please.
"- Come on, girl."
You know he likes you.
- Shut up.
- He wants some of that.
- Daphne!
"Damn it, Reid."
"I said, ""Don't take the vest off."""
Come closer.
I want to see both of your hands at all times.
You sit across from me.
Why are you so nervous?
I told you.
I'm not used to being around guns.
This is going to probably sting a little bit.
Whoa.
Did you see that?
I knew it.
I knew it.
"Hey, look."
He's got it.
He's got it.
He's got the chip.
I've gotta go to the Higher Authority.
I was supposed...
Not yet!
Turn it on.
Turn the chip on.
Excuse me?
"- Get off the train, Reid."
"- No, no, something's wrong."
Get off the train.
- Get out of there.
- Why isn't he moving?
How many shots would it take to move in?
Two.
First blows the window.
Second takes Bryar down.
I didn't stand a chance with those odds!
it wasn't my fault that I lost.
that's all!
Always looking down on me with those smug expressions!
crap!
Then you're saying that you still have the resolve to fight?
You are most fortunate.
There happens to be one available Servant.
Open up!
Where is she?
You're insane!
Where's my daughter?
Eva?
Eva?
Get out!
Help me!
Eva?
He's in there!

Hands.
Show me your hands.
Put them on your head.
What did she do with my daughter?
Where's eva?
"I didn't do it, cornielle!"
Arrest her!
Arrest her!
You got character.
I don't make this offer to just anybody.
"Sarge, I got a great-lookin' gal to go home to... not to mention my wife..."
so it just ain't in the cards.
Igor.
Another glass of cheer.
You think you got it rough?
Look at that guy.
"- ## [""Harbor Lights""] - [Sighs]"
"Boy, he looks terrible."
What's his story?
"He got a ""Dear Maxie"" letter."
- Says he's got nothin' to go home to.
"- Oh, yeah?"
"Well, that's a shame."
Please.
Allow me.
"Some tune, huh?"
The greatest.
"For a certain little lady and me, that was our song."
"This drink's on me, Maxie."
Please.
Don't call me Maxie.
Only Laverne called me that.
And...
- And...
"- That's it, pal."
Get it off your chest.
Tell Joey all about it.
Yeah.
"You're right, Joey."
Who are you?
We can't just leave him.
Either he's gutted or scalped.
"And if he ain't he can find us, can't he?"
What about Glass?
He ain't our problem.
"Like us, he's on his own."
We made a promise to the Captain.
A proper burial when the time was needed.
He needs that rifle!
He couldn't do nothing with it if you tarred it to his hand.
We can't do this.
We got no fucking choice.
"No, we can't."
Look at him.
"All right, shit, then, buddy."
Get him up.
You want to take him?
(GLASS GROANING)
Come on now!
Easy.
"Slowly, Fitz."
Easy with him.

"Stop, dammit!"
I know who the van gang are.
And their next stunt.
They're in the sticks.
It starts from there.
"In exchange, you cover me."
Or get nailed with me.
Who did you waste?
"Marcus Zerbib, his driver and his goon."
Marcus Zerbib?
The guy who put you in jail?
You'll get nabbed right away!
Not with a good alibi.
Now... you can grab the worst gang around.
Choose.
"OK, let's have it."
I know two of 'em:
Francis Horn and Robert Boulanger.
They're squatting in St Ouen.
On Captain Glarner St.

- Want a drink?
- I'm with friends.
You got friends now?
Access granted.
"All right, Project Cadmus."

"But if Batman's suspicious, maybe we should investigate."
Solve their case before they do.
It would be poetic justice.
"Hey, heh, they're all about justice."
But they said stay put.
"For the blotting-out-the-sun mission, not this."
"Wait, are--?"
Are you going to Cadmus?
"Because if you're going, I'm going."
Just like that?
We're a team on a mission?
We didn't come for a play date.
[SIR ENS WAIL ING]
-Help !
-Get us down!
Stay put.
We will get you out.
[BOTH GRUNT]
Whoa-
- Unh.
It's what's-his-name.
Flash Boy.
Kid Flash.
Why is that so hard?
So smooth.
Does he always have to run ahead?
We need a plan.
We--
-Robin?
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.
"I hate this, John."
I absolutely goddamn hate this.
How was Chicago?
What did he say?
He wouldn't see me.
Shit.
You all right?
It's cold.
"Get in the car, warm up."
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Denise and all the others, they don't know, John."
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
I understand.
Everything.
"John, doyou remember the last time you were happy?"
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?
- Did I wake you up?
- No!
Today Mr. Lin has rented a villa for our gathering.
Villa?
Where is it?
I don't know.
Tt's classy set up here!
Feels like a prince charming is coming from the sky!
This is not good!
Do you want to be taken away by a prince charming?
It might be!
So you should come for me quickly !
"Yawang,"
I miss you so much!
- Mee too!
"- Oh, right..."
Is your new job okay?
Hello?
"Yawang, are you still there?"
Let's talk about it later.
"Yawang, I can not use the phone too long here."
- You should go home earlier!
- I know.
- Good night!
- Good night!
- What are you doing here?
"- Prince charming, huh?"
Sounds good!
Here...

I lend it to Mr. Lin today.
Do you have fun?
Bye.

"Who was that, sport?"
Friend of yours?
Yeah.
"He's, uh, a new kid."
What...
I...
"Hey, hey!"
Stop!
Stop that!
Stop it!
"Hey, mind if I ask you a few questions there, buckaroo?"
"Now, why would you tell your mom about a giant robot, slugger?"
"Say, what'd you see at the power station?"
"Huh, tiger?"
"You tell anyone else about this, buddy?"
"How big is this thing, ranger?"
Been in the forest lately?
Hey.
Where you going?
Champ?
Slugger?
"Hey, cowboy?"
Where you goin'?
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going out!
Why don't you take Mr. Mansley with you?
Show him the sights.
"Oh, Mom, the sights?"
"Hey, I'd love that."
"Give us a chance to get acquainted, swap some stories, huh, chief?"
Dinner will be at 8.
"""Come to me, my love..."""

You really don't know anything?
She isn't at home and she isn't even answering her phone.

Look who finally took her home.
Girls want princes not paupers.
"Hey, hey, hey!"
- Brother!
Brother!
What is it?
- You want money?
I have money.
"""Come to me, my love..."""
"""Come to me, my love..."""
Oh!
Hi!
You want something?
No appreciation.
Don't come any closer.
Saira... what are you doing?
Come down.
Don't come any closer or I'll jump.
"Oh come on, Saira."
You know you won't jump.
- He's a thief.
- Meantime I'II report him.
- He's gone.
- Afugitive?
"- No, he checked out."
He popped off.
- He croaked.
- I don't understand.
- Dead.
- Great start!
- Take me to a hotel.
- I didn't get that.
There must be a hotel around.
"This time of year, at this hour?"
.
You razzin' me?
Okay.
Is there much more to walk?
Want me to carry it?
Come in.
It's kind of you to host me.
"please, this way."
Mr. Director...
Take your shoes off.
My mother's fanatical about dirt.
Watch your step.
Go ahead in.
"I'II camp out on the couch, I can't stay here."
I'II move the box.
"I'II get you settled, change the sheets too."
You shouldn't...
"It's moth balls, Mom puts them everywhere."
"I'll give her a fight, all right!"
"- No, no, no."
Wanted to write!
- What?
Wanted to write.
On the paper.
Why should I want to write on it?
I'll have some sent up to your room immediately.
Manuel!
That doesn't work either.
What were you saying just now?
- Turn it on.
- What?
Turn it...
Turn... it... on.
I can't read that.
I need my glasses.
Where are they?
"They're on your head, Mrs. Richards."
I've lost them.
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.
Excuse me!
"- Now, I had them this morning..."
- Mrs. Richards...
When I was buying the vase...
"I put them on to look at it, and then I had them at tea time..."
Mrs. Richards!
Your glasses are there!
There?
Who put them in there?
"No, no, no!"
Hit him in the belly!
"You got him, Nelson!"
Knock him out!
- How do you like it now?
- I still say it'll go the limit!
"- Little Boy, I need some more dough!"
"- All you want, baby!"
We'll make it 100!
A hundred?
"Look, I don't want to take your money, sister!"
- Put your dough where your mouth is!
"- Okay, okay!"
It's a bet!
Finish him!
"Come on, finish him, Nelson!"
Nelson's opened up his left eye!
- It's bleeding!
- Good!
"Come on, Nelson!"
"Get him, Nelson!"
Come on!
Stand up and fight!
Nelson's pounding his kidneys!
The sucker!
Why don't he work on that eye?
That's more like it!
Come on!
I don't like this!
I don't like it!
"- Hey, what goes on here?"
- Don't you like it?
You're trying to cross me!
Nonsense.
"Whatever you do, don't stop."
Just remember my motto at the exercise salon.
Beauty Knows No Pain. just try it.
It's gotten more ladies through my class...

No philosophy.
We've barely come 10 miles.

Go.
Beauty Knows No Pain.

Come on.
Hey!

Get your hands off me.
- Gold teeth!
Don't make this any harder than it has to be.
"Oh, let her go."
Let her go.
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
-
I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.

You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
Frankie Valli or some big shot?
I forgot.
I thought it was next week.
so you're a liar!
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.
Let me make it up to you.
I'll think about it.
she was screaming on the street and I mean loud.
But she looked good.
I'll think about it.
Hill.
A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.

What's wrong?
Nothing.

"What's this, Chinese?"
How about you?
I'm fasting.
"Say, isn't that strange  to practically fast into one's own death?"
It's just a question.
- Very tactful.
"Yes Dad, very nice."
Right to the point.
What did I say?
Are you hard of hearing?
I've just about had enough.
Shut up!
I won't listen to this crap any more.
It's a good thing when new people come to us.
"You could be a bit nicer, especially to her."
I think so too.
And you shut that thing off!
"Alright, fine."

Thanks.

You're the boss.
You should keep your word.
Don't talk crap.
"I won't pay him, even ifyou beg."
"Mr. Weng, let me keep my word and pay him what I promised."
Then I'll bring him to you.
"Mr. Weng, if it pleases you..."
I will beg.
Go to hell!

We don't know about the other two.
"Ma'am, do you have any idea who they might be?"
"No, I don't."
I see.
What about Mikey?
I saw him go in there.
We did find the skeletal remains of what appears to be a 10-year-old child.

As if I could get rid of you that easily.
"Hey, Bo."
"I'm not like Jenny, am I?"
I'm not too clingy or anything?
You make me want to be a better Fae.
Go seduce a yak.
My God.
Mass destruction and two dead Furies.
"If it's the chocolates that Saeko-san loves the most, then all the more."
"The confectionery school's graduation exam is today, right?"
Yeah.
"Well, since my family has a cake shop..."
I think I'll be fine.
"Rather, I can finally show my performance."
Performance?
Eh?
What?
"- Ah, nothing."
"Ah, hey."
Can we meet on the 14th?
Valentine's day.
I'm a bit busy on the 14th...
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"Well, that's right."
"A guy shouldn't be asking you out on that day, right?"
Sorry.
"Then, the 13th?"
- That's fine.
"Ah, thank goodness."
"Then, the 13th."
- Yeah.
"Then, on the 13th."
Yeah.
- Yeah.
"I'll text you later, okay?"
Bye bye.
"- Yeah, bye..."
I feel like I've been casually rejected...
"Oh, that's right."
The place was bad.
"Apparently, not everybody's favorite."
And the final number is 17.
My daughter's age!
"Hi, Julie!"
"Once again, the Gold Rush numbers are 25, 52, 7, 32, 10, and 17."
"So, that's it for now."
Keep playing lotto!
You'll thank me later.
"""You'll thank me later""?"
That's my line.
I say that.
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
"You know, I might as well flush 20 bucks down the toilet once a week."
It was terrible.
Wasn't I terrible?
Yeah.
You were great.
I don't know what happened.
I just...
I got so nervous.
You were great.
It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Great job.
"Thank you, Mr. Monk."
It was fun.
Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.
Natalie?
Where are you going?
"Just hang on a second for me, please."
Alright.
"I'm sorry about that, Guv."
I'll catch up with you next time.
Alright?
Thanks.
Yeah.
(phone ringing)
Mum!
Ev!
"How are you, love?"
Have you found Uncle?
"Yeah-- yeah, but there's people living in his house!"
Oh Ev...
(crying)
"Oh, come on, mum!"
Really?
"That's not helping, isn't it?"
"Of course, it's just that--"
"Okay, look, mum, what's happening with the appeal?"
"Well, Mr. Irving filed it--"
Yeah.
He said likely another 6 to 8 weeks.
"Mum, this is not going to work!"
It's not going to work!
I'm getting light here.
"I mean, it's like $100 U.S. a night."
"I mean, I just can't afford it."
But you're not there on holiday!
You can't afford that!
You need to find another place!
"Okay, yeah, where?"
"Nine, eight.."
Dad!
"Dad, look!"
Five..
"Dad, in his hand!"
..four..
three..
"Emily, get down!"
..two..
Get down!
One.
Confirmation timed out.
"Delta 26, one minute to target."
Go weapons hot.
"Thank God, Em."
"Daddy, I love you."
You're okay.
I love you so much.
The president.
He shot him!
He shot him in there.
"Look, I need you to listen to me."
"There's an air strike coming, I need you to run."
I need you to run as far and as fast as you can possibly go.
Can you do that?
I gotta get the president.
Okay.
You gotta go for me.
"Now, go."
Hundreds of people seem to be running toward the White House.
"They've been told to evacuate too, but they're climbing the fence."
"Okay, we have confirmation."
Where did he go?
You want to wear it now or later?
Go to hell!
"Sir, be careful."
Slippery floors.
"Mr. Lin, I'm Lo Keung."
Why is this with you?
I found it at the crime scene.
I saw who killed your brother.
Tell me then.
I never pay for information.
Tell me now.
It's your citizen duty.
Or I'll bring you to the police.
Cut your crap!
How to escape with no money?
Petty jerk!
Tell me now!
Ok.
I'll talk...
Stop!
...
Tell me!
Help me!
Come!
...
Will you talk now?
I'll talk...
"Around 3am, I was going to steal a car."
"I saw a couple walking to the car, I guess it was your brother."
"When he opened the door, 4 men attacked him."
No...
- Just exploring—
- We've been duped.
This girl is not a thief.
- Really?
- Take charge of the situation.
Jeeves.!
Jeeves.!
"- I beg your pardon, sir."
"- Nice work, Jeeves."
I'm a little bit rusty for a former amateur champion.
That's better.
"Allow me, sir."

"Splendid, Jeeves."
"- Thank you, sir."
There they are!
After them!
- Jeeves!
Two more coming up!
"- Very good, sir."

"Downstairs, quick!"
Stop them!
- Jeeves!
Two more on the ice.
- What?
"Again, sir?"
Go on!
We still are...
Husband and wife.
"I love you, Henry."
I can't wait to hear you saying it.
- Henry.
- His memories are stil catching up with him.
"Oh, Jesus."
I'm Robbie.
- The sorcerer of sound.
- You're gonna love this.
"Because, sir..."
You're gonna get to pick your own voice.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hello, Henry."
- Robbie.
"- Come on, they're options."
Our white guy would wanna sound like Louis Armstrong?
"Just one more, wait."
"Henry, I am your father."
"Robert, enough."
"- Sorry, mom."
- How about we use Henry's voice?
"Yeah, whatever you say, you're the boss."
Boring.
- Security breached.
"- Oh, fuck."
- Level Four.
- Is this a drill?
- What is this?
- Security breach.
Level Four.
"I know, but you might actually like it."

Hello.
Thomas.
- I should've known.
I am no longer your psychologist.
Globale blamed you for all this?
No.
Not directly.
They replaced me by Dr Moreau.
They can.
With no reason.
But the girl was...
Eva?
- Yes.
Eva.
What will happen to her?
She was transferred to another sector.
less demanding of her body.
- What?
Another sentence of substitution.
but a longer one.
What does it consist in?
I can't tell you.
Thomas.
Globale forbids you to have any contact with her.
And it's best.
Where is she?
You must tell me.
Listen.
you know.
when we were waiting for the insurance experts.
Listen to this.
I'm really sorry.
"If you give me your number, I'll call ya and bring the money to ya."
I don't take I.O.U.'s from guys that I just met.
Forty bucks.
"Oh, wait."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
How 'bout this?
What's that?
"Hundred dollar five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Chargers, Seahawks, Lions."
From the Montecito.
Huh?
- No way the Rams cover.
You kidding?
- I owe you 40.
"This thing pays, you'll get two grand, man."
Come on.
Come on!
Give us a break.
Start betting on Korean Ping-Pong.
And get out of here.
"All right, fine."
All right.
It's me.
So what?
I don't know anything about fake chips.
You don't know anything about fake chips?
You cashed it in.
This isn't fair.
No.
"- It isn't fair, is it?"
- It wasn't even my chip.
She goes through my pockets some nights.
"Oh, absolutely."
Which horse?
"- Uh, Dragonfly."
- When's it running?
"No, it ran today."
I won that on it.
Oh.
"Well done, old boy."
"No, could you keep it?"
"No, I couldn't do that, very decent of you..."
"No, could you keep it just tonight?"
"It's Sybil, you see?"
Secret.
"Ah, a present."
"Sort of, yes."
Don't mention it.
Mum's the word.
I'll get it from you in the morning and bank it.
"Understood, old boy."
Cheers.
"There you are, Mr. Mackintosh."
"There you are, Mr. Mackintosh."
"Good morning, Mr. Fawlty."
"Good morning, ladies."
Hello.
Fawlty Towers.
Watt!
I didn't say anything.
Have you called the police yet?
"Excuse me, I'm trying to take a telephone call."
Have you called them yet?
"OK, hurry up."
Come on.
Why did you leave the key in the car?
You look fine.
God loves you for a liar.
Daylight never saw such a ruin!
But you've put on weight.
You're as plump as a partridge.
You look good.
Blanche!
"Yes, you do, or I wouldn't say it."
But watch your figure.
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"I haven't put on an ounce in ten years, Stella."
I weigh what I weighed... the summer you left Belle Reve...
- the summer...
"- Laura, come quickly."
What's wrong?
Internal bleeding and head injuries.
- How did it happen?
- A car accident.
"- Shit, I don't know if I can..."
"- Sure, you can."
You've got no choice.
Come here.
Hold this.
Swab.
Suck it up.
I can't see anything.
- We need more blood.
Ligature.
"Yeah, Lila, she does."
That's good.
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?
Cheryl Ann.
"Oh, that's right."
And you and Cheryl Ann have a little girl.
What's her name?
Bonnie.
How old is she?
Eight.
"You don't like talking with me about your family, do you?"
"No, Lila, I don't guess I do."
I don't blame you.
I got something for you.
Where you going?
"Don't shoot me, officer."
DALE:
What the hell are you doing now?
Can I turn on the light?
No.
I put it in here so it wouldn't get stale.
Can we leave this open so we can have some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
Here you go.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It's in September.
Fucking Kraut!
What was that?
Fucking Kraut.
Idiot!
"Only for buses, sir."
-I'll be right back.
"No access for normal cars, sir."
Don't be a nag.
There's plenty of space.
Only buses.
"Drop dead, asshole."
"Yes, one more for my husband."
Everything will be ready when you come back.
Stop!
Take him away!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
I won't turn in my weapon.
Never.
Check if we have these people in the computer.
"If not, ask who we do have."
Just the addresses.
Is it urgent?
-A matter of life and death.
I'll be gone all afternoon.
The money.
"Here, fifty thousand."
Take it.
I already bought jenever on the black market.
Ay yi yi...
Tu viste eso?
"Her daughter, son?"
"What are you doing, Angie?"
I'm getting ready for bed.
Don't you miss me?
"Enrique, please not now, I'm tired."
"Yeah, what you tired from?"
Life.
"Life, huh?"
I thought you were tired from going
With that new boyfriend of yours.
What are you talking about?
I don't got no boyfriend.
No?
No...
"what are you, deaf?"
"Don't lie to me, Angie."
I ain't fucking stupid.
"Look, I don't expect anybody to wait three years."
That ain't natural.
I was up north.
You had to do what you had to do.
But I'm home now.
I don't want to see no dudes.
I don't want to smell it.
That's it.
"If you want me, it can only be me."
Okay.
"You know I missed you, Enrique."
You sure?
"Of course, stupid."

One dark and windy night.
A female vampire was in search of a virgin boy's blood.
"Tonight she found her victim,"
So she walked slowly to the door.
I'm not a virgin!
You scared me!
"Robin darling, I need you!"
What?
I need you!
Me...too!
- l need you now!
- Now?
You mean right here?
But the bed's a little small!
"If you don't go to rescue Yoyo, he's done!"
Rescue Yoyo?
I wouldn't do that!
People hold cars in high esteem.
They show certain signs of concern when they lose them.
Martin!
-Martin!
-I love you!
"One moment, the boss has a meeting."
I'm asking for sick leave.
Immediately.
Now before the symposium?
You've gone crazy!
And what about the report?
Do you have the report for me?
-Well...
"-Yes, or no?"
-No?
-I'm sorry.
It'll be all right.
Sorry.
-Yansky!
-Good bye!
"Martin, what's going on?"
You won't even look at me?
You have a nice hat.
"Yes, yes, Doctor Yansky."
"Decent, truthful,"
"responsible,"
So send him to a psychiatrist.
Life is beautiful.
-I know.
-So what's missing in your life?
It's not missing.
It's excessive.
"It's normal, too."
"Henry, wait."
Wait.
We'll get there.
Scan.
Sensory processor activated.
Relax.
Okay?
Scanning.
- Video link confirmed.
- Up.
This next part might hurt.
Maybe quite a lot.
"But it won't last long, I promise."
Almost we have done.
Welder.
You can do it.
"Wonderful, Henry."
Squeeze.
Harder.
"Cool, right?"
Integument.
"Please, don't move your hand."
You probably don't recall.
You were never a big fan of my work.
Maybe this will change your mind.
Right?
Memory is a funny thing.
I am an expert and I do not know if you'll ever get yours back.
"You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry?"
My name is Estelle.
You and I were...
is anyone home?
Toni
"Hey, wait..."
- What do you want?
"- Stay calm, Toni"
Don't move
"Don't do this, Toni"
Get lost

The Hovitos are near.
"The poison is still fresh, three days."
They're following us.
"If they knew we were here, they would've killed us already."
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
Senor... nobody's come out of there alive.
Please...
Senor.
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
"If you insist, senor."
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Might be kind of awkward.
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C. But there'll be a lot of single guys.
So there will be plenty of chances for me to be awkward.
"Don't worry, I'll be there."
I'll talk you through it.
[PLATES SHATTERING]
"Okay, gotta go."
"Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates."
Maybe I'll see you there.
You're busy.
I shouldn't have called.
You called me.
"- Yup, good."
- Bye.

Mom!
Are you okay?
"[whispers] It's okay, baby."
Have you seen this lately?
One good squeeze and it'll come apart in your hands!
It's not as easy as that.
I've t--t--tried.
Granville!
Fetch a d--d--dry cloth!
-
- Did M--Mrs Gillespie come for her bread?
-
"- Aye, yesterday, about tea--time."
There's no p--pattern to the movements of that woman.
She's very irregular for someone that buys s--so much Ex--Lax!
Does it matter when she comes?
Does it matter?
D--Does it matter?
Course it matters!
"- Angel, come on."
Are we going?
- Yes.
"- Come on, let's go."
"Come on, Mike."

- Okay.
I'm sorry.
What do you think?
"Beautiful, is not it?"
- What's the problem?
- I do not like this place.
"This is only temporary, okay?"
Just for a two nights.
Remember?
"Soon, not whisper their home."
"Who knows, maybe one of those pools."
"First, a few need to handle the job, okay?"
"Then they whisper very, very far away."
- Really?
- Yes.
- You know what?
I am sure that Bella liked here.
"- No, I did not like."
Is that right?
Let us ask him then.
"It's beautiful, Bella?"
See?
Complacent.
"Daddy, stop it!"
"Daddy, no!"
[Ariel sobs]
"Ariel, I... [sobs] Just go away."
Poor child.
"Poor, sweet child."
She has a very serious problem.
If only there were something we could do.
But there is something.
Who...
Who are you?
Don't be scared.
We represent someone who can help you.
Someone who can make all your dreams come true.
[Both] Just imagine...
You and your prince...
Together forever.
I don't understand.
Ursula has great powers.
[Gasps] The sea witch?
"Why, that's..."
I couldn't possibly.
No!
Get out of here.
Leave me alone!
Suit yourself.
It was only a suggestion.
Wait.
[Both] Yes?
- [Sniffles] Poor Ariel.

"Good, good!"
"It's all right, mother."
I'm home now.
"Oh, yes, yes, I know, darling."
"No, I'm all right."
"Oh, my dear!"
"Hi, dads."
I'm here.
"Oh, son!"
That's a boy.
You all right?
"- Yeah, but I have to sleep."
Leave him alone.
"Oh, it's all right, Joe."
"You see Joe, Joe Krozac is his name-"
He brought me home.
"Didn't you, Joe?"
There you are.
"You got quite a ducking, didn't you, son?"
"Here, I'll do that."
"The last time it rained, we slept in a haystack."
"You should have been with us, dads."
It was fun.
I'll bet it was.
"You know, Joe tried to make a fire, and I showed him how."
The way you showed me.
"Didn't I, Joe?"
Let's get this coat off.
"You two must have had some experience, huh?"
Yes.
"Here are your pajamas, darling."
The ones you like...
How about a big glass of hot milk?

He tries to buy their freedom.
Why would he do that?
He lives a good life in Malaysia with his wife and children.
How do you know?
"William, have you had contact with him?"
I had to do something.
-Oh my God.
No.
It is you.
You asked him to come here.
10.2 million euros.
That is the price for Karine?
"He killed her, he hit her head against the stone until it cracked!"
Finally.
It was not him.
Tonje saw him somewhere else.
The alibi was a joke!
We all know it!
Try to think ahead.
Think of the responsibilities we have.
Here you can not ask me.
Never.
Never.
Hey dear.
"God, so good to see you."
-Oh?

"Well, go on, have a good time."
"Thanks, mom."
[gunshots]
"You know, in spite of what you think,"
I think he's starting to warm up to ya.
"Well, yeah, he's got a funny way of showing it, though."
"I know, but it's-- it's just going to take time, Mike."
Yeah.
[woman sighs]
- You having a good time so far?
- Sure.
Really?
Yeah.
I'll buy you a beer.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- I could use one.
- maybe two if you're nice to me.
- Or three.
- [woman laughs]
"You're not getting too tired to take me out tonight, are you?"
"Uh, alone?"
- mm-hmm.
- No.
You think you can handle it?
"Yeah, I think I can."
[gunshots]
"Oh, hey, that's really a good shot, don't you think?"
Yeah.
[pianola playing]
Keep playing.
No.
(Clinking) Think!
Bob's been picking her up all week.
She's been humming stupid songs all around the house.
(Grunts) Last night she came home with green glitter in her hair.
Oh.
Stop it!
"That's right, Sue."
Mom's still in the play.
(Gasps)
What?

"You know, when you said lunch and bowling,"
I didn't realize you could do it all in one awesome place.
(Chuckles) Yeah.
"Hey, you're a pretty good bowler, too, you know?"
What did you end up with?
39.
39.
That's pretty good for a 7-year-old.
"No, I'm 10."
Oh.
"Well, you should be better then."
(Brakes squeal)
Okay.
Time for you to take the wheel.
(Shifts gears) What?
"Well, you gotta learn to drive some time, don't ya?"
"Um, don't I have to be 16?"
(Chuckles) Who says?
The state does.
I don't have a license.

Damn.
I'll deal with you from what you say.
- I hear?
- You want to destroy us?
Max.
I'm not Max.
- Damn.
- Why do think I can play?

"Well, it's not an ice-cream truck."
- Saul!
"- Stay back, sir."
- What happened?
- Is it his heart?
Looks like it.
We'll know better at the hospital.
Stand back.
"- Er, where's his wife?"
- I don't know.
- What hospital are you goin' to?
- Honolulu General.
Lena?
Lena?
She's not here.
- Where'd they take him?
- Honolulu General.
- That's what his prescription says.
- That's not far.
- Wait.
What about Lena?
- We'll leave her a note.
No!
What would I say?
"""Dear Lena, Saul's had a heart attack""?"
- Stay here and break it to her gently.
- Wait a minute!
What's going on?
Answer the question.
Where did you see him last?
I-I don't know.
"Work, I think."
- Is that Roger?

Did... did an Inazagi kill him?

Roger Caplan was murdered.
"Oh, God."
Who would want to hurt him?

I can't look at these.
"Please, I wanna get out."
Explain why your DNA and fingerprints

His heart rate's high.
What about his brain activity?

If you can bring it.
"Sir, I am reading you for the past 40 years."
"But sir, sorry."
"You don't look like you are 40, sir."

Otherwise I was going to leave soon.
"Well, my mother says time favours those who value it."
"Tell him he's got to call me, ok?"
"As soon as you talk to him, he's got to call me. lt's important."
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
-Take this. lt's a couple thousand.
"-Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."

You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.

- Eat my shorts.
- Blow me!
- Motherfucker!

"Shit, that's very sexy."
For that... the referee will give you a red card.
It's a big soccer game tonight.
The national team is playing.
It's on the TV.
- Is Acacio playing?
- I'm sure.
"Well, let's get started, then."
Why don't you open to page 3 5 and read?
Do you prefer on the top or below?
I beg your pardon?
The reading.
I should read on the top?
"You mean, should you stand up?"
I'm sorry.
"- A federale, right in front of him."
"Three agents wounded, one lost his leg."
It's like what you hear about in Iraq or something.
- The IEDs.
- Jesus.
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
Hank talked to his SAC for about an hour.
Hank should win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.
"He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed."
"And all he keeps saying is,"
"""I'm fine."
I'm fine.
"Leave me alone""."
"Baby, not now."
"It's me, Hank."
Sorry.
"Hey, buddy."
What's up?
I just...
Do you mind if I...?
"No, no."
So...
How you doing?
You know.
Lousy.
"Montezuma's Revenge, big time."
"I mean, everything's going through me like crap through a tin horn."
Better not get too close.
I'll take my chances.
I guess you heard about what happened down in Juárez?
Terrible.
Anything to drink?
No.
Water for me.
"Nothing, thanks."
"No, excuse me, uh..."
"Actually, we'll have two strawberry milkshakes, extra whipped cream."
We couldn't find you anywhere.
"You know, finally, your mom stayed up top, and I took the elevator all the way down to the ground floor."
"And I got out of the elevator, and there you were, reciting the alphabet, in French, to, uh, the security guards at the CN Tower."
"And you were little, too."
You couldn't have been more than five.
Not scared though.
"Nah, not one bit."
Heh.
Take your time.
Thank you.
Oh.
Damn.
What's wrong?
Heh.
"My, uh, wallet was in my jacket."
"Oh, no way."
Way.
Do you have money?
I'll pay you back.
I promise.
Yeah.
Um...
Three and change.
That's it?
Yup.
"Mmm, not enough."
Mr. Adda!
-Yeah?
I am not Adda!
I am Chaddha!
Oh Mr. Chaddha!
"-Yeah, go on!"
"Mr. Chaddha, your goods are ready."
-Yeah.
Goods!
What kind of goods?
Where do they come from?
Who are you guys?
I guess you havent recognized us!
"Sir, you had given us rupees five lakh as advance."
And we have kept ready your goods worth 80 lakh!
I think you are forgetting.
I am forgetting!
"Yes, right!"
"So guys, do one thing!"
Just forget about it!
Forget?
"What are you saying, Mr. Adda?"
Mr. Chaddha!
"Mr. Chaddha, dont do this, otherwise we will be ruined!"
..
We might die also!
-Yeah!
What can I do if you are going to die?
"Its all right, if you cant do anything!"
We want to meet your boss!
-Yeah!
Then go to right and turn to left!
"Or are you gonna stand up, spit it out... and go spill theirs?"
- Akan!
- You fuck...
No!
Stop!
I am ordering you to stop!
Henry!
Stop!
Where is he?
No.
"Fuck you, motherfucker!"
Fuck you!
"How could you do this to me, Henry?"
How could you fucking do this?
Answer me!
Answer me!
Motherfucker!
"What happened, Henry?"
You were supposed to love me.
Henry!
Henry!
Listen to your heart!
"Hello, Henry."
"Well, if you're hearing this, there's one more thing I need you to do."
Hey?
You... little... pussy..
"Hello, Henry."
"You can't speak, but that's normal."
"No, that isn't normal, but only temporary, okay?"
Do you remember how you got here?
That's fine.
You're going to become my puppet.
Puppet...?
You plan to brainwash me?
What's that!
You're responsible for this?
!
What are you talking about?
Go take a look!
You're not...!
Hurry!
An android...!
"Don't think you can get away, witch!"
Wait!
We've got to get out of here.
Who the heck are you?
Duck!
Ohh...!
The kidnappers...!
"The kidnapper is Midorikawa, the owner of this ship."
We're getting out of here.
I'll take over from here.
"You, no good robot!"
Looks like you need a spanking.
Very nice!
I told you you needed a spanking.
This food battle is over!
So long!
Enter the Dragon!
My fist is deadly!
Adios!
My name is Chidou;
"first name, Hitomi..."
"No, I don't think so."
"Oh, I got myself something there."
What?
A barrette.
"Oh, stop it, Carrie."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop and you were hiding the bag from me.
"Ok, fine."
I'm sorry.
"Oh, man, I can't believe this."
"At most I thought I was, like, the biggest size at Macy's."
When did I make the crossover?
"2 years ago, Christmas."
"Oh, God!"
"Come on, honey."
What's the big deal?
It's just a big and tall store.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, let me break it down for you."
I'm certainly not tall.
You're tall.
Sure you're tall.
"What are you, 6'2""?"
"I'm 5'9""."
That's pretty damn tall.
"Oh, would you come on?"
All right.
Maybe you're a little bit big.
Why is this even a discussion?
The man is gargantuan.
"Ok, what else came from the big and tall shop?"
Tell me.
What-- this belt?
- Stop it!
Ugh!
[glass shatters] [coughing] [panting]
"Oh, no."
Why did you make me do that?
I guess I'm on my own.
- Psst.
- There you are.
You're all right.
"- Yeah, you are too."
You're ready.
"- Yeah, I know."
That's what I was saying the whole time.
But it feels good to hear you say it.
"- Go get 'em, tiger."
- Ow.

Tell them he's holding his own.
Right.
"Let's get a CBC, lytes, blood gas and coags."
- What's his core temp?
- Eighty-two degrees.
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.
Heated saline.
"Let's start him on lidocaine, 0.8 mgs per minute."
Hope he doesn't go back into V-fib.
"Doug, you're a mess."
You're married!

Get me out of bother.

Oh...
We can duck and cover.
There's a fallout shelter right there.

"-Didn't I name it, Mitch?"
-I wasn't listening.
What were you doing?
He was looking through the drapes.

"We're gonna deal this hand again, play cards or quit."

Shall we go?
Bravo!

Scared of all these men?
No normally there's always a bunch of beggars outside the temple.
Minister Pradhan's sent us.
We're here to take you to ACP Pradhan's farm house.
Come quietly or else we'll beat you up.
No.
I am scared.
I'm frightened.
Look at this I'm getting goose-bumps.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Boss.
Run!
Jump.
You jump.
Tell me something will anybody be at home?
Daddy the Boss is here all alone.
Where are our goons?
Hello sir.
I could've pulverized your goons back there.
But then I had a brainstorm.
I left those rascals back in those lanes.
And I came visiting your home.
"Hi, honey."
Is that my phone in your pocket?
Or are you just happy to see me?
"Oh, God, that's all kinds of wrong."
"Uh, no."
Mine.
"- Okay, I'm gonna go shower."
- Okay.
Quick.
How do I write her back?
Just text her everything ys.
"Yeah, compliment her face without makeup, and tell her it's the best sex you ever had."
This is my son.
"Oh, they're here."
"All right, uh."
"Look, I'd love to stay... and help you pretend to be your son, but I have to go pretend I'm dying."
Hello.
I'm Victoria Chase.
This is Dr. Lori Hernandez.
I'm Dr. Robert Moore.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ah.
Likewise.
"I'm sorry for staring, but I'm just surprised at how well you look."
"Oh, thank you, but I'm tired."
So very tired.
Please sit.
I know that I need to.
"Hmm, that's very odd."
What?
You're not limping at all.
Limping?
Pity yourself for how they'll cripple you!
Poor girl.
"--Here, take it as a keepsake from grandpa!"
"--Pasha, calm down!"
"--Egoists --Pasha, where to?"
Comrade!
Why do you look at me that way?
--Me?
"--Yeah, you"
I wasn't looking at you
No.
You clearly were.
Familiarize yourself.
A monthly pass!
"Hey, pal!"
May I join you?
She kicked me out
Now she'll start begging me back
"""Come in"" she'll say."
"I'll say ""No"" out of principle"
"I have no home, no corner of my own."
"That's how it is, pal"
--And where's yours?
--Who?
--Fedor!
--And I keep silent
--Fedor --Whaaaaat!
Nothing
See that?
I trained her
And you don't just go back either.
Train her good.
"- Eh, the answer is... no."
No?
Then why did you save her from jail?
You taught her to save me.
It's only fair I save her.
What's your relationship with this girl?
Tell me!
"Fung-wu, the Highness is behind this."
He deliberately pinned the blame on us.
Someone is there!
"We're surrounded, let's go inside."
- They're the Ching army!
"- And archery, too!"
What shall we do now?
Their aim is Mr. Chao and me.
We'll escape in different directions.
"Fung-wu, you and Miss Cheung should escape out the back window."
Yan-ling and I will fight them in the front.
Shoot!
Now!
Run!
"You go first, I'll stop them!"
Miss Cheung!
Run!
Let's go together.
I taught you to fight.
Watch out!

"Yes, I know, I know!"
Why you say I know nothing?
"Look, look, look..."
You know the horse?
Uh...
Nitwit or Dragonfly?
Dragonfly!
There isn't a horse called...
you're the nitwit!
"What is ""wit-nit""?"
It doesn't matt...
I could spend the rest of my life having this conversation!
"Please, please try to understand before one of us dies!"
I try.
You're going to forget everything you know about Nitwit.
"No, no, Dragonfly."
Dragonfly!
Yes!
"Sí, sí, sí."
Eventually.
What?
Eventually.
"Uh, at the end."
"No, no, no, forget it now!"
Now?
"Well, pretend you forget!"
Pretend?
"Well, don't say anything to anyone about the horse!"
I know that.
You tell me that this morning!
- Basil...?
- So don't do it again!
"God bless the moon, and God bless me"
And God bless the somebody
I'd want to see
God looked down from up above
And he picked you out for me to love
He picked you out from all the rest
'Cause he knew that I loved you the very best
I see the moon and the moon sees me
And the moon sees somebody I'd want to see
God bless the moon and God bless me
And God bless the somebody I'd want to see
Good morning.
Hey.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Guess what.
What?
I'm pregnant.
You're kidding.
Never more serious.
Wow.
"Oh, uh..."
Are you happy?
Yeah!
Are you happy?
I think so.
"Yeah, I think I am."
Sit down.
Should you sit down?
"I'm only two months along, I'm fine."
"Oh, my God."
A baby.
Straight ahead.
Turn left.
"Your kind of party, huh?"
I was never in a fraternity.
I was much too serious.
I bet you were 29 even when you were 19.
Put it this way.
"If I had to do it again,"
"I'd do it knowing that after you graduate, no one ever gives a fuck what your GPA was."
Hey!
Kim!
Hi!
"This is Sara, and Bridgitte and John."
- Hey.
How's it going?
- Cool.
Sorry about that.
"At the tone, please record your message."
"Chris, it's Jenna."
Michael and you both have your cell phones off.
"Listen, Izzy's dad just died."
"We're all gonna head over there, so I guess I'll see you guys there."
Bye.
Go ahead.
I'll be okay.
"- I want things to be okay, Daddy."
- I know.
Go ahead.
Take care of your friend.
I'm fine.
I really am.
You have no messages.
"Crazy, this."
"One red one you eat, another you don't."
"Look, there's a fine one."
I don't like that one at all...
You silly thing.
Please...
Where are the others?
Where are they all?
- Where are the others?
- There aren't any others.
- What about Henry?
- He's... back there.
"Elisa, someone's looking for you!"
When my pal was dying in the battlefield he asked me to bring you this.
"Elisa, my child..."
Pull yourself together.
"Oh God, what now."
"I've left my message, so goodbye."
Elisa.
Look at me.
Daddy.
Your Grace.
"A great performance, Jean!"
"- Yes, you'll get a medal."
"- Thank you, your Grace..."
A medal?

I've got 'dozens of those!
"Goodness, what happened?"
Henry was killed.
I'm so sorry.
That's life for you... that's life...
It was the same day the girls disappeared.
I was at the farmhouse waiting for a brick.
- It was five in the morning.
- What kind of car was it?
A white Dyane 6.
He drove right past me.
The car had a sticker on the back window.
What kind of sticker?
A woman with long hair and a hat.
- How long?
This long?
- A little shorter.
- What was the hat like?
- Big.
Like a priest.
Like this?
I've seen this before somewhere.
"- Anything else, Fermin?"
- That's what I saw.
Hey.
I did see your problem.
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.
He gave her these towels.
They were from the hotel where he worked in Malaga.
- What was her friend's name?
- Sebastian.
- Sebastian what?
- I don't know.
- Is he from around here?
- I don't know.
- Have you ever seen him?
I just thought maybe we could...
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?
JANINE:
Maybe if you just go over there.
"Just trying to you know, re-light the fire."
"Oh, honey."
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.
Look I'm really trying here.
Do you wanna save our marriage?
Of course.
Me too.
"Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in with the bussers when you can."
Wait a minute.
I'm on 8 through 10.
"Hey, I been working here 18 months, 8 through 10."
ALEX:
Minor oversight.
"Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then."
"Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago."
[WORKERS CHUCKLING]
MAN:
"Yeah, he quit."
Is there any reason we're even having this meeting?
Not really.

ALEX:
Great.
Good.
Great.
Meeting adjourned.

Dad where's Wes?
Jacob.
We'll get him back.

-Why you never call me back?
What's that?
-I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
-I don't know.
"Look, I'm gonna race next week."
Alright?
"I'm gonna win for you and dad, whole town's gonna see it."
Okay.
"-I need you to be there, okay?"
You gotta tell Pam.
Wes?
[Ring]
Let me go.
"Hey mom's still at her bridge club, you wanna come in for a cold one."
(Hollis) I gotta get back.
"Everything's gonna work out just fine, man."

So how was London?
Quiet.
"No bombing since Tuesday, apparently."
I meant the exhibition.
Very successful.
-You think so?
-Babe...
-...
I know so.
-Good.
I love a man who speaks his mind even when it's bullshit.
"Hey, stranger."
"-Hey, you."
-Hey.
What time did you come to bed?
-I tried to wake you.
-Really?
-You didn't move.
-I didn't even feel it.
How did it go yesterday?
-With the apartments.
-Good.
What's the status?
I saw a few things.
Most of them were pretty disgusting.
Yeah.
I think it's gonna take some time.
"I was sure there was something perfect in here, just ready to rent."
So how was work yesterday?
Strange.
"I had to deal with a 16-year-old having an Ecstasy-induced psychotic episode, and he thought I was a Nazi."
How ironic.
-Yeah.
-And upsetting.
"Yeah, he was pretty upset."
-I'm sure.
-This one looks good.
- Yeah.
Shady Lady.
"Oh, my God."
Stop!
Whoa.
"Take a right, Nicolas!"
"Take a right, a right!"

"Hey, Nicolas!"
I need some help here.
Okay.
Somebody get a doctor!
"Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help."
Nicolas!
"I swear to God, I don't know what happened."
He's epileptic.
I should have told you.
- I'll call an ambulance.
"- No, it will pass."
"It's okay, baby."
This hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.
I could kill myself for taking him on that ride.
"It's okay, it's not your fault."
He won't even remember it.
It'll be as if nothing ever happened.
Wanna come in?
I think you could use a drink.
I hope wine's okay with you.
That'll work.
What good is a home if you can't relax in it.

"See you, Hewitt."
"We've done the chairs, Mr Kirkby."
"Are you all right, Mr Kirkby?"
It's this leg.
Gets bad in the cold.
Just need a minute.
Do you want me to go and tell you when the bus is coming?
Then you don't have to stand in the cold.
I walk home.
I'm only down Pattison Street.
That's near me.
"I can walk with you, sir."
I don't think you walk as slow as me.
I can do.
I like walking slow.
"And if I walk on the side of your cold leg it might warm it up, and then it might feel better."
You can lean on me.
I'm dead strong.
I'm always carrying coal and spuds and that for Mam.
"Come on, Tubby!"
Hello!
"Oh, you came."
"Pauline, this is Tubby."

She needs a couple glasses of water and some sleep.

"It's so weird getting older, isn't it?"
Everything just... changes so fast.
"Yeah, but that's supposed to be the exciting part, isn't it?"
Why haven't you ever dated Zach?
Because I never felt like I was...
good enough for him.
"But you like him a lot, right?"
Yeah.
And you think he's handsome.
Yeah.
And he likes that dog of yours.
Yeah.
He loves Bowie.
Stop!
My son is out there!
"No, wait."
"It's me, Hogarth."
Remember?
It's bad to kill.
Guns kill.
And you don't have to be a gun.

You choose.

It's okay.
It's okay.
We gotta show them you're good.

"What are you saying, he's friendly?"
Yes.

He would've gone in search of his father.
- What did you say now?
- My foot!
"You watch cartoons on laptop, he would've left your area along with his father."
"This place is my fortress, I'll get him at any cost."
"Enough of searching there, come on boys."
"Come on boys,"
Find him whether he is here.
Search inside.
- Playing cards?
- How much?
- 250

"Drinks, cards, you need any woman?"
May I send one?
- He's here!
- Who?
Your Godfather!
Singamuthu's son!
He beat my partner.
Hey Konda Reddy!
Has my son come here?
How could I judge it?
I can get it from your scared face.
You're shivering.
You're sweating profusely.
Konda Reddy is scared because my son is here!
"Yes, he has come!"
But he'll not go alive from here.
Come on boys!
Get up!
Come!
Who is it?
Manami Mishio...
Ms. Sugi?
Who's there?
Damn you...
Shadow warriors!
Who are you?
I'm here to see Commander Yonamine and Vice Commander Shikitani.

No need to say a word...
I'll just ask your mind.
"All right, tell me everything."
What's the matter?
Manami...!

Don't talk.
I'll go get help.
No!
Don't go.
I'm scared.
"Yeah, but..."

He isn't.
"He isn't, he isn't."

"Physically, his cells were recoded for optimal capacity."
"Physically, he is the best version."

"Hey, you can't do that, V."
"Oh, yes, I can."
Didn't your mothers tell you not to play in the rain?
Bye.
Thanks.
Thank you.
See you guys.
This is where you live?
Yep.
The yellow house over there.
Do you like it?
Strange place.
Greetings!
"So you have come, finally?"
Everything okay?
Any trouble on the way?
So these were your men?
What you thought?
"You shall take away my ""would be"" bride, and I shall keep watching?"
I love Faiz!
Your marriage shall happen with me.
"""Happiness blossoms."
"But this world confines all the happiness""."
"""I only have this request of you, Keep them free""."

"""These are birds of Love""."

The next bullet shall pass through your head.
"""These are birds of Love""."
Sheen!
"""These are birds of Love""."
Sheen!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Faiz!
- Hello!
- Brother Kadir!
Faiz and Sheen were to get married.
But Shadab got to know of it.
I think we both know it didn't go as well as we'd have liked.
But I've heard from your previous employer and she speaks of you in glowing terms.
"So, I've decided to offer you the job."
Yes!
Yes!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Bang!
Yes!
I got you the job!
I got you the job!
"Oh, I got a job!"
Oh!
That is brilliant.
I'm gonna take you for a walk on the seafront.
"- Cos, boy, do I know how to celebrate!"
- Yeah.
- We got a job.
- Yeah.
- Ajob!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Oh!
"- Get out of here, you."
Oh!
You're dressed already.
What a shame.
- I'm not sure about this.
"- Oh, that was Number Two's."
He was a smallish gentleman.
That's why he only lasted such a short time.
But I think it's a close enough fit.
"Yeah, well, I usually go for a more relaxed vibe."
"Oh, but the great and the good are gathering."
"No, really, I'm fine."
Fine?
You must be exhausted.
"Multitasking, multi-flirting."
"No, I'm used to it."
"I think jealousy uses much more energy, negative energy."
Are you feeling okay?
"Oh yeah, I'm good."
I'm going over to Ricky's tonight.
"Okay, everyone out!"
"(SIGHS) Thanks, Adrian, see you around."
See you later.
Text me.
"So, let me guess."
You're going over to Ricky's to meet Amy?
"Yeah, she says she wants to meet me."
She wants to be friends.
"You know her, right?"
"Yeah, I know her."
And I kind of doubt she wants to be friends with you.
She's not going to like you.
She's probably setting you up.
It is a setup.
They're introducing me to someone.
Who?
"I don't know, but, uh, should be fun."
Could I have some more coffee?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I just ran out.
I'll have to make you some new coffee.
Hi.
Hi yourself.
You're looking for typefaces.
"You've got 45 seconds, two passes, remember."
Reveal the hive.
Helvetica.
Helvetica.
Press the letter?
Correct.
Simon.
30 seconds.
Two passes remaining.
20 seconds...
Pass.
"Pass, Helen."
Courier.
Courier?
Correct.
Simon.
"Ten seconds, one pass left."
Five seconds.
"No, you're out of time."
"Simon, you could've passed if you couldn't see it."
I did say.
One pass left.
You were concentrating...
It wouldn't have helped.
It wouldn't have helped!
All right.
"OK, let's see what you got."
"Courier, which is the standard typeface for writing plays."
And is the default setting in Hollywood.
You also found Helvetica.
Do you know where that was developed?
"Okay, I'm going to wash it."
So put the pillow on now.
Now person number one is going to go.
Might be me.
Might be Rebecca.
"- Okay, you go."
- I don't want your cooties.
Wipe it off.
Okay.
Person number two- citizen two is beginning now.
Get away.
- Can I have the washcloth?
- The wet one or the dry one?
The dry one.
"So, what was the difference?"
"Yeah, who was better- number one or number two?"
You were exactly the same.
I couldn't tell the difference.
"As far as everything goes with you,Jim-"
Are you guys all packed foryour mom's?
Yeah.
- What's that?
- Dave planted it.
What a romantic guy.
I'm in here.
Come in.
Okay.
"Well, I'm off."
I'm just brushing my teeth.
"God, I used to hate that nightgown."
"Other people have to look at it, but they can't read it."
That's the point.
- I am so glad that you guys are here.
"- Well, thank you for inviting us."
We miss you.
"Yeah, well, Eddie's been out on the road, you know."
- Eddie's been on the road?
- Yeah.
"So the midget says, ""Hey, that's why I became a taxidermist."" Ha-ha-ha."
- Hey.
- You can't say that anymore.
"Whatever. ""Munchkin."" It's a good joke."
It's a good joke.
It's a good joke.
- What?
What?
- I keep missing things.
- I'm actually working on that...
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Hey.
- I got it.
Under control.
Under control.
Where is he going?
"Hey, you guys know the one about the Wisconsin farmer"
- and the burnt barn?
- I'm sure you're gonna tell us.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
We've been through this before.
It's gonna be fine.
- Is everybody gone?
"- Yeah, they're gone."
- I'm really sorry.
Yeah.
That's fantastic.
"Well, where to begin?"
"Well, first off, it's not just a bunch of nude farming."
Dad.
- Wow.
- Let's look at Stonehenge.
Obviously not a coincidence.
They didn't have the machinery to move those rocks.
They're huge.
"- Yeah, they're heavy."
- Of course.
"[""IF I NEVER SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN"" BY MAROON 5 PLAYING ON STEREO]"
- I'm Nathan.
And this is Bruce.
- Gigi.
- Gigi.
Hi.
- Hey.
So how do you guys know Alex?
We don't.
Our friend Mary heard about this from some guy named Conor.
And how do you know Alex?
I hope...
I'm pretty sure that something's about to happen between us.
BRUCE:
Ooh.
NATHAN:
Oh.
"So are you here as, like, a guest, or, like, his date?"
"Oh, I hate that."
When you don't know if you're a date.
Two minutes to target.
Clear the area.
Get back in there!
The Department of Homeland Security..
Get in there!
This is a mandatory evacuation..
Emily.
"No, please, please, baby."
Look at me.
I'm right here.
Tabriz targeted.
Confirm Tabriz.
"Please, baby, you gotta turn around and look at me."
Damn it.
Evacuate this area immediately!
"We need you to move back, people!"
Move back now!
Emily!
Get out of here!
There's an air strike coming!
My daughter was in there.
Emily Cale.
She's still in there.
Wait!
Emily!
What is with this family?
Wait for me!
Confirm Tehran.
Targeting complete.
Armed for nuclear launch.
You have 15 seconds to initiate.
"Fifteen, 14.."
This isn't good.
This is fabulous.
I love it.
"Oh, Cookie shake."
"Oh, he loves it too."
And Cookie's never wrong.
It's a hit.
You guys are amazing.
"Amazing, yes."
"I was just saying, the minute I wrote it,"
I knew it was the song for you.
"Well done, Megan."
"Come on, Cookie, let's find someone who can take you for a walk."
Love the layers...
"Tanya, can you believe it?"
Livi loves the song I wrote for her.
We're now officially
"""amazing..."""
Where have you been'?
An ice-cold milkshake for you.
Forget the drinks.
I've got just the task for you.
"If you do it well, you can record your own song, become rich and famous and make a gazillion new friends."
How does that sound?
I'm all ears.
Uh...
- Oh.
"- That was, um, original."
Thanks.
It's called Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Uh...
Why?
"Oh, Carol."
"Oh, God!"
"Hey, Jack."
Amy told me the good news.
"In my culture, when two people start dating, you give them a present."
They're condoms.
"Hm, I really thought these would have wrappers."
You seem to be enjoying this.
Nice to see cocky Jack Gordon uncomfortable for once.
Yeah.
Especially because of that secret you have with Jack.
[laughs]
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, I think you do."
A real challenge... delicious!
Just tell me what happened.
Sex?
Rehab?
Embezzlement?
Sex?
Animal fighting?
Hit and run?
Sex?
Roland's secret son?
"Damn it, woman!"
You're showing no emotion!
How is this possible?
!
I'm British.
"I think the real question should be, Mason, why the obsession with secrets?"
Who betrayed you?
"I'm telling you, those moms are scary, snobby and judgmental."
And you're not judgmental?
"Hey, it's not called judgmental when you're right."
It's called right.
"I mean, I know Ritchie likes it there, but, God, I wish I fit in better, you know?"
Is this Portuguese?
Hold this.
"Yeah, it's close enough."
Let's go.
Give me a hug.
"Quick, big hug."
Ooh.
"- Adios, or whatever."
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh.
Your map of Portugal.
- Map of Portugal.
Right.
- There you go.
- Yeah.
Play nice.
"You too, Ritchie."
Ah.
Portugal.
Jewel of Iberia.
Largest producer of cork in the world...
And that's all I know about Portugal.
"And yet, you still might be the world's foremost authority."
"All right, I'm gonna get going."
I'll see you later.
All right.
Look son.
You should be careful in such situations.
Otherwise you will stumble.
Who stumbled?
No... no one.
I was just saying he should be careful in life... otherwise one stumbles.
Yes.
That's a good advice.
Right.
And son.
You know whom we're sending you to in Delhi.
Your uncle sub-inspector Zoravar.
Yes.
He'll take good care of you.
And I've heard he's no ordinary man.
The whole of Delhi's afraid of him.
I've heard that people fear him... more than 'Chulbul Pandey' and 'Singham'.
Zoravar's so feared... that he always catches the goons he's after.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Beat him.
Uncle.
I never imagined...
I'd come to Delhi and see you in this condition.
- How did this happen?
- Nephew.
They were 20 and I was alone.
How could I?
With all the stuff I was bringing.
"Nina, will Tasik bring Irishka from the kindergarten?"
"I must tell you something, only don't get scared, please."
- What?
- Stasik and I are separated.
- Divorced?
"- Not yet, but it's going to happen."
"- Oh, Nina!"
"- Mama, I beg you!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Mama, please."
"I'm begging you, mama."
I wouldn't have told you if I knew you'd be bewailing.
"How can you, you got a daughter!"
"I've just informed you, that's all."
I wish I'd never come here!
I'm going away from here.
Nina!
Nina!
"- What is it, mom?"
- They're there with those snags!
"And look, up there!"
Your man!
A real hero!
"Oh, mama!"
It's for me.
- Why for you?
- I swear.
Listening.
Playing again?
No brains mean a cripple.
Something's very wrong here.
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.
I'm from DC.
Look.
"It's a wallet, okay?"
Wallet?
I'm from DC.
My name is John Klein.
Washington Post?
Yes.
Yes.
Can I get out of this shower now?
"You can wait for me outside, Mr. Klein."
We'll run a check on him.
"Anyone else comes by, forget the gun."
Just call me.
Just find out what he wants.
"So, you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?"
No.
But I heard the knocking.
Three nights in a row.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
"I'm gonna give you a ride into town, unless you wanna sleep in your car."
I can call for a tow in the morning.
You're a long way from DC.
What are you doing here?
Driving through.
"We're not on the way to anyplace, Mr. Klein."
I recognize you.
DC Review.
- You watch that?
- No.
I'm fine.
Follow us in the car.
Get support.
"Do you know what you're doing, Harry?"
Hold on tight.
"Screen's up, sir."
"God, don't let Clayton be driving."
"Harry, stay back!"
Get down.
Slow down!
Jesus!
Give him room!
Harry!
I see it.
Give me machete.
- What's the simple solution to the Fenchurch and Lau murders?

"Kevin, don't."

Follow the lady!

"He took such great care of me and the kids, and..."
- This is gonna sound weird. [Chuckles]
- Please.
My life?
No judgment.
L-lt's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that... but I...
I wanted... the opportunity... to show him that I could be there for him.
You know?
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what recovery is all about.
"You know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
[Chuckles]
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids... boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
[Sighs] Assembly line.
Boring.
- Come on.
I told you.
That if none of them make it back...
Then the photographs they took at the exchange...
Tell a story I think most of us would rather keep private.
"Thank you, Minister."
GRANT:
Major.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(INCOHERENT CHATTERING)
CRAWFORD:
"Yeah, I've got your back."
Move.
What is it?
Arak.
Drink.
Then we shall eat.
(CHUCKLES)
(ASSEMBLING GUN)
"Come on, get it together."
Do you wish to know how much your father thinks you are worth?
I have no father.
You are all of his world.
He destroys worlds.
Like all men of violence.
(SIGHS)
"Let's just get this over with, shall we?"
(MEN CHATTERING)
SUBIN:
Help me!
Help me!
"(SOBBING) Stop, help me!"
Subin!
She is not your concern.
Wasn't that enough?
Stop walking around.
"Frankie, go do some homework."
I've done my homework.
Do some reading.
Watch TV.
Do something.
"Grandpa, all I need is the truck."
I know you know that I mean.
"Come on, Ma, let me have the truck."
I got a date!
What do you take me for?
The Hong Fats have a son...
Frankie.
He's cool;
American style.
His parents are Chinese-style cool.
"Frankie likes going out, but they'd rather he work in the store, selling milk and bread and lizards."
Ugh!
"I mean, do I try to interfere with your bookkeeping?"
!
My business is comedy!
That's what I do!
I'm funny!
I'm the funny guy!
"Yes, you are."
They're the money guys.
"Okay, slippery, bath time's over."
Come out with your hands up.
But I just got in.
"Oh, sure."
I believe that one.
"10 years ago to this day, his father died here."
He was waiting for a train as he did every evening.
"He had a good job, happy family."
"And one evening, he'd had enough."
"And when the express came by, he jumped."
Was he a friend of yours?
"And these last few days,"
Dennis has come here every evening.
- Every evening.
- Do you ever answer a question?
Look at him.
- Why should I?
- Look at him.
"Because in about two minutes,"
Dennis there will be dead.
What the f...
You're crazy.
Completely crazy.
"You gotta take the Chambers Street Exit, right across the platform."
Look!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
"Listen, don't do it!"
"Please, put the gun down!"
Is this your first time?
You seem kind of young.
He's here to see Dr. Kay.
- Okay.
- He'll come get you in the day room.
- This way?
- Mm-hmm.
- Will I?
"- Yeah, totally."
"You've got the pony bug now, and there's no cure for that."
- Granddaughter 1 returns.
- That's my girl.
Back in time for dinner.
"Okay, I've had the most insane day."
I don't know where to start.
Uh...
"Sam, she asked me to help with Raven, he's a horse."
"And Pin was like, ""Back off, tourist."""
- And I...
- You've been at the stables?
"It sounds like you had fun, whatever you were doing."
Everybody's actually kind of cool.
Apart from Mia...
I don't want you riding.
What?
Why?
Because I need you keeping an eye on Rosie.
- She could come with me.
- Rosie at a stable?
I don't think so.
Okay.
It's fine.
She doesn't have to be with me the whole time.
This isn't up for discussion.
I've got enough to worry about with Gramps and your dad and...
Just... promise me.
No riding.
Sure.
No riding.
And she became a billionaire.
Weren't you going to call Philip?
- Who do we know with money?
"- Philip, Jonas and Tommy."
Why?
We'II do what Anna Nicole Smith did.
Hook a guy with money.
- Sounds a bit risky to me.
- What else can we do?
Move to Virum and end up like Vanessa?
Add Bjarke to the list.
He's dying to screw me.
- Patricia?
- Sofie?
Where have you been?
- What happened?
- Simon's been really worried.
- I've been sleeping in the park.
- Why?
- I said no and that's that.
- I'm sick of you.
You never think of anyone but yourself and I'm sick of school...
I hate you.
"Stop it, Simon."
"I am not in the mood, OK?"
- She looks just like you.
- You creep!
You'd be great in porn.
You fuck just like her.
Didn't you hear mum?
She totally lost it.
What did she say?
- Not for idea.
"Yes, yes."
- Not gonna happen.
"Strength, me dia."
"Then, Mr. Duncan Lloyd..."
Are you serious?
- Only when I can not breathe.
Did you really recognize that border guard?
A few years ago I made a film about Balkan beauties.
How do you speak Serbian?
- I've been here during the war.
We have a problem.
It must be from civil war.
"- No, there were floods."
Do you see all those locked woods there?
Water has passed.
A nice nuisance.
This is not a scene with a destroyed bridge.
It is a scene with a very different obstacle.
An obstacle to me and my past difficult.
Duncan!
Duncan Lloyd!
It's me!
Dragan!
OMG.
"What the hell are you doing here, man?"
I?
What the hell are you doing in my Serbia?
Get your camcorder and movie.
"Dragan, brother."
- Duncan the Beone.
My friend.
"Three, judge."
"Thank you, judge."
Three for the judge.
Ten dollars.
I'll let you off with a light sentence.
Pair of nines.
Pair of dogs.
"I didn't know you had a twin brother, judge."
"All right, Brock, the door's open."
"It's temporary, anyhow."
"Who opened it for me, Bill;"
I suppose I ought to say thanks.
I don't know the party.
Ho!
[playing piano]
"Brock, you're home."
"Papa, Brock's home."
"Well, were you still as lucky;"
"Oh, sure, I'm always lucky."
"-Stop that, play something else."
-Like;
"Well, anything but that funeral march."
Play something with people in it.
Can't have a funeral without people.
Have dinner;
Yeah.
Ate at Bailey's place on the way out.
"-Brock said he was lucky again, Papa."
-Really;
That's funny.
-Looks to me like the boys took him.
-They tried.
Guess he wasn't a person after all.
"V, Cash said that you took the money."
That's not true.
"I, I believe you, but... you got to tell Waltzer in person."
Um...
"T ell me where you are, and I'll come to you."
V?
Got to...
"Oh, shit."
Got to get out of here.
Okay.
Oh!
Excuse me.
"Sorry, excuse me."
Thank you.
Who do I need to find?
What am I doing?
"Uh, Dad."
Dad.
Find Dad.
"Um, excuse me."
I'm looking for Frank's father.
He's a teacher here.
"Oh, what's his goddamn name?"
"His name is, um..."
T om.
"T om, that's his name."
...the edges on the sedge.
That's one of the ways you can tell-- sedges have edges.
"Now, if you look at the composition of this soil closely under a microscope, you could see traces of thousands and thousands of years of evolution."
"Thanks, Mr. Wheeler."
"You're welcome, Nate."
I'm so sorry!
"- Don't worry, Jocelyn."
How do you know my name?
I don't know.
"This is Paul Rochester, Deputy Art Director."
Hello.
Have a nice tour.
Thanks.
Well... you go...
you go that way.
- Where to now?
- The Beauty Department.
"- What, what is it?"
- Whore!
- Who?
- Whore is here.
- Roxane Rochett?
"- Not that whore, the nail enamel!"
- Whore!
- What does it mean?
"It means fuck me, but respect me."
"Worship my body, but the upkeep is going to be costly."
"Stripe me, spurn me, treat me as your Spaniel."
I'm your dog and I'm gonna break the leash on you!
"- Calm down, Cornelia!"
Arf!
Arf!
- I'm sorry!
Just transports me to a dirty corner of 42nd street.
- Breathlessly.
- That's naughty!
- I adore the shade!
- What the fuck?
- Come on!
"Down, set, go!"
TTD:
"There it is, right there."
"Put it on, quarterback!"
"Aw, shit!"
"Man, chase his ass."
Chase him.
- Get him!
What are you smiling for?
"- Dude, run!"
Y'all take five.
Good play.
Take five.
- Come here.
- Where the hell are you throwing?
"Sorry, Rick."
You know what a skinny post is?
"Why the fuck are you throwing it so high, man, and behind me?"
"Man, we don't even call plays at my school."
School?
What you... you in...
what school you go to?
- Miami-Dade High.
- You in high school?
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Really?
I'ma really kick your ass if you don't get to step...
Get out of here.
"T, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
"We got Amendola, Gronk, and Edelman working with Brady."
I don't have time for this.
"I am sick, damn it!"
I'm the one that is out of time.
"Jacob, I am dying."
You have to stay and do what we have decided.
- Nothing has been decided.
- Anna will need you.
And Helene...
And the boys...
"They're so young, Jacob."
"Look at me, Jacob!"
Don't you see that there is a point to all of this?
"You have a responsibility here, Jacob."
Do I have to live on the other side of the world to get your help?
"Hi, Anna."
It's Jacob.
Would you please call me?
I need to speak to you.
Call as soon as you can.
I'm leaving now.
I have to go take care of my hubbie.
Anna?
Is something wrong?
- Can I sleep here?
"- Yes, of course."
"Anna, what happened?"
There.
- Hello.
"- Mrs. Shaw, it's Jacob."
"- Hi, Jacob."
Want to talk to Pramod?
"- No, just let him sleep."
What...
What is going on?
I needed to see you.
And this is how you do it?
Uh...
You abandoned me.
You walked away from me when I needed you the most.
- I'm sorry.
- That's not good enough!
"After the accident, I had to get my life together."
And what about my damn life?
It took me two years to get back on my feet.
You were the only thing that kept me going.
"Kaman, what happened to you?"
What do you think happened to me?
[Boy] Mommy?
Who else is here?
"Mommy, what's wrong?"
[Woman] That's my sister's son.
"Uh, go back upstairs, baby."
- Go back upstairs.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.
"He said ""Mama."""
"The boy's confused, Kaman."
Is that your son?
"[Tracy] No, Kaman."
Don't you stand in front of me and lie to my face.
"Kaman, drop it."
"You shoot me, I drop this, and they burn."
Then what?
"You move, you die."
Now he wants to be mortal again...
To repay society for his sins...
To emerge from his world of darkness...
From his endless forever night.
Thanks for your help.
I appreciate it.
"Your name, please?"
Angie W.
"[CHUCKLES] Angie W., Tricia S., Tony D."
Don't any of you people have any last names?
"Look, I heard the gunshot,"
"I saw the fire, just like a hundred other people, all right?"
Can I go now?
"Yeah, yeah, you can go."
"Hey, but first, uh..."
"Can I bum a smoke, please?"
[LAUGHS] Sure.
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"All right, here."
Right.
Having a rough time?
"Nasty, nasty habit."
I'm handling it.
That's what they all say.
"Seriously, I'm just down to one a day, a pack a month, tops."
Really.
"And, um, how many more do you bum?"
"A few, and you must be Clara B., right?"
Clara Barton?
No.
Monica.
Let's go.
Hail Mahadev!
Look.
I've already been punished for my crimes.
Let's end this enmity.
For that one needs to kill the enemy.
Understand!
Go on.
Kill him!
Catch him.
No matter what color you paint on black... it'll still remain black.
Raghunath.
He's already slipped out of our hands.
And now he's out of Satyakant Shashtri's life too.
Shiv.
Listen carefully.
Satyakant has just one son.
And that's you.
And you.
Satyakant.
Get out of here.
There's no place for a murderer in Dharam kunj.
From today you're dead for me and for all of us.
You're dead!
You're dead!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
So Boss.
You should've called me instead uncle.
No no it's always the needy that come to the provider.
How can someone like you be sulking?
"And Richard, you either tell me right now what's got your brother so riled up, or I end this goddamn thing right now!"
Tell him.
"Tell him, or I'll show him."
- Show him what?
- [Richie sighs]
She's a... a...
What she means  is that she's not a...
"Say goodbye, Reina!"
You're goin' home!
[grunts]
Ah!
[roaring]
What the... ?
So that's what you were tryin' to tell me.
That's not all.
[roaring] [grunting]
"Oh, this is some serious B-movie shit."
[gagging] [gun clicking]
Ah!
[Groans]
- [Eddie shouts]
- What the hell are you doing?
Gotta take care of this son of a bitch old school!
"- Come on, you bastard!"
- Eddie!
Ahh!
[grunts]
- [Richie] Whoa!
"- [Seth] Hang on, Eddie, we're gonna..."
- We're gonna get you help.
"- Hey, Eddie, don't move."
"Just look at me, man."
Be a good girl.
"Whoa, Annie!"
Just the bars!
Alert the guards!
- Wake up!
- What?
The Thugs are here!
Why didn't you say so?
I'd like to get a crack at them.
What happened?
- Dacoits slipped in and stole elephant.
- What's that?
Thugs stole Annie.
Stole Annie?
They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?
- Couldn't see.
- Where did they go?
- The hills.
- Sound assembly.
"Sgt. Ballantine, pick 16 men and follow me."
"MacCheesecake, if this is another of your tricks..."
Fall in the remainder!
Put every man on guard duty!
"- Very good, sir."
"- Steal Annie, will they?"
I'll break every Thug's back in India!
"Din, are you sure you're on the right trail?"
"Yes, sahib."
"Here is the bridge, sahib."
- Is this bridge safe?
"- It's safe, sahib."
You mean like this?
Yeah.
Where did that come from?
My spa treatment.
Cupping.
Cupping?
Yeah.
"You know, I thought it was gonna hurt, but honestly, I snoozed through the whole thing."
"By the time I woke up, I was down two dress sizes."
"Before the cupping, did you eat any pudding?"
Darn tootin'.
Licked the bowl clean.
[ Laughs ]
"Donna, do you remember who did this treatment?"
"Oh, yeah."
You betcha.
"[ Laughs ] Evelyn, you are looking great."
Just 10 more pounds till your goal weight.
Do you mind if I borrow my wife for a sec?
I'll be back.
[ Chuckles ]
"Looking good, ladies."
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]
The new guys aren't personal trainers.
What are you talking about?
I did a little digging.
I found this in their glove compartment.
They're Feds?
Worse.
They're hunters.
Why are hunters here?
- Stronger.
- What?
[Scoffs] Michael Jackson couldn't have handled those.
Where'd you get those?
Will it show up on the test?
Will these narcotics show up on a drug test?
- Hey.
- What?
"Seriously, why don't we do this more often?"
- Okay.
- [Laughs]
[Knock on door]
"Uh, lieutenant, you got some visitors."
They're early.
My sister has ruined more nooners for me than the rest of the world combined.
You had a lot of these growing up?
How do you think I put myself through med school?
[Laughs]
"Come on, aunt Hallie."
It starts in five minutes.
"Uh-oh, what do we have here?"
VIP guests for the parade?
- Aunt Hallie!
- Hey.
"- Hey, Viv."
Hey.
- How ya doing?
- Can't complain.
- Good?
"- How's, um--how's your mom?"
- Viv.
"No, it's fine."
Yes.
And absolutely the best car in this garage?
- Lime green 'cuda.
- This American shit?
"Point is, I'm a good guy."
"Oh, no, you're a bad guy, sweetheart."
But...
I keep your secret.
[Singsongy] Bad guy.
There's no secrets.
"See you later, bad guy."
Bad guys don't turn that down.
Okay?
[Under breath] Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
Watching my girlfriend.
I got some bad news.
Your girlfriend's marrying that creepy old dude.
That's just her Dad.
- She was kissing him.
- You kiss Dad.
Not like that.

"[Candy rattles, bowls thuds]"
I cannot tell you how excited my baby is right now.
So I'm not familiar with Jewish weddings.
Is there anything special?
A request you might have?
"We are far from traditionalists down here, Robin."
Just speak from the h... oh.
Dagnabbit.
- Oh.
"I have high blood pressure, I can't take this."
Shame on you!
Inspector!
No toothbrush.
But we found 2 pineapples.
Where from?
From them!
"Help me get rid of them, quick!"
"- Get rid of them, sure!"
- Yes.
I meant the pineapples!
Inspector!
Inspector Robin!
I've been waiting for you!
For me?
What for?
- To be friends with you!
- Friends?
Do you mind if I sit on your bed?
Not at all.
You can do anything you like on my bed.
"Make yourself at home, feel free!"
I'm a very easy-going person!
- Inspector Robin!
- Just call me Robin!
"Robin, I want to...!"
What do you want to do with me?
I want to chat with you!
O.K. let's talk while we're still sober.
"Robin, I...!"
"Control yourself, Bridget!"
- Can I have a drink!
See you then.
"Dennis, I have an idea."
"- Well, this is awesome."
- Yeah.
This is amazing.
There's blood everywhere.
It's beautiful.
"Yeah, and we were totally right."
These guys don't have technique.
They get all cranked up like animals and beat the Christ out of each other.
Look at all this money being thrown around.
"- Dude, we gotta get in on this."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Really, I think it's about who can take the biggest beating."
- Yeah.
Get up!
You know who can take a really good beating?
- Charlie.
- Charlie.
Here she is...
The old gym.
Smell that?
- That's the smell of hard work.
- And feet.
That's the smell of big dreams.
The smell of glory.
- It smells like feet.
- And feet.
Does smell like feet.
- Frank?
"- Oh, shit."
Frankie Fast Hands!
"-Well, then, let's climb aboard."
"-No, no, no, wait, Buzz!"
Buzz!
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.
Negative.
There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.
-We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
"-Yeah, bu..."
Buzz!
Buzz!
"That's two lefts and a right, huh?"
"-Thanks for the directions, okay?"
-Yeah.
"And remember, kid..."
Buzz!
It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay.
What an idiot.
Next shuttle lift-off is scheduled for
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
The white zone is for immediate pizza...
Sheriff!
There you are.
"Now, the entrance is heavily guarded."
We need a way to get inside.
"Great idea, Woody."
I like your thinkin'.
You are clear to enter.

"Fung-wu, stand back."
"Your Highness, this wine is!"
"Master, it must be an extra old vintage."
Very smart.
Check!
Good move!
This bottle is a gift from the king.
A rare wine!
"Yes, it can stimulate the belly of warriors."
"Master, it's good for your stamina, too."
Check!
You'll lose!
Good move.
Please have a drink!
Master Law!
Thanks!
One more!
"Your Highness, how about you?"
I used to have it every day!
"Try more, this is a good wine."
"Master, you better try one more!"
That's right.
"With good wine and lovely women, everything is changed."
Even a master will ignore his student's presence.
It's nothing serious..
- Hey...
I want the answer.
- Sir...
He had been taking photos of the women coming to the restaurant discreetly...
A customer noticed it.
He was caught.
"When everyone started hitting him, he escaped."
"If we report it to the police, our restaurant will get a bad name..."
So we handled the situation and let it go.
Where is he now?
Is nobody there in the neighbouring house?
"No idea, Sir."
The guy who was working at Beach Walk restaurant.
His name is Dinesh.
It's him.
Yes.
He was working in some hotel.
- Where is he?
"I don't know, Sir."
He should be somewhere around.
Thanks.
(boys chattering)
"Sorry, Sir."
Please throw the ball.
I just said sorry.
"Throw the ball, Sir."
"Oh, here you are!"
Met him?
They came searching for you.
"Hey, stop!"
Hey!
"Porter, have you heard of her?"
Exactly.
Nouveau riche.

- I'm happy that you're pleased.
You may be feeling stress.
So... this tonic may calm your nerves.
How are you responding to the tonic?

You're too late!

It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to--
"- Ursula, stop!"

"Why, King Triton!"
How are you?
- Let her go!
"- Not a chance, Triton!"
She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I--
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable... even foryou."
"Ofcourse, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter ofthe great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange... for someone even better.
"- Eric, what are you doing?"
"- Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!
No!
"Oh, no!"

And I Iove her for it.

"No, she's badly hurt."
Her brain.
They already arrested Albert.
I sent Clay and Sadie down there.
I'll have to go down there myself.
I promised Shannon I'd take her to the Father-Daughter Dance at the club tonight.
"I have no idea how long l'll be with Albert, so--"
"Oh, Dad, Dad--"
"Just drive her over there, and I'll catch up."
- Just drive her there?
"- Yeah, right."
Samantha's case is up.
All right.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Well... she's up.
Um... will you be OK here?
His hotel room is just a block away.
I'll be right back.
I'm late.
Your-- Your dad went home.
"So, um... your ne_ hearing is in 28 days."
OK.
And we will get you moved then.
28 days.
That's when we'll move you.
It must be at least 18 years now.
"We drive up to Germany, up to the Fuhrer's headquarters."
"To Berchtesgaden, and then to the Eagle's Nest."
Because it interests me.
A couple of times now they've questioned me.
The police.
"The Gestapo, or whatever."
It's not called the Gestapo anymore.
I'm on their list.
My name shows up.
They look in their computer:
"""Ochs, Josef."
Marz...
"Holy Christ!"""
It means you have quite a record.
My sweet little mouse.
"Sophia, Sophia."
My darling.
Your cheeks are all red.
Are you warm?
We'll take your bonnet off.
"Look, where are we?"
"Look, in Daddy's basement."
Look!
At night he's down here at the computer.
He works all night.
"Look, my little mouse."
Look at all the paper he needs.
"That doesn't interest you, sure."
"It's fun, you can watch TV."
"Look, sweetie."
You can see yourself in the TV.
-Perfect!
"-keep quiet, she already comes."
Thanks.
-Young lady.
-Yes?
You often suffers migraine?
From time to time.
"You feel nauseous, dispepsia, schizophrenia?"
"Good, in fact..."
"Sickness, pains to the legs?"
Why?
I am ill?
-It is possible.
-It could be serious.
"Please, Professor, help me."
We would have to examine you.
-I undress?
-You are not embaressed?
"-Good, in fact..."
"-Young lady, we are doctors."
We on a daily basis see a great amount of naked women.
"Good, then..."
"Well, we will help you."
-Lie down in the sofa.
-Comfortable position.
We are going to examine you.
"-Lie down, trust us."
We undo this...
"-Everything, Doctor?"
"-Yes, it is better."
He already is...
"The next time, a bad zipper"
- Shut up!
"- Dude, come on..."
- I said shut up!
Go!

Help!
"Excuse me, can I see your ticket?"
That trunk yours...?

"Hey, it's Fred!"
My life is a horror movie!
It's so scary!
I'm so scared!
"And you'll be, too, once you hear about it."
You'll be scared and scarred.
Scare-arr-red!
"That's a new word I just made up, scared and scarred combined."
Which is what you'll be.
I'm gonna go get a snack.
Do you want to hear about it or not?
Meet me in the kitchen.
"Usually, I lead a very normal life, go to school, hang with friends, see my girl."
"You remember Judy, right?"
Freddie

Ho ho ho.

"It's full up in here, as the vicar said with his hand up Sam Fox's blouse."
Show us your tits.
"But seriously, folks."
The Good Lord gave us the gift of laughter.
- Get off!
- Ha ha ha.
"Thank God the likes of Tony Benn can't take that away from us, although he'd like to."
"Tell us a joke, then, you fat bastard."
I hear Arthur Scargill's blind stick lost his hairdresser.
"- You have to laugh, don't you?"
- Not at you.
"Two, three, four..."
Happiness
Happiness...
Thank you.
"God bless you, one and all."

Fire calling fuse.

"Mattia, hearme?"
Shoot!
"- hello, Mattia?"
Got a minute?
I'm off the clock.
I want you to give Griff his job back.
- No.
"There, less than a minute!"
"- Well, let's talk about this."
- He almost killed a patient.
- It was an accident!
It's still no.
- Just like that?
- Yup.
- No discussion?
"- Uh, no."
Alright.
I'm not leaving until we talk about this.
Close the door on the way out.
I need to eat.
"Frank, wait!"
Nicole...
"It's OK, I just,"
"I just wanna sit with her for a bit, OK?"
OK.
I yelled down the stairs.
- What?
"- When she left for work, I was too tired to go downstairs and kiss her goodbye."
You didn't know.
No one does.
I never in a million years thought I'd marry a woman.
"I had a boyfriend, we were serious, and..."
"I met Stephanie at some first responders thing, fundraiser, and  all my everything turned upside down."

It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in jackson,pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That james finn has been dead three months.
He left for iraq three nths ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay,but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
Now I want to know who that other woman is.
We're not here to talk about that.
"Is she saying that she's engad to jimmy,too?"
"'Cause if tt's true, he better hope he's dead,or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connecte on a deep,spiritual level."
"When I worked there last summer,"
I spent every day jumping JCBs over cement mixers.
"- Well, that's a lie."
- And I got paid a grand at the end.
- Another lie!

Is that alle?
- I hope so.
- It's not.

I wasn't expecting you till next month.

You know my expenses.

"You see, I don't feel anything, isn't that great?"
"I never thought about what I would feel, I was only thinking about YOU."
"I only wanted to make YOU happy, I never thought I was good enough for you."
"Oh, but you are good enough for me, Rose."

Would you like some of ours?
We keep an extra supply.
Yes.

The Prime Minister amended a few things.
"By the way, firm handshake is customary in Turkey."
It's so short now.
Brussels insisted on being brief.
"Apparently, after my speech in Scotland."
I thought I improvised well.
Very well.
"Carlos, please."
"Sire, I think you should refrain from comments."
Excuse me.
Your Majesty?
Of course.

She was having so much fun with that little girl.
"And then i saw the father, and he was flying a kite with his son."
They were having fun.
And there was a couple...
A couple about my age...
And they were
"On a blanket in the middle of the park,"
"Just laughing, enjoying each other."
And i thought about the fact
That i have never been on a blanket...

I...
I haven't been a good mother.

Where are the coins?
Where are the coins?

[Landing blow]
Who are you?
I'm the one who asks the questions.
Where are the coins?
[Groans] I don't have them.
They were taken from me.
Give me his name.
Farley Kolt.
Kolt does not have them.

Captain?

Stay here.
"What kind of person do you think I am, to bring me here?"
"It's immoral, unethical and a bad example to the common people."
What a lovely bottom!
"Brother Foon, what's brought you here?"
I've missed you.
- Really?
- Marshal?
Marshal?
Shall we go?
"Since we're here, I want to find out if they employ any underage girls."
"- Come on, drink up."
"- OK, I'll drink up."
- Drink.

"Mousy, relax."
You've gone red.
It's because I drank too much wine.
You've been drinking soya sauce!

Yes.
I'm inside.
Be careful.
Marilyn could come home at any minute.
"Okay, Ricky."
Oh my.
"Marnie, what are you doing?"
I'm dusting for fingerprints.
And a little dirt.
"Come on, Marnie."
Looks for something that looks like a clue.
"Sorry, Ricky."
Let's start looking right now.
It's a very scary foyer.
I'm going to look around it.
"Here I go, Ricky."
I'm looking.
Please don't just run in circles.
"Marnie, what's that?"
It's a picture of their fat son.
"No, no, no."
Stand perfectly still.
Oh boy.
Look at the remotes.
The remotes?
"I'm looking at the remotes, Ricky."
Zoom in on the remotes.
"Zooming in, Ricky."
I've been studying the crime scene.
Usually there's 13 remotes.
Now there's only 12.
"Marnie,"
I think we just figured out what the murder weapon was.
"Rose, I'm his only chance."
Let's go.

"You don't have a clue as to what the fuck is going on, do you, Sheriff?"
"Bill, do you copy?"
"Bill, do you read?"
"- It's just club soda, Freddy."
- Finish it.
"- Hey, Ray."
"- Hey, Freddy."
I came to tell you I found Superboy... and I'm bringing him in tomorrow morning... and I'd like you to come with me.
I owe you that much.
"He's a fugitive, Ray, and he's convinced you're tryin' to kill him."
"Just tell me where he is, Freddy."
There you go.
Thanks.
This looks good on me.
You think?
I look completely different from yesterday.
But don't you think this is hard on Takao and Shinako?
I have to think about them later.
Why don't you come to rehearsals?
"The performance is coming up, you know."
I think I'm going to quit dancing.
Why?
"This place might close, too."
Really?
I just came from your place.
I found Kayama-sensei.
Where is he?
He's in Okutama.
It looks like he's pretty sick.
He might not know who you are.
"Brother, brother."
Sensei.
"It's me, Shinako."
Do you remember who I am?
"Shinako, dance."
Dance!
"As long as you have legs, dance"
Ballerinas dance until they die.
Can you hear that?
It's a festival.
A gypsy dance.
People with legs should dance.
Ballerinas...ballerinas dance.
- Let go of my wife's arm!
Let go of her.
This is a shoot.
Let her sit on the pillion
I'll miss out on my tv programme.
Don't you watch Mtv?
"Drop me, please"
Where have you brought me?
Why here... in a haunted house?
Haunted house!
Come in
"I told you, it's a tv programme."
It's all a sham!
I'm faking

Who Cyrus... what Cyrus?
"What happened, Ma...?"
He knows me!
My brother's bride.
Bride...?
Do you like her?

But why have you eloped?
Did your parents object?
Only Om objected
Who are these guys?

You are the scapegoat

"[Sara Sighs] You know, I'm okay with the ballet part, but I need help with my free form."
"Girl, who is Snookie talking to ?"
I don't know.
Anything with legs.
[ Laughs ] I think someone got spilled on.
"Hey, back off."
Ain't nobody watching' you but me.
"Yeah, right, nobody's watching."
Come on.
Gotta get ready for Juilliard.

You're milk.
Ain't no point trying to mix.
"Hey, what's up ?"
"Look, we were just dancing."
"And what, her ass just happened to fall into your hands ?"
"No, it was-"
"- You were dancing with Snookie, I was dancing with Nikki."
The music was going and-- l thought we were having a good time.
Look.
There's nothing between me and Nikki anymore.
-Come in.
"-Thank you, my dear."
-You're going to break your eardrums.
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.
"You're young, I'm old and sick."
What we'll do in the next few months will make history.
It's never been done before.
Not even your father would dream that such a thing could be possible.
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?
He's small potatoes.
What's up?
We got company?
What's going on?
Michael Corleone is here.
Where is he?
He's in your den.
You better hurry.
He's been waiting a half hour.
Is something wrong?
I wish you would have let me know you were coming.
-I could have prepared something.
-I didn't want you to know.
-You heard what happened?
-I almost died.
We were so relieved...
In my home!
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!
Where my children come to play.
In my home.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
"You know, I can honestly say that you are the only grandfather"
I have ever wanted to be with.
- Oh!
Hello.

I'm going to bring Ritchie his pancakes.
Okay.
I'm going to get us some coffee.
I'll be right over there.
"- Hi, Christine."
- Hi.
You having a nice Grandparents' Day?
"Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am."
You seem to have a very close family.
"Yes, you certainly seem to be daddy's best girl."
W hat?
Oh.
Ew!
"Oh, no."
That's not my father.
"No, no, no."
That's New Christine's father.
Why were you kissing him?
"Um, because I'm, um..."
I'm sort of dating him.
You're dating your ex-husband's girlfriend's father?
Yeah.
That's right.
"Well, you know, Christine, if we don't tell you enough, we are so happy you're at this school."
That's nice.
Ugh!
"I got so distracted by those meanie moms,"
LUCY:
Uh-huh.
-Congratulations.
-Same as you.

Ha.
"You're the father, Buck."
"Hey, Buck and Lucy are having a baby."
LUCY:
And a wedding too.
-What?
"Oh, my Pa's gonna insist on one."
And you know how mad he gets.
A wedding.
"Well, someone should buy a round of drinks."
"The Lord blesses the union of two lovers, glory to behold."
"No, no, this is nonsense, all right?"
It's nonsense.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not about to get married.
"No, no."

"Well, Buck, it looks like it's time to get yourself a ring and a new suit."

This has to be sent back.

Do you know my grandson Peppe?
"I have to send him this, it's a sweaterI made."
"I want it to get there fast, how long will it take?"
- Two orthree days.
- Two orthree?
"And if it rains, what will the dearthing wear?"
.
should he freeze to death?
Two orthree days?
But it's just a small package.
Your grandson Peppe?
- You're talking about Peppe?
- Do you know him?
"Peppe said, I quote:"
"""If my grandma comes, tell her she can't make sweaters,"""
"""she's gotta do fried dough, 'cause she does 'em great."""
"But he doesn't like sweaters, make him a dessert."
"Making sweaters isn't foryou, Peppe said so."
- Make scarves.
Come on Prewitt.
"Come on, cut that out."
You want to see this guy's imitation of Mussolini?
"Come on, show him your Mussolini impersonation."
Italian men... Italian women!
For twenty centuries...
"Sorry, I can't."
"Cut that out, Prewitt."
What are you doing here?
Don't you know it's forbidden?
It's a minefield.
Get lost.
Get that bitch out of here!
"Out, out!"
Can you get that Italian bitch out of here?
- Get out bitch!
- Enough!
Are you here to fight Germans or to insult Italians?
You're killing them!
"Out, out!"
Go!
"- Step aside boys, move!"

It's too late.
Nothing can be done.

- [Sal] Sixty.
- Sixty kilos?
"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"
This stuff'll take a 7-to-1 hit on the street.
"And by the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be at least 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
"Take what's left there with you, and good night."
Uh-uh.
Not that one.
The little one.
"- I guess we got a deal, huh?"
"- What we got here, Sal, is a test."
A deal for half a million dollars?
"If anyone should be there,"
I should.
I feel awful.
You have to tell me where you got those boots.
Olivia?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to use my journalistic connections to get them out.
"Now, which one arrested Zack?"

"Oh, it's my brother's."
He gave it to me when he met Antonio and moved to Florence.
I didn't know your brother was...
An expatriate.
I know.
It's surprising.
Okay.
"Billie, I'm out and on the way."

Better not let my husband hear that.
I don't care if he hears it.
Will you do it for me?
Okay.
How much you gonna pay?
- Fifty dollars an hour.
- Fifty an hour?
I'll do it... 200.
[Cloudy] Nah.
Can't afford it.
I'll call you later.
All right.
Bye-bye.
"Hey, it's 1:30."
I didn't expect you till 2:00.
- [Angie] You work around here?
- Yeah.
Across the street.
[Jimmy] That's the third time he's come here this week.
[Cloudy] Mm-hmm.
- You got anything on this building?
- The building's clean.
Something more interesting in the scene?
All were killed with a 9mm pistol.
The gun was not found.
But back to what we were talking about.
Christer calling you.
He said that a person would be killed.
But he does not talk you who is?
The Christer knew who it was?
I do not know.
I could not ask before it shut down.
You were covering Christer.
Why did not he tell them?
-No Was Lars who answered.
He called you often?
What does this have to do?
-Christer Was his brother. -how Do you know?
I am the police.
We will continue?
I wonder how long you have to spend.
Strømme.
Yes?
Ok.
I come already.

Imperative.
Antitoxin must be administered.
- We have to get him to a hospital.
- Don't worry.
We will.
Send an ambulance to Malibu end of the canyon.
We'll meet them there.
- 10-4.
- Carry or lead?
I'll carry.

"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
You'll go with big Jon.

Come on.
Here.
Take it easy.
Attaboy.
"Hey, his name is Henry."
"He's still in recovery, but the doctor says he's gonna be okay."
What about the baby food?
It's all accounted for. 15-8's got it.
"You put in a good day, fellows."
There is one other thing.
I hate to bring it up but you'll have to cut down on the personal calls at the office.
But we weren't even there to make any calls.
I'm Marybeth Cogan.
We met at the hospital.
That's Randy and Maria?
These are my kids.
-Please sit down.
-Thank you.
-l'm sorry to have to talk to you here.
-lt's all right.
Hear from anyone in the department today?
A couple of the guys.
What did they say?
I called to pick up his things from the precinct.
They said his locker was sealed.
But the captain came to see me.
He was very nice.
What captain?
Homicide South.
Eddie's commander.
He's required to call on the widow.
is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?

You heard Rhodes.
He's got his hands full.
"Besides, we're running out of time as it is."
"Now, now."
Where's--?
Where's my journal?
D-d-don't...
"Don't, uh-- Don't touch... anything."
"What do you mean, we're running out of time?"
That's right.
"In fact, we've only got two days to find the treasure."
I can't even find my journal.
Why only two days?
Ah!
Ha.
Success.
"Professor, why only two days?"
Because that is when the first line of Solon's riddle comes true.
"I copied it, uh--"
"Uh, from an altar I found in--"
In the caves at Exeter.
Where is it?
Hm.
There we are.
There you are.
"""When the gods march in rank."""

Hermes became Mercury.
In Albany.
We are in Albania.
"Yes, like Mother Teresa."
"In prison, His Majesty."
Yes...
Okay.
Yes.
"Seeing Him, His Majesty..."
Why did you tell her about the prison?
- I did not want to invent a story.
The Chief of Cabinet will call you to this number.
And then we'll call the guards.
"Now I'm off, if you do not mind her."
"Thank you, sorry."
She does not answer.
- Wait.
I do not mean to wait.
"First, you must contact..."
It's ringing.
"Yes, we are healthy and safe..."
Did anyone explain it to you?
Can you contact the embassy in Albania?
Go call the guards.

"Mr. Lloyd, the palace has canceled Our King."

Did you telephone Dr. Mead?
"Yes, of course."
[Ursula]:
Do you think he's dead?
I suppose the sensible thing would be to turn him over.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Janet, you do it."
He's alive.
The tide's low enough for you to get round the point.
See if you can find Pendered... and Luke.
Get them to bring a stretcher.
And ask Mrs. Pendered for some brandy.
Go on!
He's barely alive!
And send Joe Gallow on his bike to find Dr. Mead.
[Man]:
"What you got there, missus?"
"I should have thought that was obvious, Mr. Pendered."
[Pendered]:
I don't know where he's come from.
Ain't no sign of a wreck.
"- You hear anything, Lukey?"
- No.
That's enough for now.
[Pendered]:
Get him on the stretcher.
Be careful with that ankle.
I think it's broken.
"Lift on three, Lukey."
Three!
[Janet]:
It came from outer space.
I saw it.
And it was headed toward land.
I called the government in Washington about it.
Maybe it was a Sputnik or an invader from Mars.
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.
Unidentified?
"Knowing you, earl, I'd say it was either whiskey or beer."
I saw it too.
I rest my case.
I believe you.
What if it is Sputnik?
Or a flying saucer...
... fromMars?
I bet we could find it.
"Sorry, kid."
I didn't really see anything.
"If we don't stick up for the kooks, who will?"
"Is my son bothering you, sir?"
No!

"Hogarth, you were going to get your pet, honey?"
"I will, Mom."

"We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results."
"McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires."

"Oh, Kori."
There's a lot more to racing than just winning.
"I mean, taking the race by a full lap..."
Where's the entertainment in that?
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
"No, I'm not."
'Cause I'm a one-man show.
What?
"Oh, yeah, right."
That was a confident Lightning McQueen.
"Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz."
- Get outta the shot.
"- Yo, Chuck."
"Chuck, what are you doing?"

- Everyone wants to see the bolt.

"Come on, guys."
"- Whoa, team!"
Where are you going?
"- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!"
"Oh, OK, leave."
Fine.

"You know, why not?"
Better later than never.
I'm dating now.
MAN:
What do you miss most about marriage?
Have you been married?
MAN:
"Yes, I'm married."
- You are married?
MAN:
I am married.
And what's your question?
MARY:
"We're heading there, is that fair?"
CONOR:

"I like him, I'll say that L word."
"That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah."
"I like her a lot, so..."
"- Good, I'm glad."
[MOUTHING] I love her.
I love her.
ANNA:
"You know, what I've been focusing my energy on  is like a self-discovery, as opposed to dating."
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.
I'm gonna go have a shower.
Ok.
"Uh, Sarah?"
What should I make us for dinner?
"Don't you mean, what should you order in?"
"No, I cook."
S-sometimes I cook.
"Yeah, I'd wait for mom if I were you."
"Wow, look at you."
"Yeah, please don't."
"I look like I walked off the set of ""7th Heaven"" or something."
"I hope you don't mind, I put my clothes in the wash."

"Yeah, we're in the kitchen."

"Hey, mom."
"Um, dad said it'd be ok if I came home with him."
"Of course it's ok, if you're here to stay."
"Sarah's here for dinner, which, uh... is actually going to be ready momentarily, so..."
"So, what was it this time?"
"Did you run out of money, or did you have another fight with Martin?"
"Yeah, it was a big mistake."
I really shouldn't have come here.
"Sarah, wait."

Do you know I haven't had bacon for over 30 years?
Because it goes against our beliefs?
"Well, I'm just not sure what our beliefs are anymore."
"Mom, what do you mean?"
You're a Muslim!
What if I'm a Muslim because I was married to a Muslim?
"Well, um, how long have you been feeling this way?"
"I've been on a date, I've had wine, and something else Ann put in my drink, and now I'm thinking about trying bacon."

I've got one I'd like to share with you.
The least cool car I've seen in a while - 1982 Porsche 911 SC.
Particularly if someone has written on the back and fitted a turbo body kit.
That's my car!
That really is your car!
"And it's hideous, so it's going here."
"Oh, right, right, right."

This is my favorite.
"Oh, I've never seen a ring like this before."
It's so twinkly.
"It's a rose-cut diamond, from India."

I can't stop looking at it.
"Nicky, see this ring?"
"Hint, hint."
"No one does subtlety like you, babe."

"Olivia's dad was a jeweler in Romania, and now she makes her own stuff."

You come to my house with your junkie girlfriend.
I have two kids here.
What are you talking about?
"That, I..."

And she never asked any questions anyway.
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.
Looks like Roma.
This is all silk.
This is from Siam.

This is where we spend most of our time.
I love the floral arrangements.

"Hello, Cameron."
Have some tea while you catch up on old times.
"Thanks,Jenny."
Be careful.
- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.
- Thankyou.
- A pleasure.
Is he another friend ofyours?
"No, he's thejanitor."
We don't have a janitor in this building.
"Oh, he's the plumber."
There's a burst water pipe outside.
Your voice sounds familiar.
Have we met before?
I met you in the night club.
"I loved your singing, but you wouldn't sing withoutJeffrey there."
"Oh, I remember."
What a coincidence.
"Dumbo, take care ofJenny for a while."
I'm going to the bathroom.
So am I.
There's a second bathroom in the bedroom.
"Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!"
I'll catch it.
Hey!
Don't shoot!
It's me!
Somebody's aiming at my ass from below!
What happened?
Where'sJeffrey?
I know you both lied to me.
Tell me the truth!
What happened to your head?
"Uh, the sky is falling."
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow?
"Thank you, Lee."
Whatever.
"Hey, you know in that Cat Lady sketch?"
Do I have to hold a real cat?
Cat Lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.
"Oh, good."
Who's that?
That is the new network dude.
"Mmm, yummers."
He reminds me of Scotty on General Hospital.
What?
"No, ew, Jenna."
Do not like that man.
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
"Hi, uh, what are you doing down here?"
I'm known for being hands-on.

What's going on?
- I don't wanna be irrelevant.
- Irrelevant?
You're Serena van der Woodsen.
"Gossip Girl might be right about me, but she's wrong about you."
"Without Serena, who would I have dreamt about?"
I might have spent my whole life on the outside if you hadn't let me in.
Which I'm holding against you.

You can reach her at the estate or through Rick at the club.
You can reach me at my own house.
Won't you be more comfortable at Robin's Nest until your relatives arrive from the mainland?
OK.
"Mrs Greenberg, one last thing."
If you think of anything else...
- I will call you!
- Fine.
Thank you.
They make me so nervous.
"Now, why do I have to stay at this Robin's Nest?"

- Because they might try and grab her.
They don't want me.
They want Saul.
They don't want her.
They want Saul.

Mrs Greenberg?

It was a suicide back in '98.
Some kid named Barry Cook.

How'd he die?
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.
-That's where--

Did everything work out yesterday
With the Sapphic love scene?
No.
"Why, what happened?"
There was a revolution.
The actress did not wish to take her clothes off.
"And, you know, and she did the first scene"
.
-I'll introduce you to my childhood best friend.
-But why will I meet her just now?
"-Because she came from Canada, she just arrived."
-Make sure she's just your best friend okay?
-Yes!
Come on!
What?
"You know, Migs and I have been playing together since we're 2 years old."
"As a matter of fact, he's my first boyfriend!"
How old was I when I answered you?
"-Around 1 6, right?"
-What 1 6?
Around 1 5 and three fourths!
-Come on.
-So you've been a couple.
Yes!
"We're childhood sweethearts, right?"
"I'm sorry, I thought Migs told you."
"No, it's okay!"
I was just surprised because he never mentioned that to me.
Haven't I told you about it?
"You know, why don't you guys tell me how you met?"
Oh!
It's like this.
"We were together in the hospital, she's a nurse there."
There it is!
Hence the uniform!
Then it's okay that you're together!
"Are you okay, Joy?"

Are you okay?
-Yes.
-Look.
- lt should go that way.
"Ivan Semenovich, may I go out for a second?"
-No problem.
- Could you watch the communications as well?
Everything is simple here.
"Look, you simply press this button."
-OK.
- Then this one.
And then the red one.
That's all.
-Do you follow me?
"- Press this button, that one and the red one."
"OK, daughter, go out and do not worry."

Put it on the shelf.
"So you said in your e-mail that you have a dance background, but you're just a bit out of shape."
Right?
"Well, I haven't played as much paddle as I used to."
That's not exercise.
Lose the bag.
So I'm gonna give you a beat.
"And you're gonna show me what I'm working with, okay?"
[upbeat music playing]
Come on.

"It's delicious, but I don't..."
Ataste.
Sausage?
A little dessert?
"Mom, some dessert forthe Director."
- I'm really fine as is.
- Taste it.
"It's good, a kind of chocolate."
"Kind of, it's called blood pudding."
It's chocolate with pig's blood.
- You have to eat it.
- I got that.
"Yourmother's right, it's not so hot here."
"They told me it was very hot here, but..."
"camels used to bring the mail, the directorwas a Bedouin."
- Are you making fun of me?
- No...
- Mattia!
- How's it goin'?
This guy?
Looks like the michelin man.
He's joking.
"He's the new director, from milan."
- I get it.
- What?
He always gets things late.
- Buy you a coffee?
"- No, I have to work."
"Wait, Iet me introduce two stalwart co-workers."
"little CostabiIe, one of our greatest employees."
- welcome to the famous CasteIIabate.
- Wait!
- To New Yorkers.
They don't live here.
"I'm all f or love, son."
"Come on, hero."
And that's an order.
Washington hasn't released a story.
What gives?
Drake's the story. I'm not.
You see Johnny here-
- Johnny?
Sergeant Drake!
Johnny!
I didn't like that salute.
There was something final about it.
I got it alright why Johnny had taken a powder.
He'd faked a birth certificate to enlist.
"John Joseph Preston, eh?"
The Yale pin said so.
All I needed was a telephone.
"Sorry, gorgeous. I'd let you have it, only it's long distance."
Yale University.
"Hello, Yale?"
Give me your top man there.
What college?
"Yale, of course."
"Okay, so it's a university."
How would I know?
I just own taxis.
"Yeah, one of my men f ound a pin with a name on it, class of 1940."
I want his address so I can return it to him.
"Thanks, lovely."
"General, if you won't authorize me to go after him I'm af raid i'll have to go anyway."
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"""May He who makes peace in His Heaven make peace upon us and upon all Israel,"
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"Thanks, honey."
Not a word to Raziya.
"Okay, honey."
"If you ask me, Mom was a spy."
"She grew up in Algeria, right?"
- And she visited Aunt Rosa in Paris once a year?
- Yeah.
She met an Algerian spy there who she knew from childhood and brought the secrets to Dad.
Do the math.
Dad was in Intelligence.
- He was a cook in Intelligence.
- That was his cover story.
So the Algerian spy got her pregnant?
- Maybe he was an Arab.
- God forbid.
Maybe she was the spy.
Or a murderer.
Ever see her kitchen cleaver?
- I know.
She was a Nazi hunter.
- What?
Then why did she take us on a heritage tour of Oschwitz?
Since when did she have family in Oschwitz?
It was an educational tour.
We're Jews.
"Unless your father is a little Arab spy,"
- which makes you...
"I know with our history, you'll think I made this up--"
"Andy, what?"
"Now, an incident has occurred at my apartment. lt's not fit for visitors."
-l don't believe this.
-You wanna know what happened?
-No.
"-Hey, John, good morning."
"I've heard about fungus in the fish tank, dangerous tiles--"
You want to know what happened?
Yes or no?
What happened?
"Well, I have a very bad gas leak."
"Now, I called the gas people."
There is no way I'm gonna feel comfortable exposing you to danger.
-We're back to square one?
-We are definitely not at square one.
I want you to come to my place.
I told you. I turned that corner.
I'm looking forward to it. I'm a changed man. I have a dangerous leak.
"That's all we're talking about here, now."
"You want some advice, Andy?"
Get it fixed.
WOMAN:
Mike?
Roberts?
-Mike Roberts around?
I gotta see Mike.
DONNA:
He's not here.
Mike?
"-Hey, Roberts."
-Excuse me.
"Whose bag is that next to Mom's, and whose hat is that?"
It's a man's hat.
- Maybe Morn bought it for Dad.
"- Yeah, right."
"Anyway, this is what we have so far."
1.
The picture. 2.
Dates of Mom's trips.
3.
Algeria - black hole.
"And, oi course, Aunt Rosa."
She's obviously hiding something.
The conclusion is:
We have a father and we need to find him.
And the conclusion is:
"There are pills, Shai, and you need to take them."
"""Have a father must find him!"""
"Maybe you're right, maybe I'm nuts, but I can't sleep at night and you can't either."
Don't pretend.
"What are you getting at, Shai?"
"Tickets to Paris, voucher for a hotel on the Champs Elysees, inflatable pillow for the flight."
Maps.
Even new swimsuits.
The hotel has a pool.
You are nuts.
He's nuts.
We fly a week before Passover.
- I can't.
"- You're on vacation from school and Dorona, you're free now anyway."
- But...
- I spoke to Raziya.
You told Haziya?
What's wrong with you?
"Man, where the gefilte fish at?"
It's in the fridge.
That shit's perishable once it's open.
"They ain't in the fridge, man."
"Hold on, man, I know I put that shit in the fridge 'cause don't nobody want no hot-ass gefilte fish."
"Just like I said, right behind the peanut butter."
"Ain't no peanut butter in here, man, just yogurt."
"- Where the fuck are you, Ricky?"
"- Where you think I am, man?"
"I'm in the motherfucking kitchen, bro."
I'm in the kitchen.
I don't see your ass.
"Hey, man."
"Oh, God!"
"Yo, TTD, call the cops."
There's a weird white kid in our house.
"What house are you in, Rick?"
- Ricky?
- Uh...
- Ricky?
"- Oh, shit."
- Ricky.
- Boy:
"I know who you are, asshole."
- You're not gonna get away with this.
"- TTD, call Spencer."
( car alarm chirps )
"Wayne, Wayne!"
( panting ) Wayne!
"Well, look what the breeze finally blew in."
"Better late than never, though, right?"
I also work here.
"Reason is the Salty Treat blew out an amp the other day, rockin' out pretty hard to some Lifehouse covers, which will happen."
"So, I'm pickin' up the slack."
I'm happy to do it.
Way she goes.
I'm Lisa.
Are you ever.
Look at you!
It's America's little sweetheart over here.
You're like a little Katy Heigl or like a little Katy Hudson.
What can I get ya?
Do you have cookies and cream?
Do I...
Do I have cookies and cream?
I sure do have cookies and cream.
(SIGHS) And I'm thinkin' maybe a vanilla-fudge swirl chunk for Mr. Newman over here?
"- That'll do, thank you."
- Okay.
And you're gonna keep an eye on little Caty Blanchett here
- for me till I get back?
- Sure will.
Thank you!
Be right back!
"- So, you're a farmer, Wayne?"
- Can confirm.
You don't smell like one.
(CHUCKLES) I'm kidding.
I'm a pre-school principal.
Do you like kids?
- Hmm...
"- I know, everyone likes kids."
They're so silly.
Who is it?
It's Gargan.
Long distance.
- Huh?
- Gargan.
- At this hour?
- Yeah.
"Hello, Mr. Gargan."
"Oh, listen, Thompson, I'm gonna be out of the state for a week or 10 days."
"Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Gargan."
We'll miss you.
Yeah.
I can imagine.
"But listen, I gotta make a business trip."
"When I come back, I'm gonna have a conference with the governor."
- You get me?
"- Sure, I understand, Mr. Gargan."
"I don't know how long it's gonna take me but meanwhile, I want you to get this straight."
I want everything run just exactly as I left it.
No changes.
"If there's any argument, whatever Miss Griffith decides, goes."
You understand?
- Is she around there now?
- No.
"I think she's in her cottage, Mr. Gargan, I could get her for you if--"
"No, no, that's all right."
Never mind.
Just tell her I called.
"Yeah, so long."
"And remember, no changes."
"All right, Mr. Gargan."
"Yeah, I understand."
"Take it, son."
"I didn't bring kettledrums for money, Zaer Kheder_"
- Is Bashirou here?
- Hello Zahireh_
Hello.
I want to ask him for baby cradle
"Bashirou, go upstairs"
go;
I am coming to shifl it myself.
"Go,"
I am coming too.
You go to their home yourself and tell his mother.
"- Zaer, I do have to play kettledrum_"
- God willing.
What do you mean by God Willing?
Yes or no?
God willing means god willing.
"No Zaer,"
- It's not my answer.
- Definitely yes or definitely not.
"- I said ""God willing""."
"- I said ""definite answer""."
"You are repeatedly saying ""definitely""."
"If you want a definite answer, its been ""No""_"
"So why would you say ""God willing""?"
"Just say no, at first_"
- Just No. now I am relieved?
- No.
"Come on, take it."
Shush
"Thank you so much, sorry to disturb you."
- Goodbye.

"Look, josie."
1621/2. i got 'em cornered.

The gold corner is broken!

Luke!
Line up the soldier boys.
We're marching on wall street to show 'em who's king!
"Jim, come here!"
"Jim, look!"
There's something wrong!
"Jim, what's happened?"
"I... just lost a bet, josie."
"We're not gonna march today, luke."
We're never gonna march again.
"I'm broke, josie."
Jim fisk is busted.
I'm right back where i started.
"Jim... don't worry about me, josie."
I'm all right.
"I was just laughing to think that for the first time in his life, nick was smarter than i was."
And i thought i was bigger than anybody else.
"Don't you worry, josie."
You've got yours.
See how smart i was to make you take all those things i gave you?
- I don't know what he knew.
This is crazy.
"You're saying Dad hid one of his kids from us for years and then gave Holly the land, so his affair is thrown in our face because of some girl named Rebecca?"
I wish I could tell you what he was thinking.
- It's a shock for me too.
- I don't know why.
- He lied about having a mistress.
- That's not fair.
Why should I be so shocked that he lied to us too?
This whole family revolves around lying.
"- Justin, please!"
- Grandma!
Aunt Kitty!
- Hi.
"- Hi, Grandma."
- Hi.
Hi.
"- Hey, guys."
"Hey, sweetie boy."
"Hi, guys."
- This is wonderful.
- Joe.
"- Hey, Nora."
- Hi.
"- Hey, Kitty."
- I can hardly pick you up.
Please help me understand how you could discover your father has another child and not tell me?
- We were trying to spare you the pain.
- How?
By keeping me in the dark?
God.
You should've seen Justin's reaction.
"No, quite the reverse."
Knock-out drops.
Surely you've heard of them?
- For knocking out what?
- People.
Who else?
- You mean a sleeping draught.
"- I suppose so, but instantaneous."
"My dear madam, you're asking for a Mickey Finn."
- Am I?
"- We have a mild soporific here, if you're sleeping badly."
"I'm sleeping perfectly well, thank you."
Mickey Finn...
Mickey...
Thank you very much.
"Desiree, you are the expert on crime, how would one obtain a Mickey Finn?"
"Well, I get all dope on drugs from a little crook called Maury Fish."
He hangs around in a pub called the Limehouse Arms.
The Limehouse Arms?
Thank you very much.
(Piano music and chatter)
- Yes?
- Gin and...
"Port and lemon, please."
- Thank you.
- One and six.
- You know Maury Fish?
- Why?
I want some Mickey Finns.
"The real McCoy, mac."
- What for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
"But Ms. Viola, there many dangers along the way."
"Hazard-no, challenges."
-As soon as it comes.
"Okay, find Uncle Ramon ..."
"Send him to bring friends, Adélie how he can."
-Is ...
Do not forget the family motto.
The RE-MASH.
"Come on, Uncle Bud, we have too many fish to catch."
"-So, what news?"
-Ruins.
"Every corner, every direction, completely blocked."
There are rumors of people thinking the unthinkable.
"Noah, are calling The Iceberg's End."
-How to answer this?
-We will try again.
-We can not ...
Return- to seek hundred times.
-There is no escape.
"-Thousands of times if necessary, there is always a way out."
"It does have, and right there."
"Ice, no ice, but it has ice tone and testing ..."
Let me help you.
"Ready, you can go."
"Erik, no!"
Bounce!
"You saw, you saw?"
"Never, do it again."
"Father, I flew!"
-Erik.
-I flew!
"I beat my wings, was very quick."
- And so am I.
- And I to be here.
"Before I forget, I must give you Mrs Jennings' and Mrs Palmers' regards."
Oh.
"Miss Marianne, I hope you will not think me too forward, but I have brought you a gift."
- That lovely box.
- And its contents.
Please open it.
Whatever can it be?
"Oh, books!"
"Oh, thank you, Colonel."
It is only a very modest treasure chest.
"""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire""."
- Will it not be too difficult for me?
"- Oh, by no means."
"You may find it even more exciting than ""The Mysteries of Udolpho""."
But I shall have hundreds of questions to ask you.
My children.
-You wanna get somethin' to eat?
-Nah.
"I had somethin' last night, ruined my appetite."
"Besides, I gotta get down the road."
Okay.
Thanks for the ride.
"Come on, I'll buy you a cup of tea and a bromo."
-Come on.
"-Okay, but I can only stay a minute."
Good.
"Okay, we open."
Come in.
-Where's the john at?
JOHN:
It's really green as hell.
"You know, I'm a country boy, John."
That's a bunch of crap.
You were born in L.A.
Mmm-mmm.
Malibu.
(SIREN WAILING)
JOHN:
What the fuck?
Howdy.
Dale Dixon.
"Welcome to Star City, boys."
"We've got a full day, so if you'll follow me we'll get you unpacked and get you something to eat."
"As soon as I saw you drive by,"
I knew you were the boys from California.
"(TRUCK HORN HONKING) Cops look the same everywhere, I guess."
Follow me.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
"Oh, shit."
WAITRESS:
"That's three scrambled and a cold Bud, whole wheat, sausages."
You boys are in for a treat now.
"Say, Fern, can you bring us some extra biscuits, too?"
"Sure thing, Hurricane."
"Some more coffee, too, please."
She call you Hurricane?
Folks call me that.
I never have figured out why.
I figure we can wait up in the woods.
"When the bad folks show up, we'll put the stopper in the bottle like that."
They'll be sorry they ever heard of Star City.
"Come on, come on, come on."
D'ARTAGNAN:
"Yes, yes, yes."
PORTHOS:
"Good, good."
What we got?
What we got?

ANNE:
Why else would Louis choose Aramis particularly to be his personal guard?
He knows.
CONSTANCE:
You don't know that for sure.
The King has hated me for five years.
I know things have been difficult between you but...
Our marriage has been for public show.
"In private, he's ignored or slighted me at every turn."
You need to stay strong.
You're still the Queen of France.
Perhaps not for long.
Do you think that the King would want a scandal that could endanger the throne?
"The Dauphin is his son, the King could never admit to anything else."
I had hoped that everything with Aramis was over.
Forgotten.
He died of love.
"I mean, he must have been killed by a jealous lover."
Makes sense.
This was brutal.
"Marshal, could it be White Tiger?"
- According to my calculations...
"- Not him, right?"
- Could be.
"- Yes, yes."
- After serious consideration...
- It's him.
Not him.
The Marshal is right.
I came from the North to GuangZhou just to catch White Tiger.
Minor cases like this should be settled at your level.
"If you don't solve this, you'll come to regret it."
I'll regret it!
"Marshal, Marshal!"
"Marshal, you're here all the way from the North."
Come for dinner tomorrow.
- OK.
"- Please, please, please..."
"Sifu Tam, we haven't been asked to perform our lion dance at the start."
Why not?
They asked Wong Fei-hung.
Wong Fei-hung again?
His birthday's in a few days.
"Junior, deliver a birthday robe to him."
He'll like the robe I make him.
"Foon, it's my birthday in a few days."
Are we ready?
"- Yes, Sifu."
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God!"
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.
- It's Josh Peters!
You're Josh Peters!
- Sorry?
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.
The system could be mining some of your personal memories for texture.
Was Josh Peters someone you were scared of?
He was a bully.
I wasn't scared.
"I wasn't scared of him, but he was a bully and..."
Man!
Take a couple of Krav Maga classes and I'd be ready.
I'd be ready!
Kali ma!
Dah!
I'm gonna get some wine.
Re-up.
"I'd offer you some, but I don't think you can drink it so..."
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
"Catch ya later, Peters."
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.
"I'm not like a expert or anything, but it's kinda great."
I was in France.
"I stayed at this, like, vineyard, and they had this wine, like, grape-stomping festival."
"Now that, that wine was good."
I know that.
You're being discursive.
- What is discursive?
Discursive?
What else?
"Well, women like Sherri already know they're beautiful and desirable."
-You won't score points by telling her.
-Okay.
Don't be in a hurry to spill your guts.
She doesn't need your life story...
-... beforeyougetthe salad.
-Got it.
"As someone who knows your life story, I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all."
"Right, right."
"I'll be cool, aloof, distant."
"She's here, she's here, she's here!"
What about the-
- What-
- What--
What about the kiss goodnight?
-Should I ask or just go for it?
-Go for it.
Don't wait until the last minute.
It creates pressure.
-Get it out of the way early.
-How early?
"After dinner, when you walk to the car..."
"... openherdoor,waitforher to say thank you..."
"... smile,leanin ,andkissher."
"Oh, nice."
"Hi, Alan."
You ready?
"You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you."
That's another way to go.
-Madam.
-Thank you.
"- Robin, how could you?"
"No, she's right."
Maggie deserves some time to herself.
"Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a breakup, but that's when we discover who we really are and what we really want."
She deserves that.

What do you want?
I saw mom in the supermarket.
- Attention!
Report to 08...
- Supermarket...
The last time I heard from her she was in Sweden.
That was the end of the seventies.
What would she be doing in a supermarket around here?
What do I know?
You imagined it.
Why would she suddenly just show up here?
Sweden is much too far away for a short visit.
But suppose I did see her.
You've got her mixed up.
I didn't get her mixed up.
Do you hear that?
"This singing, you hear that?"
Isn't that great?
It' s been going on for days.
Why can't everyone just leave me alone?
You'll get the file in the morning.
Alright?
Fine.
Shouldn't I come with you?
It's not necessary.
Too bad!
"A 1,000 Euro show."
"How come 1,000 Euros?"
What were you thinking?
Toni's 999 Euro show?
A jam in Los Angeles.
-Let me...
-No hydraulic fluid
-for the platform lifts.
-This is ridiculous.
You guys are making me laugh.
You call yourself truck operators.
"-What's your dram, hydraulic fluid?"
-Yeah.
"-Yeah, what are you driving, diesels?"
-That's right.
"Well, you simply drain the lube fluid out of the hitch gearbox, transfer it to the hydraulic lifts."
Look alive!

-Dawson figures-- I have to have 'em right away.

"- Beautiful, isn't it?"
- Milan is amazing.
It'll change our lives.
Who is it?
It's Mario.

I'll call you this evening.

"Optimism, Silvia!"
- Yuck!
- Darn it!
- WELCOME TO THE SOUTH -
You can't do anything?
I've been working there for 15 years!
You promised!
You know I was counting on it.
I understand.
"It's not fair, though."
Bye.

"Naples: gunfire downtown,"
Minister Maroni in visit to the regional capital.
"102 deaths since the year began, 1,300 in the last ten."
It's as if an entire village were erased from the map.
- What is it?
- No transfer to Milan.
What?
Someone disabled got the job.
"To live in Milan, a person has to be handicapped?"
"They have priority, it's only right."
"Wasn't your friend ""Leave it to me"" Mario helping you?"
He'll be coming soon then.
Though I hope that's after the bill is passed through.

I came for Da Hye's tutoring.
Go in.
Is this what you came to find?
You really are fearless.

It seems you don't know when to stop.
Stopping...
Doesn't quite suit me.
Let me ask you one question.
What is the reason that you're doing this?
That's all.
"Keep an eye on them, Seymour."
"Company, attention."
Fall out for five minutes.
"Oh, Quigley."
Come here.
I've already warned you a couple of times this week.
Look at yourself.
"Well, what's your excuse this time?"
Walking around on my knees to give my arches a rest.
Let me see your hands.
Ever try using soap and water?
Let me see the other one.
I thought so.
You heard what Mr. Jeffries said.

How's my favorite dog?
You're subdued.
-Did you give him a beer?
-No.
-Will you excuse us?
We need to talk.
-Sure.
"Oh, me, right."
-He's miserable.
What happened to him?
-Nothing.
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?
Rachel stuff.
"Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!"
This is the happiest dog in the world.
"He spends a day with you, and look!"
He's breathing.
"Okay, well, he's watching us so just look happy, okay?"
-I'll take him to Wendy's.
"Strange man, covered in blood, racing away from the scene of the crime."
"I don't know about you, but I don't need no eyewitness to make sense of this."
-Obediah Jackson is a murderer!
MEN:
"Yes, he is."
"All right, save it, Litefoot."
"The people rest, Your Honor."
MAN:
Put him in the ground.

The pussycat.
Let the pussycat kill the kangaroo.

Pussycat.
That is your spirit animal.
"Aah, that's nice."
You could've been anything you wanted to be in the world and you chose a pussycat.
You're a curious goat.
"Yes, I know, but..."
What I need you to do now is call to your guide.
"Make the cries of the pussy cat to the heavens,"
Sleet and I will join you.
DERMOT MEOWS SLEET BLARES
"It's a very quiet pussy cat, Dermot."
"Sleet, Sleet, that's great, can we hold the goat for a second?"
"Keep going, Dermot."
Sounds like a very sad pussy cat.
Or an owl.

More like a sort of...

There's nothing to talk about.
You were right.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
"It isn't that simple, Michael."
"You thinkyou can let the job be whoyou are... all you are, and you can't."
It's dangerous to think thatyou can.
I know I can be...
passionate...
- but I'm good at what I do.
- I know.
- It's no secret that things between us have been--
- Little rocky.
It isn't easy for me either.
"Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive... sweet, needy."
Don't deny it.
Fine.
"Isn't it interesting that she turned out to be... well, who she turned out to be?"

"Plus, I get Dannon points."

"Oh, mama!"
"Dude, look at the craftsmanship of this bow."
"The guy behind the counter, he said that this is the same one they used to light the torch at the Lillehammer Olympics."
"Ooh, nice."
- I think that was Muhammad Ali.

But I'm not sweating it.
'Cause this crossbow's gonna shoot a bow so hard it's gonna explode a deer's head.

"Wait, so now you're on board to hunt?"
I thought you weren't really down for it.

They're like the rodents of the sea.

[SIGHS THEN GASPS]
Isobel.
- What are you doing here?
"- I'm your mother, Elena."
I wanna be more involved in your life.

You already have a lot of people you care about.
But I've been studying.
Let's see if I got this right.
"There is the witchy best friend, Bonnie."
Gonna stay away from that one.
"The sad little brother, Jeremy."
And there's Caroline.
Obnoxious Caroline.
"I got all of my info from her, by the way."
"She had no idea who I was, and she wouldn't stop yapping."
Aww.
And there's Matt.
"Friend, ex, Yappy's future ex."
Lots of connections there.
- Matt's not involved in this.
"- He's involved with you, isn't he?"
"Look, you shouldn't be here."
You need to leave.
No.
-...on your memorable family experience.
WYATT:
"Just a reminder, though, this is going to be worth half your final grade."
Leave him alone.
WYATT:
Don't screw it up.
"-Shh, I'm going for a record."
WYATT:
"Um, what you write about...."
I said leave him alone.
WYATT:
--than how you write about it.
I wanna know how--
"You wanna take his place, midget?"
WYATT:
"I'm looking for the brutal, funny..."
-Yeah.
Sure.
-...maybe even the painful truth.
WYATT:
"Okay, everybody, if you have any questions?"

On the right.
"Empty your pockets, please."

Wait.
It's there.
At the end.
Good morning.
I'm Marco Zuloaga.
Benigno Martin left this letter for you.
"Dear Marco,"
It's still raining.
I think it's a good omen.
When Alicia had her accident it was raining.
I'm writing minutes before I escape.
I hope that all I've taken is enough to put me in a coma and reunite me with her.
You're my only friend.
I'm leaving you the house
I prepared for Alicia and me.
"Wherever they take me, come and see me, and talk to me."
"Tell me everything, don't be so secretive."
"Farewell, my friend."
Okay.
Thanks very much for calling us.
Yeah.
Appreciate it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
( Clearing Throat )
Mikey Trenton and Ben Owens won't be in class today.
There was an accident at Ben's house.
Is Ben all right?
"Ben's all right,"
- but his sister's boyfriend is dead.
- What happended?
Some bizarre accident.
He was electrocuted in the jacuzzi.
I've been doing research into Mikey Trenton's background.
I really need to talk to you about this.
"Yeah, okay."
You go to your class.
I'll meet up with you later.
Okay.
"Eva, I'm gonna come back after my next class to check on that fax."
"""Electric chair""?"
We were so stupid.
"Putting the radio so close to the edge, that was so stupid."
He was probably just changing the station or something.
I went in to answer the goddamned phone.
Do you believe there was some pervert on the line?
I'm glad you're not dead.
God!
I wish I was.
Maybe it wasn't an accident.
"He is, but do you know him?"
"Of course, I do."
"He's incredibly kind, generous--"
My dry-cleaning guy is kind and generous.
Where's the prednisone?
Left bottom shelf.
I know him. I do.
Does he fold the newspaper inside out when he reads it...
... andthenforgetstoputitback when he is done?
Clips his toenails in bed?
-Drips when the toilet seat's down?
-Abby.
-Likes jam on his grilled cheese?

I wouldn't miss it.
-Great.
-Okay.
"Dr. Pratt, you got a moment?"
-Sure.
-Walk with me?
All right.
"This young man, K.J. Thibeaux?"
You've been sponsoring him as a Volunteen.

"He got in the surgical floor storeroom, stole a digital video camera."
-What?
Get out of here.
-l don't wanna make a big issue...
"Nadine, I'm sure you recognize Acacio... and this is Gordo, his manager."
Gordo is more than my agent.
He's my buddy.
"In English, please."
- Sorry.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Acacio's going to play in England.
I know.
I saw it on TV.
Speculation.
Nothing's signed yet.
- Twelve million is cheap.
- You're crazy!
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
"If I were him, I'd only sign for 1 5."
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
She's right.
Twelve million is too little.
Acacio is a great player.
"Thanks, but I don't need anyone to defend me."
You watch and see if he's not the best.
Senor Juan.
That's me.
Can we talk for a moment?
"Of course, Mr. Vermont."
Have you finished the American contract?
Not yet.
It's almost ready.
"You know, Americans are sticklers for details."
I come from three generations of tailors.
- Details are my specialty.
"I said, all right, Horace."
"I called a time out so you can go take a leak, all right?"
"I mean, what am I gonna do?"
"He's my nephew and he's crying, right?"
"So I said, okay, honey, go to the toilet, I'll put Ralphie in right field, all right?"
So you can go take a pee pee.
"And he's crying, just standing there."
"I said, what's the matter with you?"
I thought you had to go make a pee pee?
Now go make a pee pee!
"And he says... (high pitched) Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete, it's too late!"
I look and he's got piss all over his pants!
His pants are covered in piss!
"Remember that, Horace?"
Remember when you peed your pants in little league?
Where you going?
"Oh, come on, you little crybaby!"
"- Don't cry, little Horace."
Horace:
He's all right.
"He's all right, Pa."
man:
"Oh, Jesus."
"- Hey, Horace, didn't your other boy play baseball, too?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, Little Pete's good."
- Yeah.
"- He's on a team, he's great."
"Shortstop, and he can hit it."
Fantastic.
"- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Where you been?
- l know.
"Why don't you take that note, give it to the American Consulate, and let's not get any more involved, please."
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.
Alright.
"Say, uh... you know a Mrs Drayton?"
- English lady.
- That's right.
Did you see her coming from the marketplace in the last hour?
"- No, sir."
- Wait a minute.
This is very important.
- She had my little boy with her.
"- No, sir."
- What about Mr Drayton?
- Mr Drayton checked out.
- He what?
- Checked out.
- But he couldn't have.
"- Yes, sir, he did."
"Mr Drayton, the Englishman with the horn-rimmed glasses."
"Yes, sir."
He checked out.
"(Sighs) I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted."
"I'll call Mrs Drayton, tell her she can bring Hank back."
"- Just hold that call a minute, Jo."
- Why?
Because I asked you to!
"Ben, are we about to have our monthly fight?"
I hope not.
"Well, then stop acting like that."
I merely said I was going to call Mrs Drayton.
-Of course you're sorry.
is that your signature?
We record the receipt of all documents.
What about phone calls?
You keep a log of them?
"Take a minute for me, please."
Look up the dates of Frank Anselmo's calls to this office.
"You're in the wrong pew, Mr. Calhoun."
Frank Anselmo never called this office.
What about the mayor?
"He's in his dressing room, Mr. Calhoun."
Where you been?
I was looking for you.
Trying to get to Senator Marquand.
"Well, he got through to me."
They're moving the convention to Miami.
Miami?
Why?
They like Miami.
Glamour.
"Whoopi Goldberg, Madonna just bought houses in South Beach."
Maybe we can nominate them.
I thought it was all cut.
"Cut, not cut."
Politics.
Nothing's cut.
Where you going?
I'm gonna pay my respects to Nettie Anselmo.
Do you think that's wise?
-What's wise got to do with it?
-The perception--
Fuck perception!
- His doctor?
I don't know.
"Oh, wait a minute. it could be a Dr Kessler."
"Yeah, Dr Kessler is a cardiologist here."
"- Could you check with him, please?"
- Sure.
Let me check.
'Dr Sigapelli to Cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'
I went to the market for five minutes and he's gone!
Where is Saul?
"- Take it easy, Lena."
- Rick won't tell me nothing!
- What's happened?
- Saul may have had a heart attack.
"- Oh, God, no!"
- It's all right.
We don't know yet.
- Is there any word?
"- No, not yet."
"Dr Kessler will be here in a moment, but he knows nothing of a Mr Greenberg suffering a heart attack."
And international Life Support haven't dispatched an ambulance since last night.
Where is he?
What happened to Saul?
Where is he?
"Please, where is my husband?"
"Oh, Thomas."
- Please be calm.
- Why don't you go and find my husband?
Why don't you just go and find my Saul instead of torturing me!
- Lena!
Officer?
"It's a quality mozzarella because it ""ooze-s miI-k""."

It should go in the fridge.
I'm off.
"- Wait, some coffee."
- Duty calls.
I have to work.

"- lfwe were given this mission, it is possible."
Do you understand what all this might end with?
"If everything is all right, I'll get the USSR Hero Star."
Posthumously.
"No, everything is all right, comrade mayor."
Everything is OK.
Everything is all right.

Bloody hell!
"Folks, you are wet to the bones!"
"Take this, warm up a little."
"Take, please."
-What about yourfriend?
- The friend can not afford this.
Why so?
"Everything is all right, auntie."
"Comrade captain, we are sorry."
"Please, do not get offended..."
But we will not untie you so far.
"Okay, pal, hold it, hold it."
"Look, it's 14 to the right, then you go twice around to the left 'til you come to 22..."
And then back to zero.
What about the bodyguards and your lady friend?
"Those two bums, that fuckin' whore..."
They took off.
Is there anything else I should know?
"Hell, no..."
You kiddin' me?
"Hey, look, I swear."
"If you're lyin', I'll be back."

Stop it!
"Jesus Christ, don't!"
"Please, please, don't do that."
"Goodbye, gone."
When do I start?
Let's go.
"- Listen, this isn't a great time for me right now."
- Oh.
"- I'm sorry, I apologize."
"- Oh, Iâm sorry, just give me ten minutes, though."
"Just give me ten minutes and then you won't have to see me again 'til tomorrow, at work."
Horace.

Popsicles melt.
And then it's juice.
"Who likes juice, Horace?"
Please?

Yeah.
Lark just would not stop crying today.
- Yeah.
"- And 45 minutes later,"
I found out her shoe was on too tight.

"You don't look like you need any help, but the best one I got just went in for the beer."
"Oh, no."
"See, you don't understand."
I'm not just lookin' for any woman.
"I mean, not that Kiki's any woman."
She's beautiful.
"I'm sure she's a special, sweet girl."
"Hey, brahda, just kidding."
Just kidding.
"Who's this wahine, this woman, you're looking for?"
- Did you ever hear of the Wiki-Wiki Club?
- Sure.
I was the bartender there... from '39 to '43.
Good club.
High-class wahines.
Not like the girls working the streets today.
- Did you know many of the women who worked there before the war?
"- Hey, brahda, I knew them all."
- You know what I mean.
- How 'bout this one?
Her name was Diane Westmore.
She disappeared in the attack in '41 .
"Sorry, brahda."
It was a passionate affair.
I knew it was wrong.
What am I supposed to do?
"Said she'd kill her husband, I should kill my wife so we could live together."
I just let it go.
I thought it was talk.
"The next thing you know, lo mató, Mr. Garcia is dead."
She did it.
Son of a bitch.
But I'm still thinking that she did it because he was beating her.
-This is when I talked to your detective.
-Detective Kelly.
"Yeah, yeah."
Then she gives me a call three days ago.
"She calls me from prison, right?"
"""l did my part,"" she says."
"""Now you gonna do yours. """
That's why I was upset when you came over.
Now I realize that she's crazy.
She says she murdered him so we can live together forever.
-Your wife knows nothing about this?
-l confessed.
-She knows I'm here.
-You did the right thing.
I had to.
What about if she gets off on bail?

"Oh, somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor."
[Seahorse] Sebastian!
"[Pants] Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you."
I've got an urgent message from the sea king.
The sea king?
He wants to see you rightaway.
Something about Ariel.
[Gasps] He knows.

"Oh, who could the lucky merman be?"
"[Clears throat] Come in, Sebastian."
[Inhales sharply] I mustn't overreact.
I must remain calm.
[Squeaky voice] Yes?

I'm concerned about Ariel.
Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately?

Justin spit on him.
"And Danny, he was so mean, he was like ""Hey Justin."

"You, you give me your sweater and... and I'm gonna do a high kick."
I'm gonna do another high kick.

And that was it.
Yeah.
Maybe I embellished a little bit but I feel like you guys got the gist.

"You know, when Jesus was crucified on the cross, there was a thief named Dismas on the cross next to him."
He believed in Jesus and asked him not to forget him when he died.
"When Jesus died, he took Dismas to heaven and Dismas became a saint."
I want you to wear it.
"Let me see it, Mama."
"Mi hijo, let's put it on your brother."
Okay.
Santana.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
You're not supposed to pass items to convicts.
But you see what it is.
Sorry.

He can pick this up with the rest of his property you brought for him.

He is not!
Henry would not date Dylan.
Why not?
You're not dating her anymore.
"Well, I mean, he can date her if he wants, but he knows I still like her."
I don't think he would ask her out on a date.
"But then again, I guess he did."
Huh.
"It's, uh..."
I can't believe that.
Fancy that.
I can't either.
"You're not maybe planning on going to the movies with Alice and then bumping into Henry and Dylan and doing a little do-si-do, are you?"
Go back upstairs.
You're not going anywhere.
And give me your phone.

Adrian's boyfriend is asking her to marry him and she's practically engaged and Amy's married and it's not fair!

Can I at least call Alice and tell her not to come over?
"Her number's in your contacts, right?"
I'll call her.
"All right, that's just an invasion of privacy!"
Go.
I'm too old to be sent to my room!
I'm divorced!
I've lost a child!
I'm over 18.
I'm an adult!
We made a great team.
"I mean, older and wiser shows me how to hit the books."

"Ah, That was a long time ago."

Your intention of saving her is not wrong.
But a life has been lost.
"Don't get scared, Manoj."
We are not dealing this case officially.
"Only if you tell the truth, we can save you and your friend."
"–Uh, is it really necessary?"
"–Yeah, do you mind?"
"–No, not at all."
–Great.
Follow me.
Hey.
Fleetwood's been checkin' in with his parole officer... doin' community service and scrubbing' graffiti.
Sumbitch is totally clean.
You?
I ran some of the names he had in his Palm Pilot.
He had four two-strikers in his address book.
You need a new C.I.?
–Doesn't everyone?
–I'm gonna hit the head.
"Then we can go do some arm twisting', huh?"
"–Vic, we need to talk."
–What's up?
Claudette's got Tio's ledger.
He was supposed to burn that.
"Well, apparently, Armadillo burned him first."
Claudette wants to run your financials against Tio's records.
Fine.
Let her.
–You sure?
–Trust me.
She's not gonna find anything.
–What's Joe Clarke doing here?
–You know Joe?
I remember his picture in the papers.
He can't be here.
"Hey, he's a friend of mine."
And he's also an embarrassment to this department.
It's our honor that Brother Y an invites us here
We'll do whatever you need us to do!
"Come, come!"
"Gentlemen, help yourself!"
"Don't be shy, feel free to eat!"
Who are you?
Where is that woman?
She is cooking in the kitchen
I'm the youngest apprentice of Thunderstorm
Youngest apprentice?
T ake that old fart here
And see if this kid is lying
Y es!
Lying?
I'm telling you the truth
My name is Gao Jian
How come I've never seen you before?
Master said that I didn't practice well
So he kicked me out.
I just came back to see how he is doing.
If you release me
I'll pour wine for you!
"Master, Master!"
How are you?
"Master, I'm Gao Jian!"
Gao Jian!
"Zhengzong, is this one of your apprentice?"
Y es!
"Master, so I can be your apprentice again?"
T ake him out.
He's not allowed here... without my permission!
"Dad, take the medicine!"
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-Yes.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Allison MacKenzie.
"Miss MacKenzie, how long have you known Selena Cross?"
Ever since I was a child.
We went all through school together.
Miss Cross is my best friend.
"Ms. MacKenzie, you've testified that when you saw Lucas beating Selena... you thought that your presence prevented things from going further."
-I know it did.
"-You don't know, you assume."
"Well, he was embarrassed to find me watching."
How many times did Lucas hit Selena?
-Once.
-Once?
"Now, did he hit her with his fist or a weapon?"
"-Well, it was kind of a slap."
-A slap?
"Have you ever been slapped, Miss Mackenzie?"
-Yes.
-By a stranger?
-No.
-By a member of the family?
-Do I have to answer this?
"-I'm sorry, but you do."
By my mother.
As hard a blow as Selena Cross' stepfather gave her?
-No.
-How could you tell?
I don't think so.
"You don't really know what happened inside that house, do you?"
"By ""later"" you mean when everybody's dead?"
Everybody.
Women.
Children.
Everybody.
"Come on, Hamchunk."
[WOMAN SINGING IN FRENCH]
You like?
What is there not to like?
Who is she?
Her name's Lin.
Her father was chief of the Hang Pham Province.
Until he refused to cooperate with the Viet Cong.
- And then they killed him?
- They murdered him.
And her little brother.
In a most hideous way.
That's their style.
Besides being one of our top models she could be most helpful to our government.
"Are you trying to tell me something, colonel?"
That gentleman seated with her.
He's a double agent.
He works for us and for General Pham Son Ti.
"Then tell me, colonel who will she be helpful to?"
[SINGING]
"Colonel Morgan, there's a big buildup around Camp A-107."
It could be the real thing.
They've requested tac air and a flare ship.
MORGAN:
That's fine.
Keep us informed.
Captain MacDaniel had a word for you.
Butthatwas a mistake.
The White House was full of Kennedy people then.
Itstill is.
- Who do you think's behind this?
"- Well, you have C.I.A. People all overthis place."
Helms has seen to that.
And then there's Kissinger's staff.
"Kissinger himself, I believe, may be the leaker."
- Kissinger?
- He's obsessed with his own image.
He wants his Nobel peace prize a little too much.
"And as the late Dr. King proved, even an ape can win a prize with good press."
"Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office."
"He comes in here ranting and raving,"
- dumping his crap all overthe place.
- [Laughing]
"Could you prove it, Edgar?"
"Mr. President, I always getmy man."
"Yeah, you do."
This damn tie.
- Could you help me?
- Yeah.
"See, I'd be bugging myself."
Who'd getthe tapes?
No one.
Your property.
And itwould prove your case.
Why do you think Kissinger is taping allyour calls?
For history.
Hmm?
His word againstyours.
And right now...
- What's going on?
A meeting to appoint a new principal.
- How do you know it'll be Ms. Thornton?
- Nobody else deserves it.
I'll drop by the store after school.
"Goodbye, Dad."
I wish you'd stop that ridiculous performance every day.
What?
Saying goodbye or hello to my father?
Saying it to a photograph.
"I suppose it's silly, but it makes me feel that he's here."
You scarcely knew him.
It's not my fault he died when I was two.
"I can't remember him, I admit, but I miss him."
"You mean, you miss a father."
"Yes, Mother."
"Wouldn't it be nice if you had men friends, or dates, or even marry again?"
"Stop talking about fathers, husbands and marriage."
You miss him more than I ever realized.
"I'm sorry, Mother."
I'll be late.
Forgot the speech.
"- Goodbye, Mom."
- Bye.
"- Good morning, Ms. Lancie."
"- Good Morning, Allison."
"Hi, David."
"- Good morning, Mr. Herman."
"- Morning, Miss Allison."
"Go on home, Buffy."
"- Hi, Dr. Swain."
"- Morning, Allison."
Is that a big thing out here?
"Oh, yeah."
You betcha.
Folks take it real seriously -- train for months.
"Eat all sorts of wackadoo stuff, you know, like, uh..."
"Baked beans, buff wings, butter."
Butter?
Yeah.
Sometimes deep-fried.
Hm.
"This year alone, Wayne won the Butter Bowl, the Wing Ding, and Shrimptasia."
"Anyhoo, point being, Wayne McNut was the only one Slim Jim couldn't beat in the whole Great Lakes region."
So is he a suspect?
"We checked him out, but Slim Jim was in the Hot Doggery at the time of Wayne's death, and we got 15 witnesses to prove it."
Really?
Yeah.
Training.
"When I gear up for a competition, I eat lettuce -- stretches the stomach."
Yet another reason to stay away from salads.
How well did you know Wayne McNut?
"Well, well enough to know he was a weasel and a cheat."
"I hate to say it, but, uh, karma's a bitch."
This is interesting.
Mala's good-luck charms.
And Mala is...?
My old lady.
Is your old lady superstitious?
Yeah.
She's Romanichal.
Romanichal?
Gypsy.
But don't call her that.
"He doesn""t have anything to say."
"You, sir, do you have anything to say on your brother""s desire to speak to me?"
- You did it!
- No!
"See, with cheating comes lying."
And lying and lying some more.
Every single lie out of your mouth does a little more damage to you.
Lunch.
"Until one day you wake up, and you don't know who you are anymore."
"Listen, I made dinner plans tonight... with Lisa."
"It""s no big deal."
"We""re just gonna go to Perry""s."
I have to set some things right with her.
"""Make amends,"" like Pastor Paul said."
"It""s only dinner, Clara."
I promise.
"You understand, don""t you?"
Yes.
I love you.
What?
I think my husband is cheating on me.
"L""m sorry to hear that, honey."
With our receptionist.
Ex-receptionist.
Lisa.
"What was her real name, Amy?"
Rebecca Singer.
"- He""s taking her out to dinner tonight."
"- Perry""s Steakhouse."
Yeah.
"Perry""s cuts their pork chops extra thick... just the way that David likes it."
I thought that maybe you could go there and spy on him.
"Working on it, sir."

"I know the story, but go ahead."
Charlie came in the night to take the young men.
"Their family thinks he was forced by the perpetrator, who is considered dangerous."
"Take this, Beto."
Do you want to go to the hospital?
"- No, I just want to go home."
"Look at my eyes, Beto."
Bye.
May I offer you a drink?
A friend of mine was driving a Tsuru thinking that nobody knew him.
"He was kidnapped, I don't know how much he paid."
Now he drives an armoured Hummer with bodyguards.
"The dinner is ready, everybody to the table!"
"Mom, what's going to happen to Beto?"
Do you know where I can find a job?
Merry Christmas!
"Kids, before you open them, give the gifts to Beto and the maids."
"Here, Beto."
- Thank you.
"That's nice, what do we have here?"
A shirt and a watch.
- Terrific.
Are they from you or from your mom?
From Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus!
They're very nice.
Thank you for giving them to me and to Santa because he sent them.
What did he say?
"Here, give this gift to Beto?"
Yes.
"- Well, thank you."

"Thanks, madam."

"Please, be absolutely silent."

"Dear Barbuda,"
"I received your letter, and loved the invitation."
I wish I could go with you to stay with your brother in Bahia.
Isn't he the fisherman who lives by the sea in the middle of a palmfield?
But I can't go now.
"School is back, and grandma won't let me."
"But on my vacations,"
"I want to see you, and Foguinho as well."
Can you write me back?
Can you tell me where the circus will be?
"Barbuda, I have something to tell you."
I remembered everything.
Everything.
At least I know now.
"And as the days go by, I get more used to it."
"Kisses, Maria."
"Come on Maria, you don't want to spend your life on a tightrope..."

"Oh, yes."
I've been waiting for this moment a long time.
You ruined my life.
I had to live in Florida for six months!
- It's the worst.
Have you tried the pizza down here?
"- Yeah, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted."
It somehow burned my mouth and is cold at the same time.
But none of that changes the fact that you're about to go to prison for the rest of your life.

Maybe.

It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
Yep.
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report in my dad's inbox.
He keeps everything.

Papa died 12 years ago and Mama died two months later-.
12 years?
We had grandparents until 12 years ago?
Why didn't we meet them?
Your mom shunned them until they died.
"She didn't speak to them, only to me."
"Aunt Rosa, where's Maurice?"
Please tell us.
Do you know who Isabelle Moretti is?
- The actress?
- Yes.
Talk to her.
- What does she have to do with Maurice?
- She knew him.
Look her up and talk to her.
"This isn't Hollywood, she's just an actress-."
Now leave me alone.
Who are you talking about?
Why should we talk to Moretti?
Why can't you tell us?
"- I don't want to, okay?"
- Why not?
Who are they talking about?
"About Madame Isabelle Moretti, no more and no less."
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.
We start with Romeo and Juliet and end up with Isabelle Moretti.
"Suddenly Mom jumps out of windows, has abortions, she's a Communist."
I don't know who you're talking about but it sure isn't my mother.
And to top it off you invent grandparents.
Great.
"We""re going to be together, Lisa."
"L""ve got it all arranged so Clara won""t have to know."
"That""s it?"
"That""s your big announcement?"
"That""s what you wanted to tell me?"
"Well, what did you expect?"
"For me to say I""d leave Clara for you?"
Yeah.
I did.
I just did.
Sleep with me.
Just tonight.
"L""m afraid to go home."
Is she smiling or...
"Have you seen what I""ve turned her into?"
My daughter.
"My brilliant, talented, grown-up daughter hates me."
"No, she""s ashamed of me."
I have six dental practices.
I employ 50 people.
I put bread on their tables.
I work seven days a week... to build something my mom and dad could be proud of.
"Now it""s meaningless."
"Overshadowed, negated by David""s mortal sin."
- Maybe I should go.
- You have to understand.
"When I first met Clara, I never imagined I would ever..."
"Back then, her accent was so strong, she""d say, ""David."""
"That was the only thing she""d say that I could understand."
"But still she""d talk and she""d talk... and I""d watch her."
I could watch her forever.
I used to look at her... and think I had more respect for this woman than anyone I have ever known.
Very good.
We are counting on you to do your best in the national communication network sector.
I'll do my best.
"These are the new bodyguards, Kim Na Na and Shin Eun Ah."
Bodyguard Kim Na Na is 27 years old and is a 4th Dan in Judo.
Bodyguard Shin Eun Ah is 24 years old and is a 5th Dan in Taekwondo.
I already said I don't need bodyguards.
President.
"Please be with Mr. Lee, he is waiting for you."
All right.
"My child is stubborn, sorry to trouble you all."
Just treat her as your sister.
If you need to teach her a lesson then do so.
"I will do well, President."
I will do my best.
Okay.
"Because she had to repeat a year, she's a bit sensitive when it comes to school."
So please be a little more understanding.
"Don't hand in your letter of resignation, okay?"
Yes.
That Dr. Lee Yun Seong.
"Since you've studied in United States, your English must be really good."
My English is rather poor.
"You be my tutor, okay?"
"Chief, can you tell me the business plan?"
"Oh, okay."
Let's go.
"Both of you, do a good job."
"Wow, how can there be such a man?"
!
"Eonni, you saw it, right?"
He totally ignored me.
Mother?
Father?
Zendaya?

Ooh...
I've got all I need.
Good news!
"I got approval for a laptop, so now I can work up here and W-2 with my boo."
Boop!
"Jack, you better talk to her soon."
"She's only booped, like, three other guys."
Yeah.
"Man up, wuss."
"Hey, remember when I just called you a wuss?"
I'm really sorry about that.
"I just, I'm finally bonding with Emma."
It's so exciting.
"Clark, you sold out a friend to score points with a girl."
That means you're growing as a person.
Thanks.
How are you going to deal with this Amy situation?
"Oh, I don't know!"
"Usually I just tell a woman it's over, hop on a plane, and suddenly she's the TSA's problem."
I could help you.
"Uh, okay, so you've broken up with tons of girls?"
[chuckles]:
No.
They've broken up with me.
I know more about break-ups than anyone except Taylor Swift and every person she has ever dated.
"I've been dumped by nine women, and I've only dated five of them."
"Wait, wait, so four strangers just walked up to you and said, ""It's over""?"
One of them was on a bike.
So because you won't stand up to your boss...

Tomorrow morning.

"No, Mr. Fuentes, we wanna talk to both of you."
"Well, when will she be off?"
Tomorrow morning?
We'll be there before noon.
Thank you.
"-Kelly, you're up."
"Oh, hey, Marissa, I was really sorry to read about your stepdad in the paper today."
- You read the paper?
"- Just the L.A. Times, the New York Times, the Orange County Register and The Wall Street Journal."
"This relationship is probably over now, right?"
I'll just go.
"No, no, no."
Stay.
"Um, actually, we were just talking, and um..."
What are you doing this weekend?
You got to be kidding me.
"I know, I know."
"I'm sorry, but it's the only seat left."
"- Don't worry, I promise I'll keep my hands to myself."
"- Well, it's your elbow I'm worried about."
- Why do you hate me so much?
"- No, I don't;"
I'm sorry.
- What did I do?
- It was an accident.
"- No, it was like four accidents."
"- Six, if you count each individual tampon."
- I don't know what else you want me to say.
- Nothing.
"In fact, we never need to speak to each other again."
"- Yeah, see, but I was really enjoying getting to know you."
"- Well, I wasn't."
- I was being sarcastic.
- I wasn't.
"Morning, guys."

- Enough for all the ladies who do high tea at the Bel-Air.
"Yeah, I remember my first campaign."
I didn't care about image.
I would show up at a fundraiser in the same suit that I wore to the previous night's fundraiser.
"Sometimes my wife and I would bring the kids,"
- strapped to us in those backpacks.
- Sounds like fun.
"No, it was, and then we'd rush home, put the kids to bed and then stay up all night laughing about the evening."
Sounds like you and your wife made a good team.
Ex-wife.
"And, yeah, we did."
For a while.
Do you miss her?
I miss the people we were back then.
"And no, I don't miss who she is now."

"Because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference."
- Thank you and good day.
- Mr. Nixon.
I
- Is this the end of politics foryou?
- [Reporters Shouting]
[Shouting Continues]
[March]
[Announcer] Here in California... we can officially write the political obituary of Richard Milhouse Nixon.
"Asmall town lawyer like Lincoln, Nixon became a representative at 33... and a senatorat 35... as partofthe postwar Republican sweep ofthe congressional elections... that attacked F.D.R.'s big-government new deal."
"Running as a South Pacific veteran, victories overCongressmanJerry Voorhis and Senator Helen Gahagan Douglas... made it clearthat, to Nixon, politics was war."
"He didn't have opponents, he had enemies."
"Why, she's pink, right down to her underwear."
I
"Nixon became one of the leading lights... on the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee, questioning labor leaders, Spanish Civil Warveterans, Hollywood celebrities."
"If I had myway, they'd all be sent back to Russia."
But itwas the Alger Hiss case that made Nixon a household name.
"One ofthe architects ofthe United Nations, intimate of F.D.R. And Oliver Wendell Holmes,"
Alger Hiss was a State Department diplomat... accused by freelance journalist WhittakerChambers... ofpassing secret documents to the Soviet Union.
- Hiss is lying.
- Hiss claimed he was being set up... by Nixon andJ.
Edgar Hooverto discredit the new deal's policies.

You better go.

Drink up!
Flip over the kimchi that you've eaten!
Flip it over yourself.
It's too bright.
Wait!

Any story.
What kind of story?

I was faster than Rex.
Because you shut the door in his face.
"Strange, that."
Maybe it was the wind.
Let's go now!!
- He's gonna hit me.
I promise.
I won't hit you.
"You promise, right?"
I said I promise.
"- Honey, I'm sorry!"
- Please come to your senses now.
You guys are made for each other.
What a show.
Go home and cry!
-What are you throwing out?
- The stew's too salty.
It's burning!

"You know that, right?"
"You too, for 3 years!"
- Wait.
-Why?
I have this.

-What's wrong with you all of a sudden?
Stop complaining.
Last time was the Big Sister.
Now you want me to be gay.
"No, thanks."
I don't want anything going through my back door.

- Too much.
Too much.
- I'll teach you a lesson.
Son of a bitch.

This is my nephew.
Can't you try it on now?
It should suit you.
No.
Go home now.
Alright.

Go and take this.

-What were you thinking coming here?
- I'm sorry.
No one knows who I am.
Open it.
Who is he?
His name is Venkat.
He is handsome and 6 feet tall.
That is the main problem.
Thank you.
Do you want another?
- It is enough for now.
Are you Venkat?
Yes.
Boss is calling you.
Get in to the jeep.
- Which boss?
This territory has only one boss.
Bhadram sir.
Why does he wants me?
Hey!
He got some work.
Shut up and get in to the jeep.
The boy is with me.
You go.
I will drop him at the house and follow you.
Who is he?
He is talking opposite to what we say.
Put both of them in the jeep.
Come on.
What is this?
Why are you so angry with us?
Sorry sir.
I said I will come.
Please leave the boy.
I would not cause any harm just caress him.
Take the boy home.

Don't cry...
I feel very ashamed before you.
Don't tell anybody.
I promise.
I won't tell anybody.
"But you have to promise me, too..."
"Whatever happens, don't give up on life."
Life is very valuable.
"You saw the bottom of the pain, Narin."
I'm not going to make it.
"Hey, put him down."
Down.
Let him down.
"Bastard, why did you let him fall off, huh?"
Go drive the ambulance.

"Hey, how much are those two bottles of pepsi?"
"Well, it's been paid for."
"The man at that table has paid, sir."
What's this?
He's your next victim.
No way.
This is way too much.
"The last time, I had to put up with that Che."
"It's disgusting, eww..."
Don't get too dramatic.
Hey.
I've always managed.
What are cannibals doing here?
Those are also the robots I built.
-Then stop them!
-Well that is...
They will let you go if you pay $100.
This is too much.
Making money even with this?
"If you pay extra $500, they will make you their chief."
How does that sound like?
"Atom, where in the world are you?"
"Hey, Pura."
Where are you going?
Don't go too far.
Pura!
Watch out!
"You must be Zora, right?"
What a suction power!
I could get rid of it if Pura weren't with me.
It's not that smart.
"That's not your mom, Pura."
There it is!
Follow it immediately.
Don't lose it!
Huh?
What is that?
Waterfall...
Let's take a rest.
"Ah, Pura."
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Is something there?
All right.

Like a honeymoon.
- I can't go.
-You promised.
I'm in front of my house.
Okay.
I'll be home soon.
-What's wrong?
- Did I leave the stove on?
The rice cooker?
- It only takes him 30 minutes to get home.
What are you doing?
Which is this way to console someone?
What consolation means to the ruined people?
We're goner!
We're ruined!
"I pray to God, why he didn't picked me?"
Those goons could have kidnapped me in place of Radha.

Just rub my back.
"Mohit, come here, dear."
My God!
Mohit!
Rub my back.

Why are you rubbing it softly?
Do it with pressure.

Whatever you say.
But the girl is really nice. t seems we've got a spring in the garden.
Our life passed between thieves and criminals.
But she sings so well!
What a dance!
Wow!
Rub in my front body too.
- Look out!
- I can hear someone breathing.
- Where?
- There's nobody there.
"- I tell you, I can hear like an owl!"
"- Hey, Mitrofanova."
"Such an important uncle, and you are making a Babylon of your hair!"
You know what I'm saying?
"- All right, Marat."
Go on.
- Maybe it'll sting through the shirt?
- Off with it!
"- And your pants, too."
"- Oh, come on!"
"- What, you think epidemics leave tan lines?"
"Rash all over, except the butt?"
"- Go on, then!"
"- Come on, guys, can't we do it all together?"
- We can!

"- Come on, guys!"
For the win!

Hello.
"Play it, play it."
"Go ahead, feed Him."

Take a look.
- What's wrong with the mic?
Where's everyone going?
"Go, go."
- No.
Where are you going?
- Go.
Get down.
Play it.
- Wait everyone.
Wait.
Even Siddeshwar Maharaj is asking you to go.
"Go, go, leave."
- Leave me.
What have you done?
"No, papa."
"- Fool, breaking pots during exam times."
"Stop it, stop it."
Go and feed some butter to the Lord.
I won't stop you next time.
Stop you fool!
You'll be punished for your unpardonable sin.
He will punish you Himself.
He will punish you.
Don't try to scare me in the name of Lord.
Could we get off that subject?
"I want us to be friends, Harry."
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
"If you knew who he was, would you tell me?"
May.
"Oh, what, Ben?"
Wait.
Aunt May.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, Peter."
"Oh, for a second there, I thought I was years ago."
"Everybody's gone, aren't they?"
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
You okay?
Of course.
But you go home.
And be careful.
I don't like that scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
"Oh, my."
You did?
"Oh, well."
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
"Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore."
"I'm tired, and you better start back home."
"Here, kiddo."
Still you better give them a call.
They are really worried.
"Especially Cemre Abla, she called me at least 20 times."
- 20?
"- Okay, maybe 10."
Where have you been?
I was worried to death!
Here I am.
"See you, bro!"
"Okay, go on."
Thanks.
God bless.
Your phone was off.
Yunus said he didn't know where you were.
I was scared.
"Here I am, in one piece."
Don't panic.
- Called you father?
- Mhm.
We kept waiting at the gates for you to come out.
"You escaped from us, huh?"
Where did you go?
What did you do?
There was a error.
I just had to fix it.
"That Barış jerk, I fixed him."
I knew you'd do something like that.\
"Don't worry, from now on."
That punk can't do anything to you.
You don't worry.
Okay?
Okay.
"No, no!"
That family had drowned!
But one guy from that unlucky family had escaped!
Today he is standing in front of you as your death!
Then you will remember this knife too!
I used it to kill your father!
Where is shekhar?
- Who?
Tiger!

And let love happen.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
It's none of your business.
Sit down.
Look at your friend.
Who got bit by a stroke.
"Yes, Sylvester."
Gaze at her and make her pay.
Pay money?!
See...
Stop laught at him.
Hush!
This is a hospital.
What's the matter?
"Nurse, get him out of the hospital."
Why you call me out?
He's my buddie.
"Good, follow me, sir."
Is it OK?
Don't you play tricks!
We contacted his family... ...but they denied know him.
We found these in his pocket.
Stop looking at him.
What do you said?
Shut your big mouth.
You're a big mouth!
What is this?
These are blood-stayed but they aren't your friend's.
"Mom, let's go look for him."
Look for who?
Your husband.
I saw him with a woman yesterday.
He's got a mistress.
Don't you know that?
There he is.
(pulsating echo)
Thank God.

Yeah.
Oh.
"Oh, my... what is..."
No.
"Go, go, go, go, go."
"Ah, there he is."
God.
That scared me.
Aw.
Did it just die?
Did the flashlight just die?
"Well, gentlemen, I think it's all over."
"I can't see anything, and he's behind me somewhere."
(footsteps crunching)
It's just a matter of time before he catches me.
"I'm smacking tree-- oh, my God."

I love and hate this game so much.

My hand is shaking.
Ksanka's got to go.
Ksanka.
Ksanka!
Get back into your girl's clothes.
You'll go to Zbruyevka.
Maybe she oughtn't to go alone?
Find out how many there are and how long they'll stay.
"You ferry her there and then back, Yashka."
Go to Aunt Darya's.
"Good luck to you, Joan of Arc!"
Why did he call you that Joan of Arch?
What does it mean?
Something like a psychologist.
He knows all sorts of bourgeois words.
Valerka told me they burned that Joan of Arc.
He probably just made it up.
- Ksanka.
- What?
I like you prettier in girl's clothes.
What things you say!
That's right.
What are you doing?
I won't let you go alone.
I'm going with you.
You want to give me away?
Don't argue.
Go back.
Ksanka!
Ksanka!
"Wait, Ksanka!"
What were Danka's orders?
It's not that.
I'm about to lose my house.
Where will we stay?
"On the streets, or in their house?"
Do we have any other option?
Why don't you understand?
"Come on, Jigna."
Sit in the car.
Come.
- He's made a mess of things.
I won't leave papa.
I'll slap you if you refuse.
"- No, mother."
"Come on, sit inside."
Please..
Hello.
Hello.
Who is it?
- Bhagwan (God).
What?
"lf you were a Muslim, I would've said Allah."
"lf you were a Christian, then Jesus Christ."
"You're a Hindu, so Krishna."
"You, here?"
"You're an excellent stuntman, really."
Very good.
I'm sure you're acting is decent as well.
Why don't you approach some television channel?
They keep remaking Ramayan and Mahabharat.
Krishna.
Suited-booted Krishna.
Here to teach me a lesson.
Look.
Take care.
We might not be able to see again until the trial.
You want anything from us?
No.
Just your good health.
Tell the lawyer if you wanna eat anything.
I'll cook and send it over.
"Okay, but it's not needed."
"I took a vow, when you get out of this place... ..."
I will feed orphans.
Look...
Stay away from the prison dogs.
- God be with you.
- Stay away from them.
Inshallah you'll be out after the first trial.
We'll see.
Inshallah.
We got the appointment for 13th of the month.
"Oh that, I got it."
I wish you the best.
Good for you...
"Goodbye, son."
See you.
- See you.
- Goodbye.
Handan Pakel.
Can I have my bag?
Have a good day.
"Ilyas, where are you?"
"Okay, I'm coming."
Can I have my ID as well?
Sami Tekinoğlu.
Why not?
You challenged him to a race.
Look.
He called the lift for you.
All right.
I'll reconsider.
What's up?
Do we have to walk the rest?
Rex wanted to show you he can both call and stop a lift.
I think he's shown me enough for today.
"Hello, Anna."
What are you doing here?
"Mummy, Daddy's here."
"I know, darling."
- Did you come for something?
- Just what we agreed on.
"- One, two..."
- You can take the lot.
I want what I was awarded in the divorce settlement.
They're taking my job off me.
Have you been drinking?
Did you hear what I said?
I've lost my job.
Don't you care?
You didn't ask how Anna and I are.
"Come on, darling."
You're still talking about yourself.
"No, I don't really care."
"Bye, Dad."
I hope we've got enough to last.
Höilerer isn't here.
There should be enough.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
But I love Kishan.
Then get ready for the ruin.
I agree.
Welcome!
Kishan!

And Jimmy has done this.

"I don't scold him, I don't go drinking..."
How long has it been hurting?
Yes?
- Just... since the accident.
"- No, I don't mean that."
Haven't you had abdominal pain?
It must've been quite severe.
Listen carefully to what I tell you.
I already told your husband.
"Wait a minute, wait!"
Time out!
Wait!
I didn't mean to hit you.
Nice job.
You're the best human sandbag.
Excuse me!
"Sorry, but could you do me a favor?"
- Me?
- Yes.
"If he asks who you are,"
-just tell him you're someone I know.
-Yes...
Yes... hello?
I am...
What is... your name?
"Mi-ryung, Song Mi-ryung."
"Well, I'm an acquaintance of Song Mi-ryung."
And next?
I want to break up with him.
Uh... pink.
"Yes, I have a pink sari. ..."
"But, it has big flowers."
The big flowers will look very nice.
Now go!
Your daughter is very innocent.
Your dream has come true.
"Miss, your airman has come!"
"Renu, are you all right?"
What's happening?
"- Nothing, sir."
Where is Renu?
- She is inside the house.
"I am aware of that but, where is she?"
- She's inside the house.
Are you all right?!
"- Yes, sir."
"Aunty, give me my clothes."
It's getting late.
Suraj will be here soon.
I have arrived.
I thought that it was aunty.
Get out from my room!
Come out.
There's no need to feel shy.
Our wedding is also fixed.
Shameless man!
Impertinent!
Are you going or....
Get dressed quickly.
We are getting late for the function.
Give me something to wear.
"- And do you know how many ""Inochkins"" I've got?"
- 263.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Want some fruit punch?
- No.
- Dismissed.
"- Let's go, kids."
- Kids.
"- Hey, swimmer."
Swam one too many?
Too late now.
Here's your ticket.
- Got anyone at home?
- Grandma.
- She in good health?
- Uh-huh.
"- That's all right, then, she'll do."
Will you manage on your own?
I ain't got time to play nanny all day.
The milk will go sour.
"All right, let's say I get there."
Grandma doesn't know anything.
Probably singing some song.
She'll see me and say...
"""Kostya."
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something?"""
- Kostya.
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something? ...and then, of course, ""You'll be the death of me!"""
- You'll be the death of me!
"Yep, here we go."
"""Why did you kill your grandma?"""
"- Don't forget what I told you last night, OK?"
Vural.
- Don't (do something silly).
- OK.
"Naci, take Vural where he needs to go."
- What's the matter?
"- Last night, he kept me up till morning."
- What's his problem?
- He says Kerim didn't do anything.
- Get out of here.
- He meant it.
Selim!
He says that the girl was unconscious.
And Kerim was just sitting beside her.
He was gonna tell Kerim everything but I talked him out of it.
Is he out of his mind?
"- Selim, what are you doing there?"
"- Coming, dad."
He really didn't do it?
God damn it.
Now we're done for!
It's on the Internet now.
We can't stop it now.
It'll be on the newspapers tomorrow.
God damn it!
Did you talk to Kerim?
These idiots don't know where he is.
"I'm calling him, uncle."
He's not picking up.
Stop calling him.
He'll think it's a big deal.
Let him think it's a big deal.
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.
[ Finch ]
She reads the articles.
[ Boys Moaning ]
Is she ?
She's goin' downstairs.
[ Moaning ]
"- Oh, my God !"
"- Jackpot, baby !"
- Can you believe this ?
"- Nadia, I would have never known."
I have an announcement that I would like to make.
There is a gorgeous woman... masturbating on my bed !
- [ Finch ]
"Thank you, Nadia !"
"- If you ever had a chance with Nadia, this is it."
- [ Scoffs ]
"What am I supposed to do, Kev ?"
- Seduce her.
Wha-- What the hell would I say ?
Go over there and ask her if she needs an extra hand.
"- That's stupid, Kev."
I can't-- - That's not stupid !
You're stupid if you don't go !
Come on !
Get over there !
"- Get goin', man."
She's prime.
- Get out of here !
- She's waitin' for you.
"- Okay, all right."
- Showing them a TV.
This is not done.
- That's how I do it.
I sold all TV's.
Only one or two are left.
What are you doing?
Do you intend to loot?
How can they loot like that?
What do you mean by threatening me with a gun?
Keeping a gun on the temple means. . .
Gun?. . .
Gun ! . . .
Neelambar!
You were making a bill and demanding money?
I'll pay you !
Move it. . . move it both sides.
What are you doing?
- Kick him.
"Neelambar, call the police."
Call the police!
What happened?
- Mr. Gorpade has come.
"Mr. Gorpade, they were stealing our TV's and Videos."
Who?
Where?
- Over there.
You always give wrong direction.
- Thieves?
"Constable, arrest them."
Beat them up.
What happened?
"For the first time, while shopping with you, I made an arrest."
I will talk to him.
My boss called you.
You rejected.
So he himself came here.
Why are you sitting without respect?
I am the person who beat your people.
It was not my mistake.
You called me.
I said I will come.. ..after dropping the boy at home.
They tried to hurt the boy.
I will kill.. ..the person who tries to hurt the boy.
Uncle!
"Look here, I am an elderly person advising you."
Obey my words and forget that girl.
Which girl?
- What was her name?
Shailaja.
Shailu!?
Why should I forget her?
Because my boss is loving her.
"Hey, You will not be in Warangal."
In that case I will stay in Karim Nagar.
"Tell me uncle, he is loving her but does she love him?"
Who needs that?
My boss loves her.
That is enough.
It is not enough uncle.
Your boss is loving her.
I am loving her.
She loves me.
So she is mine.
I am an young guy asking you.
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
"Ladies, five minutes."
Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
"Work out, plenty of rest."
"You know, eat your green vegetables."
Thas what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on.
Go.
Keep it steady.
Is a web.
"Go, Spidey, go!"
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should forgive them?
Yes.
"I mean, no."
Hey.
Hey.
"Hey, chief."
"You park there, I'm towing it."
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
Can I help you?
"Yeah, I've come to see the show."
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
No one will be seated after the doors are closed.
Will you answer me?
Come on.
"Now, Cheyney, no more of that."
Wake up.
Stop.
"Come on, get up."
Frank Jordan?
Who the devil's Frank Jordan?
I'm Frank Jordan.
You empty-minded jerk.
What were you doing in the car with his wife and kid?
I'm the gardener.
The boy got hurt in the yard.
I was driving him to the doctor.
Calluses and dirt under the nails.
"Well, that's no millionaire, that's the hired help."
"Congratulations, you got us a real prize, didn't you?"
"Ah, what am I supposed to do?"
The kid was even hugging him.
The gardener.
That's terrific.
"What's he worth, Cheyney?"
"Five dollars, maybe 10?"
"Oh, don't."
Don't.
"Pryor, I wanted."
I wanted to make him sweat out every minute.
What'd you say your name was?
Frank.
"Not a bad looking guy, Frank."
Never mind how he looks.
How long you been with the Pryors?
Your yenge is calling.
If you say her anything...
What's the matter sir?
You're bothering our customers.
"- It's okay, we're sorry."
"- You can go out, and sort it out there if you want."
It's all right.
It's over now.
"- You couldn't wake up, huh?"
- I wasn't sleeping.
And we departed in the morning.
We're half way there.
- When do you think you'll be here?
- Hopefully before it's dark.
- Where are you?
- We're in a hotel in Beyoglu.
"Okay, we'll come there then."
Is it Fatmagül?
"- What's Fatmagül doing, is she with you?"
"- Give it to me, let me talk with her."
- Her brother wants to talk.
- Give it to me.
Hello?
Hello?
No body is there.
- Abi...
- Are you all right sister?
"- I am OK, are you coming?"
- We're on our way.
We hit the road before the dawn.
Are you OK?
- I think about all the time.
When daddy has put the incense in here.
[bell rings]
That's it.
"Good morning, mummy. boy speaking native language:"
"Good morning, mummy. man speaking native language:"
"Good, now put the incense out."
Good. boy speaking native language:
All done.
I want some water.
[man speaking native language]
[woman laughs]
[man coughs]
man:
Today we're gonna videotape Sasha doing his first ever shave.
Sasha:
"Oh, boy. man:"
Sasha is how old now?
Sasha:
Uh...15. man:
All right.
Sasha:
15. man:
The first thing Sasha's doing is getting the water hot to put a hot cloth on his face.
Sasha:
Yes. man:
So that it'll warm up your face and moisturize your skin.
"Does he have, like, a nice, warm face now?"
Sasha:
It's always been hot. man:
All right.
Yes.
"Whatever you say there, dude."
But I never had the proof.
"What are you talking about, Marla?"
"Your husband, Barry.... my ex-husband, Barry..."
"Denise, Barry's a selfish bastard."
What?
No!
"No, he's not."
No.
Look.
-Oh my god.
-Mm-hm
This is not happening.
He fooled me too.
There were always signs.
What signs?
Think about it!
Haven't you ever been stuck out in the cold with him?
"I got pneumonia once, but..."
You got lucky.
I lost a finger.
Frostbite.
Think about your last birthday.
Happy Birthday to you!
Mmm!
It's spongy.
Selfish bastards can't participate in the celebration of others.
It's been documented.
No!
It's not true!
He loves people.
He was so close to his brother and sister.
Selfish bastards recreate the past for personal gain.
Ay!
Ay! &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;All you needed to do was open your mouth.
I can't lie.
Smart ass!
What should we eat?
Uh...
How about ribs?
I like rib patties.
That is slightly...
Then do you want to have sushi?
I know a great place.
"Their fried fish is also good. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;And, they also have Yeongdeok snow crab."
"Even that... for the time being, no..."
Then what do you want to eat?
What about pizza?
Pizza?
We haven't had it lately.
"Oh, Pizza sounds great."
Really?
Then where should we go?
How about Marco's?
Their pizza is good!
That place is expensive.
Let's go where we always go.
Ah!
The pizzeria at the crossroad?
Hey!
There is no place to sit there.
"Baek Go Dong, let's go somewhere else."
Somewhere else!
Forget it.
Go there!
"Uh, it's, uh..."
Wait a minute.
[laughs]
A stupid question.
"""What day is it?"""
Ah.
Sorry. woman:
Okay. man:
It's 24 July.
[laughs]
woman:
And what a day it is. man:
It's the best day ever.
woman:
You might be wondering why I'm up at this ungodly hour.
"Like others, I believe that the time between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. is one where the veil between this world and the next is the thinnest."
"Often during this time of the day,"
I hear the sound of my name uttered by an unseen presence.
[dog barks]
[rooster crows]
woman:
Good morning.
[woman #2 speaking native language] [woman laughs]
man:
Whoa.
[laughs] [speaking native language] That's nice.
man:
And here we go into the garage.
That's right.
We're going to ride in the elevator.
All right.
Let's ride it.
Why not?
That's because he's your younger brother.
You're my daughter.
I'm your real father.
Nonsense.
I don't believe this!
We have different surnames.
My child
"No matter what your surname is, you're indeed my daughter."
"I have a jade pendant here, it's the same as the one you're carrying."
They're the love tokens of your mother and l;
Take a look.
Mother.
Mother.
What's going on?
It's all because of your father.
Do you know that?
Miss Mu is your elder sister.
What are you doing?
Royal Uncle asked us to keep you under watch.
Yellow Robe Man...
Canglong.
Back off.
I'll deal with them on my own.
Move over.
Let me deal with him.
Moonlight Palm.
"If I jump, then there is nothing to worry about."
Catch her.
What are your wicked plans?
Senior.
Where are we taking them to?
Thank you.
"Take it, man."
Take it.
It's my habit to help poor friends.
"Keep it, man."
"- No, thank you, sir."
Your size is smaller than mine.
As my chest is wider than you.
Neither my poverty nor your friendship can cover it.
Hey... this guy is self-made.
I like it.
Is this your bike?
"- Yes, it's mine."
Which model?
- Yamah Rajdoot 350.
"It's a very good bike, sir."
A latest model of our company.
No 1 bike in India.
Indian bike!
Indian bike is a Indian bike!!
"Shit tank, shit tyre!"
And shit model!
"What nonsense is this, Jimmy?"
"Don't get angry, darling."
He's right.
Indian is Indian and foreign is foreign.
"Now see, this foreign metal."
It's very strong.
You can punch it anywhere.
Nothing will happen to it.
Hit it here or there...
Keep hitting... keep hitting anywhere.
- I did everything for you!
"I did everything, what else do you want me to do?"
"For God's sake, Basha."
Is your heart that cold?
"I beg you, answer me!"
What?
Answer me!
Popoy stop it!
Basha...
I love you.
And it hurts.
Take me!
Right now!
Take me right now!
Hello?
Where are you?
Huh?
Where?
"I've been going around here over and over, where are you?"
I'm coming.
You keep saying you're coming but I still can't find you!

"It could be really bad, at the end."
"What are you saying , man?- Don't use every opportunity, to come close to Mira."
I don't want to see you next to her again.
"Man, Nylon (Plastic), Whom are you threatening?"
"Get away from my girlfriend, otherwise I will cut your legs."
"Man, i would chew you on this soil and plant parsley over your body."
Leave..

- Who are those fitties?
"- They're well beyond fit, they're lush."
They are sex gods.
- They must be newbies.
"- Ace Gang, it's boy-stalking time."
Ladies?
- They have mushy peas and chips.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, definitely."
I want them!
You're here.
You're late.
Get changed.
We're going on a family outing.
- Do we have to?
"- What do you mean, do we have to?"
You used to love doing things with the family.
"Georgia, don't start, not tonight."
We're going to the Bonker's Buffet and your granddad's coming as well.
"Oh, look out."
"Oh, no."
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Did you think I was that stupid?
I knew you looked familiar!
I should have known then!
I knew that you knew me!
I'm really stupid.
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
"Was it you, Chief?"
Don't try to trick me again!
I know everything!
"Long time no see, Doe Eyes."
So it was you!
Have you become a bandit for the people?
- I guess you can say that.
- I'm so glad to see you!
You're amazing!
We should rush your marriage to In Hyung.
I'm not interested in it.
You do what you have to.
This marriage was never what I wanted anyway.
Alright then.
Go and rest.
How do I get rid of that little...!
- But you're hurt.
- I'm alright.
It's alright if it hurts.
Miss Eun Hye!
"I heard you were safe, but I still had to come."
- Are you hurt?
- Go back.
I will do everything in my power to catch the man who did this to you!
How?
Really?
"There're so many of us, we're not afraid of her sword."
Right...
Eat...
"They want to kill her, what now?"
"If she dies, then no one could save Miss Zhong."
Right.
"I'll send her a message first, then she won't kill me."
Waiter.
For the bill.
"""Shigu Town"""
This is it.
Anyone home?
"There're eight people coming to hassle you,"
I'm here to give you this message.
Anyone home?
You are...
"Don't be so sneaky, get in here!"
I have...
"I know that they're going to hassle you, that's why I rushed here."
But it's too late.
What's your name?
Tuan Yu.
Any last wishes?
You better tell me now.
"There's a young lady called Zhong Ling, she's trapped by the Poisonous Moths Clan... at Wuliang Hill, she sent me here for you."
"Don't waste anymore time, better go."
Get out!
I don't want to kill anyone today.
What are you talking about?
Go.
After her...
Why do you want to know my bra size?
Huh?
- I never knew Su-eun was so dirty-minded.
- Get away from me!
Happy birthday to you!
"Happy birthday dear Su-eun, Happy birthday to you."
-Congratulations!

"Sister-in-law, I'll give you a better present than this."
How about a blind date?
Really?
With who?
"Well, in my station, there's..."
"No, No firemen."
Letter to Santa.
"""Dear Santa, I have been SO good this year..."""
You know what?
No!
"No, I am not listening to any more of this!"
You're just jealous!
Long term exposure has compromised your ability to judge.
There is no way I am married to a selfish bastard!
(SMACK!)
"Focus, Denise!"
Think about all that you have sacrificed.
How could I be so stupid?
"Don't go there, Denise!"
You deserve so much more.

"Denise, you deserve oral sex."
But... he said that was...
Impossible.
That it's just...
A scam.

Jamna!

That's it.
My Radha...
"Yes, sister-in-law."
She'll definitely come back.
She'll definitely come back.
But God...
In which condition?
I just can't think over it.
That young boy and young girl...
And she'll be all alone.
And that too in a jungle!
Wonder what he must be doing with her.
And Radha is so innocent.
She doesn't know anything about this world.
She's so innocent.
- What will happen with her?
- Aunt!

You don't do someone on the deck.
"What's fucking wrong with you, eh?"
"He'll bury us all and, what, you just gonna sit down and watch him do it?"
No.
"No, Steve, you're the Major."
You started this firm.
"I'm speaking for all the boys, we got the biggest ruck... ...of our lives coming up and your brother's too much of a bottle job to lead us."
The GSE is Pete's firm.
All right?
He calls the shots.
Yeah?
"Well, fuck the lot of you."
GSE?
Get out of the fucking way!
Move!
Get yourself cleaned up.

No one will be in until tomorrow.
Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
"No, I can't take that from you."
"Yes, you can!"
You can take this money from me.
"For God's sake, is not much."
"Now, take it!"
And don't you dare leave it here.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Is just that I miss your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that is two years next month since he was taken?
"I think to myself at times... ...were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd..."
"Oh, I don't know what I'd do."
Now... ...you better take the rest of your cake home.

"Oh, boy, yeah."
"""Oh, boy, yeah"" what?"
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?

You're such a mystery.

Just--just no.
That's really all she said.
"Just ""no."""
She didn't want any of that.
"Ever, possibly."
"Never, ever."
"And so, uh..."
"Well, actually, I said,"
"""What about the possibility of a possibility?"""
And she said-- She said no to that.
No possibility.
None.

Her daughter's name was Andrea.
"A beautiful name, isn't it?"
Nothing to say?
"No, not now."
"We'll talk again later, okay?"
I was so freaked out.

To scare you.
To scare the living (bleep) out of you.
I don't know.
You told me to find a piece of paper.
"To find the eight pages, which I failed miserably."
(chuckles) (Finebros) And how did it make you feel when you were playing?
I said stay there.
You hear me?
Where's my mommy?
"She's gone, but..."
I can't do it.

Your mommy... told me she'd be back soon.
She said you have to be good... and wait for her here.
Okay?

I'm scared.
Don't leave me here alone.

There's a problem with your brother's certificate... we couldn't find it.
"You said he was born in June 1980, but it's not here."
What do you mean it's not here?
"He may not have been born here, or it could be a mistake."
"However, we just moved here and everything still has to be saved on the computer so..."
Pablo?
God.
We found your brother's car this morning in the woods 20 miles away from Tolhuin.
It'd been there all night.
Come on!
Cut!
Okay.
Are you Ok?
Is everything alright?
Except for blood on my chest.
"Yeah, right."
It's the winter.
Once the ice stabs the bones he realizes that he's alive.
Nice!
What a line!
"Dad, you're a novelist now?"
"A novelist, that's really off the wall."
Can't recall the things you've done.
"Uh, a truck driver... a cabaret singer..."
You and your samba... a dance instructor... a month at acting school to become an actor...
Remember that?
"Hey, stick to what's going on now."
Dwelling on the past... not a manly thing to do.

The fridge is broken so put them in cold water.
Yes.
Do you drink?

You're cringing.

Where did this come from?
This is a real baby elephant.
I'm going to make it my pet.
Stop it!
It's prohibited to capture real animals.
"Don't you dare to stop me, stupid robot!"
I'm sure it came from some hunting prohibited area nearby.
"This is a safari park made only with robots, right?"
It's his fault for coming here.
Why can't I hunt it?
"Wh, what are you!"
I'm Atom.
Stop it!

Lieutenant Gerard's out of town.
SOPHlE:
"I never liked him, right from the beginning."
"So when I saw this picture, I called the cops."
"You think he killed your friend, Priamos?"
Sure he killed him.
"Gus found out who he was, so he killed him."
"He's been spotted before, and he didn't kill."
"What do you mean, ""didn't kill""?"
"He killed his wife, didn't he?"
The law says he did.
Okay.
"So if Gus ain't dead, where is he?"
He hasn't been seen all day.
"The car's gone, and the money's gone."
Where's the money?
What money?
"Gus had 8,000 bucks."
Choose.
Jackie Chan or Taekwondo.
I can do both well!
Fine.
Ten more laps then.

Think what you like.
"As I told you before, my goal is not winning a Gold but to graduate."
He will only bring her back.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
So what have you decided?
I will bring her.
Not because I love her but since I need money.
Money?!
Money is not a problem.
Tell me how much you want.
I will ask after I get her back.

Just want to be honest.

Confession...
I did plan on doing it.
"Banu, see what you did to us."
"Read it, further details in the paper."

- Okay Güney.
You thought I could be the murderer.
You accused me in your head.
You didn't believe me.
But see what happened?
The truth has come out.
You accused me for nothing.
Was it worth it?
But you were talking in your sleep.
You said it yourself.
Honey...
"Look, it was only your imagination."
You gotta admit that yourself.
Stop doubting me.
Erase the suspicions in your mind.
"Don't do this to us, if you want us to be like before."

"Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to."
It's so fun!
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves
"Yes, it's true."
"Oh, Ha Ni!"
Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.
It seems I have forgotten!
"Sure, I'll be right back"
"You know that closet towards the inside, right?"
I know
OH!
It's the couples T-shirt!
He still has it.
Room for rent
Part time job?
What are you doing in someone else's room?
You came?
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.
Then you should have just gotten it and left.
What are you looking through?
"Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae."
He said that you might even move out of this house.
"Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?"
It's true.
Huh?
I'm going to leave this house.
Why?
What do you mean why?
Do I need to get your permission for that too?
That's not it....
No!
Are you alright?
That fellow has taken a hostage!
We have to get him.
Go!
Seize him!
So you mean... my Eun Hye... ...disappeared while looking for the dead Hong Gil Dong?
She ran out to help Hong Gil Dong.
But she disappeared.
What will we do if she gets hurt while she's with him?
What if she gets caught with him?
I will find her myself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your Excellency!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Miss Eun Hye has been taken hostage by thugs!
What?
They're dangerous!
Please send for more men!
They must not be caught!
Eun Hye...!
It's alright now.
Just stay here and then go home.
Let's see.
I must have stepped on a broken piece of pottery.
You got cut.
How did you run in this state?
Because I had to run fast to get you out of danger.
"Young Master, are you alright now?"
Yes.
Why were you so agitated just now?
And what was that about not losing me?
- That was...
- Were you troubled because I was angry at you?
Yes.
Rajesh!
- Now you can keep your gal with you!
"Rajesh, seema is not what you think of her!"
But how come that flower string was with you?
Forget that flower string!
"Believe me, Rajesh! seema is sacred like the Ganges!"
"Marry her, Rajesh!"
Marry her! only you can keep her happy!
And look..
I have fixed your alliance!
"lf you didn""t marry her, then her family""s image will be tarnished!"
"Look, Rajesh!"
I beg you!
I plead with you!
You have done so many favours on me!
Do one more favour on me!
"Marry seema, Rajesh!"
Marry seema!
Are you drinking poison? - seema!
Look here!
"Look here, sister-in-law!"
"Look who is the groom! shekhar! seema, I had told you that love is very strong!"
It can face any big storm! so what?
"I don""t accept this wedding!"
"This is not a wedding! lts betrayal! lt""s cheating!"
"I didn""t expect this joke from you!"
"This is not a joke! lts true, Mrs. Dinanath!"
Actually I was going to marry her.
"But when I found out about shekhar and seema""s love.. ..l fulfilled my duty!"
This is not duty!
This is betrayal!
I will report to lG sir!
"You're gonna get it now, you little Yank."
"Bov, you wanna make up for what you've done?"
Get my brother's family out of here.
Tommy!
"Don't you want to finish me off, then?"
"You're already finished, little Petey."
"The NTO will take care of you in a minute, you mug."
"We didn't kill your son, Tommy!"
You did!
"You should have protected him, mate!"
He was your son!
- Don't you talk about my fucking son.
"- He was your son, Tommy!"
- Get in the fucking motor!
Get in the car!
- Get Pete!
Only a poor little Hammer!
His face was all battered and torn!
He made me feel sick!
I hit him with a brick!
Now the cunt's not laughing or singing No more!
"- He's not laughing or singing-- - No, Tommy, he's had enough!"
I'll get us out of here.
Go.
- You can't leave him.
- Pete!
Pete!
Fucking help him!
Pete Dunham's life taught me there's a time to stand your ground.
His death taught me there's a time to walk away.
I would never have the chance to thank him.
But I could live in a way that would honor him.
Get the ram!
"Citizens of Alexandria,"
you have nothing to fear from Caesar
Egypt and Rome have always been close...
"Magnificent, isn't it?"
We want our Queen!
We want our Queen!
We want our Queen!

"Your Majesty, let us come with you, on your journey"

Your Queen ...
Your Queen accepts Caesar as her friend and sovereign what is that?
Come!

"You've won, Cleopatra"
"- Quick, everyone, hurry!"
Put them on!
- Whose slippers are these?
- Mine!
"- Hey, who's missing?"
- How should I know?
- He got away.
- Lost one.
- Inochkin!
- All together!
- Inochkin!
- Inochkin!
- Inochkin!
And that's me.
That's my name -- Kostya Inochkin.
I ran away with the locals to the island.
I'm a very good swimmer.
- You don't believe me?
"All right, one moment."
I can swim across this river a hundred thousand times over!
"I'll have you know, I do 2:12 on the back."
"If I was a woman, I would be a state champion in women's swimming."
- When I was a little boy...
"I, too, spent summers in camps."
We had it tough back then.
Had to sleep in makeshift shelters...
Cook on open fire.
Had to fetch our own water.
And do our own laundry.
"In other words, none of the comforts of life whatsoever."
And now?
Look around.
I ...wanted to ask ... if your dog was taken ill.
Why should he?
Perhaps an old hurt he always growls.
"Well, no, boy!"
Dick is my friend!
He saved my life!
It happened like this...
That's how dick got written of for the border guard.
"So he is a real hero, that dog!"
"You bet, he is!"
Now I will draw!
- Give back the crayons!
Do you want a candy? - what?
Let's have it!
Here!
Have a treat!
"Watch out Sasha, don't eat it."
It'll turn you into stone!
Why did you bring it here at all?!
"Don't be angry, Valerian I'll bring you some chocolate tomorrow"
And me?
And you?
You'll get an ice cream! ans I'll buy you... a sausage.
"Mitya, have you perhaps seen my tablet somewhere?"
"I did, grandpa, here it is, your magic tablet!"
"Haha, It's not really a magic tablet I was just joking!"
See?
I'm healthy again!
So I don't need medication any more!
"Grandfather, Look!"
Why did he pretend it was only a joke?!?

Oh!
"How sweet, Tanya."
Red heart shaped box.
Very nice.
"Bunty, will you marry me?"
That's your favourite Question.
"Right, Tanya?"
You keep giving me a fright by asking this question again and again.
What's there to be afraid of?
"And if I wanted to frighten you.. ..I would've said ""Please marry me, I'm pregnant with your child""."
That would've been better.
Less scary.
Listen Sweetie.
If you want we can move in together.
Live-in is ok.
We can be partners.
But no Mister and Misses.
And no marriage.
I've promised grandpa.. ..that I'll get married.
And that too only to you.
"Then you can't fulfill your promise in this lifetime, Tanya."
"Bunty, marriage is an institution."
"A mental institution, Tanya."
And the living examples are my parents.
"Marriage is the end of love, Tanya.. - Bunty.."
You will know what I am talking about.. ..once you meet my parents.

Did you enjoy the show?
That's the end of Jo-gu Ma's Horror illusion
Come on out
Amazing!
"Great job, today"
Just keep it up
You were great
It'd be nice if you were taller and your face smaller
Touch up your nose and eyes?
Great job
Thank you
You're a natural
Live with an actual ghost or something?
Wait
Don't go We're all going out for drinks
I have an appointment
You always say that
I have many appointments
"They asked students to turn off their cell phones in libraries, classes, hospitals and concerts and..."
Mom
- Mom!
- Huh?
Aren't you going to let me out?
What's wrong?
Does your stomach hurt?
No...
I'm okay.
Should I drive?
You don't even have a license.
You know what I mean.
"It's frustrating, unnerving,"
"- scary, sad, and futile."
-What is?
Poverty.
You know how long it's been?
Three years.
"But in those three years, nothing has changed."
I worked here part-time back then and I work here part-time now.
You've changed... you've grown much prettier.
You had no job then and you don't have one now.
"What drives me crazy is, in the future I'll be still here, and you'll be still unemployed."
Do you need a bag?
It costs 50 won.
- The total is 24 dollars and 80 cents.
"-Wait a bit more, give me a chance."
- I know I can do better.
- I've been waiting three years.
Hurry up and pay.
Will this work?
I think so...
[laughter]
David:
"Okay, [laughter] there are some asexual people who will masturbate."
"But I know that's like very, very difficult."
Joy: asexual
David:
"It seems counterintuitive, but yeah, thank you for saying that."
Think about it: you can like having sex with a man and not like having sex with a woman
You can like having sex with yourself and not like having sex with a partner.
Joy:
Yeah.
Star:
Wait.
"Now, you're describing something that's-"
Joy:
You didn't answer the question.
Do you like to have sex with yourself?
David:
"Oh, me, personally?"
Joy:
Yes.
David:
I've tried it.
I mean it was all right.
Joy:
It's not all that?
[laughter]
David:
Yeah.
[laughter]
Joy.
It's not all that.
"Well, here."
What is this?
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.
Why are you giving this back to me?
You shouldn't do this.
You helped us so much during that time.
I can't accept this.
Here.
"Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?"
"If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad."
Yes.
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..
I know that you were going to build a second floor.
"And because of the new house, and Ha Ni..."
I also know that you couldn't do anything.
"But, still... this."
"Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and... just come live with us again?"
Yes?
I came out because of Ha Ni.
This is better for Ha Ni.
Pardon?
For Ha Ni?
How can you not know your daughter's heart?
"Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?"
Pardon?
Hide something?
Those two have even kissed!
And Seung Jo did it first.
Kiss?
Seung Jo did?
Yes.
Take him to the hospital.
He being bit by a stroke!
Pay your debt first!
Give me the money!
He is dying and you're still thinking about your money?
It's only his nose to big deal!
The stroke is going to kill him.
Let me call the ambulance for you.
"Ping, get me the phone."
Anything wrong with your nose?
Is it the police or the hospital?
"Just the same, anyway."
I've got some loan shark here bleeding.
Please come quickly.
It's alright now!
He's managed to stop the bleeding.
Thanks.
Mom was right in saying that everything is predestined.
"Ever since Sylvester picked up those two letters, ...bad things take place one after the other."
Weird things that no one can explain!
They just happen...
Click!
Just like that.
Sylvester
"Moon, it's your pager."
"I've dehited $3,000 into your account."
"""The news-vendor kid called."
Sylvester's being hitting.
Come!
Hurry!
Look!

Go with Serdar Bey.
"Good evenin, Zilan"
Ohhh. welcome...
"You are coming with full hands, again, I see..."
What can I say?
I am a middle man.
Serdar Bey buys and we carry the stuff.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Do you get weary?
"May God thank you, Inci abla, and Serdar Bey."
"If I said my prayers have been accepted, it would be true."
Are all your dreams this?
"A comfortable job, place?"
Enough money.. anything else?
Ali Asker... a person never stops dreaming of more...
"But, we don't have the strength (right) to ask for more than this."
"Nothing is certain, Zilan..."
"You are okay, right?"
Not bad...
"You are saying you are not good, then?"
"You are saying, 'don't even ask.."""
Good night.
Good night.
Didn't I say that you were not go there?
"That if you wanted to see your mother, to go during the day?!"
"And, Serdar is the one to drop you off!"
Why is this doctor still in our life???
Why do you bring this man to our door?
"I didn't want to, I said I could come by myself."
My mother said..
Why don't you listen to me?
"So passionate eyes, so beautiful eyes!"
I'm in love with those eyes!
Good evening.
Kornei!
Where's Lyuty?
- Does it hurt?
- I don't mind.
"Oh, come on!"
Really.
I'd gladly get wounded every day if...
Sit still!
I'm in love with those eyes...
I'm afraid of those eyes...
- What?
- I killed the bastard.
"What are we to do with them, Comrade Danka?"
"Go up on the belfry, call the people together."
Let them decide.
Vodka...
"One fine day, Devil Was feeling bored."
"He went to Soldier's house, Knocked at the door."
"Said to Soldier's wife,  "" I'll be no trouble,"
"Just sit in the corner, Still as rubble. """
"Said he to her, "" I'll be no trouble,"
"Just sit next to you, Still as rubble. """
"Soldier's Wife had lived alone, Many a year."
"Devil moved in, His purpose clear."
Twelve months went by.
In Devil's seat
Sat seven little Devils eager to eat.
"I'd gladly join Wife this very day,"
But Devil Makhno stands in the way.
And this one is the camp director.
Comrade Dynin.

"- One, two, three, four..."
- Boy!
"Hey, boy, get out of here!"
These locals are spoiling our whole regime.
"- Oh, relax, will you?"
- I heard there were cases of whooping-cough in the village.
We must make sure our kids avoid all contact.
- Avoid any contact... contact... contact...
"- Oh, dear, I shudder to think about the parents' day."
As if we didn't have enough trouble with locals.
Now we'll get some walking infections from the city.
- So what.
It's all good!
"- Why, why does he insist on this ""parents' day?"""
- They say Mitrofanov will be coming.
- Aaah.
[counting]
- ...24 ...25.
- Put on your slippers!
Everyone put on your slippers!
- What's the matter?
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Rumors have spread everywhere.
Huh?!
Are you sad?
Since the girl that was following you has left?
Seung Jo ah!
"Oh, it's the main lead of the rumor."
"Miss Calm Cat,"
When did you become like that with Kyung sunbae?
Have you heard?
The rumor that doesn't make any sense.
I'm leaving first.
Good luck
Congratulations.
Can you stay here by yourself until your brother comes back?
Of course.
I don't know when Seung Jo is coming though.
Do you think I'm a baby?
I also.... need to spend some time alone.
Look at you.
That's right.
"Alright, Eun Jo, We'll see you tomorrow."
Hurry!
Don't play too many games.
I won't.
Just leave quickly.
Let's go.
Ok
Aigoo
Alright!
Oh!
"""Seung Jo ah"" &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I came all the way here without even realizing it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; How did I end up here? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And it wasn't that long ago when I was so happy that we had our first date."
So there are lots of seafood restaurants near here.
"Like Busan of Korea, sort of?"
I think I'm near the coastline.
"Yes, that's where I'm filming for the MV."
Young Jae looks really like a model today.
We're finished with lip-synching now. only one last scene in San Francisco remains.
I'm scared.
They don't bite right?
Nah they don't.
They say this is a town for rich people.
Doesn't it look like a set?
I guess these places are models for sets.
None
It's pretty good.
I hear Americans usually sprinkle cold lemon on shrimp to eat.
But I think Koreans heat up shrimp to eat.
I guess only Americans do this.
I think for some people it suits their tastes.
I don't really like seafood.
"San Francisco video shoot is a wrap! okay, good job for now."
Good bye.
Now we'll be moving on from San Francisco to Las Vegas to film.
This is Las Vegas.
The weather is really nice.
It's warm.
Las Vegas!
It's warm.
"Weather is good, scenery is good."
I feel good.
"""Seoul, Tokyo N New York City"""
Everyone is making bets going around.
Las Vegas!
"Mira!&amp;gt; Okay , we will talk later."
Can you stop for a minute?
I am trying to explain you something.
Can you wait for a minute?-it's OK.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Please!
You always are like this.
Go!

There was a disturbance.
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.
"Come on, 21 minutes ago, in comes order."
"Harmattan, Burton &amp;amp; Smith."
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.
"In eight minutes, I am defaulting on Joe's 29-minute guarantee."
"Then, not only am I receiving no money for these pizzas... ...but I will lose the customer forever to Pizza Yurt."
"Look, you are my only hope, all right?"
You have to make it in time.
"Peter, you're a nice guy."
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
"Hey, what, are you stupid?"
Whoa!
He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
"Hey, you guys."
No playing in the streets.
"Yes, Mr. Spider-Man."
See you.
"Way to go, Spidey!"
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
"Joe's 29-minute guarantee is a promise, man."
"I know to you, Parker, a promise means nothing."
"But to me, is serious."
"Is serious to me too, Mr. Aziz."
You're fired.
Why did you drink so much?
Come to your senses!
Good job.
Go on your way.
Aren't you going to give me some...?
- Give him something and send him away.
- Yes.
Come to your senses!
In Hyung!
In Hyung!
"Your Excellency, you're home."
He must have had an event at work.
These events are important to one's career.
The police have been busy all day due to the explosions at the harbor.
"- Father, you're home!"
- In Hyung! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Father!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Take him to his room.
"- Yes, Sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;In Hyung, wake up!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Take care of the body.
It was him that night!
Gil Dong...!
Let me go with you.
I didn't tell Yi Nok about him.
I said that it was not my duty to reveal to her what he himself hid.
But that was just an excuse.
"But the truth is that I know that if she sees him, I will lose her."
That's why I couldn't tell her.
I must have fallen asleep.
Did the chief leave already?
I must have dreamt about Gil Dong again.
He was sitting right here.
It's still warm.
My Higgs radiation simulation.
Matt:
"The ""God"" particle."
Amy:
It's a particle that we're trying to make in the collider.
Amy:
"I'm supposed to be investigating how it acts on living tissue, but my programme just crashes every single time that it starts to look bad."
Connor:
"So what, you think Higgs radiation is dangerous?"
Amy:
I don't know.
I'd know if I could get it to finish!
Connor:
They wouldn't run the LHC if they thought it was a danger.
Connor:
Must be a glitch or something.
Connor:
Have you tried on the central computer system?
James:
Except... she doesn't have access to the mainframe.
Kate:
Are you not allowed to use it?
Connor:
Well... not exactly.
(Typing on keyboard)
Connor:
There we go.
James:
Nice!
(Alarm sounds)
Matt:
Nice one Amy!

Kendin geziyorsun tabi maaşallah.
Do you have to brush me downas soon as I'm back?
I was busy with work and stuff.It's not like I'm late on purpose.
You don't carewhat this woman is doing with no money.
I didn't even eat anything.
"- Okay, okay."
"I'll order something now.- You're very generous, thank you."
"Hey, okayI am sorry."
"I said sorry, girl."
"Okay, I've acted like a jackass.I'm sorry."
"Okay, I won't be late next time."
Mukaddes you're prolonging this.
Look at me.
Look.
Smile.
As if I could smile right now...
"Anyway, I shall go wash my face."
"And then we go and eat, okay?"
"- So, did you go to the doctor?- Tsk."
[No]
"I went to the nursery school, to see my son."
Some illness it's hard to put your finger on.

"I know he's not working, I know he's not"
She thinks I'm driving you away.
She's a child!
How do you kill someone with voodoo?
"I put his hair inside the wax coffin, buried it in the graveyard."
That's ridiculous!
You wanna raise the dead?
But you can't kill people with voodoo. sometimes a soldier falls on his own sword.
You speak to my wife again and I will kill you.
Oh my god!
No!
Daddy!
Bad girl
I failed him. no!

All right.
So now you know.

"Well, keep it coming."
"All right, people, good work !"
"Now, don't forget."
"The state competition's a couple of weeks away, so keep on it, okay ?"
"Not bad, Chris."
Really ?
"Thanks, uh, Heather, right ?"
Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
"So, you've got this sort of Frank Sinatra thing going on."
[ Chuckles ]
Right.
I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.
"I mean, uh, music is so expressive."
[ Chuckles ]
Okay.
So thank you for that.
"We can take one or two questions, but remembering we've got the forum."
Any questions?
We'll save it 'til then.
Great.
"- Esra, I've heard you're replacing Luciel  by taking care of Mrs. van de Berg."
- Yeah.
- I know some of you don't think it's such a good idea  but this is what Sander and I decided.
"I promise you, I won't be in your way."
- Hidde is doing well.
"Corien, thank you for acting  so determinedly."
It was hardly a pleasant situation.
"Let's see, to wrap things up..."
"Oemaima, you're off to see Esmee and her baby."
Please don't start any arguments this time.
- I don't start arguments.
- Oh well great.
Then I'm done nagging.
Get to work everybody.
- Wait.
Wait.
No motto for today?
- Yeah of course.
"Take care of other, but mostly of yourself."
- Ah beautiful!

Let's get off with a little magic trick.
All right!
Here is a collection of actors from movies.
"This is Bruce Willis, Danny Devito, Cloris Leachman, Stanley Tucci,"
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind

This will be the tenth victim of the mysterious Kool-Aid Killer.
"-(announcer) For years, he's waited in the shadows, forgotten."
-There's a madman loose and he's killing people.
-This is his calling card.
-He feels forgotten and he's sending a message by killing everyone that doesn't drink Kool-Aid.
-So he's basically killing everyone above the age of five.
-I hate my life.

So you are the Major?
I was the Major.
I guess to some I still am.
"Now, Terry here was my right-hand man back in the glory days."
"That was a long time ago, mate."
Why'd you get out of it?
I was a crazy bastard back then.
Yes I'm
I just want to be a boxer first
I'm so sorry
"Hey, fella."
I think you can help.
Coem with me
How'd you like to go to a movie premiere?
I'm hurt
[Light music]
Here I go out to sea again.
Sunshine fills my head and dreams hang in the air.
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes you know it feels unfair.
There's magic everywhere.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to hide and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
The sun's in your eyes.
The heat is in your hair.
They seem to hate you because you're there.
"And I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy."
Not stand here on my own.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in the sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
[saxophone]
"I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy, not so alone."
She doesn't even get tired and comes very often...
Baek Eun Jo.
How could you talk to your life saver like that??
That's alright.
It seems like you're not getting tested today.
Yes.
"In the end, her motive for coming here is about hyung anyways."
Here you go again.
Seung Jo didn't come yet?
"See, I told you."
It's all about Seung Jo.
If you keep saying that...
He'll be coming soon.
It seems that Ha Ni should come back home.
Again?
You came?
"Baek Seung Jo, even if you talk like that..."
"Seung Jo, now that you know Ha Ni you feel great right?"
"Eun Jo, are you okay? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"
How is Eun Jo?
We would be in big trouble if Ha Ni wasn't there.
True.
It would have been a disaster without Ha Ni.
Thank you.
"Thank you, Oh Ki Dong."
It's a relief that everything is fine.
How is the building of your house coming along?
Is it doing alright?
"You know, it's a major pain."
It happened because of the earthquake so the insurance won't really pay for it either.
We're still fighting over it right now.
"It'll all go well, I guess."
James:
"I thought there was an exit, back at the dead end."
"Next one's about a three hour walk away, it's at point 17."
And that's if we don't get lost.
Connor:
Is there anywhere safe we can stop on the way?
Amy:
We need to let someone know we're down here!
James:
There's a mainframe computer room about half way round.
We can send a message from there.
Amy:
Ok.
(Electrical flickering)
Connor:
Which way now?
James:
We have to go that way.
(Flickering lights)
"(Low machine noises, heartbeats and breathing)"

Matt:
Jesus...
What does it take to kill one of these things?!
Amy:
They're people Matt!
Matt:
See?
"It feels like someone else is touching them, not your own hands, right?"
- Wow.
Freakilicious.
"- Oh, I could get used to this."
I don't think we should be doing this.
It's kind of lesbiany.
"Well, you asked me what it was like to be felt up."
"So, what's the best thing about having a boyfriend then?"
It just feels really natural.
"You know, really grown up."
And the snogging is wicked.
Sven uses varying pressure.
That's what foreign boys do.
My parents snog occasionally.
Even at their age.
Cringey.
Seeing old people over the age of 30 snogging is just horrific.
"Of all of the boys I've ever snogged, Sven is definitely the best."
'Cause he's emotional.
Where have you got to on the snogging scale?
What?
Jas and I invented a snogging scale.
The Ten Stages of Snogging.
- You're mad.
- No.
It's scientific.
- How would you know anything about it?
- Please.
- Who got 82% in Bio?
- True.
We cut out all the letters about kissing from the problem pages of every girls' magazine.

"I'll get you, Patman!"
Principal Cooper.
"Egbert, stop that horseplay and get to class."
Can I quote you on that?
"Thank you, Mr. Superintendent."
"Elizabeth, you're here late."
Just doing some fact-checking for my audition tape.
"Well, I know you'll do a great job."
"You asked for it, Patman."
(hissing)
"(Manny) Hey, Bruce, wait up."
Want to get something to eat?
(Bruce) Great idea.
"So, why do you want to get involved with this Oracle show, anyway?"
"I want to do the editorials, share my opinions."
I feel like owe it to these simpletons to tell them how to think.
"Hey, you're the man."
Of course.
What about the audition tape?
Done deal.
Made a call.
I'm bringing in the best director money can buy.

This is my first visit ever to the city.
-Really?
"-Yes, I swear to God."
But my son is living here in the city.
He is married to a lady from a very wealthy family... ...and he has an amazing child.
"Wait, I will show you his picture."
His name is Hamada.
See how cute he is?
How old is he?
A year and 6 months.
God wills.
He is cute like his grandmother.
This was in the past.
"You know, I have never seen him."
And he also gave me a hard time... ...till he gave me a picture of him.
When he come to visit me I asked him... ...why didn't you bring your son and wife?
He answer travelling makes my wife tired.
"Here I am, a very old lady... ...but people helped me to catch the train and come... ...and my son waited for me in the station."
But there is nothing we can say.
It's noday's lady's.
"By the way, what's your name?"
-Abdallah.
-God bless you.
You look handsome and have a good taste.
Thank you.
"Look, I will show you something... ...and tell me your opinion honestly."
Show me.
I got it for my daughter-in-law... ...and I am afraid that she don't like it.
"But tell me honestly, don't lie at me."
So beautiful.
Seriously.
"Yes, I swear it is beautiful."
You're not tougher than a Boy Scout.
You have to go home.
Lee:
"Thank you, gentlemen."
I appreciate it.
I'm heartbroken... right now.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" You did great."
Lee:
My wife gave me one bit of advice before she left.
"It was, ""Keep your head."
Don't freak out.
"Keep your head and you'll win."""
I kept my head for two days.
"The last challenge, I failed myself by not thinking all the way through."
I just feel like I let my kids and everybody down.
"Michael ""Hitch:"" Lee owned up to his mistake."
"If I was his kid, I'd be proud of him."
Lee:
Phew.
"Hey, Paul."
"Good luck, man."
Paul:
"Thanks, Lee."
So I'm the last man standing.
That feels pretty good.
"And I'm, I'm ready."
I'm ready for the next stage.
NARRATOR:
"Scouts, welcome to the final challenge."
"Paul, you're going head-to-head against Will, Rob, and Rio... ...in one final challenge that consists of three different events."
"We're incorporating Scouting skills that require concentration, endurance, and your smarts."
"This is the Toyota ""Iron Scout"" Challenge."
I did this cool collab video with my boy Dave Storm.
Bam!
Go and check it out.
It's freakin' awesome.
He has an awesome idea for a channel.
He takes suggestions from the audience and makes songs out of them.
It's really cool; he's a really talented guy.
"So anyway, go check out the video."
"If you like his stuff, be sure to subscribe and I will see you guys after Thanksgiving."
"So tell me guys, what would you do?"

Mary Jane Watson.
"Oh, boy."
If she only knew how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
"I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do."
"And I'm Peter Parker, and I, too, have a job."
Parker.

"No, no, no, stop!"
Stop!

Every time when Ahmed comes back from Somalia.
He tells terrible stories and says:
I wil never go there again.
"But he also says: when Somalia needs a president in 10 years,"
I'm ready.
"When he went there for the first time, he met relatives, that he never saw before."
And his uncle took him to the desert.
Ahmed must sleep in the desert in order to turn adult.
They go far out.
It is cold.
There is noone.
Ahmed cannot sleep.
Suddenly he hears an animal.
A lion roars nearby.
It is creeping through the camp.
Ahmed tries to wkae his uncle.
Hopefully he has his gun with him.
The uncle wakes.
"The lion roars again, and the uncles tells Ahmed, that he should not wake him up because of a lion which is 20 miles away."
This way Ahmed became a grown up person.
"The choreographer of Lion King didn't want us to imitate animal movements, as everybody does it."
But we dance the souls of the animals.
This a cow.
No.
This is a pig.
No.
A giraffe.
No.
A horse?
No.
This is a monkey.
No.
"But you are still a baby, you are my big baby."
"Okay then, Okay, have some rest,"
Don't ever force your leg okay?
"If you need something, shout to us."
"Okay, I am lying down.- Bravo !"
Lie down!
"Mira, did you talk to Orkun?"
"Yes mom, is the third time you're asking today."
What does he say?
- He doesn't say anything.
"He went together with his dad to the fabric in Luleburgaz, they will be staying there for some days."
"See ?, he is escaping too.&amp;gt; Mom, don't please!"
"The owner of this wants his vehicle in some days, you have to take care of the instruments order right away on morning.Beeren calling"
"OK, no problem, I will solve it tomorrow!- Good bye! &amp;gt;Good night uncle!"
Yes?
Err...

It's me Berren...- Beeren?
Aa Beren...
So good you called me..
I was thinking of you.&amp;gt; Really?
Dad?!...
Daddy... &amp;gt; My sweetheart...
"Where were you ,i was so worried , dad..- I am sorry.."
I am sorry.
I will solve everything.
"I know my dear dad, i know..."
Shall I go and talk with him too?
No.. just let him..
It means he is suffering from love.
My precious boy!
He is growing up dear Ender.
"Let me see, where were you?"
Mert whispering: is that Mira?
Hello?&amp;gt;Just a second..
I will go so you can talk comfortably.
Your voice sounds interrupted...
Last night was left half.
"In fact we have to complete it. want to talk with you a bit tonight, but alone."
Okay?
Don't take Mert with you.
Only you and me.
"Look, girl!"
"I am telling you the last time clearly, I don't have anything to do with you and will never in this life."
"Did you understand it?-Ah..ah...-Ah or not, this is it!"
You will have nothing from me!
I'm telling you this from the beginning.
Do you understand me?
"Hey, talk properly !"
You're the girl that my friend loves.
"Be wise, be worthy of him!"
I am trying to explain it politely but...
"look Eylul, if you sadden that boy, I will break your heart, know this too!"
OK?
Did you get me?
You're out of your mind!- Whatever it is!
"Don't call me again, ok?"
"Or even say ""Hello"" as a human... or don't even greet me."
That's it!
Mert?!
I forgot my phone.
There is a girl at our place...
Err...
Giray's girlfriend... stupid... she calls me constantly..
"I was good, wasn't I?"
"So, it looks like a tough assignment."
Maybe you could give me a hand.
Or maybe both hands.
"OK, those who didn't get talent positions, there's room on the crew."
Talk to Patty.
I thought my tape was really great.
"Elizabeth, some people like yourself excel at the written word."
Not everyone's meant to be an on-air personality.
There's still room on the crew.
Get it together!
We've got a show to do here.
"Enid, did you get that?"
"(Todd) Man, Patty's really trippingon this director business."
"(Patty) People, please!"
Are you feeling any better?
Not really.
You're still *The Oracle's* star writer.
No one can ever take that away from you.
"I wanted it so bad, Todd, and I thought my work was really great."
"Well, what did Collins say?"
There's nothing he can do.
"If you ask me, they should change the name from *Oracle On-Air* to *Airheads On-Air.*"
Hey...
"Present company excluded, of course."
"Hi, Liz..."
Todd.
Have you met Russ?
"Yes, I have."
"Well, just wanted to say hi."
Don't forget to watch me tomorrow.
Is it wrong to hate your sister with a passion?
Will it lead Pasha on the gallows?
Yes!
Definitely he will.
Never.
Because you'll withdraw your statement.
"I spent 35 years of my life, listening to the... ...threatening from the boys like you."
"If I wish, I can kill your entire family in just five minute."
But you've a big family.
And it's in your hands to let it prosper.
It was my duty to warn you.
"So, I have."
You are lucky that my gun is under maintenance today.
Your darling daughter Radha.
"Stop, Shreekant."
I've no one in my family.
But you've many.
Think about it.
19 days are left for you to give your statement.
"Santo, let's go."
Hail Lord Krishna!
"- Lord, what a festival!"
Hail Lord Krishna!
"Uncle, we must leave for Mumbai now."
Never!
Shreekant Mathur has never got... ...afraid of anyone's threat nor will he in future.
"Thank God, Damodar isn't here today."
"Otherwise, he'd have started firing."
"Let go off it,"
I know Damodar.
He's just a police officer by profession.
"Otherwise, he's very soft hearted person."
Inspector Damodar!
"Bridge, neighbors, courage, inclusive?"
Inclusive.
OK.
Let me just take that word for you and break it down into syilables and see if it helps.
"As he got up in grades and his reading vocabulary got larger, he was faced with all these multi-syilabic words that he couldn't decode."
In- cuse?
It could be cuse.
But if this is qua?
Quis?
"Quis, good."
In- quis-a- tive.
Good.
So can you put it together?
Inquisitive.
Excellent.
OK.
Go on.
Clever.
Success.
And Adam's reading problems were affecting his spelling and writing as well.
What's your best guess with success?
How do you think it's spelled?
Good.
That's pretty close.
"By the time he got to ninth grade, he was getting no Special Ed help."
And he was really at a distinct disadvantage.
He fell apart.
He stopped going to class.
"He stopped doing his homework because, essentially, it was way beyond what he could do."
"And when Jane said, oh, he needs help, people said, you know what, if you look at his profile, he's solidly average."
There's nothing going on here.
He's not trying.
"- Good job, Christine."
"- Oh, thanks. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Monti?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It just shows the inexperience.
- Helene?
- Helene is a disaster.
Helene was shocking.
"According to them, it was, like, way undercooked."
You're not the worst.
She is.
And Tali.
I mean...
Disaster.
I don't know what Tali was up to.
- No.
- Dave?
"The sand, you know, big, big technical error."
"I didn't wash the mushrooms, and I think I started too late."
"Any freakin' dish but risotto, man."
"Like, seriously."
Ryan and Tali are the two people that I want to see go home.
They're just total idiots.
"And, if they don't stay on their toes,"
I'm gonna be the one to take 'em out.
Clearly we have to take him out.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
I'm gonna have to throw someone under the bus.
"Once one of 'em's gone, the other one's..."
"Remember, you're the best."
- How do you feel?
- Good.
"All right, guys. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Back to your stations, please."
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"- Wait, Georgia."
"- Georgia, don't go."
- Georgia!
"Georgia, what are you doing?"
You'll be late for your first day back at school.
I'm coming.
"- Georgia, Mummy wants you."
- Libby.
"Oh, flip, flipper and flipping hell!"
Excusez-moi.
C'est trés grotesque.
If you don't mind?
Oi!
Cheeky.
"Libby, stop putting Angus in the fridge."
"What do you want for breakfast, munchkin?"
Stuffed olive?
"Just because I did something so beyond the Valley of Sad City last night it doesn't give you the right, as my parents, to humiliate me further."
Today is the first day of my life as the new Georgia.
"And who is she, my little elf?"
"She's not an ""elf""."
Not a munchkin.
"She is a mature, sophisticated woman called Ms Georgia Nicolson."
"So, to celebrate the new me,"
I've decided what I want to do for my birthday party this year.
"I want a proper party in a club, with a D.J."
"You're not old enough to get into a club, never mind hire one out for a party."
"If you haven't noticed, I'm a woman now."
I wear a bra!
Bob.
Are you really trying to damage me permanently?
"There's no way that you are having a party in a club where there's drinking, and it's full of randy men."
Hey!
Do something about this bag...
"I packed, but I'm not sure."
"Take a look, hyung-nim."
That's alright.
I will be back real soon.
I will buy the things that I need.
"By the way, what is going on?"
Why suddenly..?
I don't know.
"Get going. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be linked to voice mail after the beep."
Her phone is turned off.
Who?
Man Ok.
Stylist Jang.
"Today, she went with Tae Ik for a scheduled radio broadcast."
Radio?
Why does the stylist have to go along for radio?
Today is a live-broadcast radio.
"Last time, Tae Ik went dressed in anything and around fifty thousand malicious comments were posted."
"""A Date in the Middle of the Day""."
"Today's guest is the cool guy from &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take One&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, Lee Tae Ik."
We will shortly come to you with live radio.
Commercial!
"Your style is fabulous today, Tae Ik."
Am I okay?

Ken wanted a piano as a kid.
Ken couldn't get a piano as a kid.
"So three years ago, we looked on Craigslist all summer and went over to the Twin Cities and got pianos!"
[Ken playing mid-tempo melody]
The man's a genius.
He just never quite had the time.
It looks like the auctioneer's here.
[creaking]
[crash]
man:
What's in my pocket?
"Madam Noh, please help me."
Please help me find my daughter quietly.
Do you know who took your daughter?
That...
You should know him as well.
The one who was killed as an insurgent.
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister!
Hong Gil Dong!
Is he still alive?
You must find her quietly for me.
She is the only daughter of the core of all power!
No one must ever know she is with him.
And everyone that is found with her...
Silence them forever.
Do you understand?
So the one who blocked the police was Hong Gil Dong?
Did the prince know this?
He told us that someone would block the police so that we can attack Choi Chul Joo.
I am sure he knew.
So the reason he gave up the explosives and stopped the ship was... ... because of Hong Gil Dong!
He has interfered with our plans yet again.
- Go and find the Councilor's daughter.
"- Yes, Madam!"
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister and the only daughter of the Second State Councilor...?
We may have found a better weapon than the explosives.
- Search the area carefully!
"- Yes, Sir."
- Search the empty houses too!
"- Yes, Sir."
Hurry!
Miss Eun Hye!
"For you, I will lay down my life!"
"Well, let me say first of all thank you for haveing my mama at the White House [oh, yeah] for the Easter, that was a beautiful event and she was so [applause] and she was so thrilled to be there."
It was great having her [applause] she's terrific
We even got Bo in there.
"Bo's there, Tony's there..."

Amy:
Oh no!
DG:
Good morning!
"I'm Professor Vacinski, Director General of CERN."
DG:
This meeting has been called because last night there was an emergency beam dump.
(Crowd whispers furtively)
DG:
Here we see a monopole magnet in LHC Sector 7G.
DG:
Beam sensors have detected that an unknown event caused this magnet to quench and triggered an uncontrolled shut down.
DG:
If this happens again the results could be catastrophic.
DG:
"Due to the special circumstances, Dr. Niven is taking a team into the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause, and see what damage there is."
The LHC will be in shut down until at least the end of the week.
DG:
Since Dr. Niven will not be available we will need 4 volunteers to be on shift in the control room.
Connor:
We'll do it.
Amy:
(Quietly) What are you doing?!
DG:
"Ok, you four."
Lisa:
"Oh, I'm going to be at a conference in Barcelona."
DG:
"Uh, very well."
You... you then.
Matt:
"Uh, I have an analysis note due this week, so I'm not going to have time to do this..."
There's a place where you throw in coins and make wishes.
I made many wishes.
First wish was 'Please let B.A.P have a hit.'
Second wish was 'Please let our hair designer get married'
And the third wish was 'Please let our make-up artist get married too'
"I wasn't going to say this but, honestly, I wished for many chances"
To see many BABAz.
I think I threw in coins worth about 5 dollars.
"Well most importantly, the MV has to come out well."
We have to finish off the concerts in
Korea and Japan successfully too.
Take this energy from Central Park...
This is awesome.
None
Americans seem to know how to appreciate the small things in life.
We're so used to internet and machines.
We should stop getting used to them
And become appreciative people.
"I will try, too."
We're going to Time Square now.
Yong Guk is filming his scene at Time Square.
I've only seen it on TV.
Like in 'lnfinite Challenge' kind of TV shows. or other entertainment programs.
I've always wanted to visit.
And I get to go today.
I'm excited.
"Yo, New York City."
"We're here, in NY."
There's so much to do.
"Hogwarts kid, move."
We're here in NY.
I said move Hogwart!
It is an earthquake!
(RUMBLE!
CRASH!)
Come on.
You'll stay with me until you get back on your feet...foot.
"Wait, he was so close with his mom."
"No, Denise."
It's genetic.
"Oh, no you're not!"
I am.
Our short webseries tells these stories.
Real stories.
You married the whiny bitch.
"Well, we made them up, but they'll remind you of folks you know."
Speaking of horse c*ck
This seriously hurts my titties.
Mine too!
She has a condition.
She does.
It's so wet!
A Series of Unfortunate People
We're gonna need back up.
The walls are closing in on me!
Now.
Mekong:
Watch That River!
This is the Mekong
One of Asia's major rivers and the 12th longest in the world
"It nurtures a great deal of life in its waters and in the wetlands, forests, towns, and villages along its path"
The Mekong's long journey begins in the Tibetan highlands
"It flows through China's Yunan province and then across Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia before entering the sea from Southern Vietnam"
"It's a journey of nearly 5,000 kilometers or some 3,000 miles"
I've seen many skateboarders since yesterday. our youngest Zelo also likes to skateboard.
"Board shop, board shop!"
"Here, it seems like a routine."
"Just as we go bike riding, people here seem to enjoy skateboarding."
Look at the camera.
None
"Since the U.S. is a really big nation, the roads and buildings are all big"
I can tell why Americans are so relaxed.
"I heard in America, people eat burgers and shakes together."
There aren't many people yet in Korea who eat like that.
"- Yes there is, Yong Guk."
"- Yes, Yong Guk eats like that."
We will give it a try today.
"At Shake Shack, they eat burgers and shakes together."
"Usually, people drink coke."
"Well, that's what they say."
Why don't you all try it too?
I hear strawberry shakes are delicious.
I felt this last time too...
The clouds in America are so beautiful.
I think I can see them more clearly because there aren't too many tall buildings. one two three.
We're in America.
"one more time, one more time."
"Hurry, one more time."
"oK, the red light is on."
I'm at a coffee shop.
"This is a mango smoothie, sold only in this store."
None
I don't know where everybody else went.
oh!
There's Zelo.
"Yo, what's up!"
He can't change without a blanket or fan
He can hid inside the thick mattress
Move it away
Let's watch inside.
You do it
Do it
Yes， do it
I can't with so many eyes looking at us
Ok， let's push up the bed 1， 2， 3
Act fast， but not too hard， or we can't hold it
It works
Darling， can such a wedding night be recorded in the Book of Guinness?
Landal How come?
What happened?
She's kicking me
I didn't
No?
This bed?
Why's everything missing?
Why?
I beg you， or I can't get reincarnated
You're crafty， you've changed into a bedsheet
Take it out and burn it
Don't!
Tsung， bring gasoline
Let's go out first
Keep and eye on him
Don't burn me
Don't let him go
Come on， sprinkle it on him
Keep away， let me
You're taking away my girlfriend?
"Of course, I got carried away a little bit after that."
No harm or nothing done.
It was just innocent.
We thought it was just normal innocent stuff.
"What about the music, speaking of the dance."
Who played music at that time around here?
That would have been
Jule Gillespie and Pat Bonner and
Walter McCauley.
"Maybe Robert Palmer, Edward's brother."
"Russell, one of the [?] guys or something."
There's a lot of people - a lot of them can make music
Family type stuff...
Jules - Mary's mother...
Mary can sing.
Mary Palmer.
If you can ever get her to sing.
"Richie Gillespie is a good singer, if you can ever get him to sing."
"He used to - twenty years ago him and Rich [?] could - you name it, they'd play it."
Richie'd sing as good as anybody you've ever heard.
"But Jules's wife, she could sing too."
She was a real good singer.
What kind of music?
Just the regular stuff that you hear on the tapes.
The country type or whatever you want to call it.
Were anybody left that actually did any step dance?
Mm-hmm.
The Dodie guys would just ... wife here a couple weeks ago...
Uncle Joe [?]
"Gallagher, and Uncle John he lived over where [?] is."
He was a big guy.
"Not quite like me, but big guy."
Such a smarty!
Is that important?
This story should be... a mystery with a fabulous ending.
"Popular these days, you know."
For example...
"In reality, the one scribbling was an alien."
No wait... better make it an angel.
"Huh? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The angel, helps an ignored kid to find his friend&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by scribbling all over the street.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Add the foreshadowing by showing a glimpse of a feather.
"And at the end, Voila!"
"The angel appears, angel!"
Oh my...
Stop pretending to be nice.
"How, can you smile like that in front of me!"
Stop there!
Okay... who can tell us what the problem is here?
"Come on, she's shaking."
Maybe she's got her phone on vibration mode.
"So awkward, even for the audiences."
Who are you?
Never seen you before.
Yes!
"A third-year Taekwondo major, my name is LEE Ji-hwan!"
"Heard that, as an acting teacher you are the best in the country"
So I dared to sneak into your class!
Such a dignity for someone sneaking in!
Sure.
But don't talk too much.
Quiet!
"Yes, thank you very much."
"Yo, LEE Ji-hwan!"
Concentrate!
"Let me ask Mrs. Ender, let me see what will she say."
Don't let Mrs. Ender know about it please!
I can't give money to anyone without her knowledge.
How can I give it son?
"Brother, I really need it very much.Look, I will pay it back as soon as I can."
What do you need this money for?
"I family matter. &amp;gt; I'm sorry..&amp;gt; Okay, thanks."
"Yaman, here you are, 300, it's not advance payment, it's from my pocket."
But it's a debt.
"- OK, it's a debt, you will complete the rest somehow. here 50 from me, &amp;gt; Thanks, &amp;gt; and from me, &amp;gt;also from me &amp;amp;gt, me too- Thank you , Thank you all !"
This is from me.&amp;gt; thanks..
Do you have 50 TL now?
"Thanks to all of you, really, as soon as I have money in my hands I will pay it back, I promise"
How will you complete the rest?- I will see.
Thanks- May you use it for the best.
How much money would you give for this? &amp;gt; Let me see.
Mira calling.
One moment...
Hello!
Mira:
Hello!
Did you get out of the interviewing? &amp;gt; Yes.
How was it?
"Not bad- This means it was very good, right?"
I don't know.
Let me take the last exam and we will see...
What time is your exam at?-At 3 o'clock!
"I have to close it, I have to study a little more."
"OK, let me know as soon as you are out OK?"
I want you to give me the good news first.
"I will call you&amp;gt; Okay, success! &amp;gt; Thanks."
The interviewing was very good.
"We'll transfer youhere in the morning,is rapidly recovering."
Nurse...
Have you been hereall night?
I am.
"Dida beautiful lady come to visit me tall, black hair,in a black coat?"
"You've had many visitors,I was busy and did notpay any attention towho enters and exits."
news... news
"news... news son,you have visitors"
"Come on, pick up. pick up."
"Well, well, brother"
Thank God you're all right...
How are you?
"I'm fine,Azmi, thanks."
God saved!
"A quick recoveryMahir, good luck,"
Speedy recovery.
We're very worried.
"Thank Godthat heard the prayers! thanks brother,Do you need something?"
Just say.
"No, my friends,Thank you."
How long will youstay in the hospital
"I do not know what the doctors say,But today's my father s hearing"
And I havebe there as a witness.
"How are you going to go,Mahir?"
I have to ..
I have to go and join my fatherat the hearing to set him free .
Good morning.
"the court hearings is today, right?"
Why are you so nervous...
You'll see Mahirand his family .. surely I have been informed about it...
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him ..
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him...
"See you later, L.A."
We're going to San Francisco.
"See you again, L.A."
We just arrived in San Francisco.
"Before MV filming, we're going to San Francisco hamburgers."
"Tigger here, Tigger there."
"Lately, fans have been sending a lot of Tiggers."
We have so many Tiggers at home.
"Tigger staring at me here, Tigger staring at me there."
I'm freaked out.
They look like they're alive.
It looks like they're alive and staring at me.
oh my gosh!
This street is called Union.
The weather's kind of chilly here too.
None
It's a different feeling from L.A.
San Francisco feels a little more antique.
"Very vintage, and each building has its own character."
lf I were to choose between the two cities
I'd pick San Francisco because it's more put-together.
"L.A. is nice too though, it's very casual."
I wish my neighborhood were San Francisco.
This place has a different aura to it.
They're in the same country but they feel different.
"It's a city that goes well with our song ""Coffee Shop"" too."
Just a little bit ago there wasn't this much sunlight.
Thank goodness the sun came out.
Zelo is filming right now.
It's a relief the sun's shining brightly.
I have a feeling today's shoot will be a good one.
I'm done.
Don't tell the kids.
"Nick, who I found yesterday,  kissing a woman passionately in the street..."
He later claimed that woman was his wife!
[laughter]
Here's to the future.
Drugs... sex... divorce...
Death!
Who'd want to live anywhere else?
Here's to us.
[clink]
Try me again and I promise you  it'll be more fun this time.
"- Hey, everybody!"
Welcome to the Atheist Experience.
We're live.
"It is July 15th, 2012."
"Two days after Friday 13th, and one day after Saturday the 14th, and three days after Thursday the 13th, and they're all equally important."
I'm Matt Dillahunty.
Joining me this week is Don Baker.
Welcome.
- Good to be here.
-We're in a good mood.
"This is a live call in television program out of Austin, Texas."
We'll have the number up for you shortly.
"The announcement stuff has kind of been sidelined, and we're going to go ahead and let Don get started on his talk."
"How are you, by the way?"
- I'm doing good.
"I went to a holy place, believe it or not."
"- Holy to you, or holy to somebody else?"
It's as close as atheists have to a holy place.
I went to a great science museum.
"I went to the American Museum of Natural Science in New York City, where the Hayden Planetarium is."
"I didn't see Neil deGrasse Tyson there, but took in a great planetarium show."
"5 is a prime number, so we'll put 5 right there."
"And then, 12 is the same thing as 26, and 6 = 23."
"So, in our LCM, we have to have two 2's, but we already have two 2's, and we already have one 3."
"Another way to think about it, is that something that is divisible by both 9 and 4 is going to be divisible by 12."
"And then finally, we need it to be divisible by 15's prime factors."
15 is the same thing as 3*5.
"So once again, we already have 3 and 5."
"So, this is our least common multiple (LCM)."
"So, LCM is going to be equal to 33225 =180"
"So, our LCM is 180."
"So, we want to rewrite all of these fractions with 180 in the denominator."
"So, our first fraction, 4/9, is what over 180?"
"To go from 9 to 180, we have to multiple 9 by 20."
"So, to get the denominator to equal 180, we multiple by 20."
"Since we don't want to change the value of the fraction, we should also multiple by the 4 by 20."
4*20 = 80.
"So, 4/9 is the same thing as 80/180."
"Now, let's do 3/4."
What do we have to multiple the denominator by to equal 180?
You can divide 4 into 180 (180/4 = x) to figure that out.
4*45 = 180.
"Now, you also have to multiple the numerator by 45."
3*45 = 135.
"So, 3/4 equals 135/180."
Now let's do 4/5.
"To get 180 from 5, multiple 5 by 36."
"Have to multiple numerator by same number, 36."
"So, 144/180."
And then we have only two more to do.
180/12 = 15.
"Same for numerator, 15."
"So, 11/12 = 165/180."
There's a forest behind us
"On snowy days, it feels like a fairy will come out"
I wish you could come
"- I'm sorry, Sweetie - Don't start up again, Mom"
"I'm fine, Mom"
I'm really happy here
My co-workers love me
Men are lining up to have dinner with me
I met up with Min-jung again
I see her often
"Mom, I'm fine Don't worry"
Leaving you alone like that
Sure you're okay?
"I'm so sorry, Yu-ri"
"- So sorry - Stop crying, Mom"
"We'd better hang up, Sis"
Okay
Take good care of Mom
"Okay, talk to you soon"
SEEKlNG WlTNESS
I have information on a hit-and-run
"No, I didn't see it directly"
Someone told me
Yes
"Practice at home, will ya?"
"She's abnormal, that girl"
"She doesn't eat with us, but chows down alone"
What now?
Where are you going?
Home
No prior engagements today?
No
Nothing to detect these units.
-	Ghosts cloaking.
"They are going to try and EMP all of the Sentries, if he does, he can go in for an attack."
EMP on the entire army!
His entire army is EMP'd!
He Stims and goes in to finish them off.
If he destroys this army he will win the game and advance to the round of 16!
So many Marauders!
The Vikings taking out every single Colossus and BoxeR is on the verge of winning the game and the series.
"Here he goes in, stimming one more time, the Medivacs healing everything."
"Avenge on the run, falling back into his expansion, we might see a GG any moment now."
-	Ohh..
And a Nuke!
"-	Nuclear Missile, dropping onto Avenge's natural expansion where his army is right now."
The Nuke's gonna land on his army!
"-	Ohh, is he going to get his units away?"
-	Ooooohhhhh!!
-	Nuclear Missile killing everything.
"-	BoxeR, 100 supply ahead."
-	Winning the third game!
"- With those Vikings you shoot forward, trying to get rid of those Colossi."
Not overcommitting his ground units quite yet.
And uh..
Actually lost quite a few Vikings in all that.
Choya is giving him chase and going to chase him right into the main base.
"There is the defensive nuke, if he can hold this wall right here, he's got it."
The nuke could go down right in the middle of all these units.
- Oh no!
Oh no!
And it looks like..
"Oh no, Choya!"
- Ohhhhhhh!!!
I don't see the point when I can just use an actual joystick.
"And what's really weird is that this thing, again, is just a piece of plastic."
"It doesn't have any wires connecting to it, you just plant it there."
And the buttons actually work!
"And it steers okay, too."
"To tell you the truth, I'm stunned."
Ass!
"So, that covers most of the dreaded NES accessories."
"But, I know that there's one in particular that I didn't mention, but, you know, can't do it all in one shot."
"So, we'll save it 'till later,"
"I'll see you next time,"
I think you know what's next.
Western illinois Women's Soccer returned home to face Grand View last week Sunday.
"Head Coach Tony Glinn used much different starting line up then in previous matches, but it payed off early and just in the 11 min of play Senior forward Amy Unzicker recorded her first career goal to put Western up 1 nil."
Unzicker
Shot!
Amy Unzicker barried it.
Amy Unzicker her first goal as a Leatherneck.
Congradulations Amy.
Head coach said there is going to be a Highlight reel.
Sure enough we are going to get one today folks.
Grandview will tie things up just 10 minuets later.
In the second half it was all Western illinois.
Now Rite is in the box.
Cross comes in Julies Heads!
Yes!
Oh baby.
4 to 1 Western illinois.
Kellie Julius 's goal in the 67 minuet of play put Western up 4 to 1.
Thy weren't done yet.
Shot comes in Abby goal.
What a finish 6 to 1 Western.
Again a pig?
No.
A lion.
No.
"I have to say it, it is a stupid, racist sentence, but it is also true:"
Somali people are always shouting.
It is always the real big drama.
This was a german Reunification-Shout.
This was a Bone-Breaking-Shout.
I can't bare certain pictures.
"When I see a cruel picture, a bloody picture,"
I loose consciousness a fall to the ground.
This happend for the last time in Berlin in the subway.
There are screens called Berliner Fenster.
"They showed an advertisment for a CD recorded by the German Opera, Semiramide by Rossini."
Then they showed a photo from Pulitzer Awards.
It was taken in the National Theatre in Mogadishu.
You see a man lying on the ground with summer clothing.
"The sun is shining, he smiles."
"There is a hole in his head, there's blood and parts of his brain everywhere."
When I saw this I fainted.
Oh God!
I worked with cruel pictures as well.
A serbian colleague asked me to participate in her performance.
She experienced the Kosovo-war when she was 15.
She described a footage that she saw.
That was broadcasted in the TV.
A prisoner was tied to a column.
His skull was cut open alive.
And the liquid from his brain was spooned out.
I shoul dance a derwish-dance.
That's a prayer of turkish monks.
Then you will die
These men are loyal to Antony
"Yes, but they will follow your lead"
Antony!
Antony!
Stop him!
Move!
Get after him!
He's wonderful with the child
"I shouldn't wonder, he's a child himself"
You would do well not to disparage Antony is my presence
Are you that much in love with him?
ls your judgement that clouded?
"I am in love, Olympos, but my mind is clear"
Egypt needs him We need Antony's strength
You haven't really tested his strength Only his weaknesses
What do you mean?
"You are strong, my queen"
You have the metal to seize and heel the world
"But Antony, he wants only to seize you"
And that makes him weak
"You're wrong, Olympos"
Antony does share the vision
And he's not weak
Grattius!
What is it?
Why are you come to Alexandria?
Your Lordship
Octavius has stolen your legions in Gaul
General Cornelius?
Dead
He's deliberately flaunting me!
I'll bet we could really swing down there.
Just the three of us.
You and me... and all that money.

"If we take it to go,  they give 30% discount."
Hey!
Lee Tae Ik!
Are you trying to stingily save money?
"No, no!"
It's because it is good.
I like that pizza best.
This and... give us this.
We purposely came all the way here.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Please give us a lot of topping.
Also give us a lot of hot sauce and pickles.
"Whatever, give as much as possible!"
We are regulars.
"Also, give us garlic sauce."
"Anyway... just to get 30% discount,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;we went all the way there?"
"Hallyu star, Take One?"
Hey!
"Baek Go Dong, don't just eat."
You must never tell about this to anyone. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;It's such an embarrassment.
I also think so.
So what?
It's good to save money.
What is he doing?
The pizza will turn cold.
It's almost ready.
"Hurry and come, hyung!"
"It's so good, looks like we will finish it all."

"Hello, LOEN TV  viewers"
"And then finally, we have 13/15."
"To get 180 from 15, multiply 15 by 12--1510 = 150, 30 remaining for 180."
152 = 30.
"So, 15*12 = 180."
"Multiple numerator by same number, 13."
"We know 12*12 = 144, so just add one more 12 = 156."
"So, we've rewritten each of these fractions with the new common denominator."
"Now, it is very easy to compare them."
We only have to look at their numerators.
"Foe example, the smallest numerator is 80, so 4/9 is the least of these numbers."
"The next smallest number looks like 135, which was 3/4."
"And then the next one is going to be the 144/180, which was 4/5."
"Next is 156/180, which was 13/15."
"Finally, we have 165/180, which was 11/12."
"And, we're done!"
We have finished our ordering.
"HI my name is Allison and I'm the president of Communication Conections,Inc., a nonprofit for families hearing loss.I'm sitting in my favorite place-my garden."
I love all of my flowers.They are beautiful and I have a variety of them.
I work hard to have them grow.
"But my favorite ones are sunflowers.Sure,they are pretty and yellow."
But why do I love sunflowers the most?
It's because they start with such a small seed and you add water and they start to grow.
You add sunlight and they grow more.
"Then all of a sudden,they grow HUGE!"
I was shocked when I saw how big sunflowers grow!
I never knew how big they would grow.
It's kind of t the same for the new nonprofit.
I worked hard for years as a teacher of deaf and hard of hearing children.
I worked for 15 years and I've seen growth and improvement.
"But,I wanted to see a BlG change."
I started with a small idea and decided to set up a nonprofit.
I researched and aksed people to help me.
Which proves all this
"Look, my memory is perfect."
I can remember anything even if it was 30 years ago
And you can ask Sheheibar and Abo Doma
Who are Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
My children
You mean Sameh and Karim?
Isn't that what I said?
You said Sheheibar and Abo Doma
No I said Sameh and Karim
Are you sure you didn't say Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
Who's the one forgetting now?
"Ok Mr.Mahmoud, Thanks"
This case is closed for now
You may go
What did your dad just do?
We all know he doesn't have alzheimer's
Maybe the medication he's talking is affecting him?
"Talk, Shaker"
Didn't you say the medication would only make him unstable and confused?
"Yeah, that's the medical evidence we know"
"But with old age, maybe the medication has affected his memory"
You mean he actually got Alzheimer's?
Even if he did get Alzheimer's
That's what we wanted
Ofcourse not
"We just want to win this case, not hurt dad"
It's the same result
"You won the case, what else do we want?"
"You're right, that's the most important thing"
"If you're gonna empathise, remember prison and all that"
"Once you get the money, just cure him using it."
Suleiman was killed by Nazif Kara it is a Lie!
I did not kill him!- Silence!
Sit down!
"Please,Sit down, sir."

Judge!Suleiman did not tellMahir will be called that particular day.
"I do not have any information,and even claims that it is called the day...I just expected..."
Silence in court!
"But you asked Suleimanto call your sonto talk, right?"
"We know all,even if Nazif Kararefused to meet with your ​​son that you mentioned in your letters."
That's not true!
"Sit down, Mr. Nazif!"
She was the one that left my Mahir!
"This woman Kader Alton is the one who left little Mahir,and claims that she is his real mother"
I neverstood between them!
Sit!
Mr. Nazif sit!- She was the one who left Mahirand threw him into the house of my brother!
These are the exact words of Kader father:She never wants to seein the face his brother's killer!
"Sit down, Mr. Nazif,I told you to sit down!"
"Any witnesses what you're saying,Mr. Nazif? is your brother or father stillm alive Mr. Kader to confirm your words? no"
I never saidI do not want to see my son!
Nazif and his familyfiled a lawsuit in order totake him away from me...
They kidnapped memy son!
"Whenever they saw my fatherHow do they pay for it,beat me..."
Every day I said to myself why am I crying for someoneWho does not want me...
I went to file a lawsuitto the police in order to return sonand then they threw meout of the house...
Suleiman was the onlywho stood by mein that difficult days...
"He helped meand opened the door of his house for me , Thus began our relationship..."
Nazif is lying and is again sdtanding between me and Mahir!
Silence in court!

"(Male announcer) This is the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen, where, for one home cook, dreams will become a reality."
[Cheers]
"After searching across the entire country for America's finest home chefs, we've narrowed it down to 18."
I'm a food photographer.
I'm a graduate student.
I'm a stockbroker.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
"(Announcer) But to earn the title of Masterchef, they must impress three of the biggest names in the culinary world..."
Joe Bastianich...
"The hallmarks of a Masterchef are elegance, sophistication, and finesse."
- (Announcer) Graham Elliot...
"- To me, a Masterchef is constantly innovating."
(Announcer) And Gordon Ramsay.
A true Masterchef puts perfection on every plate.
"(Announcer) Tonight, the competition officially begins."
We're looking for one stunning dish.
(Announcer) And with that comes twists...
What the heck is gonna happen now?
(Announcer) Turns...
Fire.
Fire.
(Announcer) And tears.
The search for America's next Masterchef begins now.
"Thousands of cooks have already been eliminated, and only 18 remain in the search for America's next Masterchef."
Now it's time for these top home cooks to take their place in the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen.
(Michael) Walking into the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen for the first time is incredible.
"It's such a beautiful kitchen, you know."
It's the kitchen that I've always dreamed of.
(Josh) The &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen even has its own bar and restaurant.
"Man, this is crazy."
It's freakin' awesome.
I have never seen so many glorious bottles of wine.
"We headed to one of the Quran Institues here in chechnya, and Indeed I was amazed from what I've seen"
Its as though the Dream is now Reality.
"Before I came to chechnya, I was told that they focus so much on their Quran [especially the kids]"
"But when I came here, I found their Institutes to be very different from the other Institutes."
Some of you may think that I am standing in a Random Public Garden or a park.
"No By Allah, I am standing in a park that belongs to Quran Institue"
A very distinguished Institute that has many things to help the students to memorize the Quran.
I wish that this dream comes to reality back in my country and in other countries as well.
"The dream of this great concern about the Book of Allah here in Chechnya, Come with me to check it out"
"This institute... has special Rooms for Their students a classes that fits their schedule well, and a Cafeteria that provides their daily meals."
"And they have a Masjid of their own, along with a wide green field, for the students to enjoy their break time"
"But Truly, the most Beautiful thing we found in this institute.."
"Is the Organized system of the institute, along with its discipline from the Hufadh of the Book of Allah Swt."
Who can start reciting for us a portion of what they have memorized from the Quran?
"MashaAllah TabarakAllah, Do you listen to Shaykh Abu Bakr Al Shatri?"
"-Yes he does -MashaAllah, May Allah make you"
-..become like Shaykh Abu Bakir al Shatri.
Congratulation to AbuBakr for having
-.. the kids of chechnya listening to him.
May This is all be found in his scale of good deeds
Institute of Shaykh Zayid - Chechnya.
while I was walking around the institute.. here in Chechnya
"The insititute of Shaykh Zayid for Quran Memorization and while I was listening to their beautiful recitation, I met a boy named Ikhwaan"
It was said to me that this young boy is 12 years old and has the Quran Memorized.
"MashaAllah Shaykh Adam, When did ikhwaan start memorizing the Quran? - he started memorizing as soon as we opened up this Institute which was 8months ago."
- He started memorizing 8 months ago? - yes he did.
"MashaAllah Tabarak AlRahman, he memorized the Quran only in 8months! honestly I am a little shocked because he doesn't speak Arabic right? - yes he doesnt."
"-But with that, his main focus was to memorize.."
-..the Quran in 8-9 months.
And he sure did.
MashaAllah.
- How many pages does he memorize a day?
This is a subspace of L2 from -1 to 1.
"And it is a subspace spanned by polynomials of degrees of 0, 1, 2 to up to N-1."
"There is a self-evident naive basis, mainly sk is equal to tk, k going from 0 to N-1."
This naive basis is not orthonormal and can be quite badly behaved when N becomes large.
"Our goal will be to approximate vector x, which is sin t over this sub-space, so sin t does not belong to P3, so we have to find the orthonormal projection of sin t over this sub-space P3."
"From the basis s k, we can build an orthonormal basis using something called the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure that you're probably familiar with from linear algebra."
"So, you take the original set s k and you derive the orthonormal set u k using an algorithmic procedure which is given in steps below."
"At each step k, you first derive p k as s k minus the projection on to the previous orthonormal set."
"And then, you renormalize p k into u k by simply dividing by its norm."
"Let us see the Gram-Schmidt procedure on a set of two vectors s 0, s 1."
"So, they are obviously not orthonormal to each other."
"So first, we normalize s 0 into p 0 divided by its norms, that gives you u 0, which is of length 1, it's the blue vector."
"Then, we compute the projection of s 1 onto the subspace, using u 0, so that's u0 inner product with s 1 times u 0."
"Then, we subtract this from s 1: that gives us p 1."
"And finally, we normalize p1 into u1 which is the blue vector."
"Now, we have two vectors that span the same space and are orthogonal to each other."

It feels really nice to just be able to watch from above what everyone's cooking style is.
It looks like Tali's never made risotto before.
"It looks like Dave Mack has never made risotto before, as well as Scott."
"He's not using a classic technique, and there's reasons why techniques are developed."
I'm gonna make a poblano risotto for them today.
I'm gonna add a little scallop on top and see where we go from there.
"Hello, Helene. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What do you think?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Um, I think it's actually done."
The texture is telling me that it's really close.
- Did you taste that rice?
- Yes.
That taste cooked to you?
"Well, it's getting there."
- Monti.
"- Yes, sir, chef."
"One, two, three, four pans going."
What are you doing?
"I am gonna make risotto with green and yellow beans, white asparagus, and sun-dried tomato. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Not keeping things simple?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I'm gonna see how things turn out, and I'm gonna go from there. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Last 15 minutes."
Here we go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"So, with 15 minutes left, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we should certainly be adding&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the first consommes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to our final risotto.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"The rice should be toasted, the onions should be wilted."
"You're starting to see the rice swell a little bit, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;gaining volume... working it,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;working it, working it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Who do you think's gonna be doing something delicious? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I think that Frank'll do&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a good risotto,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;because I think&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;he's eaten it before.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Dave Mack?
"- He's got a pot like this, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;where it's literally, like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;just making this porridge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Right.
- I think Tali &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is kind of really&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;out of his comfort zone.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;His technique is off.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"He put cranberries in there. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I mean, there's certain things&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that never go&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; in a bloody risotto."
Cranberry's one of them.
He doesn't know when to stop. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He doesn't know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when to stop.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I mean, I'm seriously concerned. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He is in hot water.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Five minutes to go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Beautiful boy
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"

Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer

In every way
It's getting better and better
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Beautiful boy
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Beautiful boy

Sailing away
I can hardly wait
To see you come of age
But I guess we'll both just have to be patient
'Cause it's a long way to go
A hard row to hoe
"Yes, it's a long way to go"
But in the meantime
Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what happens to you
While you're busy making other plans
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Beautiful boy
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Beautiful boy
Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer

Warsaw became an important fur trading post and one of the earliest European-American settlements in western Illinois."
"During the 1840s, Warsaw was one of the centers of opposition to the Mormons at Nauvoo. Thomas C. Sharp, who edited the ""Warsaw Signal"" at this time lead the anti-Mormons. The Mormons tried to set up a settlement at Warren, a site just south of Warsaw. In 1841 Willard Richards moved to Warsaw to oversee the settlement of Warren, but due to the public response to writings by Sharp and other problems, the Mormon settlement was abandoned in 1842. In October 1844, a great gathering was announced in Warsaw. Although it claimed to be a ""wolf hunt,"" people knew that the ""wolves"" to be hunted were the Mormons. When Governor Thomas Ford heard about it, he sent militia troops to disperse the gathering. Most Mormons left the area for Utah in 1846."

"These examples above show that the difference between language and dialect is often hard to define, even for linguists, or people who study languages as their job."
"When a speaker of one language can understand what a speaker of another language is saying but not the other way around, it is called asymmetric intelligibility. An example of of this is Portuguese and Spanish. While Portuguese speakers say they can understand Spanish without major problems, Spanish speakers, on the other hand, have a very difficult time understanding Portuguese speakers. This situation is actually quite common across languages."

Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's,"
"yeah,"
"I mean,"
yeah
"there's, there's no way to stop, uh, stop anybody from getting a gun."
"Uh, I think there should be more control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you know, uh,"
"Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh,"
in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.
Uh-huh.
And for a rifle there's no waiting.
There wasn't anyhow.
Now there might be now.
Yeah.
"But there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that."
Uh-huh.
"I guess  it was just handguns that there was a, some kind  of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something."
Sure.
Yeah.
Right.
"But, uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, you know, robbing people and shooting people,"
I worked for P I E
"and then, uh, they went bankrupt"
so I just went ahead and took my early pension.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, uh-huh."
But I only get that once a month.
"Oh, that's tough."
Yeah
My roommate only gets paid once a month
and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking
Yeah.
"So,"
so.
Yeah.
"So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month."
Right.
"I, for, for years got paid once a month"
"and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once."
Uh-huh.
"There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,"
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
but I would pay all of them at one sitting
"and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, and it worked okay for me."
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
"And,"
"Right now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is"
I'm Jennifer.
And where are you from?
Pennsylvania.
"Oh, nice,"
"I'm from Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"so,"
"Oh, that's neat."
"Well, did you understand what this was for, you know, what it was for, what we,"
"Uh, television shows?"
Yeah
"Sure,"
that sounds good.
Okay
"I, I don't watch too many,"
but we can try it.
Okay.
Are you ready to start?
Sure am.
"Okay,"
just a minute
"Okay,"
I guess we're recording now.
"Yeah,"
okay.
What are your favorite television shows?
"Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here."
"Oh, really?"
"And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,"
"but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,"
"Oh, I love that show."
"I, I've been working,"
"we're going to have a baby this summer,"
and I'm not going to work anymore.
"Oh, how exciting."
Yeah.
"So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day."
I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up
"and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,"
so.
Yeah.
"Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. I mean, cook at five and eat at six, rather."
Yeah.
"Eat at six, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family."
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, yeah,"
I don't like the run in and out part.
Yeah.
"And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened"
"and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home."
"Yeah,"
that's neat.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things"
and I think that's good.
"Yeah,"
that really is.
It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.
Yeah.
"I think,"
Right now we eat in front of the T V
"Oh, yeah."
They get burnt off.
"They, they really do,"
Uh-huh.
and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, and that makes it bad too, because, uh, when more, with water being at a premium."
"I know our aunt in California,"
"they, they have really been rationed on their water."
"And it makes it real hard to have a yard or, uh, or anything like that, a their garden, their farms."
"Their farmers, I guess, are hurting because of that also."
Yeah.
"Well, my parents are now in San Diego,"
"and, and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't, almost nobody there has, has lawns."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, they are not allowed to water,"
so what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, it is very, it is very rough on them"
"so,"
Uh-huh.
"Actually I think, I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas."
"Because the, the Summers are extremely hot."
Uh-huh.
"But your humidity is different though than ours I think,"
"and it makes a, a bit of a difference, too."
"Um, what is your humidity like?"
"Oh, I don't know."
I think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas.
And when he retires I'm retiring.
"Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm, retiring period,"
Uh-huh.
"that's it,"
Yeah.
"you know, no more"
"Well, but, the,"
"did you, did you go to Florida in a van?"
As though
Uh-huh
"And we wanted to travel,"
"well, that was really nice traveling"
"but you know, I like to know more, I mean, hear about more people that have things like that you know?"
Yeah.
"And see what they think of them,"
the different kinds
Yeah.
"because I've only ridden in the one,"
"What, what kind was it?"
that's it.
"Uh, shoot"
I can't even think of the name of it now.
"What, what was remarkable, this van, even with, the,"
"we have two kids,"
and we went to Disney World
Uh-huh.
"uh, actually I grew up in Alabama,"
"and I went to see my mother,"
"and then went on down to Disney World,"
"and it got better than, I think twenty-two, twenty-three miles a gallon."
"And this was with the air conditioner on and, and you know four people with, with luggage,"
Yeah.
exactly.
they have to just go through everything.
Exactly.
"And you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight, thirty, if you haven't slowed down,  something will slow you down."
Uh-huh.
Do you know what I'm saying?
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"Um, because it's just, you find out that you're really not, um, smelling the roses,"
"and I know that sounds trite,  and all that."
"Yeah,"
"I think, I think a lot of, uh, people probably feeling that way,"
"I know, I'm probably feeling that way because it's, everything's geared towards young.  You know"
Uh-huh.
"and whether I want to realize it or not, everything on television is young,  young, young, young."
Oh it is.
"You can't be a model after thirty,"
"you can't do this after twenty, you know"
"and,  everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen.  You know,"
That's right.
Uh-huh.
and so I feel like I'm old.
"It's like I sing,  I sing"
"and I would really love to become,  uh, a professional singer,"
Uh-huh.
"but I think I'm too old now,"
"Oh, you're not,"
no.
"and I'm twenty-three,"
No.
"because everyone I've seen coming up, they're fifteen.  You know,"
That's true
"Yeah,"
"well, we, we've had, uh,"
"let's see,"
"we had, uh, we had a, uh,"
let me think.
ause We had a fifty-three
"and a, uh, we had, uh, two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story"
"Uh, and we had a sixty-five"
and then we had this eighty-two.
Uh-huh.
"So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really."
"Yeah,"
we've been real pleased with ours.
"I think we've had, one, two, three"
Yeah.
"and most,"
"we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventy-seven."
Uh-huh.
Then we have a Cutlass Sierra
and we've had the ninety-eight.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"but I don't know,"
"we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year"
"and the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they give good financing through the, the motor company."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, I don't know what we're going to buy."
"I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car,"
"but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty"
Well
"So,"
I could be wrong.
"Uh, I do not know what, what it is percentage wise"
"but I,"
I do not know for sure either.
"But it always seems well, it just felt different like when we were in Texas."
It had a different feel to it.
Yeah.
"It is, it is drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin, which is further south."
Uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But it is not dry.
"And, and I have lived here for many years,"
and I think it has gotten more humid over the years.
"Where the water is coming from, I don't know."
Uh-huh.
"Well, it could be."
"I know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times, uh,"
"Oh, does he live near the lake?"
"Well, there is a lake not far"
"but it is more run off from surrounding, you know, areas and that."
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"And, uh, he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it's, you know, it, it collects there."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, he has had a couple of inches in his house several times."
"That is, that is a problem, uh,"
"they tell you when you are looking for a house or, or, or buying land to build on, to be very careful and check the drainage because, uh, it is, it is deceptive."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Because of that.
Yeah.
"I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada."
"Uh, well part of it, touring."
"And, uh, you know, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on."
"There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec"
Yeah.
and I had never heard any of that before.
"Yeah,"
"you know, there was, a, a,"
"what is it called,"
is it Meech Lake Accord?
Uh-huh.
"Or, or, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of"
"and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it."
"And, and came"
it was a big thing going on there
and I came back here
and nothing in the papers.
"Right,"
right.
I didn't see a thing about it.
"So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess."
It's improved.
"And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news."
"Even, even there's, uh, uh,"
it's it's semireligious in some respects.
But what is it?
"It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,"
"uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel."
"The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR."
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, I, it surprised me."
"Oh,"
Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time?
Pardon.
"Uh, do you all start planning real far ahead of time?"
"Well, no."
There is kind of a set pattern to it.
"There is, uh,"
"so, uh, the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually."
"Oh, really"
Yeah.
"Uh, we, uh, get together, at the, uh, the park, uh, the, uh, the park, and playground area of the Church I was raised in"
Yeah.
"and, uh, everybody brings lots of food"
and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat
Eat a lot.
"Oh, gosh."
It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out
Yeah.
"and so we have to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can uh, start their, uh, vacation time."
Schedule vacation time
and yeah.
We
"uh, Sat, uh, Sunday afternoon or, uh, sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon."
Uh-huh.
"Usually, it is like Sunday afternoon"
and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"is that one of your, uh,"
"I mean, uh,"
"Well, where I am calling from is southern Mississippi."
"So, we have got, uh, uh, my wife and I have, uh, a bit longer ways to go than most."
"So, it's, it's like everybody is into it,"
it's just greed. Human greed.
Yeah.
"Interestingly in Honduras, It's very pro-American."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And we have I,"
"my girlfriend used to, uh, be in the Navy"
"and she was based, uh, based in Panama."
Uh-huh.
"In Honduras, very, uh, uh, pro-American."
Uh-huh.
"And there's a lot of men, I don't know how many American, uh,"
"soldiers are there,"
but there's a lot.
"I mean, they, uh,"
"I had wondered sometimes,"
"I knew that there was a lot of, a lot of effort"
"and a lot of work went into a lot of that,"
"and I just wondered if, if it lasted, and if it took, you know,"
"like, uh,"
Uh-huh
"Yeah,"
"I've, you know, some of the programs I would have concern about like, um, the language teaching, you know,"
"I mean, why should we push English,"
Uh-huh
and a lot of people were down there teaching English
"and when they talked about Hungary or someplace, one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language, you know, to me that's a little bit marginal."
"I did teach economics at the university one night a week,"
"and the textbook was in English,"
"but basically I taught it in Spanish, because, I mean, I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test."
Oh.
and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find.
Exactly.
It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S
"I was reading,"
"Right,"
"I was reading something in, uh, CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact."
"They were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out. And about how, yeah, you'd like to buy an American car maybe"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, you know, the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever."
Yeah.
"Uh, like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger"
"and, and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi."
Huh.
"You know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know?"
"Yeah,"
really.
"But, uh, that's the way it is."
"I don't know,"
"I, I personally feel that, uh, uh, if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes"
"and, you know, people, more than manufacturers should get a clue"
"and, you know, they should start making quality products."
"Yeah,"
I think they're beginning to.
"The, the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away"
"and,"
"That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, they've got all the American, well, all the, all the cars rated, you know,"
"and, uh, essentially, I I don't see much of a trend."
"I mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there."
"There's nothing wrong with them. Uh, and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars."
But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy
"""I Touch Roses"" is the second single released by the American synthpop band Book of Love. The song was included on the band's eponymous debut album ""Book of Love"" in 1986. The B-side to the single is ""Lost Souls"", a remixed version of which also appeared on their debut album."
"Although ""I Touch Roses"" failed to reach the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart, it did make the Top 10 on the ""Billboard"" Hot Dance Club Play chart, where it peaked at no. 8 in 1985."
"""I Touch Roses"" was written by band member Theodore (""Ted"") Ottaviano. After the success of their first single, ""Boy"", ""I Touch Roses"" followed a similar trajectory, securing that the band would record a full album for Sire Records. In 2009, Ted Ottaviano revealed, ""We didn't know it at the time, but thankfully, with 'I Touch Roses', it was not preordained that Sire was developing us at the time. There was no grand scheme. It was more a la carte. But then people started picking up on 'Roses' and then the album happened."""
"In 2001, after having success with new remixes of ""Boy"", the record company commissioned DJ/producer Markus Schulz to attempt a follow up by remixing ""I Touch Roses"" for the new millennium. A promotional 12"" single was released in 2001, featuring the Markus Schulz Dark Rose Remix, and an instrumental version of the remix on the flipside, in order to further promote Book of Love's greatest hits album, """". The new remixes did not chart, and are not included on the album."

"William Meschin (sometimes William le Meschin; died between 1130 and 1135) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and baron. The brother of the earl of Chester, Meschin participated in the First Crusade. After returning to England, he acquired lands both from King Henry I of England and by his marriage to an heiress."
"Meschin built Egremont Castle on his lands and with his wife was a benefactor of a couple of religious foundations. He died sometime between 1130 and 1135, with his estates eventually being divided amongst the descendants of his three daughters."
"Meschin was the brother of Ranulf le Meschin, the Earl of Chester. They were the sons of Ranulf de Briquessart, the viscount of the Bessin, and his wife, Matilda, the daughter of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches. The boys were also nephews of Hugh d'Avranches, who was Earl of Chester. There was also an older brother, Richard, who died young, and a sister, who married Robert de Grandmesnil. Meschin went on the First Crusade and was present at the Siege of Nicaea in 1097."
"Meschin was given Gilsland by his brother, in order to protect the approaches to Carlisle. Due to attacks by the Scots, Meschin was unable to hold it. In compensation, King Henry I of England gave him lands around Allerdale in Cumberland, which centred on Egremont. These lands comprised the lordship, or feudal barony of Egremont. Through his wife, he acquired Skipton, and the lordship, or barony of Skipton. Besides these lands, Meschin also was awarded two escheated properties in Leicestershire, some of which had earlier been lands of Roger de Busli. Other properties in Leicestershire were previously held by Durand Malet and William Blund in the ""Domesday Book"". Meschin also held lands in Lincolnshire and Cheshire from his brother."
"Meschin built the original parts of Egremont Castle at Egremont. It was a motte-and-bailey stone castle on the River Ehen. He and his wife also founded the Augustinian priory of Embsay Priory. Katrina Legg argues that Meschin's main motive for the foundation was to show support for a monastic order that enjoyed the patronage of King Henry I. Against this, Legg feels that Meschin's wife's motives were more probably religious, as she was close to Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Another religious foundation of Meschin's was St Bees Priory, a daughter house of St Mary's Abbey, York. St Bees was founded around the same time as Embsay, Embsay was founded between 1120 and 1121, and St Bees was founded sometime after 1120."
"Meschin married Cecily, daughter of Robert de Rumily. They had one son, Ranulf Meschin, and three daughters, Alice, Avice, and Matilda. Another son, Matthew, who was the eldest son, died before his parents."
"Meschin died between 1130 and 1135. His widow married Henry de Tracy, and she died around 1151. Skipton went to Alice, who married William fitzDuncan. Alice and her first husband also acquired Egremont, after the death of her brother Ranulf without heirs. After the death of fitzDuncan, Alice married Alexander fitzGerold. Avice married William de Courcy. Avice married as her second husband William Paynel, son of Ralph Paynel, as his second wife. Before 1153 Avice had married as her third husband Walter, the son of Alan de Percy. Matilda married twice – first to Philip de Belmeis and second to Hugh de Mortimer. All three daughters were the eventual co-heirs of their father, after their brother died without offspring between 1135 and 1140. Meschin's lands were divided between their descendants, with parts ending up with the Counts of Aumale, the family of the Courcys, and the last and smallest part to the Mortimer family."

"McHugh was born at Annagh, Glenfarne, County Leitrim. He was the son of a tenant farmer, Peter M’Hugh of Leitrim, and of Anne McDermott.

In 1900, standing for the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party, he was again challenged in North Leitrim by a Unionist, but again won comfortably, with 91% of the vote. In April 1901 he was imprisoned for six months following conviction for ‘seditious libel’ on account of an article on Jury Packing in Sligo published in his newspaper. The article had attacked jurymen who had convicted two men of intimidating persons who rented farms from which the former owners had been evicted. On his release he was given a celebratory lunch by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. In September the following year, he stood before the Irish Court of Bankruptcy after a petition from the Crown Solicitor for Sligo, but this apparently did not affect his political standing.

"= = = Leila; or, The Siege of Granada = = ="
"Leila; or, The Siege of Granada is a historical romance novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton published in 1838."
"The novel is set in Granada, Spain at the end of the Middle Ages — beginning in the summer of 1491. It was originally published in an expensive form, with many engraved illustrations. The preface to the 1860 edition explains that the novel has been less popular than his other works of fiction due to the prejudice against literary works that are thought to owe their value, in part, to the illustrations."
"In ""Leila"", as the double title suggests, there is a double storyline: the domestic story of the daughter (Leila) and the public story of the nation. Leila's father, Almamen, switches allegiances between Christian and Moor in what eventually becomes the famous Siege of Granada. Almamen attempts to guard his daughter's Jewish heritage by keeping her away from her Moorish lover, Muza. He inadvertently delivers her into the hands of the Christian monarchs, and Leila is subjected to the procedures of conversion by the queen's intermediary, Donna Inez. In the double story line, the conquest of Muslim Granada runs parallel to the conversion of the Jewish Leila. The characters meet at the altar of a convent in which Leila is about to take her vows as a nun, and her father kills her. The domestic plot parallels the Christianization of Spain."

"Sevier was born in 1896 in Madison Parish, Louisiana, a son of the former Roxie Roberta Allen and James Douglas Sevier, Sr., a native of Port Gibson, in Claiborne County in southwestern Mississippi. His parents moved to Madison Parish in 1880, where his father became a planter. Sevier attended local segregated schools for his lower education. He graduated in 1917 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge."
"His father's family were descended from John Sevier, a veteran of the American Revolution, and pioneer and first governor of Tennessee. He was the namesake of Sevierville in Sevier County in eastern Tennessee. His line became prominent in northeastern Louisiana. One of Henry's cousins was Andrew L. Sevier, who served as a Louisiana State Senator with repeated reelection, from 1932 until his death in office in 1962."
"During World War I, Henry Sevier served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He was wounded sixteen times in France, and received the Purple Heart and the Silver Star medals."
"After the war, in 1918 Sevier married the former Retta Brooks (1899-1992) of Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. The couple had three children: Carolyn S. Yerger (1921-1997), who married Rufus Taft Yerger, Sr. (1914-1973); Roberta Sevier Gandy (1924-2006), who married Robert Wyly Gandy, Jr. (1915-1987), and Henry Clay Sevier, Jr. (born c. 1926), who became an attorney and a partner in his father's law firm for a time. He later moved to Covington in St. Tammany Parish."
"Sevier and his wife went to New York City, where he completed postgraduate work at Columbia University in 1921. He graduated from the Louisiana State University Law Center, and they settled in Tallulah."
"There Sevier entered into practice with Jefferson B. Snyder of Tallulah, the political boss of the delta parishes in northeastern Louisiana. Snyder wielded power for more than 40 years as the regional district attorney, from 1904 to 1948."
"Sevier decided to enter politics. A member of the Democratic Party, in 1936 Sevier was elected to the Louisiana House from Madison Parish to succeed fellow Democrat, Mason Spencer of Tallulah. Spencer was the husband of his Sevier cousin, Rosa Vertner Sevier Spencer (1891-1978)."
"Sevier was elected a few months after the assassination of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr.. At the time, there was much voter sympathy for the pro-Long faction. The staunchly anti-Long Mason Spencer had earlier announced that he would run for governor, but he withdrew before the election. Richard Leche of New Orleans, the choice of the Long faction, won the election uncontested."
"After his law partner Snyder died in 1951, Sevier formed the Sevier, Yerger, and Sevier law firm in Tallulah. (His son Henry became an attorney and his partner in the firm for a period of time.) The senior Sevier was also president of the Tallulah State Bank and Trust Company. Given these additional responsibilities, and having served eight terms in the state house, he chose not to run again after his term ending in 1952."
"Like Snyder, Sevier was active in the Democratic State Central Committee. He was the national committeeman during the first administration of Governor Jimmie Davis. Afterward he was selected as the state Democratic Party chairman under Governor Earl Kemp Long."

Despite losing a third of their games in the first stage, finishing in 4th position out of ten teams in their group, Naft Al-Wasat just about managed to qualify for the final stage, after wins against the likes of Erbil and Al-Zawraa; this itself was considered a big success for the young team. In the second stage, the team surprised everyone by defeating Al Shorta SC (the defending champions and one of the strongest contenders for the league championship) twice. After taking the Group 1 lead, Naft Al-Wasat got qualified to the league final, where they won over Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya via a penalty shoot-out."
"Their league title win qualified them for the 2016 AFC Cup. They finished top of Group B with a record of five wins and one loss, but they lost 1–0 in the round of 16 to Al-Jaish. They were not allowed to play their home matches in Iraq in this tournament due to security concerns. In the 2015–16 Iraqi Premier League, Naft Al-Wasat finished in second place in their group, behind eventual champions Al-Zawraa, to qualify for the final stage.

"John Francis Dodge (October 25, 1864 – January 14, 1920) was an American automobile manufacturing pioneer and co-founder of Dodge Brothers Company."
"Dodge was born in Niles, Michigan, where his father ran a foundry and machine shop. John and his younger brother, Horace, were inseparable as children and as adults. The origins of the Dodge family lie in Stockport, England, where their ancestral home still stands."
"In 1886, the Dodge family moved to Detroit, where John and Horace took jobs at a boiler maker plant. In 1894 they went to work as machinists at the Dominion Typograph Company in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. While John was the sales-minded managerial type, his brother Horace was a gifted mechanic and inveterate tinkerer. Using a dirt-proof ball bearing Horace invented and patented, in 1897 Dodge arranged a deal for the brothers to join with a third-party investor to manufacture bicycles. Within a few years, they sold the bicycle business and in 1900 used the proceeds of the sale to set up their own machine shop in Detroit."
"In their first year of business, the Dodge brothers' company began making parts for the automobile industry. In 1902 the Dodge brothers won a contract to build transmissions for the Olds Motor Vehicle Company upon which they built a solid reputation for quality and service. However, the following year they turned down a second contract from Olds to retool their Detroit plant at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue to build engines for Henry Ford in a deal that included a share position in the new Ford Motor Company. By 1910, John Dodge and his brother were so successful they built a new plant in Hamtramck, Michigan."
"For ten years (1903–1913), the Dodge brothers' business was a Ford Motor Company supplier, and Dodge worked as vice president of the Ford company. He left Ford in 1913, and in 1914 he and Horace formed Dodge Brothers to develop their own line of automobiles. They began building motor trucks for the United States military during the arms buildup for World War I, and in October 1917 they produced their first commercial car. At war's end, their company produced and marketed both cars and trucks."
He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1997.
"Because of his temper and often crude behavior, the red-haired Dodge was seen as socially unacceptable to most of the well-heeled elite of Detroit. Nevertheless, his wealth made him an influential member of the community and he became active in Republican Party politics in Michigan."
"The Dodge brothers were the sons of machinist Daniel Rugg Dodge (1819–1897) and Maria Duval Casto (1823–1906). Maria was Daniel's second wife. They had an elder full sister: Della Lone (1863–1936) and older half brother Charles Frontier Dodge (1855–1926), and half sister Laura Belle (1858-?) from Daniel's first marriage to Lorinda Gould (1820–1860)."
John Dodge married Canadian Ivy Hawkins (1864–1901) in September 1892. They had three children:
"Following Ivy (Hawkins) Dodge's death from tuberculosis, he secretly married Isabelle Smith (who was his housekeeper) in Walkerville, Ontario, on December 8, 1902. They separated in 1905 and quietly divorced in 1907; the marriage was kept secret until after the death of his third wife. Shortly after the divorce from Isabelle, Dodge married his secretary, Matilda Rausch (1883–1967). Dodge had three more children with Matilda:"
"In 1908, John Dodge and Matilda purchased the land for Meadow Brook Farms near Rochester, Michigan. At Meadow Brook, their eldest child, Frances, developed a love of horses that led her to acquire Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and turn it into one of the leading horse breeding operations in the United States. Dodge's daughter Isabel established Brookmeade Stable. It became a major participant in Thoroughbred horse racing and owned several Champions, including the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame horses Cavalcade and Sword Dancer. Five years after Dodge's death in 1920, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and they built the Meadow Brook Hall at the Rochester estate."
His great grandson is film producer John F Dodge III.
"John and Horace contracted influenza and pneumonia while in New York City during the 1918 flu pandemic. John died on January 14, 1920, at the Ritz-Carlton, aged 55. He was interred in the Egyptian-style family mausoleum in Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery guarded by two Sphinx statues."
"Horace died the following December, and in 1925 their widows sold the Dodge Brothers automobile business to Dillon Read, investment bankers, for $146 million (equivalent to $ in ). Dodge's newborn daughter Anna Margaret died of the measles before age five. His son Daniel drowned in the waters off Manitoulin Island after falling overboard while being transported to hospital following an accident involving dynamite. He had just recently married, at age 21."
"After Dodge's death, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and adopted two children with him, Richard and Barbara Wilson. Matilda Dodge Wilson was Lieutenant Governor of Michigan briefly in 1940 under Republican Governor Luren Dickinson."
"In 1957, the Wilsons donated their Meadow Brook Farm, including Meadow Brook Hall, Sunset Terrace and all its other buildings and collections, along with $2 million (equivalent to $ in ), to Michigan State University to establish an extension campus. In 1963, the Michigan State University-Oakland was renamed Oakland University."

"Nachman Goldstein of Tcherin (1825 – 1894), also known as the Tcheriner Rav (rabbi of Tcherin, a town in eastern Ukraine), was a leading disciple of Nathan of Breslov (known as ""Reb Noson""), who in turn was the chief disciple of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic dynasty."
"A child prodigy who excelled in his Torah studies even as a young boy, Goldstein was the grandson of Rabbi Aharon, the chief rabbi of Breslov in Rebbe Nachman's day, and the son of Rabbi Zvi Aryeh, the succeeding rabbi of Breslov. He grew up in the town of Breslov. However, in his youth he shied away from Reb Noson. Once Reb Noson said to him, ""Nachman, who knows? Maybe the reason Rebbe Nachman worked so hard to bring your grandfather to Breslav was because of ""you""?"" After that, Goldstein became a follower of Reb Noson, and after the latter's death, became very involved with Reb Noson's works."
"Goldstein raised his daughter's son, Abraham Sternhartz, after the latter was orphaned of his parents as a young child. As the grandson of Reb Noson's leading disciple and at the same time a great-grandson of Noson through his father's line, Sternhartz was privy to all the family traditions and stories about Rebbe Nachman's closest disciple. These formed the basis for his definitive collection of Breslov oral traditions, entitled ""Tovot Zichronot""."

"Eminsang travelled back to the Gold Coast on the same ship that carried Nagtglas there. Upon arrival, Nagtglas appointed Eminsang as a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast. When it became apparent that the Dutch were negotiating a treaty to transfer their possessions on the Gold Coast to the United Kingdom, Eminsang led the attempts by the Elminese to stop the transfer, and together with other Dutch loyalists paid for a visit to The Hague by David Mill Graves, in an ultimate attempt to stop the ratification of the treaty. Eminsang wrote a letter to the German ambassador in The Hague asking German Emperor William I for mediation and protection, to be handed over by Mill Graves."
"After it became clear that Mill Graves's mission could not prevent the handing over of Elmina to the British, Eminsang withdrew his protest, keen on keeping his influential positions in the colonial government. Apart from being a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast, Eminsang had also become a substitute judge on the Court of Justice, a sworn attorney, and a justice of the Small Causes Court. Eminsang's ""volte face"" proved very worthwhile for him, as he was appointed a member of the Committee for the Regularisation of the Affairs of the Netherlands on the Coast of Guinea headed by J. M. C. W. Joost, as well as notary and public registrar."
"When Elmina was finally transferred to the British on 6 April, the British Governor of the Gold Coast John Pope Hennessy appointed Eminsang Civil Commandant, Collector of Customs, Postmaster and Deputy Superintendent of Police. As it appeared that Eminsang was rewarded for his sudden change of opinion, many Elminese grew angry with the situation. On 26 April, people from various ""asafo"" wards, mainly numbers 6, 7 and 8, marched with muskets, knives and Dutch flags to Eminsang's house, where a meeting was held between the Regularisation Committee and colonel De Haes, the Dutch military officer who had been entrusted with effecting the transfer of sovereignty. An altercation followed on the streets and eventually shots were fired, which hit J. M. C. W. Joost, who died of his wounds the next day."
"Eminsang could no longer remain in Elmina and fled to Cape Coast. He was released of his duties to the Regularisation Committee by colonel De Haes on 30 April. Eminsang later returned to Elmina, however, and served as acting consul general of the Netherlands in Elmina in 1878 and 1879 during the absence of Pieter Simon Hamel, and as consul to the Congo and the United States in Cape Coast in 1890."
"In the preface of his book ""Fanti Customary Laws"", John Mensah Sarbah wrote:"
"Eminsang had at least three children with Anna Abraba Smith. One of them, Marianne Eminsang (about 1859–1915), was grandmother to Robert Patrick Baffour. Anna Abraba Smith previously had a child with Cornelis Nagtglas."
"Eminsang married Mary Ellen De Lyons on 14 April 1860 at the American Episcopal Church in Harper, Liberia. She however abandoned him for the British colonial administrator Herbert Taylor Ussher. Eminsang then tried to indict Ussher for fornication and adultery at the Cape Coast court of justice, but after this attempt failed he decided to divorce De Lyons. The divorce was finalised on 11 September 1867."
Eminsang also had a child with Sarah Rühle and a son with a woman named Adayesa.

"Pemberton is an unincorporated community in Goochland County, Virginia, United States. Virginia State Route 45 passes by Pemberton, located about west of Goochland, the county seat. It was named for the family that owned Clover Forest Plantation. Nearby is Howard's Neck Plantation, listed on the National Register of Historic Places."
"This hamlet was named for the owners of Clover Forest Plantation. The settlement overlooks the James River and was once a hub of rural trading activity. A dam and canal lock were built on the James at Pemberton to enable passage by boats. The lock lowered boats from the Kanawha Canal into the James River just below Cartersville, Cumberland County, Virginia and connected with Tamworth, Virginia and its mill. Trade moved from the Cartersville port and Willis River downriver on the James."
"Pemberton became connected to other markets via the Cartersville-Fredericksburg State Road, that began in Cartersville, crossed the James, and continued northward. The Cartersville Bridge, built across the James River in 1824, connected Cartersville and Pemberton; it was the first James River bridge built in Goochland County. At the time, all other river crossings were by ferry."
"In the late 1800s the Richmond-Allegheny Railroad (later the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, and currently CSX) was built through the area along the tow path of the abandoned Kanawha Canal. Pemberton was one of the railroad stops. Trains arrived in the village daily, carrying passengers and mail."
"By the early 1920s the rural village of Pemberton consisted of a large combined general store and post office, a lumber mill and pulp yards. Prominent Goochland County residents living in Pemberton included William Henry (Bill) Hall, a veteran of the American Civil War; and Bland Selden Hobson, the only Goochland woman known to have served overseas in World War I."

"The Siege of Ctesiphon took place on 27 April 629 between the forces of Shahrbaraz and Ardashir III. Shahrbaraz managed to capture Ctesiphon with a small force, revealing to all the weakness of the Sasanian Empire."
"In 602, the last Byzantine-Sasanian war began; it was the most devastating of the series of wars fought between the two empires. In 618, Khosrau II sent Shahrbaraz to conquer Egypt; one year later the Sasanians managed to capture Alexandria, the capital of Byzantine Egypt. After the fall of Alexandria, the Sasanians gradually extended their rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands."
"Egypt would remain in Sasanian hands for 10 years, run by general Shahrbaraz from Alexandria. As the new Roman emperor, Heraclius, reversed the tide and defeated Khosrau II, Shahrbaraz was ordered to evacuate the province, but refused. In the end, Heraclius, trying both to recover Egypt and to sow disunion amongst the Iranians, offered to help Shahrbaraz seize the Sasanian throne for himself. An agreement was reached, and in the spring of 629, the Sasanian troops began leaving Egypt."
"Luckily for Shahrbaraz, a civil war began in 628 that divided the resources of the Sasanian Empire, and a devastating plague in the western provinces killed half of the population along with Kavadh II, weakening the empire. Shahrbaraz marched towards Ctesiphon with 6,000 men, besieged it and then captured it, betraying the Sasanian nobles and killing many of them, including two notable ones named Ardabīl and Mah-Adhur Gushnasp."
"After capturing Ctesiphon, Shahrbaraz killed Ardashir III and took the throne for himself. However, his reign did not last long, because he was killed by Sasanian nobles after forty days, and two daughters of Khosrau II reigned in succession."

"Lev Zacharovitch Aronson (Lew Aronson, Lev Aronoff, Lev Aronov, Lev Arnoff, Lew Arnow, Lew Arnoff-Aramon, Lew Arnoff-Aronson) (February 7, 1912 – November 12, 1988) was an Eastern European-American cellist and cello teacher."
"Lev Aronson was born February 7, 1912, in Mönchengladbach, Germany. Aronson's parents, Zorach and Pessa, along with their first infant son, had moved to Germany in 1911 so Zorach could study tailoring at the Fachhoschule (School of Fashion) in Berlin. Zorach and Pessa's infant son died in 1911. Lev was born a few weeks before his father graduated from the Fachhoschule. About three weeks after Lev's birth, the family returned to their home in Mitava in the Courland region of the Russian Empire (presently Jelgava, Latvia)."
"Aronson's sister, Gerda, was born in 1914, the same year Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated and World War I began. The Russian government, fearing that German and Yiddish-speaking Jews might be or become German spies, took action quickly. On April 18, 1915, the Decree of Expulsion was issued by Czarist Russia, and many Jews were forcibly moved to the interior of Russia. The Aronsons and many other Jews were deported on cattle cars to Voronezh, southeast of Moscow."
"Aronson first heard the cello played by a child of a non-Jewish neighbor in Voronezh. Soon after this, a relative on his mother's side, Nikolai Arnoff, who was a professional cellist, came to Voronezh to give a concert and stayed with the Aronson family. He taught Lev how to hold the instrument and the bow. Lev's father bought him a small cello and arranged with a fellow immigrant, Aron Rafaelovitsch Rubinstein, to teach the child his first cello lessons. Lev was seven."
"In 1920, the family was allowed to leave Voronezh, and they chose to move to Riga, Latvia. Lev attended school in Riga and continued to study cello. As a youth, he performed occasionally with the orchestra at silent movies. Aronson studied cello with Paul Berkowitz, a well-known physician and cellist in Riga."
"Upon his graduation from high school at 16, Aronson moved to Berlin to study law. During his first semester he met a doctor who was an amateur cellist. The doctor, after hearing Aronson play, introduced him to Julius Klengel in Leipzig. Aronson began studying cello with Klengel and soon gave up law to focus on music. After a year with Klengel, Lev began his studies with Alfred von Glehn at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin. When von Glehn died, Gregor Piatigorsky took over his class. Piatigorsky was to become Aronson's life-long mentor and friend. Aronson began performing locally with three German friends in the Peters String Quartet in 1931."
"In 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany. Anti-Jewish violence in Germany and throughout Europe was on the rise. Aronson decided to change his name to Lev Arnoff, which sounded more Russian than Jewish in an attempt to escape attention and continue performing. Aronson found a patroness, Mrs. Daliba Jones, whom he met in Florence through American conductor Vladimir Shavitch, and began to build a successful performing career throughout Europe as a soloist. He won a competition in Russia. He made several recordings for the Bellacord Electro label. In 1937, he became principal cellist for the Philharmonic Orchestra of Libau. During the late 1930s, Aronson also began teaching cello in Riga, awakening a passion for education that would stay with him for the rest of his life."
"German forces invaded and occupied Riga in June 1941. Aronson's cellos were confiscated. Aronson began work as a slave laborer for the Gestapo. The Jews were moved to a ghetto in the so-called Moscow suburb of Riga. Between November 29 and December 8, 1941, thousands of Jews living in the Riga Ghetto were taken to the Rumbula forest, shot, and buried in mass graves. Among them were Aronson's parents."
"Aronson worked at the clothing depot, Ausekla, for much of the period between the German invasion and 1943. In 1943, the Riga-Kaiserwald concentration camp system was formally established. Many Jews already lived and worked at satellite work camps in the region, which were now considered to be part of the Kaiserwald system. The Riga Ghetto was liquidated, moving the Jews from one horrible situation to another. Most Jews from the ghetto or satellite camps passed through Kaiserwald briefly on their way to work assignments within the system. Aronson worked at the Lenta subcamp, and outgrowth of Ausekla."
"In the fall of 1944, the Germans fled Latvia ahead of the Russian advance. Aronson and a number of other Jews from Kaiserwald and its subcamps, including his sister, were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp. Aronson's sister died at Stutthof."
"From Stutthof, Aronson was transferred to Burggraben and worked in the Danzig shipyards. In 1945, the Germans again moved their Jewish prisoners ahead of the Ally advance. Aronson was among one of the many groups of Jews sent on death marches in the early months of 1945. His group made it to Gotentov (near Lauenberg), where they were liberated on March 10, 1945, by the Russians."
"Aronson, along with many other survivors, was sent to a Soviet repatriation camp in Torun, Poland. Aronson managed to escape and made his way with the help of the Jewish underground through Poland and Germany to the American militarized zone, where he spent nearly two years waiting to be allowed to immigrate to the United States. During his flight, Aronson met dancer Nina Bukowska, and the two fell in love and were married in 1947."
"Some of the musicians from the Riga ghetto survived the war in the same camps as Aronson; the tenor Gregor Shelkan was one of them. After the war, Aronson and Shelkan, memorializing those who died in the war, composed several original pieces. A few of these compositions were published in the Displaced Persons camp Schlachtensee in the American zone of Berlin."
"Aronson and Bukowska immigrated to the United States in 1948. He accepted a contract with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and moved to Texas. Aronson served as assistant principal cellist in the Dallas Symphony for the 1948-1949 season and then as principal until 1967. Aronson taught cello at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, from 1967 until 1980. In 1980, Aronson began teaching at Southern Methodist University. In the 1970s, Aronson collaborated with Croatian cellist and composer, Rudolf Matz, producing the two volume work, The Complete Cellist."
"Bukowska and Aronson moved to Dallas together but later divorced. Aronson married Deane Wright in 1959 and was subsequently divorced. He married Harriet Snodgrass, a fellow cellist and former pupil, in 1979."
"Lev Aronson died in Dallas on November 12, 1988. In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the ""Chevalier du violoncello"" by the Janzer Foundation."
"Though a talented performer, Lev Aronson is perhaps best-known as an influential teacher of the cello. During his tenure in the Dallas Symphony, he taught several private cello students. After his retirement from the orchestra, he dedicated more time to teaching, privately and at his university appointments. He founded and conducted the Dal-Hi Chamber Players, a group of young musicians who performed in the United States and abroad in the 1970s. He taught and judged at numerous music festivals, workshops, and competitions. He even taught a course for the Southern Methodist University Continuing Education program, which introduced adults to western art music."
"Aronson's students include Lynn Harrell, Ralph Kirshbaum, Kristi Curb, Brian Thornton, John Sharp, Adron Ming, Brook Pearce, James R. Denton, Christopher Adkins, Laurie Arnold, Alicia Randisi-Hooker, Karen Terbeek, Carol Haski, Philip Taggart, Kevin Dvorak, Richard Pope, Jonathan Reimer, Rebecca Young, and Mitch Maxwell."

= = = Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation = = =
"The Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (often shortened to BBC) was a Philippine television network that began operations on November 4, 1973 and ceased transmission on March 20, 1986."
"DWWX-TV (formerly DZAQ-TV) station owned by ABS-CBN was shut down following the declaration of Martial Law in 1972, and served as the flagship station of BBC. Roberto Benedicto, a crony of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and owner of the Kanlaon Broadcasting System, took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center complex on Bohol (now Sergeant Esguerra) Avenue in Quezon City after the KBS Studios along Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City (which were ironically sold to them by ABS-CBN in 1969) were destroyed by fire on June 6, 1973, a few months before BBC went on air. The new network was named the ""Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation"" after Mount Banahaw, a dormant volcano located in southern Luzon known for its hot springs and mystical associations."
"In July 1978, BBC, RPN and another Benedicto-owned network, the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) (which originally aired from San Juan del Monte), transferred to the Broadcast City compound in Old Balara, Quezon City, with the transmitter located along Panay Avenue, Quezon City (now being used by ABS-CBN), with the then newly upgraded 35 kW transmitter for better broadcast reception. This left Channel 4 (a frequency formerly owned by ABS-CBN and taken over by the government through National Media Production Center (NMPC) as Government Television in 1974) at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center complex, then renamed MBS Broadcast Plaza (MBS being Maharlika Broadcasting System, the name that Channel 4 acquired in 1980)."
"By December 1973, the network also operated DYCB-TV 3 in Cebu and DYXL-TV 4 in Bacolod, both of which were also originally owned by ABS-CBN. Their call signs were also changed to DYCW-TV and DYBW-TV, respectively. The Cebu and Bacolod stations switched affiliations to GTV (Government Television; later the Maharlika Broadcasting System) in 1978 and reverted to their former call letters."
"BBC-2 was rebranded as City 2 Television from 1980 until 1984. In 1984, it was rebranded again back as BBC-2 (not to be confused with the British television channel). BBC ended operations on March 20, 1986 after People Power Revolution along with RPN and IBC (temporarily), after reformist soldiers disabled the transmitter that was broadcasting Marcos' inauguration from Malacañang Palace. Upon Corazón C. Aquino's subsequent accession to the presidency, BBC, RPN and IBC (collectively known as ""Broadcast City"") were sequestered and placed under the management of a Board of Administrators tasked to operate and manage its business and affairs subject to the control and supervision of Presidential Commission on Good Government. ABS-CBN resumed broadcasting on September 14, 1986 and its Cebu and Bacolod stations were returned to its original owner. DWWX-TV is still used as the callsign of the network's flagship station in Metro Manila."
"BBC became well-remembered for its trademark jingle, ""Big Beautiful Country"", composed by José Mari Chan and sung by various OPM singers of the 70s. By 1980, its relaunch as City 2 made history as the first national station to incorporate computer-generated graphics using the Scanimate system for its station identity and promo spots, followed only by Radio Philippines Network in 1981-82."

"Second-order election is a term that appeared for the first time in Karlheinz Reif and Hermann Schmitt's ""Nine second-order national elections – A conceptual framework for the analysis of European election results"" article for the [European Journal of Political Research, in 1980]. It was used to analyze the first European Parliament elections, held in 1979 in the, then, nine member states of the European Economic Community. According to the ""second-order elections"" approach, European Parliament elections were ""second-order"" in that they were viewed as less important by voters, parties and the media than first-order elections."
"First-order elections are those that determine the government and/or executive power in a political system, i.e., national elections. They are first-order in that they are seen as more important by parties, voters and the media. Local and regional elections are also considered second-order elections."
"Second-order elections present the following characteristics: turnout is expected to be lower than in national elections, voters are more prone to vote for protest parties, or parties in the periphery of the political system, rather than the usual mainstream parties they would vote for in a national election. As a result, second-order elections are often used by voters to punish or reward the current governing parties."
"Regarding EP elections, empirical evidence has shown that all six EP elections (1979, 1985, 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004) have been second-order elections. However, the second-order elections approach has not been confirmed for the twelve new member states of the European Union (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia)."

"Joel Lester Oppenheimer (Jacob Hammer) (February 18, 1930 – October 11, 1988) was an American poet associated with both the Black Mountain poets and the New York School. He was the first director of the St. Marks Poetry Project (1966–68). Though a poet, Oppenheimer was perhaps better known for his columns in the ""Village Voice"" from 1969 to 1984."
"Oppenheimer was born in Yonkers, New York, attended Cornell University for one year in 1948, spent less than one semester at the University of Chicago, and in 1950 enrolled at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. At Black Mountain, he studied with Paul Goodman and poet Charles Olson, became friends with Fielding Dawson and Ed Dorn, and worked in the school's print shop."
"In his earliest poetry, Oppenheimer shows clearly the influence of William Carlos Williams, but he soon developed his own style. While at Black Mountain, Oppenheimer met and married his first wife, Rena Furlong. He left the school in January 1953 without taking a degree, eventually settling in New York and working in a print shop while continuing to write poetry."
"His first publications were ""The Dancer"" (1951), as ""Jargon"", no. 2, 1951, by The Sad Devil Press/Black Mountain College; ""The Dutiful Son"" (1956) by Jonathan Williams's Jargon Society, reprinted by LeRoi Jones's Totem Press in 1961, ""The Love Bit and Other Poems"" (1962), again with Totem. His satiric Western drama ""The Great American Desert"" was the first play produced by Robert Nichols, directed by Lawrence Kornfeld, who had been with the Living Theatre, at the Judson Poets' Theatre. It opened on November 18, 1961."
"Oppenheimer's poetry has been collected in two volumes: Robert J. Bertholf (editor, introduction), ""Collected Later Poems of Joel Oppenheimer,"" with eleven drawings by John Dobbs, The Poetry Collection, 1997 and ""Names & Local Habitations (Selected Earlier Poems 1951-1972),"" editor Jonathan Williams, The Jargon Society, 1988."
"He also published two nonfiction works, ""The Wrong Season,"" Bobbs-Merrill 1973, about the New York Mets, and ""Marilyn Lives,"" Delilah, 1984, on Marilyn Monroe. ""Drawing from Life"", posthumously published in 1997, gathered 92 columns written for the ""Village Voice"". Library Journal wrote that ""Drawing from Life"" ""emphasizes several favorite themes: baseball, politics, and the role of the changing seasons in our lives""."
"Oppenheimer died at 58 of lung cancer in Henniker, New Hampshire on October 11, 1988."
"""Don’t Touch the Poet: The Life and Times of Joel Oppenheimer,"" by Lyman Gilmore, was published by Talisman Press in 1998."

The estate agent's particulars pointed out that the house is not a listed building, nor is the land a conservation area, meaning that the developer would be somewhat freer of constraints than in many similar sites. One of the St Congar directors referred to the Hanstead Park as a brownfield site, i.e. previously developed land, although it sits within the Green Belt."

= = = Robert Keeton = = =
"Robert Ernest Keeton (December 16, 1919 – July 2, 2007) was an American lawyer, jurist, and legal scholar. As a law professor at Harvard Law School and a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts he was known for his work on torts, insurance law, and practical courtroom tactics. Keeton, with Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia School of Law, played a key role in the advancement of no-fault automobile insurance."
"Keeton was born in Clarksville, Texas. He was the second youngest of five children of William Keeton (who owned a general store) and Ernestine Teuton Keeton. One of his brothers, W. Page Keeton, also became a prominent lawyer and educator. Keeton earned his Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin and his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Texas School of Law. As an undergraduate he became one of three students inducted into the Friar Society, an honor society at the University of Texas. In law school he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the ""Texas Law Review"". Keeton went into private practice with the law firm of Baker & Botts in Houston before joining the United States Navy in World War II. As a lieutenant serving aboard the escort aircraft carrier USS ""Liscome Bay"" (CVE-56) he survived the sinking of the ship on November 24, 1943, by a torpedo from the Japanese submarine I-175. Keeton, clinging to debris for hours, was later pulled from the ocean. He was awarded a Purple Heart. Keeton returned to Baker & Botts in 1945 after the war. He later taught at Southern Methodist University."
"Keeton joined Harvard Law School in 1953, where he would remain until 1979. In 1954, he wrote ""Trial Tactics and Methods"", a book of practical advice on courtroom skills. Keeton later developed a program at Harvard (later used at other law schools) in which experienced trial lawyers taught students. One rule of Keeton's program was to not ask hostile witnesses open-ended questions. In 1956, Keeton received his Doctor of Juridical Science from Harvard. In 1973, he was named the Langdell Professor of Law. Keeton served as associate dean from 1975–1979. In the early 1970s, Keeton worked with University of Virginia School of Law professor Jeffrey O'Connell on a study that contributed to the development of no-fault automobile insurance, later adopted by many states. Under a no-fault system, damages below a certain level are paid by insurance companies, thus avoiding a determination of who was at fault."
"Keeton was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on January 25, 1979, to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to a new seat authorized by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 21, 1979, and received his commission on March 23, 1979. He assumed senior status on February 28, 2003. His service terminated on September 8, 2006, due to retirement. In 1979 Chief Justice Warren Burger appointed him chair of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a body responsible for developing the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure."
"Keeton presided over the 1988-1989 mail fraud and obstruction of justice trial of Lyndon LaRouche and eleven associates, which ended with Keeton declaring a mistrial. He also presided over the 1995 ""Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc."" trial involving the extent of software copyright, a case that later was decided by the Supreme Court. In 1984 Keeton, along with older brother Page as lead author, and professors Dan Dobbs and David Owen, published the 5th edition of ""Prosser and Keeton on Torts"". The book, based on William Prosser's influential ""Prosser on Torts"" (1941), became a foundational text of tort law and has become frequently used as a law textbook and reference work for many law students, lawyers, and jurists."

Its studios are in Metairie and its transmitter is in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana."
"Costello was program director at WRNO-FM from 1976 to 1991 and also hosted the morning show as ""Michael In The Morning"" (M&M). Additionally, he hosted the Sunday night edition of ""The Rock 'N'Roll Hall Of Fame"". He then acquired the former KLEB-FM from the Harold Callais family which was a country music outlet in 1995 and flipped it to its current oldies format. The station is modeled after the original Top 40 AM station WTIX, which was a very successful Top 40 outlet in New Orleans from the 1950s through the 1970s. He increased the transmitted power and moved the antenna from its original location to its present location in 1998 to better serve the New Orleans metro area. Mike Costello also handles GM, PD, and also hosts the morning show. Many of the jingles used on WTIX-FM are the originals used by WTIX/690 in the 1960s and 1970s.

The ""old Scots Bible"" was purportedly taken as punishment against White for his support of the Confederacy."
"White left Romney with his wife and youngest children and traveled to Richmond where he was offered a position in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury within the government of the President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis."
"White died soon after his arrival in Richmond on October 9, 1862. He was interred by Scottish Rite Masons at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Distant relative Reverend Moses D. Hoge of the Southern Presbyterian Church, Bishop Duncan of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and Bishop Minegerode of the Southern Protestant Episcopal Church participated in White's funeral services."
"White's friends and family believed that he ""died of grief"" caused by the loss of his property in Romney and his concern for the safety of the records in the Hampshire County Courthouse during the conflict. In their ""History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present"" (1897), West Virginia historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher said of White:"
"White was married first to Alcinda Louisa Tapscott of Jefferson County, Virginia (now West Virginia), on December 15, 1815. Tapscott was White's cousin through his mother, Arabella Baker White. White and his first wife Alcinda had three children together:"
"White was married for the second time to Frances Ann Streit (March 19, 1811 – November 12, 1866), a daughter of Lutheran Reverend Christian Streit of Winchester, Virginia. Streit and her family were of Swiss descent. White and his second wife, Frances, had ten children (one of which died in infancy):"
"White and his family resided in a large brick mansion located along East Main Street (Northwestern Turnpike) which was later known as ""Liberty Hall"". Due to his upbringing in an affluent family, White was a person of means from a young age, and in his early adulthood he was able to construct a ""large brick mansion"" at this location. His original residence was destroyed by fire in 1857, and White replaced it with a more modest brick edifice where he resided until his departure from Romney in 1861 during the American Civil War. White's home was a ""seat of true old Virginia hospitality"" and it was frequented by all socio-cultural strata of Hampshire County and the greater Valley of Virginia region."
"During the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through Romney, the state superintendent for the project, Angus William McDonald, proposed building the thoroughfare through White's garden in front of his residence. White won an appeal in court which caused the turnpike to be rerouted, thus creating the present curve on East Main Street in front of White's former residence."

"Internationally, Zelalem made appearances for Germany's under-15 team, under-16 team and under-17 team during 2012 and 2013. He became a U.S. citizen on December 2, 2014, and FIFA subsequently approved his eligibility to play for the United States on May 13, 2015."
"Zelalem was born in Berlin, Germany, to Ethiopian parents. He started playing football at the age of five for German club BFC Germania 1888. After this, he changed to Bundesliga side Hertha BSC's academy."
"Zelalem emigrated to the United States with his father in 2006, following his mother's death in the previous year, and settled in Washington, D.C..

After contacting his coaches, Zelalem was flown to London for summer training with the Arsenal youth academy; following the end of this camp, he was offered a permanent place in the Academy. Zelalem started out playing in Arsenal's under-16s squad, before graduating into the under-21s in April 2013.

"On January 24, 2014, Zelalem made his debut with Arsenal's senior squad, coming on as a substitute for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the 71st minute of their 4–0 home FA Cup victory against Coventry City. And later that year, on March 18, 2014, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal to last until 2017. Zelalem soon made his second appearance for Arsenal, coming on as a substitute in the beginning of the second half, in a 4–1 away win against Galatasaray in UEFA Champions League on December 9, 2014."
"On August 24, 2015, Zelalem was loaned to Rangers until January. He made his debut in a 5–0 win over Airdrieonians in the Scottish League Cup, setting up goals for Martyn Waghorn and James Tavernier. He made his league debut in Rangers' Scottish Championship game against Queen of the South which Rangers won 5–1. In January 2016 his loan was extended through to the end of the season."
"He played in 21 Championship matches, helping Rangers clinch the second-tier title, and was an unused substitute as they beat Peterhead 4–0 to win the 2015–16 Scottish Challenge Cup. A week later, Rangers played old firm rivals Celtic in the Scottish Cup semifinal. Zelalem converted a penalty in the shootout to help his club progress to the final, and started in that match, which Rangers lost 3–2 to Hibernian."
"On January 24, 2017, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal and accepted a loan move to Dutch second-tier club VVV-Venlo, lasting until the end of the season. He made nine league appearances as VVV Venlo won the 2016-17 Eerste Divisie title."
"After no first team appearances at Arsenal upon returning in 2017, Zelalem joined MLS club Sporting Kansas City for free on March 10, 2019."
"After Zelalem's option was not picked up by Sporting Kansas City, he signed for fellow Major League Soccer side New York City FC on January 11, 2020."
"Zelalem began training with the United States under-15 side in 2012, but was unable to play in matches at that time due to being classified as a permanent resident, but not yet a U.S. citizen. In May 2014, it was reported that Zelalem's father, Zelalem Wolydes, held U.S. permanent residency and intended to apply for U.S. citizenship. If Wolydes gained U.S. citizenship before his son turned 18, then under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Gedion would also acquire U.S. citizenship and become eligible to represent the United States internationally. He would also be able to retain his German passport which allows him to live and work in the European Union without restrictions."

= = = Yerrapalli Formation = = =
"The Yerrapalli Formation is a Triassic rock formation consisting primarily of mudstones that outcrops in the Pranhita–Godavari Basin in southeastern India. The Yerrapalli Formation preserves fossils of freshwater and terrestrial vertebrates as well as trace fossils of invertebrates. The tetrapod fauna includes temnospondyl amphibians, archosauromorph reptiles, and dicynodonts."
Most of the Yerrapalli Formation consists of red mudstones. The mudstones were deposited across a floodplain during the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic. Smaller lenses of calcareous sandstone represent ephemeral streams that branched off from the larger channels that were the source of the floodplain sediments. The climate of the region during the time is thought to have been monsoonal with both wet and dry seasons.
"The Yerrapalli Formation overlies the Kamthi Formation, underlies the Bhimaram Formation, and is conformable with both formations. Two members of the Yerrapalli Formation have been recognized; a lower member consisting of layers of red and purple clay with lenses of pale green clay and an upper member consisting of alternating layers of clay and fine-grained sandstone."
"The paleobiota of the Yerrapalli Formation is similar to that of the overlying Maleri Formation, which also preserves fossils of temnospondyls and archosauromorphs. The main difference between the Yerrapalli and the Maleri faunae is the presence of dicynodonts in the former. The discovery of dicynodont fossils in the Pranhita-Godavari Basin in 1964 was one of the earliest indications that the Yerrapalli Formation represented a distinct paleofauna. Before this discovery, Yerrapalli strata were grouped within the Maleri Formation. The dicynodonts of the Yerrapalli Formation are similar to those of the Ntavere Formation in Zambia, which also dates back to the Anisian. During the Middle Triassic, what is now India and southern Africa formed one continuous landmass as part of the supercontinent Gondwana."

= = = Affine gauge theory = = =
"Affine gauge theory is classical gauge theory where gauge fields are affine connections on the tangent bundle over a smooth manifold formula_1. For instance, these are gauge theory of dislocations in continuous media when formula_2, the generalization of metric-affine gravitation theory when formula_1 is a world manifold and, in particular, gauge theory of the fifth force."
"Being a vector bundle, the tangent bundle formula_4 of an formula_5-dimensional manifold formula_1 admits a natural structure of an affine bundle formula_7, called the ""affine tangent bundle"", possessing bundle atlases with affine transition functions. It is associated to a principal bundle formula_8 of affine frames in tangent space over formula_1, whose structure group is a general affine group formula_10."
"The tangent bundle formula_4 is associated to a principal linear frame bundle formula_12, whose structure group is a general linear group formula_13. This is a subgroup of formula_10 so that the latter is a semidirect product of formula_13 and a group formula_16 of translations."
There is the canonical imbedding of formula_12 to formula_8 onto a reduced principal subbundle which corresponds to the canonical structure of a vector bundle formula_4 as the affine one.
Given linear bundle coordinates
"on the tangent bundle formula_4, the affine tangent bundle can be provided with affine bundle coordinates"
"and, in particular, with the linear coordinates (1)."
