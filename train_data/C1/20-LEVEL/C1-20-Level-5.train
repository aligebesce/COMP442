I don't know!
"To say I haven't paid, but I have!"
"Well no you'll not get, cos I'll take this in  and say, look, can you just transfer two pound off Linda's onto this."
"I mean, all it, all it means"
Off of Tracey's onto there.
Yeah.
All it means to me is one owes two pound more than other one.
"No, no it"
but if
"it'd be, it'd be understandable if we were identical twins but we're not!"
But we're not!
Yeah but I mean I don't
"I just  you're just names to me, do you know what I, I mean, I still don't know who, which one you are, now  even though you said."
Who are you?

Yes.
Have you got Tracey's middle name on there?
"That, three point nought one, minus"
"Right, so it's"
"three point nought one squared,"
Minus the two point nine  minus
Erm
What was the difference in the Xs?
Point nought one.
Point nought two.
Point nought two sorry .
"So we put that underneath, on the bottom half of the fraction."
Okay.
"That's, that's   Now when you've got an A squared minus B squared, you can factorize that I mean you could just do that on your calculator, and do it in one go, but it's quite easy to do it as  three point O one."
"A plus B, times A minus B. Okay?"
So three point nought one plus two point nine is point nought two.
"No sorry, is five point six."
Is six.
And the
the top is six.
Six.
Times.
"Times three point nought one minus  two point nine nine , which is point two."
Equals
Six point oh two.

Right.
They do cancel out.
Six.

Caernarvon's on the Snowdonia map.
Ah.
An O S one to fifty thousand  and that's what I thought I'd picked up this morning to take with me  but when I looked it was Chester and Wrexham so it didn't do me much good.

"drakes cha er chasing one duck  er, just past the baths along the promenade."
"And then we sat  at the far side of the Old Gate bridge  and er  an old lady came along  and said, and she was counting them  but she said, just look at that thing, she counted seven  although, in actual fact, by then  th these dra the seven drakes had stopped cha chasing the duck and they were all sitting down."
"And a there was a domestic one  in each group  there was one along near the baths in among the thirteen, and there was another white one  near Old Gate Bridge."
"I gave my top group your algebra homework today  they said  Pau is this Paul's homework, I said yes  that's not fair  I said why isn't it fair?"
"Well it's too hard, I said how do you know it's too hard?"
And they all did it  apart from Chris   who said  urgh she always works us too hard!
"Apart from Christopher  most of them managed it Paul  especially Richard  he's really clever  I know who that is, Lady Di."
Shut up Ruthy!
Is this one Lady Di?
Is Mum not entering it then?
Yeah.
Course I am.
Then why are you looking?
I'm not looking Paul  don't tar everybody with the same brush.
What?
"Pardon, don't tar everybody with the same brush."
Ooh pardon me!
What's that mean?
That means just cos you're likely to cheat don't assume that everyone else does.
Then why did you say Princess Diana?
I know that's Princess Diana.
Cos I see him cut it out.
So you were looking in the first place!
No you were looking at the Mal Vicinty
Vicinty
Spell Vicinty
"I don't  know, about it ."
Will I have to pull up any of those caps heads before your Mum comes round?
No.
We were just hanging around talking today and the children done Christmas card competition an wi some really and me and
Ah!
Moira
!
"and and Joanne Joe, say who could judge this, this is for our competition we'll say Heidi  coming, no, is anybody else in it, no  er Sarah'll come in cos she doesn't know, right?"
"So John came up and we said er we were wondering who could judge th Christmas card competition and he was saying oh I don't know,and then th the P T A chairman came up  erm we said oh perhaps you should judge the Christmas card competition  erm  and she said  well Melissa  is judging it  and we said Pardon!"
`` None in the world . ''
She looked at him through and through a moment longer .
"Then , seeming satisfied with her scrutiny , she picked up her pail ."
"`` Come down to the spring with me , '' she said ."
"As soon as they were out of sight of the house , Emily began abruptly ."
"`` If you do n't know why Lynde is acting so , I ca n't tell you , for I do n't know either ."
I do n't even know if she is angry .
I only thought perhaps she was -- that you had done or said something to vex her -- plaguing her to go to church maybe .
"But if you did n't , it may not be anger at all ."
I do n't understand that girl .
She 's been different ever since her mother died .
She used to tell me everything before that .
You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong .
But maybe I can tell you something .
Did you write her a letter a fortnight ago ? ''
`` A letter ?
No . ''
"`` Well , she got one then ."
I thought it came from you -- I did n't know who else would be writing to her .
A boy brought it and gave it to her at the door .
She 's been acting strange ever since .
She cries at night -- something Lynde never did before except when her mother died .
And in daytime she roams the shore and woods like one possessed .
"You must find out what was in that letter , Mr. Douglas . ''"
`` Have you any idea who the boy was ? ''
"Alan asked , feeling somewhat relieved ."
"The mystery was clearing up , he thought ."
No doubt it was the old story of some cowardly anonymous letter .
His thoughts flew involuntarily to Isabel King .
Emily shook her head .
`` No .
He was just a half-grown fellow with reddish hair and he limped a little . ''
gasped Appleyard .
`` I be done with Old England .
Pluck it out ! ''
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` come hither , and pull me a good pull upon the arrow ."
"He would fain pass , the poor sinner . ''"
"Dick laid down his cross-bow , and pulling hard upon the arrow , drew it forth ."
"A gush of blood followed ; the old archer scrambled half upon his feet , called once upon the name of God , and then fell dead ."
"Hatch , upon his knees among the cabbages , prayed fervently for the welfare of the passing spirit ."
"But even as he prayed , it was plain that his mind was still divided , and he kept ever an eye upon the corner of the wood from which the shot had come ."
"When he had done , he got to his feet again , drew off one of his mailed gauntlets , and wiped his pale face , which was all wet with terror ."
"`` Ay , '' he said , `` it 'll be my turn next . ''"
"`` Who hath done this , Bennet ? ''"
"Richard asked , still holding the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Nay , the saints know , '' said Hatch ."
"`` Here are a good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of house and holding , he and I ."
"He has paid his shot , poor shrew , nor will it be long , mayhap , ere I pay mine ."
Sir Daniel driveth over-hard . ''
"`` This is a strange shaft , '' said the lad , looking at the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Ay , by my faith ! ''"
cried Bennet .
"`` Black , and black-feathered ."
"Here is an ill-favoured shaft , by my sooth !"
"for black , they say , bodes burial ."
And here be words written .
Wipe the blood away .
What read ye ? '' '' '
"Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All , ' '' read Shelton ."
`` What should this betoken ? ''
"`` Nay , I like it not , '' returned the retainer , shaking his head ."
`` John Amend-All !
Here is a rogue 's name for those that be up in the world !
But why stand we here to make a mark ?
"Here 's this squire and doctor with a map and such -- I do n't know where it is , do I ?"
"No more do you , says you ."
"Well then , I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help us to get it aboard , by the powers ."
Then we 'll see .
"If I was sure of you all , sons of double Dutchmen , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck . ''"
"`` Why , we 're all seamen aboard here , I should think , '' said the lad Dick ."
"`` We 're all forecastle hands , you mean , '' snapped Silver ."
"`` We can steer a course , but who 's to set one ?"
"That 's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last ."
"If I had my way , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least ; then we 'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day ."
But I know the sort you are .
"I 'll finish with 'em at the island , as soon 's the blunt 's on board , and a pity it is ."
But you 're never happy till you 're drunk .
"Split my sides , I 've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you ! ''"
"`` Easy all , Long John , '' cried Israel ."
`` Who 's a-crossin ' of you ? ''
"`` Why , how many tall ships , think ye , now , have I seen laid aboard ?"
And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock ? ''
cried Silver .
`` And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry .
You hear me ?
"I seen a thing or two at sea , I have ."
"If you would on ' y lay your course , and a p ` int to windward , you would ride in carriages , you would ."
But not you !
I know you .
"You 'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang . ''"
"`` Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling , John ; but there 's others as could hand and steer as well as you , '' said Israel ."
"`` They liked a bit o ' fun , they did ."
"They was n't so high and dry , nohow , but took their fling , like jolly companions every one . ''"
`` So ? ''
says Silver .
"`` Well , and where are they now ?"
"`` I will eat nothing at the hands that slew my kinsman , '' she replied ."
"`` Dear madam , '' Dick cried , `` I swear to you upon the rood I touched him not . ''"
"`` Swear to me that he still lives , '' she returned ."
"`` I will not palter with you , '' answered Dick ."
`` Pity bids me to wound you .
In my heart I do believe him dead . ''
`` And ye ask me to eat ! ''
she cried .
"`` Ay , and they call you ` sir ! '"
Y ' have won your spurs by my good kinsman 's murder .
"And had I not been fool and traitor both , and saved you in your enemy 's house , ye should have died the death , and he -- he that was worth twelve of you -- were living . ''"
"`` I did but my man 's best , even as your kinsman did upon the other party , '' answered Dick ."
`` Were he still living -- as I vow to Heaven I wish it !
"-- he would praise , not blame me . ''"
"`` Sir Daniel hath told me , '' she replied ."
`` He marked you at the barricade .
"Upon you , he saith , their party foundered ; it was you that won the battle ."
"Well , then , it was you that killed my good Lord Risingham , as sure as though ye had strangled him ."
And ye would have me eat with you -- and your hands not washed from killing ?
But Sir Daniel hath sworn your downfall .
He 't is that will avenge me ! ''
The unfortunate Dick was plunged in gloom .
"Old Arblaster returned upon his mind , and he groaned aloud ."
`` Do ye hold me so guilty ? ''
he said ; `` you that defended me -- you that are Joanna 's friend ? ''
`` What made ye in the battle ? ''
she retorted .
"`` Y ' are of no party ; y ' are but a lad -- but legs and body , without government of wit or counsel !"
Wherefore did ye fight ?
"For the love of hurt , pardy ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` I know not ."
"But as the realm of England goes , if that a poor gentleman fight not upon the one side , perforce he must fight upon the other ."
"cried John , but soon he found he had not ."
"Not one of them could fly an inch , though even Michael was in words of two syllables , and Peter did not know A from Z. Of course Peter had been trifling with them , for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him ."
"Fortunately , as we have mentioned , one of his hands was messy with it , and he blew some on each of them , with the most superb results ."
"` Now just wriggle your shoulders this way , ' he said , ` and let go . '"
"They were all on their beds , and gallant Michael let go first ."
"He did not quite mean to let go , but he did it , and immediately he was borne across the room . '"
I flewed ! '
he screamed while still in mid-air .
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom .
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Oh , ripping ! '"
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
"They were not nearly so elegant as Peter , they could not help kicking a little , but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling , and there is almost nothing so delicious as that ."
"Peter gave Wendy a hand at first , but had to desist , Tink was so indignant ."
"Up and down they went , and round and round ."
Heavenly was Wendy 's word . '
"I say , ' cried John , ` why should n't we all go out ! '"
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them .
Michael was ready : he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles .
But Wendy hesitated .
` Mermaids ! '
said Peter again .
` Oo ! '
` And there are pirates . '
"` Pirates , ' cried John , seizing his Sunday hat , ` let us go at once . '"
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27 .
"They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window ; and , yes , it was still shut , but the room was ablaze with light , and most heart-gripping sight of all , they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round , not on the floor but in the air ."
"Not three figures , four !"
In a tremble they opened the street door .
"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs , but Mrs. Darling signed to him to go softly ."
Uncle Dick wrote to me to return home at once and pay my court to the lady ; I protested .
"He wrote again -- a letter , short and the reverse of sweet ."
If I refused to do my best to win Miss Mannering he would disown me -- never speak to me again -- cut me off with a quarter .
"Uncle always means what he says -- that is one of our family traits , you understand ."
"I spent some miserable , undecided days ."
"It was not the threat of disinheritance that worried me , although when you have been brought up to regard yourself as a prospective millionaire it is rather difficult to adjust your vision to a pauper focus ."
But it was the thought of alienating Uncle Dick .
"I love the dear , determined old chap like a father ."
But last night my guardian angel was with me and I decided to remain my own man .
"So I wrote to Uncle Dick , respectfully but firmly declining to become a candidate for Miss Mannering 's hand . ''"
"`` But you have never seen her , '' said Mollie ."
`` She may be -- almost -- charming . '' ''
"` If she be not fair to me , what care I how fair she be ? ' ''"
quoted Murray .
"`` As you say , she may be -- almost charming ; but she is not Eve ."
"She is merely one of a million other women , as far as I am concerned ."
Do n't let 's talk of her .
Let us talk only of ourselves -- there is nothing else that is half so interesting . ''
`` And will your uncle really cast you off ? ''
asked Mollie .
`` Not a doubt of it . ''
`` What will you do ? ''
"`` Work , dear Eve ."
My carefully acquired laziness must be thrown to the winds and I shall work .
That is the rule outside of Eden .
Do n't worry .
I 've painted pictures that have actually been sold .
I 'll make a living for us somehow . ''
`` Us ? ''
`` Of course .
You are engaged to me . ''
"`` I am not , '' said Mollie indignantly ."
"`` I want none of your money , '' said I , `` but what you owe my father ."
"I 'll get you one glass , and no more . ''"
"When I brought it to him , he seized it greedily and drank it out ."
"`` Aye , aye , '' said he , `` that 's some better , sure enough ."
"And now , matey , did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth ? ''"
"`` A week at least , '' said I. `` Thunder ! ''"
he cried .
`` A week !
I ca n't do that ; they 'd have the black spot on me by then .
"The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment ; lubbers as could n't keep what they got , and want to nail what is another 's ."
"Is that seamanly behaviour , now , I want to know ?"
But I 'm a saving soul .
"I never wasted good money of mine , nor lost it neither ; and I 'll trick 'em again ."
I 'm not afraid on 'em .
"I 'll shake out another reef , matey , and daddle 'em again . ''"
"As he was thus speaking , he had risen from bed with great difficulty , holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out , and moving his legs like so much dead weight ."
"His words , spirited as they were in meaning , contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered ."
He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge .
"`` That doctor 's done me , '' he murmured ."
`` My ears is singing .
Lay me back . ''
"Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place , where he lay for a while silent ."
"`` Jim , '' he said at length , `` you saw that seafaring man today ? ''"
`` Black Dog ? ''
I asked .
`` Ah !
"Black Dog , '' says he ."
`` HE 'S a bad un ; but there 's worse that put him on .
"Now , if I ca n't get away nohow , and they tip me the black spot , mind you , it 's my old sea-chest they 're after ; you get on a horse -- you can , ca n't you ?"
"Well , then , you get on a horse , and go to -- well , yes , I will !"
"-- to that eternal doctor swab , and tell him to pipe all hands -- magistrates and sich -- and he 'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow -- all old Flint 's crew , man and boy , all on 'em that 's left ."
"I was first mate , I was , old Flint 's first mate , and I 'm the on ' y one as knows the place ."
Then the talk drifted around to Edith 's affairs .
"She was engaged to a certain Sidney Keith , who was a professor in some college ."
"`` I do n't expect to see much of Sidney this summer , '' said Edith ."
`` He 's writing another book .
He is so terribly addicted to literature . ''
"`` How lovely , '' sighed Katherine , who had aspirations in that line herself ."
`` If only Ned were like him I should be perfectly happy .
But Ned is so prosaic .
"He does n't care a rap for poetry , and he laughs when I enthuse ."
It makes him quite furious when I talk of taking up writing seriously .
He says women writers are an abomination on the face of the earth .
Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous ? ''
"`` He is very handsome , though , '' said Edith , with a glance at his photograph on Katherine 's dressing table ."
`` And that is what Sid is not .
"He is rather distinguished looking , but as plain as he can possibly be . ''"
Edith sighed .
She had a weakness for handsome men and thought it rather hard that fate should have allotted her so plain a lover .
"`` He has lovely eyes , '' said Katherine comfortingly , `` and handsome men are always vain ."
Even Ned is .
I have to snub him regularly .
But I think you 'll like him . ''
Edith thought so too when Ned Ellison appeared that night .
"He was a handsome off-handed young fellow , who seemed to admire Katherine immensely , and be a little afraid of her into the bargain ."
"`` Edith will try to make Riverton pleasant for you while I am away , '' she told him in their good-bye chat ."
"`` She is a dear girl -- you 'll like her , I know ."
"It 's really too bad I have to go away now , but it ca n't be helped . ''"
"`` I shall be awfully lonesome , '' grumbled Ned ."
"`` Do n't you forget to write regularly , Kitty . ''"
"`` Of course I 'll write , but for pity 's sake , Ned , do n't call me Kitty ."
It sounds so childish .
"Well , bye-bye , dear boy ."
I 'll be back in two months and then we 'll have a lovely time . ''
"The boy started , stopped and looked out towards Island Rock ."
The next moment he hailed me .
"It was Ernest 's voice , and it was Laddie who was barking beside him ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted wildly , `` run for help -- quick !"
quick !
The tide will be over the rock in half an hour !
"Hurry , or you will be too late ! ''"
"Instead of starting off at full speed , as I expected him to do , Ernest stood still for a moment , and then began to pick his steps down a narrow path over the cliff , followed by Laddie ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted frantically , `` what are you doing ?"
Why do n't you go for help ? ''
Ernest had by this time reached a narrow ledge of rock just above the water-line .
I noticed that he was carrying something over his arm .
"`` It would take too long , '' he shouted ."
"`` By the time I got to the Cove and a boat could row back here , you 'd be drowned ."
Laddie and I will save you .
Is there anything there you can tie a rope to ?
I 've a coil of rope here that I think will be long enough to reach you .
I 've been down to the Cove and Alec Martin sent it up to your uncle . ''
"I looked about me ; a smooth , round hole had been worn clean through a thin part of the apex of the rock ."
`` I could fasten the rope if I had it ! ''
I called .
`` But how can you get it to me ? ''
For answer Ernest tied a bit of driftwood to the rope and put it into Laddie 's mouth .
The next minute the dog was swimming out to me .
As soon as he came close I caught the rope .
"It was just long enough to stretch from shore to rock , allowing for a couple of hitches which Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge ."
"I tied my camera case on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket , then I slipped into the water and , holding to the rope , went hand over hand to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me ."
"Ernest held on to the shoreward end of the rope like grim death , a task that was no light one for his small arms ."
"When I finally scrambled up beside him , his face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf ."
"`` Ern , you are a brick ! ''"
I exclaimed .
`` You 've saved my life ! ''
"Do n't you tell me I 'm like that old gossip , '' said Mr. Harrison irritably ."
`` I 'm not ... not a bit .
What have you got in that box ? ''
"`` A cake , '' said Anne archly ."
In her relief at Mr. Harrison 's unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward feather-light .
`` I brought it over for you ... I thought perhaps you did n't have cake very often . ''
"`` I do n't , that 's a fact , and I 'm mighty fond of it , too ."
I 'm much obliged to you .
It looks good on top .
I hope it 's good all the way through . ''
"`` It is , '' said Anne , gaily confident ."
"`` I have made cakes in my time that were NOT , as Mrs. Allan could tell you , but this one is all right ."
"I made it for the Improvement Society , but I can make another for them . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll tell you what , miss , you must help me eat it ."
I 'll put the kettle on and we 'll have a cup of tea .
How will that do ? ''
`` Will you let me make the tea ? ''
said Anne dubiously .
Mr. Harrison chuckled .
`` I see you have n't much confidence in my ability to make tea .
You 're wrong ... I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank .
But go ahead yourself .
"Fortunately it rained last Sunday , so there 's plenty of clean dishes . ''"
Anne hopped briskly up and went to work .
She washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep .
"Then she swept the stove and set the table , bringing the dishes out of the pantry ."
"The state of that pantry horrified Anne , but she wisely said nothing ."
Mr. Harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches .
Anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth .
"Soon the tea was ready and Anne found herself sitting opposite Mr. Harrison at his own table , pouring his tea for him , and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans ."
She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses .
"Mr. Harrison had brought Ginger back , averring that the poor bird would be lonesome ; and Anne , feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything , offered him a walnut ."
"`` Ai n't you gone yet , Bert ? ''"
she said sharply .
`` What in the world are you hanging round for ? ''
"`` It 's early yet , '' said Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I thought maybe George Fraser 'd be along and I 'd get a lift as far as the store . ''
"`` Well , I never saw such laziness !"
No wonder old Sampson wo n't keep you longer than the holidays if you 're no smarter than that .
"Goodness , if I do n't settle that boy ! ''"
-- as the sound of fretful crying came from the kitchen behind her .
`` What is wrong with William John ? ''
asked Bertie .
"`` Why , he wants to go out coasting with those Robinson boys , but he ca n't ."
He has n't got any mittens and he would catch his death of cold again . ''
Her voice seemed to imply that William John had died of cold several times already .
"Bertie looked soberly down at his old , well-darned mittens ."
"It was very cold , and he would have a great many errands to run ."
"He shivered , and looked up at his aunt 's hard face as she stood wiping her dish-pan with a grim frown which boded no good to the discontented William John ."
Then he suddenly pulled off his mittens and held them out .
`` Here -- he can have mine .
I 'll get on without them well enough . ''
`` Nonsense ! ''
"said Mrs. Ross , but less unkindly ."
`` The fingers would freeze off you .
Do n't be a goose . ''
"`` It 's all right , '' persisted Bertie ."
`` I do n't need them -- much .
And William John does n't hardly ever get out . ''
"He thrust them into her hand and ran quickly down the street , as though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in spite of himself ."
He had to stop a great many times that day to breathe on his purple hands .
"Still , he did not regret having lent his mittens to William John -- poor , pale , sickly little William John , who had so few pleasures ."
It was sunset when Bertie laid an armful of parcels down on the steps of Doctor Forbes 's handsome house .
"His back was turned towards the big bay window at one side , and he was busy trying to warm his hands , so he did not see the two small faces looking at him through the frosty panes ."
"Wo n't you be frank with me , dear ?"
Do you honestly think you can never learn to love me ? ''
"`` It is not that , '' said Lynde in a hard , unnatural voice ."
`` I am married already . ''
"Alan stared at her , not in the least comprehending the meaning of her words ."
"Everything -- pain , hope , fear , passion -- had slipped away from him for a moment , as if he had been stunned by a physical blow ."
He could not have heard aright .
`` Married ? ''
he said dully .
"`` Lynde , you can not mean it ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ."
I was married three years ago . ''
`` Why was I not told this ? ''
"Alan 's voice was stern , although he did not mean it to be so , and she shrank and shivered ."
Then she began in a low monotonous tone from which all feeling of any sort seemed to have utterly faded .
"`` Three years ago Mother was very ill -- so ill that any shock would kill her , so the doctor Father brought from the lake told us ."
A man -- a young sea captain -- came here to see Father .
His name was Frank Harmon and he had known Father well in the past .
They had sailed together .
Father seemed to be afraid of him -- I had never seen him afraid of anybody before .
"I could not think much about anybody except Mother then , but I knew I did not quite like Captain Harmon , although he was very polite to me and I suppose might have been called handsome ."
One day Father came to me and told me I must marry Captain Harmon .
I laughed at the idea at first but when I looked at Father 's face I did not laugh .
It was all white and drawn .
He implored me to marry Captain Harmon .
He said if I did not it would mean shame and disgrace for us all -- that Captain Harmon had some hold on him and would tell what he knew if I did not marry him .
I do n't know what it was but it must have been something dreadful .
And he said it would kill Mother .
"I knew it would , and that was what drove me to consent at last ."
"Oh , I ca n't tell you what I suffered ."
I was only seventeen and there was nobody to advise me .
One day Father and Captain Harmon and I went down the lake to Crosse Harbour and we were married there .
"I have some myself , though you might never suspect it ."
But anyhow I ai n't going to give anything to that carpet .
"Folks are everlasting begging for money here , it seems to me ."
How 's your project of painting the hall coming on ? ''
`` Splendidly .
We had a meeting of the A.V.I.S. last Friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too .
"MOST people gave very liberally , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"Anne was a sweet-souled lass , but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required ."
`` What color are you going to have it ? ''
`` We have decided on a very pretty green .
"The roof will be dark red , of course ."
Mr. Roger Pye is going to get the paint in town today . ''
`` Who 's got the job ? ''
`` Mr. Joshua Pye of Carmody .
He has nearly finished the shingling .
"We had to give him the contract , for every one of the Pyes ... and there are four families , you know ... said they would n't give a cent unless Joshua got it ."
"They had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose , although some people think we should n't have given in to the Pyes ."
Mrs. Lynde says they try to run everything . ''
`` The main question is will this Joshua do his work well .
If he does I do n't see that it matters whether his name is Pye or Pudding . ''
"`` He has the reputation of being a good workman , though they say he 's a very peculiar man ."
He hardly ever talks . ''
"`` He 's peculiar enough all right then , '' said Mr. Harrison drily ."
"`` Or at least , folks here will call him so ."
I never was much of a talker till I came to Avonlea and then I had to begin in self-defense or Mrs. Lynde would have said I was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language .
"You 're not going yet , Anne ? ''"
`` I must .
I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening .
"Besides , Davy is probably breaking Marilla 's heart with some new mischief by this time ."
"This morning the first thing he said was , ` Where does the dark go , Anne ?"
I want to know . '
I told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it did n't ... that it went down the well .
`` One ! ''
-LRB- Slightly had begun to count . -RRB-
"None too soon , Peter , every inch of him on tiptoe , vanished into the cabin ; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round ."
"They could hear each other 's distressed breathing now , which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed ."
"`` It 's gone , captain , '' Smee said , wiping off his spectacles ."
`` All 's still again . ''
"Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff , and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick ."
"There was not a sound , and he drew himself up firmly to his full height ."
`` Then here 's to Johnny Plank ! ''
"he cried brazenly , hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend ."
"He broke into the villainous ditty : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the frisky plank , You walks along it so , Till it goes down and you goes down To Davy Jones below ! ''"
"To terrorize the prisoners the more , though with a certain loss of dignity , he danced along an imaginary plank , grimacing at them as he sang ; and when he finished he cried , `` Do you want a touch of the cat -LSB- o ' nine tails -RSB- before you walk the plank ? ''"
At that they fell on their knees .
"`` No , no ! ''"
they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled .
"`` Fetch the cat , Jukes , '' said Hook ; `` it 's in the cabin . ''"
The cabin !
Peter was in the cabin !
The children gazed at each other .
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Jukes blithely , and he strode into the cabin ."
"They followed him with their eyes ; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song , his dogs joining in with him : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the scratching cat , Its tails are nine , you know , And when they 're writ upon your back -- '' What was the last line will never be known , for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin ."
"It wailed through the ship , and died away ."
"Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys , but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech ."
`` What was that ? ''
cried Hook .
"`` Two , '' said Slightly solemnly ."
The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin .
"He tottered out , haggard ."
"`` What 's the matter with Bill Jukes , you dog ? ''"
"hissed Hook , towering over him ."
"`` The matter wi ' him is he 's dead , stabbed , '' replied Cecco in a hollow voice ."
`` Bill Jukes dead ! ''
"` What fun , ' he said doubtfully , and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned ."
"` Nana , good dog , ' he said , patting her , ' I have put a little milk into your bowl , Nana . '"
"Nana wagged her tail , ran to the medicine , and began lapping it ."
"Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look , not an angry look : she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs , and crept into her kennel ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself , but he would not give in ."
In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl . '
"O George , ' she said , ` it 's your medicine ! '"
"` It was only a joke , ' he roared , while she comforted her boys , and Wendy hugged Nana ."
"` Much good , ' he said bitterly , ` my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house . '"
And still Wendy hugged Nana .
"` That 's right , ' he shouted ."
` Coddle her !
Nobody coddles me .
Oh dear no !
"I am only the breadwinner , why should I be coddled , why , why , why ! '"
"` George , ' Mrs. Darling entreated him , ` not so loud ; the servants will hear you . '"
Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants .
"` Let them , ' he answered recklessly ."
` Bring in the whole world .
But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer . '
"The children wept , and Nana ran to him beseechingly , but he waved her back ."
He felt he was a strong man again .
"` In vain , in vain , ' he cried ; ` the proper place for you is the yard , and there you go to be tied up this instant . '"
"` George , George , ' Mrs. Darling whispered , ` remember what I told you about that boy . '"
"Alas , he would not listen ."
"He was determined to show who was master in that house , and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel , he lured her out of it with honeyed words , and seizing her roughly , dragged her from the nursery ."
"He was ashamed of himself , and yet he did it ."
"It was all owing to his too affectionate nature , which craved for admiration ."
"When he had tied her up in the back-yard , the wretched father went and sat in the passage , with his knuckles to his eyes ."
In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights .
"They could hear Nana barking , and John whimpered , ` It is because he is chaining her up in the yard , ' but Wendy was wiser ."
"` That is not Nana 's unhappy bark , ' she said , little guessing what was about to happen ; ` that is her bark when she smells danger . '"
"`` For , by my sooth , y ' are here and I do mightily suspect your honesty ."
"If ye would save your neck , write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound . ''"
"`` For twenty pound , my good lord ! ''"
cried Condall .
`` Here is midsummer madness !
My whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings . ''
"`` Condall or Tyndal , '' returned Sir Daniel , grinning , `` I will run my peril of that loss ."
"Write me down twenty , and when I have recovered all I may , I will be good lord to you , and pardon you the rest . ''"
`` Alas !
"my good lord , it may not be ; I have no skill to write , '' said Condall ."
`` Well-a-day ! ''
returned the knight .
"`` Here , then , is no remedy ."
"Yet I would fain have spared you , Tyndal , had my conscience suffered ."
"Selden , take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm , and hang me him tenderly by the neck , where I may see him at my riding ."
"Fare ye well , good Master Condall , dear Master Tyndal ; y ' are post-haste for Paradise ; fare ye then well ! ''"
"`` Nay , my right pleasant lord , '' replied Condall , forcing an obsequious smile , `` an ye be so masterful , as doth right well become you , I will even , with all my poor skill , do your good bidding . ''"
"`` Friend , '' quoth Sir Daniel , `` ye will now write two score ."
Go to !
y ' are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings .
"Selden , see him write me this in good form , and have it duly witnessed . ''"
"And Sir Daniel , who was a very merry knight , none merrier in England , took a drink of his mulled ale , and lay back , smiling ."
"Meanwhile , the boy upon the floor began to stir , and presently sat up and looked about him with a scare ."
"`` Hither , '' said Sir Daniel ; and as the other rose at his command and came slowly towards him , he leaned back and laughed outright ."
`` By the rood ! ''
"he cried , `` a sturdy boy ! ''"
"The lad flushed crimson with anger , and darted a look of hate out of his dark eyes ."
"Now that he was on his legs , it was more difficult to make certain of his age ."
"His face looked somewhat older in expression , but it was as smooth as a young child 's ; and in bone and body he was unusually slender , and somewhat awkward of gait ."
"`` Ye have called me , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` Was it to laugh at my poor plight ? ''
"`` Nay , now , let laugh , '' said the knight ."
`` Five . ''
How Slightly longed to say it .
"He wetted his lips to be ready , but Hook came staggering out , without his lantern ."
"`` Something blew out the light , '' he said a little unsteadily ."
`` Something ! ''
echoed Mullins .
`` What of Cecco ? ''
demanded Noodler .
"`` He 's as dead as Jukes , '' said Hook shortly ."
"His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably , and the mutinous sounds again broke forth ."
"All pirates are superstitious , and Cookson cried , `` They do say the surest sign a ship 's accurst is when there 's one on board more than can be accounted for . ''"
"`` I 've heard , '' muttered Mullins , `` he always boards the pirate craft last ."
"Had he a tail , captain ? ''"
"`` They say , '' said another , looking viciously at Hook , `` that when he comes it 's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard . ''"
"`` Had he a hook , captain ? ''"
"asked Cookson insolently ; and one after another took up the cry , `` The ship 's doomed ! ''"
At this the children could not resist raising a cheer .
"Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners , but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again ."
"`` Lads , '' he cried to his crew , `` now here 's a notion ."
Open the cabin door and drive them in .
Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives .
"If they kill him , we 're so much the better ; if he kills them , we 're none the worse . ''"
"For the last time his dogs admired Hook , and devotedly they did his bidding ."
"The boys , pretending to struggle , were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them ."
"`` Now , listen ! ''"
"cried Hook , and all listened ."
But not one dared to face the door .
"Yes , one , Wendy , who all this time had been bound to the mast ."
"It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching , it was for the reappearance of Peter ."
She had not long to wait .
"In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search : the key that would free the children of their manacles , and now they all stole forth , armed with such weapons as they could find ."
"First signing them to hide , Peter cut Wendy 's bonds , and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together ; but one thing barred the way , an oath , `` Hook or me this time . ''"
"He rushed to Anne , hurled himself into her lap , flung his arms around her neck , and burst into tears ."
"`` I did n't know it was wrong to tell whoppers , '' he sobbed ."
`` How did you expect me to know it was wrong ?
"All Mr. Sprott 's children told them REGULAR every day , and cross their hearts too ."
"I s ` pose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here I 've been trying awful hard to be as good as him , but now I s ` pose you 'll never love me again ."
But I think you might have told me it was wrong .
"I 'm awful sorry I 've made you cry , Anne , and I 'll never tell a whopper again . ''"
Davy buried his face in Anne 's shoulder and cried stormily .
"Anne , in a sudden glad flash of understanding , held him tight and looked over his curly thatch at Marilla ."
"`` He did n't know it was wrong to tell falsehoods , Marilla ."
I think we must forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never to say what is n't true again . ''
"`` I never will , now that I know it 's bad , '' asseverated Davy between sobs ."
"`` If you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can ... '' Davy groped mentally for a suitable penance ... `` you can skin me alive , Anne . ''"
"`` Do n't say ` whopper , ' Davy ... say ` falsehood , ' '' said the schoolma'am ."
`` Why ? ''
"queried Davy , settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained , investigating face ."
`` Why ai n't whopper as good as falsehood ?
I want to know .
It 's just as big a word . ''
`` It 's slang ; and it 's wrong for little boys to use slang . ''
"`` There 's an awful lot of things it 's wrong to do , '' said Davy with a sigh ."
`` I never s ` posed there was so many .
"I 'm sorry it 's wrong to tell whop ... falsehoods , 'cause it 's awful handy , but since it is I 'm never going to tell any more ."
What are you going to do to me for telling them this time ?
I want to know . ''
Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla .
"`` I do n't want to be too hard on the child , '' said Marilla ."
"`` I daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies , and those Sprott children were no fit companions for him ."
Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you could n't expect a six-year-old child to know things like that by instinct .
I suppose we 'll just have to assume he does n't know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning .
"But he 'll have to be punished for shutting Dora up , and I ca n't think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and we 've done that so often ."
"Ca n't you suggest something else , Anne ?"
"`` And now , Livesey , '' said the squire in the same breath ."
"`` One at a time , one at a time , '' laughed Dr. Livesey ."
"`` You have heard of this Flint , I suppose ? ''"
`` Heard of him ! ''
cried the squire .
"`` Heard of him , you say !"
He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed .
Blackbeard was a child to Flint .
"The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that , I tell you , sir , I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman ."
"I 've seen his top-sails with these eyes , off Trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back -- put back , sir , into Port of Spain . ''"
"`` Well , I 've heard of him myself , in England , '' said the doctor ."
"`` But the point is , had he money ? ''"
`` Money ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Have you heard the story ?
What were these villains after but money ?
What do they care for but money ?
For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money ? ''
"`` That we shall soon know , '' replied the doctor ."
`` But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I can not get a word in .
"What I want to know is this : Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ? ''"
"`` Amount , sir ! ''"
cried the squire .
"`` It will amount to this : If we have the clue you talk about , I fit out a ship in Bristol dock , and take you and Hawkins here along , and I 'll have that treasure if I search a year . ''"
"`` Very well , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Now , then , if Jim is agreeable , we 'll open the packet '' ; and he laid it before him on the table ."
"The bundle was sewn together , and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors ."
It contained two things -- a book and a sealed paper .
"`` First of all we 'll try the book , '' observed the doctor ."
"The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it , for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table , where I had been eating , to enjoy the sport of the search ."
"On the first page there were only some scraps of writing , such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice ."
"One was the same as the tattoo mark , `` Billy Bones his fancy '' ; then there was `` Mr. W. Bones , mate , '' `` No more rum , '' `` Off Palm Key he got itt , '' and some other snatches , mostly single words and unintelligible ."
"She could run faster than Anne , who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt , and soon overtook her ."
Behind them they left a trail that would break Mr. Harrison 's heart when he should see it .
"`` Anne , for mercy 's sake , stop , '' panted poor Diana ."
`` I 'm right out of breath and you are wet to the skin . ''
"`` I must ... get ... that cow ... out ... before ... Mr. Harrison ... sees her , '' gasped Anne ."
`` I do n't ... care ... if I 'm ... drowned ... if we ... can ... only ... do that . ''
But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out of her luscious browsing ground .
No sooner had the two breathless girls got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner of the field .
"`` Head her off , '' screamed Anne ."
"`` Run , Diana , run . ''"
Diana did run .
"Anne tried to , and the wicked Jersey went around the field as if she were possessed ."
"Privately , Diana thought she was ."
It was fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the corner gap into the Cuthbert lane .
There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper at that precise moment .
"Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a buggy halted just outside the lane , wherein sat Mr. Shearer of Carmody and his son , both of whom wore a broad smile ."
"`` I guess you 'd better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her last week , Anne , '' chuckled Mr. Shearer ."
"`` I 'll sell her to you now , if you want her , '' said her flushed and disheveled owner ."
`` You may have her this very minute . ''
`` Done .
"I 'll give you twenty for her as I offered before , and Jim here can drive her right over to Carmody ."
She 'll go to town with the rest of the shipment this evening .
Mr. Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow . ''
"Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the road , and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with her twenty dollars ."
`` What will Marilla say ? ''
asked Diana .
"`` Oh , she wo n't care ."
Dolly was my own cow and it is n't likely she 'd bring more than twenty dollars at the auction .
"But oh dear , if Mr. Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again , and after my giving him my word of honor that I 'd never let it happen !"
"Well , it has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows ."
A cow that could jump over or break through our milk-pen fence could n't be trusted anywhere . ''
"Marilla had gone down to Mrs. Lynde 's , and when she returned knew all about Dolly 's sale and transfer , for Mrs. Lynde had seen most of the transaction from her window and guessed the rest ."
"Finally Mr. Barry shook his head , with a relieved air ."
`` She ca n't be down there .
"It 's a mighty curious thing where she could have got to , though ."
"Look here , young man , are you sure you 've no idea where your sister is ? ''"
"`` I 've told you a dozen times that I have n't , '' said Davy , with an injured air ."
`` Maybe a tramp come and stole her . ''
"`` Nonsense , '' said Marilla sharply , relieved from her horrible fear of the well ."
"`` Anne , do you suppose she could have strayed over to Mr. Harrison 's ?"
She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that time you took her over . ''
"`` I ca n't believe Dora would venture so far alone but I 'll go over and see , '' said Anne ."
Nobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a very decided change came over his face .
"He quietly slipped off the gate and ran , as fast as his fat legs could carry him , to the barn ."
Anne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no very hopeful frame of mind .
"The house was locked , the window shades were down , and there was no sign of anything living about the place ."
She stood on the veranda and called Dora loudly .
"Ginger , in the kitchen behind her , shrieked and swore with sudden fierceness ; but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry from the little building in the yard which served Mr. Harrison as a toolhouse ."
"Anne flew to the door , unhasped it , and caught up a small mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned nail keg ."
"`` Oh , Dora , Dora , what a fright you have given us !"
How came you to be here ? ''
"`` Davy and I came over to see Ginger , '' sobbed Dora , `` but we could n't see him after all , only Davy made him swear by kicking the door ."
And then Davy brought me here and run out and shut the door ; and I could n't get out .
"I cried and cried , I was frightened , and oh , I 'm so hungry and cold ; and I thought you 'd never come , Anne . ''"
`` Davy ? ''
But Anne could say no more .
She carried Dora home with a heavy heart .
Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in the pain caused by Davy 's behavior .
The freak of shutting Dora up might easily have been pardoned .
But Davy had told falsehoods ... downright coldblooded falsehoods about it .
That was the ugly fact and Anne could not shut her eyes to it .
She could have sat down and cried with sheer disappointment .
She had grown to love Davy dearly ... how dearly she had not known until this minute ... and it hurt her unbearably to discover that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood .
Marilla listened to Anne 's tale in a silence that boded no good Davy-ward ; Mr. Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt with .
`` The first week in June was another dreadful one .
"The Austrians seemed just on the point of overrunning Italy : and then came the first awful news of the Battle of Jutland , which the Germans claimed as a great victory ."
Susan was the only one who carried on .
"` You need never tell me that the Kaiser has defeated the British Navy , ' she said , with a contemptuous sniff ."
` It is all a German lie and that you may tie to . '
"And when a couple of days later we found out that she was right and that it had been a British victory instead of a British defeat , we had to put up with a great many ' I told you so 's , ' but we endured them very comfortably ."
`` It took Kitchener 's death to finish Susan .
For the first time I saw her down and out .
We all felt the shock of it but Susan plumbed the depths of despair .
The news came at night by ` phone but Susan would n't believe it until she saw the Enterprise headline the next day .
"She did not cry or faint or go into hysterics ; but she forgot to put salt in the soup , and that is something Susan never did in my recollection ."
"Mother and Miss Oliver and I cried but Susan looked at us in stony sarcasm and said , ` The Kaiser and his six sons are all alive and thriving ."
So the world is not left wholly desolate .
"Why cry , Mrs. Dr. dear ? '"
"Susan continued in this stony , hopeless condition for twenty-four hours , and then Cousin Sophia appeared and began to condole with her . ''"
"` This is terrible news , ai n't it , Susan ?"
We might as well prepare for the worst for it is bound to come .
"You said once -- and well do I remember the words , Susan Baker -- that you had complete confidence in God and Kitchener ."
"Ah well , Susan Baker , there is only God left now . '"
`` Whereat Cousin Sophia put her handkerchief to her eyes pathetically as if the world were indeed in terrible straits .
"As for Susan , Cousin Sophia was the salvation of her ."
She came to life with a jerk . ''
"` Sophia Crawford , hold your peace ! '"
she said sternly .
` You may be an idiot but you need not be an irreverent idiot .
It is no more than decent to be weeping and wailing because the Almighty is the sole stay of the Allies now .
"As for Kitchener , his death is a great loss and I do not dispute it ."
But the outcome of this war does not depend on one man 's life and now that the Russians are coming on again you will soon see a change for the better . '
`` Susan said this so energetically that she convinced herself and cheered up immediately .
But Cousin Sophia shook her head . ''
"` Albert 's wife wants to call the baby after Brusiloff , ' she said , ` but I told her to wait and see what becomes of him first ."
Them Russians has such a habit of petering out . '
"`` Now here , '' he cried , `` on my right hand , I swear to avenge it !"
"If that I fail , if that I spill not ten men 's souls for each , may this hand wither from my body !"
"I broke this Duckworth like a rush ; I beggared him to his door ; I burned the thatch above his head ; I drove him from this country ; and now , cometh he back to beard me ?"
"Nay , but , Duckworth , this time it shall go bitter hard ! ''"
"He was silent for some time , his face working ."
`` Eat ! ''
"he cried , suddenly ."
"`` And you here , '' he added to Matcham , `` swear me an oath to follow straight to the Moat House . ''"
"`` I will pledge mine honour , '' replied Matcham ."
`` What make I with your honour ? ''
cried the knight .
`` Swear me upon your mother 's welfare ! ''
"Matcham gave the required oath ; and Sir Daniel re-adjusted the hood over his face , and prepared his bell and staff ."
To see him once more in that appalling travesty somewhat revived the horror of his two companions .
But the knight was soon upon his feet .
"`` Eat with despatch , '' he said , `` and follow me yarely to mine house . ''"
"And with that he set forth again into the woods ; and presently after the bell began to sound , numbering his steps , and the two lads sat by their untasted meal , and heard it die slowly away up hill into the distance ."
`` And so ye go to Tunstall ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` Yea , verily , '' said Matcham , `` when needs must !"
I am braver behind Sir Daniel 's back than to his face . ''
"They ate hastily , and set forth along the path through the airy upper levels of the forest , where great beeches stood apart among green lawns , and the birds and squirrels made merry on the boughs ."
"Two hours later , they began to descend upon the other side , and already , among the tree-tops , saw before them the red walls and roofs of Tunstall House ."
"`` Here , '' said Matcham , pausing , `` ye shall take your leave of your friend Jack , whom y ' are to see no more ."
"Come , Dick , forgive him what he did amiss , as he , for his part , cheerfully and lovingly forgiveth you . ''"
`` And wherefore so ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` An we both go to Tunstall , I shall see you yet again , I trow , and that right often . ''"
"`` Ye 'll never again see poor Jack Matcham , '' replied the other , `` that was so fearful and burthensome , and yet plucked you from the river ; ye 'll not see him more , Dick , by mine honour ! ''"
"He held his arms open , and the lads embraced and kissed ."
"`` And , Dick , '' continued Matcham , `` my spirit bodeth ill ."
"Y ' are now to see a new Sir Daniel ; for heretofore hath all prospered in his hands exceedingly , and fortune followed him ; but now , methinks , when his fate hath come upon him , and he runs the adventure of his life , he will prove but a foul lord to both of us ."
`` Why do n't you go ? ''
the old one asked politely .
"`` I suppose , '' said Peter huskily , `` I suppose I can still fly ? ''"
"You see , he had lost faith ."
"`` Poor little half-and-half , '' said Solomon , who was not really hard-hearted , `` you will never be able to fly again , not even on windy days ."
You must live here on the island always . ''
`` And never even go to the Kensington Gardens ? ''
Peter asked tragically .
`` How could you get across ? ''
said Solomon .
"He promised very kindly , however , to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape ."
`` Then I sha 'n' t be exactly a human ? ''
Peter asked .
`` No . ''
`` Nor exactly a bird ? ''
`` No . ''
`` What shall I be ? ''
"`` You will be a Betwixt-and-Between , '' Solomon said , and certainly he was a wise old fellow , for that is exactly how it turned out ."
The birds on the island never got used to him .
"His oddities tickled them every day , as if they were quite new , though it was really the birds that were new ."
"They came out of the eggs daily , and laughed at him at once , then off they soon flew to be humans , and other birds came out of other eggs , and so it went on forever ."
"The crafty mother-birds , when they tired of sitting on their eggs , used to get the young one to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating ."
"Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things , just as you watch the peacocks , and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth ."
All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon 's orders by the birds .
"He would not eat worms or insects -LRB- which they thought very silly of him -RRB- , so they brought him bread in their beaks ."
"Thus , when you cry out , `` Greedy !"
Greedy ! ''
"to the bird that flies away with the big crust , you know now that you ought not to do this , for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan ."
Peter wore no night-gown now .
"You see , the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with , and , being very good-natured , he could not refuse , so by Solomon 's advice he had hidden what was left of it ."
"But , though he was now quite naked , you must not think that he was cold or unhappy ."
"He was usually very happy and gay , and the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways ."
And there was a wind that came dancing and whistling up the channel to replace the beautiful silence with a music more beautiful still .
The rest of the folks were just coming downstairs when I got back to breakfast .
"They were all yawny , and some were grumpy , but I had washed my being in the sunrise and felt as blithesome as the day ."
"Oh , life is so good to live !"
"Tomorrow Uncle James 's new vessel , the White Lady , is to be launched ."
"We are going to make a festive occasion of it , and I am to christen her with a bottle of cobwebby old wine ."
"But I hear the carriage , and Aunt Jane is calling me ."
"I had a great deal more to say -- about your letter , your big `` round-up '' and your tribulations with your Chinese cook -- but I 've only time now to say goodbye ."
"You wish me a lovely time at the dance and a full programme , do n't you ?"
"Yours sincerely , Sidney Richmond ."
Aunt Jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby .
"Sidney said her prayers , went to bed , and slept soundly and serenely ."
"She mailed her letter the next day , and a month later an answer came ."
"Sidney read it as soon as she left the post office , and walked the rest of the way home as in a nightmare , staring straight ahead of her with wide-open , unseeing brown eyes ."
"John Lincoln 's letter was short , but the pertinent paragraph of it burned itself into Sidney 's brain ."
He wrote : I am going east for a visit .
"It is six years since I was home , and it seems like three times six ."
"I shall go by the C.P.R. , which passes through Plainfield , and I mean to stop off for a day ."
"You will let me call and see you , wo n't you ?"
"I shall have to take your permission for granted , as I shall be gone before a letter from you can reach the Bar N. I leave for the east in five days , and shall look forward to our meeting with all possible interest and pleasure ."
"Sidney did not sleep that night , but tossed restlessly about or cried in her pillow ."
"She was so pallid and hollow-eyed the next morning that Aunt Jane noticed it , and asked her what the matter was ."
"`` Nothing , '' said Sidney sharply ."
Sidney had never spoken sharply to her aunt before .
The good woman shook her head .
She was afraid the child was `` taking something . ''
"`` Do n't do much today , Siddy , '' she said kindly ."
`` Just lie around and take it easy till you get rested up .
I 'll fix you a dose of quinine . ''
Sidney refused to lie around and take it easy .
"She swallowed the quinine meekly enough , but she worked fiercely all day , hunting out superfluous tasks to do ."
"That night she slept the sleep of exhaustion , but her dreams were unenviable and the awakening was terrible ."
And it turned out that the dog was a lion and my Very Brave Aunt had druv him into the barn with a stick .
It was a wonder she was not et up but she was very brave .
Emerson Gillis says if she thought it was a dog she was n't any braver than if it really was a dog .
"But Emerson is jealous because he has n't got a Brave Aunt himself , nothing but uncles . ' '' '"
I have kept the best for the last .
You laugh at me because I think Paul is a genius but I am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very uncommon child .
Paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates ... no real playmates .
"You remember our School Management professor told us that we must not have ` favorites ' among our pupils , but I ca n't help loving Paul Irving the best of all mine ."
"I do n't think it does any harm , though , for everybody loves Paul , even Mrs. Lynde , who says she could never have believed she 'd get so fond of a Yankee ."
The other boys in school like him too .
There is nothing weak or girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies .
He is very manly and can hold his own in all games .
He fought St. Clair Donnell recently because St. Clair said the Union Jack was away ahead of the Stars and Stripes as a flag .
The result was a drawn battle and a mutual agreement to respect each other 's patriotism henceforth .
St. Clair says he can hit the HARDEST but Paul can hit the OFTENEST . ' ''
`` Paul 's Letter . ''
"` My dear teacher , '' ` You told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew ."
I think the most interesting people I know are my rock people and I mean to tell you about them .
I have never told anybody about them except grandma and father but I would like to have you know about them because you understand things .
There are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them . ' ''
` My rock people live at the shore .
I used to visit them almost every evening before the winter came .
"Now I ca n't go till spring , but they will be there , for people like that never change ... that is the splendid thing about them ."
Nora was the first one of them I got acquainted with and so I think I love her the best .
"She lives in Andrews ' Cove and she has black hair and black eyes , and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies ."
You ought to hear the stories she can tell .
Then there are the Twin Sailors .
"They do n't live anywhere , they sail all the time , but they often come ashore to talk to me ."
They are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world ... and more than what is in the world .
Do you know what happened to the youngest Twin Sailor once ?
He was sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade .
"A moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea , you know , teacher ."
That is a pill for the Turks .
I wish I had a chance to tell the Czar just what a mistake he made when he turned Nicholas down . ''
"Susan disappeared downstairs to the kitchen , whence a dreadful thud and a piercing shriek presently sounded ."
"Everybody rushed to the kitchen -- the doctor and Miss Oliver , Mrs. Blythe , Rilla , Miranda in her wedding-veil ."
"Susan was sitting flatly in the middle of the kitchen floor with a dazed , bewildered look on her face , while Doc , evidently in his Hyde incarnation , was standing on the dresser , with his back up , his eyes blazing , and his tail the size of three tails ."
"`` Susan , what has happened ? ''"
cried Mrs. Blythe in alarm .
`` Did you fall ?
Are you hurt ? ''
Susan picked herself up .
"`` No , '' she said grimly , `` I am not hurt , though I am jarred all over ."
Do not be alarmed .
"As for what has happened -- I tried to kick that darned cat with both feet , that is what happened . ''"
Everybody shrieked with laughter .
The doctor was quite helpless .
"`` Oh , Susan , Susan , '' he gasped ."
`` That I should live to hear you swear . ''
"`` I am sorry , '' said Susan in real distress , `` that I used such an expression before two young girls ."
"But I said that beast was darned , and darned it is ."
It belongs to Old Nick . ''
"`` Do you expect it will vanish some of these days with a bang and the odour of brimstone , Susan ? ''"
"`` It will go to its own place in due time and that you may tie to , '' said Susan dourly , shaking out her raddled bones and going to her oven ."
`` I suppose my plunking down like that has shaken my cake so that it will be as heavy as lead . ''
But the cake was not heavy .
"It was all a bride 's cake should be , and Susan iced it beautifully ."
"Next day she and Rilla worked all the forenoon , making delicacies for the wedding-feast , and as soon as Miranda phoned up that her father was safely off everything was packed in a big hamper and taken down to the Pryor house ."
"Joe soon arrived in his uniform and a state of violent excitement , accompanied by his best man , Sergeant Malcolm Crawford ."
"There were quite a few guests , for all the Manse and Ingleside folk were there , and a dozen or so of Joe 's relatives , including his mother , `` Mrs. Dead Angus Milgrave , '' so called , cheerfully , to distinguish her from another lady whose Angus was living ."
"Mrs. Dead Angus wore a rather disapproving expression , not caring over-much for this alliance with the house of Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
So Miranda Pryor was married to Private Joseph Milgrave on his last leave .
It should have been a romantic wedding but it was not .
"There were too many factors working against romance , as even Rilla had to admit ."
"Want of practice , they called it ; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed ."
"Michael believed longer than the other boys , though they jeered at him ; so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year ."
"She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the Neverland , and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become ; but he never noticed , he had so much to say about himself ."
"She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times , but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind ."
`` Who is Captain Hook ? ''
he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch enemy .
"`` Do n't you remember , '' she asked , amazed , `` how you killed him and saved all our lives ? ''"
"`` I forget them after I kill them , '' he replied carelessly ."
"When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he said , `` Who is Tinker Bell ? ''"
"`` O Peter , '' she said , shocked ; but even when she explained he could not remember ."
"`` There are such a lot of them , '' he said ."
`` I expect she is no more . ''
"I expect he was right , for fairies do n't live long , but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them ."
Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter ; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her .
"But he was exactly as fascinating as ever , and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops ."
Next year he did not come for her .
She waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet ; but he never came .
"`` Perhaps he is ill , '' Michael said ."
`` You know he is never ill . ''
"Michael came close to her and whispered , with a shiver , `` Perhaps there is no such person , Wendy ! ''"
and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying .
Peter came next spring cleaning ; and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year .
That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him .
For a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains ; and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge .
"But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy ; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman , and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys ."
Wendy was grown up .
You need not be sorry for her .
She was one of the kind that likes to grow up .
In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls .
All the boys were grown up and done for by this time ; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them .
"You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office , each carrying a little bag and an umbrella ."
Michael is an engine-driver -LSB- train engineer -RSB- .
It seemed a pity to waste him .
"And say , was n't it fun to hear that girl yell ? ''"
Tuesday afternoon the Aid Society met at Green Gables .
"Anne hurried home from school , for she knew that Marilla would need all the assistance she could give ."
"Dora , neat and proper , in her nicely starched white dress and black sash , was sitting with the members of the Aid in the parlor , speaking demurely when spoken to , keeping silence when not , and in every way comporting herself as a model child ."
"Davy , blissfully dirty , was making mud pies in the barnyard ."
"`` I told him he might , '' said Marilla wearily ."
`` I thought it would keep him out of worse mischief .
He can only get dirty at that .
We 'll have our teas over before we call him to his .
"Dora can have hers with us , but I would never dare to let Davy sit down at the table with all the Aids here . ''"
When Anne went to call the Aids to tea she found that Dora was not in the parlor .
Mrs. Jasper Bell said Davy had come to the front door and called her out .
A hasty consultation with Marilla in the pantry resulted in a decision to let both children have their teas together later on .
Tea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure .
"Marilla and Anne stared in dismay , the Aids in amazement ."
"Could that be Dora ... that sobbing nondescript in a drenched , dripping dress and hair from which the water was streaming on Marilla 's new coin-spot rug ?"
"`` Dora , what has happened to you ? ''"
"cried Anne , with a guilty glance at Mrs. Jasper Bell , whose family was said to be the only one in the world in which accidents never occurred ."
"`` Davy made me walk the pigpen fence , '' wailed Dora ."
`` I did n't want to but he called me a fraid-cat .
And I fell off into the pigpen and my dress got all dirty and the pig runned right over me .
"My dress was just awful but Davy said if I 'd stand under the pump he 'd wash it clean , and I did and he pumped water all over me but my dress ai n't a bit cleaner and my pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled . ''"
Anne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while Marilla went upstairs and redressed Dora in her old clothes .
Davy was caught and sent to bed without any supper .
"Anne went to his room at twilight and talked to him seriously ... a method in which she had great faith , not altogether unjustified by results ."
She told him she felt very badly over his conduct .
"`` I feel sorry now myself , '' admitted Davy , `` but the trouble is I never feel sorry for doing things till after I 've did them ."
"Dora would n't help me make pies , cause she was afraid of messing her clo'es and that made me hopping mad ."
I s ` pose Paul Irving would n't have made HIS sister walk a pigpen fence if he knew she 'd fall in ? ''
"`` No , he would never dream of such a thing ."
Paul is a perfect little gentleman . ''
"`` How lovely , '' cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her grip ."
"`` I thought all the fairies were dead , '' Mrs. Darling said ."
"`` There are always a lot of young ones , '' explained Wendy , who was now quite an authority , `` because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born , and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies ."
"They live in nests on the tops of trees ; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls , and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are . ''"
"`` I shall have such fun , '' said Peter , with eye on Wendy ."
"`` It will be rather lonely in the evening , '' she said , `` sitting by the fire . ''"
`` I shall have Tink . ''
"`` Tink ca n't go a twentieth part of the way round , '' she reminded him a little tartly ."
`` Sneaky tell-tale ! ''
Tink called out from somewhere round the corner .
"`` It does n't matter , '' Peter said ."
"`` O Peter , you know it matters . ''"
"`` Well , then , come with me to the little house . ''"
"`` May I , mummy ? ''"
`` Certainly not .
"I have got you home again , and I mean to keep you . ''"
`` But he does so need a mother . ''
"`` So do you , my love . ''"
"`` Oh , all right , '' Peter said , as if he had asked her from politeness merely ; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch , and she made this handsome offer : to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning ."
Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement ; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming ; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again .
"He had no sense of time , and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them ."
"I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones : `` You wo n't forget me , Peter , will you , before spring cleaning time comes ? ''"
Of course Peter promised ; and then he flew away .
He took Mrs. Darling 's kiss with him .
"The kiss that had been for no one else , Peter took quite easily ."
Funny .
But she seemed satisfied .
"Of course all the boys went to school ; and most of them got into Class III , but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top class ."
"Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island ; but it was too late now , and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor -LSB- the younger Jenkins -RSB- ."
It is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them .
"At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night ; and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses -LSB- the English double-deckers -RSB- ; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed , and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus ."
In time they could not even fly after their hats .
No one but herself -- and perhaps Rilla -- knew it -- would ever know it .
She had no right in the eyes of her world to grieve .
She must hide and bear her long pain as best she could -- alone .
"But she , too , would keep faith ."
CHAPTER XXIV MARY IS JUST IN TIME The autumn of 1916 was a bitter season for Ingleside .
"Mrs. Blythe 's return to health was slow , and sorrow and loneliness were in all hearts ."
Every one tried to hide it from the others and `` carry on '' cheerfully .
Rilla laughed a good deal .
"Nobody at Ingleside was deceived by her laughter ; it came from her lips only , never from her heart ."
"But outsiders said some people got over trouble very easily , and Irene Howard remarked that she was surprised to find how shallow Rilla Blythe really was ."
"`` Why , after all her pose of being so devoted to Walter , she does n't seem to mind his death at all ."
Nobody has ever seen her shed a tear or heard her mention his name .
She has evidently quite forgotten him .
Poor fellow -- you 'd really think his family would feel it more .
"I spoke of him to Rilla at the last Junior Red meeting -- of how fine and brave and splendid he was -- and I said life could never be just the same to me again , now that Walter had gone -- we were such friends , you know -- why I was the very first person he told about having enlisted -- and Rilla answered , as coolly and indifferently as if she were speaking of an entire stranger , ` He was just one of many fine and splendid boys who have given everything for their country . '"
"Well , I wish I could take things as calmly -- but I 'm not made like that ."
I 'm so sensitive -- things hurt me terribly -- I really never get over them .
I asked Rilla right out why she did n't put on mourning for Walter .
She said her mother did n't wish it .
But every one is talking about it . ''
"`` Rilla does n't wear colours -- nothing but white , '' protested Betty Mead ."
"`` White becomes her better than anything else , '' said Irene significantly ."
`` And we all know black does n't suit her complexion at all .
But of course I 'm not saying that is the reason she does n't wear it .
"Only , it 's funny ."
If my brother had died I 'd have gone into deep mourning .
I would n't have had the heart for anything else .
I confess I 'm disappointed in Rilla Blythe . ''
"`` I am not , then , '' cried Betty Meade , loyally , `` I think Rilla is just a wonderful girl ."
A few years ago I admit I did think she was rather too vain and gigglesome ; but now she is nothing of the sort .
"I do n't think there is a girl in the Glen who is so unselfish and plucky as Rilla , or who has done her bit as thoroughly and patiently ."
"Our Junior Red Cross would have gone on the rocks a dozen times if it had n't been for her tact and perseverance and enthusiasm -- you know that perfectly well , Irene . ''"
"My voice stuck in my throat , for I ever hated to take part in lies ; but my very embarrassment helped on the plot , for the lass no doubt set down my husky voice to sickness and fatigue ."
`` Has he nae friends ? ''
"said she , in a tearful voice ."
`` That has he so ! ''
"cried Alan , `` if we could but win to them !"
"-- friends and rich friends , beds to lie in , food to eat , doctors to see to him -- and here he must tramp in the dubs and sleep in the heather like a beggarman . ''"
`` And why that ? ''
says the lass .
"`` My dear , '' said Alan , `` I cannae very safely say ; but I 'll tell ye what I 'll do instead , '' says he , `` I 'll whistle ye a bit tune . ''"
"And with that he leaned pretty far over the table , and in a mere breath of a whistle , but with a wonderful pretty sentiment , gave her a few bars of `` Charlie is my darling . ''"
"`` Wheesht , '' says she , and looked over her shoulder to the door ."
"`` That 's it , '' said Alan ."
`` And him so young ! ''
cries the lass .
"`` He 's old enough to -- '' and Alan struck his forefinger on the back part of his neck , meaning that I was old enough to lose my head ."
"`` It would be a black shame , '' she cried , flushing high ."
"`` It 's what will be , though , '' said Alan , `` unless we manage the better . ''"
"At this the lass turned and ran out of that part of the house , leaving us alone together ."
"Alan in high good humour at the furthering of his schemes , and I in bitter dudgeon at being called a Jacobite and treated like a child ."
"`` Alan , '' I cried , `` I can stand no more of this . ''"
"`` Ye 'll have to sit it then , Davie , '' said he ."
"`` For if ye upset the pot now , ye may scrape your own life out of the fire , but Alan Breck is a dead man . ''"
"This was so true that I could only groan ; and even my groan served Alan 's purpose , for it was overheard by the lass as she came flying in again with a dish of white puddings and a bottle of strong ale ."
`` Poor lamb ! ''
"says she , and had no sooner set the meat before us , than she touched me on the shoulder with a little friendly touch , as much as to bid me cheer up ."
"Then she told us to fall to , and there would be no more to pay ; for the inn was her own , or at least her father 's , and he was gone for the day to Pittencrieff ."
"We waited for no second bidding , for bread and cheese is but cold comfort and the puddings smelt excellently well ; and while we sat and ate , she took up that same place by the next table , looking on , and thinking , and frowning to herself , and drawing the string of her apron through her hand ."
"`` I 'm thinking ye have rather a long tongue , '' she said at last to Alan ."
`` Ay '' said Alan ; `` but ye see I ken the folk I speak to . ''
"`` I would never betray ye , '' said she , `` if ye mean that . ''"
"`` No , '' said he , `` ye 're not that kind ."
"But I 'll tell ye what ye would do , ye would help . ''"
"As for the fourth , who brought up the tail , I had seen his like before , and knew him at once to be a sheriff 's officer ."
"I had no sooner seen these people coming than I made up my mind -LRB- for no reason that I can tell -RRB- to go through with my adventure ; and when the first came alongside of me , I rose up from the bracken and asked him the way to Aucharn ."
"He stopped and looked at me , as I thought , a little oddly ; and then , turning to the lawyer , `` Mungo , '' said he , `` there 's many a man would think this more of a warning than two pyats ."
"Here am I on my road to Duror on the job ye ken ; and here is a young lad starts up out of the bracken , and speers if I am on the way to Aucharn . ''"
"`` Glenure , '' said the other , `` this is an ill subject for jesting . ''"
"These two had now drawn close up and were gazing at me , while the two followers had halted about a stone-cast in the rear ."
`` And what seek ye in Aucharn ? ''
"said Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure , him they called the Red Fox ; for he it was that I had stopped ."
"`` The man that lives there , '' said I. `` James of the Glens , '' says Glenure , musingly ; and then to the lawyer : `` Is he gathering his people , think ye ? ''"
"`` Anyway , '' says the lawyer , `` we shall do better to bide where we are , and let the soldiers rally us . ''"
"`` If you are concerned for me , '' said I , `` I am neither of his people nor yours , but an honest subject of King George , owing no man and fearing no man . ''"
"`` Why , very well said , '' replies the Factor ."
"`` But if I may make so bold as ask , what does this honest man so far from his country ?"
and why does he come seeking the brother of Ardshiel ?
"I have power here , I must tell you ."
"I am King 's Factor upon several of these estates , and have twelve files of soldiers at my back . ''"
"`` I have heard a waif word in the country , '' said I , a little nettled , `` that you were a hard man to drive . ''"
"He still kept looking at me , as if in doubt ."
"`` Well , '' said he , at last , `` your tongue is bold ; but I am no unfriend to plainness ."
"If ye had asked me the way to the door of James Stewart on any other day but this , I would have set ye right and bidden ye God speed ."
"But to-day -- eh , Mungo ? ''"
And he turned again to look at the lawyer .
But just as he turned there came the shot of a firelock from higher up the hill ; and with the very sound of it Glenure fell upon the road .
"`` O , I am dead ! ''"
"he cried , several times over ."
"The lawyer had caught him up and held him in his arms , the servant standing over and clasping his hands ."
"And now the wounded man looked from one to another with scared eyes , and there was a change in his voice , that went to the heart ."
"`` Take care of yourselves , '' says he ."
`` I am dead . ''
"He tried to open his clothes as if to look for the wound , but his fingers slipped on the buttons ."
"With that he gave a great sigh , his head rolled on his shoulder , and he passed away ."
"The lawyer said never a word , but his face was as sharp as a pen and as white as the dead man 's ; the servant broke out into a great noise of crying and weeping , like a child ; and I , on my side , stood staring at them in a kind of horror ."
"Daisy heard it , ran in , saw the empty dish , also the end of a yellow tail disappearing under the bed ."
"Without a word she seized that tail , pulled out the thief , and shook him till his ears flapped wildly , then bundled him down-stairs to the shed , where he spent a lonely evening in the coal-bin ."
"Cheered by the sympathy which Demi gave her , Daisy made another bowlful of batter , and fried a dozen cakes , which were even better than the others ."
"Indeed , Uncle Fritz after eating two sent up word that he had never tasted any so nice , and every boy at the table below envied Demi at the flapjack party above ."
"It was a truly delightful supper , for the little teapot lid only fell off three times and the milk jug upset but once ; the cakes floated in syrup , and the toast had a delicious beef-steak flavor , owing to cook 's using the gridiron to make it on ."
"Demi forgot philosophy , and stuffed like any carnal boy , while Daisy planned sumptuous banquets , and the dolls looked on smiling affably ."
"`` Well , dearies , have you had a good time ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Jo , coming up with Teddy on her shoulder ."
`` A very good time .
"I shall come again soon , '' answered Demi , with emphasis ."
"`` I 'm afraid you have eaten too much , by the look of that table . ''"
"`` No , I have n't ; I only ate fifteen cakes , and they were very little ones , '' protested Demi , who had kept his sister busy supplying his plate ."
"`` They wo n't hurt him , they are so nice , '' said Daisy , with such a funny mixture of maternal fondness and housewifely pride that Aunt Jo could only smile and say : `` Well , on the whole , the new game is a success then ? ''"
"`` I like it , '' said Demi , as if his approval was all that was necessary ."
`` It is the dearest play ever made ! ''
"cried Daisy , hugging her little dish-tub as she proposed to wash up the cups ."
"`` I just wish everybody had a sweet cooking stove like mine , '' she added , regarding it with affection ."
"`` This play out to have a name , '' said Demi , gravely removing the syrup from his countenance with his tongue ."
`` It has . ''
"`` Oh , what ? ''"
asked both children eagerly .
"`` Well , I think we will call it Pattypans , '' and Aunt Jo retired , satisfied with the success of her last trap to catch a sunbeam ."
CHAPTER VI .
"A FIRE BRAND `` Please , ma'am , could I speak to you ?"
"It is something very important , '' said Nat , popping his head in at the door of Mrs. Bhaer 's room ."
"It was the fifth head which had popped in during the last half-hour ; but Mrs. Jo was used to it , so she looked up , and said , briskly , `` What is it , my lad ? ''"
"Nat came in , shut the door carefully behind him , and said in an eager , anxious tone , `` Dan has come . ''"
`` Who is Dan ? ''
`` He 's a boy I used to know when I fiddled round the streets .
"He sold papers , and he was kind to me , and I saw him the other day in town , and told him how nice it was here , and he 's come . ''"
"`` But , my dear boy , that is rather a sudden way to pay a visit . ''"
"`` Oh , it is n't a visit ; he wants to stay if you will let him ! ''"
Rilla 's fear lifted .
Dog Monday howled no more and resumed his routine of train meeting and watching .
When five days had passed the Ingleside people began to feel that they might be cheerful again .
"Rilla dashed about the kitchen helping Susan with the breakfast and singing so sweetly and clearly that Cousin Sophia across the road heard her and croaked out to Mrs. Albert , '' ` Sing before eating , cry before sleeping , ' I 've always heard . ''"
But Rilla Blythe shed no tears before the nightfall .
"When her father , his face grey and drawn and old , came to her that afternoon and told her that Walter had been killed in action at Courcelette she crumpled up in a pitiful little heap of merciful unconsciousness in his arms ."
Nor did she waken to her pain for many hours .
"CHAPTER XXIII `` AND SO , GOODNIGHT '' The fierce flame of agony had burned itself out and the grey dust of its ashes was over all the world ."
Rilla 's younger life recovered physically sooner than her mother .
For weeks Mrs. Blythe lay ill from grief and shock .
"Rilla found it was possible to go on with existence , since existence had still to be reckoned with ."
"There was work to be done , for Susan could not do all ."
"For her mother 's sake she had to put on calmness and endurance as a garment in the day ; but night after night she lay in her bed , weeping the bitter rebellious tears of youth until at last tears were all wept out and the little patient ache that was to be in her heart until she died took their place ."
"She clung to Miss Oliver , who knew what to say and what not to say ."
So few people did .
"Kind , well-meaning callers and comforters gave Rilla some terrible moments ."
"`` You 'll get over it in time , '' Mrs. William Reese said , cheerfully ."
"Mrs. Reese had three stalwart sons , not one of whom had gone to the front ."
"`` It 's such a blessing it was Walter who was taken and not Jem , '' said Miss Sarah Clow ."
"`` Walter was a member of the church , and Jem was n't ."
I 've told Mr. Meredith many a time that he should have spoken seriously to Jem about it before he went away . ''
"`` Pore , pore Walter , '' sighed Mrs. Reese ."
"`` Do not you come here calling him poor Walter , '' said Susan indignantly , appearing in the kitchen door , much to the relief of Rilla , who felt that she could endure no more just then ."
`` He was not poor .
He was richer than any of you .
"It is you who stay at home and will not let your sons go who are poor -- poor and naked and mean and small -- pisen poor , and so are your sons , with all their prosperous farms and fat cattle and their souls no bigger than a flea 's -- if as big . ''"
"`` I came here to comfort the afflicted and not to be insulted , '' said Mrs. Reese , taking her departure , unregretted by anyone ."
"Then the fire went out of Susan and she retreated to her kitchen , laid her faithful old head on the table and wept bitterly for a time ."
Then she went to work and ironed Jims 's little rompers .
Rilla scolded her gently for it when she herself came in to do it .
"`` I am not going to have you kill yourself working for any war-baby , '' Susan said obstinately ."
"`` Oh , I wish I could just keep on working all the time , Susan , '' cried poor Rilla ."
"As we went , he stopped and spoke with all the wayfarers and workers that we met or passed ; and though of course I could not tell what they discoursed about , yet I judged Mr. Henderland must be well liked in the countryside , for I observed many of them to bring out their mulls and share a pinch of snuff with him ."
"I told him as far in my affairs as I judged wise ; as far , that is , as they were none of Alan 's ; and gave Balachulish as the place I was travelling to , to meet a friend ; for I thought Aucharn , or even Duror , would be too particular , and might put him on the scent ."
"On his part , he told me much of his work and the people he worked among , the hiding priests and Jacobites , the Disarming Act , the dress , and many other curiosities of the time and place ."
"He seemed moderate ; blaming Parliament in several points , and especially because they had framed the Act more severely against those who wore the dress than against those who carried weapons ."
"This moderation put it in my mind to question him of the Red Fox and the Appin tenants ; questions which , I thought , would seem natural enough in the mouth of one travelling to that country ."
He said it was a bad business .
"`` It 's wonderful , '' said he , `` where the tenants find the money , for their life is mere starvation ."
"-LRB- Ye do n't carry such a thing as snuff , do ye , Mr. Balfour ?"
No .
"Well , I 'm better wanting it . -RRB-"
But these tenants -LRB- as I was saying -RRB- are doubtless partly driven to it .
"James Stewart in Duror -LRB- that 's him they call James of the Glens -RRB- is half-brother to Ardshiel , the captain of the clan ; and he is a man much looked up to , and drives very hard ."
And then there 's one they call Alan Breck -- '' `` Ah ! ''
"I cried , `` what of him ? ''"
`` What of the wind that bloweth where it listeth ? ''
said Henderland .
`` He 's here and awa ; here to-day and gone to-morrow : a fair heather-cat .
"He might be glowering at the two of us out of yon whin-bush , and I wouldnae wonder !"
"Ye 'll no carry such a thing as snuff , will ye ? ''"
"I told him no , and that he had asked the same thing more than once ."
"`` It 's highly possible , '' said he , sighing ."
`` But it seems strange ye shouldnae carry it .
"However , as I was saying , this Alan Breck is a bold , desperate customer , and well kent to be James 's right hand ."
"His life is forfeit already ; he would boggle at naething ; and maybe , if a tenant-body was to hang back he would get a dirk in his wame . ''"
"`` You make a poor story of it all , Mr. Henderland , '' said I. `` If it is all fear upon both sides , I care to hear no more of it . ''"
"`` Na , '' said Mr. Henderland , `` but there 's love too , and self-denial that should put the like of you and me to shame ."
"There 's something fine about it ; no perhaps Christian , but humanly fine ."
"Even Alan Breck , by all that I hear , is a chield to be respected ."
"There 's many a lying sneck-draw sits close in kirk in our own part of the country , and stands well in the world 's eye , and maybe is a far worse man , Mr. Balfour , than yon misguided shedder of man 's blood ."
"Ay , ay , we might take a lesson by them ."
-- Ye 'll perhaps think I 've been too long in the Hielands ? ''
"he added , smiling to me ."
`` The innocent should surely come before the guilty . ''
"`` Why , David , '' said he , `` the innocent have aye a chance to get assoiled in court ; but for the lad that shot the bullet , I think the best place for him will be the heather ."
"Them that havenae dipped their hands in any little difficulty , should be very mindful of the case of them that have ."
And that is the good Christianity .
"For if it was the other way round about , and the lad whom I couldnae just clearly see had been in our shoes , and we in his -LRB- as might very well have been -RRB- , I think we would be a good deal obliged to him oursel 's if he would draw the soldiers . ''"
"When it came to this , I gave Alan up ."
"But he looked so innocent all the time , and was in such clear good faith in what he said , and so ready to sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty , that my mouth was closed ."
Mr. Henderland 's words came back to me : that we ourselves might take a lesson by these wild Highlanders .
"Well , here I had taken mine ."
"Alan 's morals were all tail-first ; but he was ready to give his life for them , such as they were ."
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` I 'll not say it 's the good Christianity as I understand it , but it 's good enough ."
And here I offer ye my hand for the second time . ''
"Whereupon he gave me both of his , saying surely I had cast a spell upon him , for he could forgive me anything ."
"Then he grew very grave , and said we had not much time to throw away , but must both flee that country : he , because he was a deserter , and the whole of Appin would now be searched like a chamber , and every one obliged to give a good account of himself ; and I , because I was certainly involved in the murder ."
`` O ! ''
"says I , willing to give him a little lesson , `` I have no fear of the justice of my country . ''"
`` As if this was your country ! ''
said he .
"`` Or as if ye would be tried here , in a country of Stewarts ! ''"
"`` It 's all Scotland , '' said I. `` Man , I whiles wonder at ye , '' said Alan ."
`` This is a Campbell that 's been killed .
"Well , it 'll be tried in Inverara , the Campbells ' head place ; with fifteen Campbells in the jury-box and the biggest Campbell of all -LRB- and that 's the Duke -RRB- sitting cocking on the bench ."
"Justice , David ?"
"The same justice , by all the world , as Glenure found awhile ago at the roadside . ''"
"This frightened me a little , I confess , and would have frightened me more if I had known how nearly exact were Alan 's predictions ; indeed it was but in one point that he exaggerated , there being but eleven Campbells on the jury ; though as the other four were equally in the Duke 's dependence , it mattered less than might appear ."
"Still , I cried out that he was unjust to the Duke of Argyle , who -LRB- for all he was a Whig -RRB- was yet a wise and honest nobleman ."
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` the man 's a Whig , nae doubt ; but I would never deny he was a good chieftain to his clan ."
"And what would the clan think if there was a Campbell shot , and naebody hanged , and their own chief the Justice General ?"
"But I have often observed , '' says Alan , `` that you Low-country bodies have no clear idea of what 's right and wrong . ''"
"At this I did at last laugh out aloud , when to my surprise , Alan joined in , and laughed as merrily as myself ."
"`` Na , na , '' said he , `` we 're in the Hielands , David ; and when I tell ye to run , take my word and run ."
"`` He 's the only boy we ever failed with , and I am so grieved , for I thought there was the making of a fine man in him , spite of his faults . ''"
"Dan heard Mrs. Bhaer sigh , and he wanted to ask for one more trial himself , but his pride would not let him , and he came out with the hard look on his face , shook hands without a word , and drove away with Mr. Bhaer , leaving Nat and Mrs. Jo to look after him with tears in their eyes ."
"A few days afterwards they received a letter from Mr. Page , saying that Dan was doing well , whereat they all rejoiced ."
"But three weeks later came another letter , saying that Dan had run away , and nothing had been heard of him , whereat they all looked sober , and Mr. Bhaer said , `` Perhaps I ought to have given him another chance . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer , however , nodded wisely and answered , `` Do n't be troubled , Fritz ; the boy will come back to us , I 'm sure of it . ''"
But time went on and no Dan came .
CHAPTER VII .
"NAUGHTY NAN `` Fritz , I 've got a new idea , '' cried Mrs. Bhaer , as she met her husband one day after school ."
"`` Well , my dear , what is it ? ''"
"and he waited willingly to hear the new plan , for some of Mrs. Jo 's ideas were so droll , it was impossible to help laughing at them , though usually they were quite sensible , and he was glad to carry them out ."
"`` Daisy needs a companion , and the boys would be all the better for another girl among them ; you know we believe in bringing up little men and women together , and it is high time we acted up to our belief ."
"They pet and tyrannize over Daisy by turns , and she is getting spoilt ."
"Then they must learn gentle ways , and improve their manners , and having girls about will do it better than any thing else . ''"
"`` You are right , as usual ."
"Now , who shall we have ? ''"
"asked Mr. Bhaer , seeing by the look in her eye that Mrs. Jo had some one all ready to propose ."
`` Little Annie Harding . ''
`` What !
"Naughty Nan , as the lads call her ? ''"
"cried Mr. Bhaer , looking very much amused ."
"`` Yes , she is running wild at home since her mother died , and is too bright a child to be spoilt by servants ."
"I have had my eye on her for some time , and when I met her father in town the other day I asked him why he did not send her to school ."
He said he would gladly if he could find as good a school for girls as ours was for boys .
I know he would rejoice to have her come ; so suppose we drive over this afternoon and see about it . ''
"`` Have not you cares enough now , my Jo , without this little gypsy to torment you ? ''"
"asked Mr. Bhaer , patting the hand that lay on his arm ."
"`` Oh dear , no , '' said Mother Bhaer , briskly ."
"`` I like it , and never was happier than since I had my wilderness of boys ."
"You see , Fritz , I feel a great sympathy for Nan , because I was such a naughty child myself that I know all about it ."
"She is full of spirits , and only needs to be taught what to do with them to be as nice a little girl as Daisy ."
"Those quick wits of hers would enjoy lessons if they were rightly directed , and what is now a tricksy midget would soon become a busy , happy child ."
"I know how to manage her , for I remember how my blessed mother managed me , and -- '' `` And if you succeed half as well as she did , you will have done a magnificent work , '' interrupted Mr. Bhaer , who labored under the delusion that Mrs. B. was the best and most charming woman alive ."
"`` Now , if you make fun of my plan I 'll give you bad coffee for a week , and then where are you , sir ? ''"
"cried Mrs. Jo , tweaking him by the ear just as if he was one of the boys ."
`` Wo n't Daisy 's hair stand erect with horror at Nan 's wild ways ? ''
"asked Mr. Bhaer , presently , when Teddy had swarmed up his waistcoat , and Rob up his back , for they always flew at their father the minute school was done ."
"`` At first , perhaps , but it will do Posy good ."
"She is getting prim and Bettyish , and needs stirring up a bit ."
"She always has a good time when Nan comes over to play , and the two will help each other without knowing it ."
"Dear me , half the science of teaching is knowing how much children do for one another , and when to mix them . ''"
`` I only hope she wo n't turn out another firebrand . ''
`` My poor Dan !
"I never can quite forgive myself for letting him go , '' sighed Mrs. Bhaer ."
"At the sound of the name , little Teddy , who had never forgotten his friend , struggled down from his father 's arms , and trotted to the door , looked out over the sunny lawn with a wistful face , and then trotted back again , saying , as he always did when disappointed of the longed-for sight , `` My Danny 's tummin ' soon . ''"
"`` I really think we ought to have kept him , if only for Teddy 's sake , he was so fond of him , and perhaps baby 's love would have done for him what we failed to do . ''"
"`` I 've sometimes felt that myself ; but after keeping the boys in a ferment , and nearly burning up the whole family , I thought it safer to remove the firebrand , for a time at least , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
"`` Dinner 's ready , let me ring the bell , '' and Rob began a solo upon that instrument which made it impossible to hear one 's self speak ."
"`` Then I may have Nan , may I ? ''"
asked Mrs. Jo .
"`` A dozen Nans if you want them , my dear , '' answered Mr. Bhaer , who had room in his fatherly heart for all the naughty neglected children in the world ."
"When Mrs. Bhaer returned from her drive that afternoon , before she could unpack the load of little boys , without whom she seldom moved , a small girl of ten skipped out at the back of the carry-all and ran into the house , shouting , `` Hi , Daisy !"
where are you ? ''
"Daisy came , and looked pleased to see her guest , but also a trifle alarmed , when Nan said , still prancing , as if it was impossible to keep still , `` I 'm going to stay here always , papa says I may , and my box is coming tomorrow , all my things had to be washed and mended , and your aunt came and carried me off ."
Is n't it great fun ? ''
"`` Why , yes ."
Did you bring your big doll ? ''
"asked Daisy , hoping she had , for on the last visit Nan had ravaged the baby house , and insisted on washing Blanche Matilda 's plaster face , which spoilt the poor dear 's complexion for ever ."
"`` Yes , she 's somewhere round , '' returned Nan , with most unmaternal carelessness ."
"`` I made you a ring coming along , and pulled the hairs out of Dobbin 's tail ."
Do n't you want it ? ''
"and Nan presented a horse-hair ring in token of friendship , as they had both vowed they would never speak to one another again when they last parted ."
"Won by the beauty of the offering , Daisy grew more cordial , and proposed retiring to the nursery , but Nan said , `` No , I want to see the boys , and the barn , '' and ran off , swinging her hat by one string till it broke , when she left it to its fate on the grass ."
`` Hullo !
Nan ! ''
I 'm sorry on your account ; but you need n't say a word at the cranky places .
I 'll do all the talking ... Mrs. Lynde would say I was well able to .
Mrs. Lynde does n't know whether to approve of our enterprise or not .
"She inclines to , when she remembers that Mr. and Mrs. Allan are in favor of it ; but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in the States is a count against it ."
So she is halting between two opinions and only success will justify us in Mrs. Lynde 's eyes .
"Priscilla is going to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting , and I expect it will be good , for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs in the family ."
I shall never forget the thrill it gave me when I found out that Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan was Priscilla 's aunt .
It seemed so wonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote ` Edgewood Days ' and ` The Rosebud Garden . ' ''
`` Where does Mrs. Morgan live ? ''
`` In Toronto .
"And Priscilla says she is coming to the Island for a visit next summer , and if it is possible Priscilla is going to arrange to have us meet her ."
That seems almost too good to be true -- but it 's something pleasant to imagine after you go to bed . ''
The Avonlea Village Improvement Society was an organized fact .
"Gilbert Blythe was president , Fred Wright vice-president , Anne Shirley secretary , and Diana Barry treasurer ."
"The `` Improvers , '' as they were promptly christened , were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of the members ."
"It was admitted that they could not expect to affect many improvements so late in the season ; but they meant to plan the next summer 's campaign , collect and discuss ideas , write and read papers , and , as Anne said , educate the public sentiment generally ."
"There was some disapproval , of course , and ... which the Improvers felt much more keenly ... a good deal of ridicule ."
Mr. Elisha Wright was reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization would be Courting Club .
Mrs. Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the Improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with geraniums .
Mr. Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after plans approved by the society .
Mr. James Spencer sent them word that he wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill .
Eben Wright told Anne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to keep his whiskers trimmed .
Mr. Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash his barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace curtains in the cowstable windows .
"Mr. Major Spencer asked Clifton Sloane , an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory , if it was true that everybody would have to have his milk-stand hand-painted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it ."
"In spite of ... or perhaps , human nature being what it is , because of ... this , the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they could hope to bring about that fall ."
"At the second meeting , in the Barry parlor , Oliver Sloane moved that they start a subscription to re-shingle and paint the hall ; Julia Bell seconded it , with an uneasy feeling that she was doing something not exactly ladylike ."
"Gilbert put the motion , it was carried unanimously , and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes ."
"The next thing was to appoint a committee , and Gertie Pye , determined not to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels , boldly moved that Miss Jane Andrews be chairman of said committee ."
"This motion being also duly seconded and carried , Jane returned the compliment by appointing Gertie on the committee , along with Gilbert , Anne , Diana , and Fred Wright ."
The committee chose their routes in private conclave .
"Anne and Diana were told off for the Newbridge road , Gilbert and Fred for the White Sands road , and Jane and Gertie for the Carmody road ."
"`` Because , '' explained Gilbert to Anne , as they walked home together through the Haunted Wood , `` the Pyes all live along that road and they wo n't give a cent unless one of themselves canvasses them . ''"
"""No! only just look,"" they said; ""there the fool sits still."""
"The next day when they went out to battle, they saw the lad sitting there still, so they laughed again, and made game of him; but as soon as ever they had ridden by, the lad ran again to the lime-tree, and all happened as on the first day. Every one wondered what strange champion it could be that had helped them, but no one got so near him as to say a word to him; and no one guessed it could be the lad; that's easy to understand."
"So when they went home at night, and saw the lad still sitting there on his hack, they burst out laughing at him again, and one of them shot an arrow at him and hit him in the leg. So he began to shriek and to bewail; 'twas enough to break one's heart; and so the King threw his pocket-handkerchief to him to bind his wound."
"When they went out to battle the third day, the lad still sat there."
"""Gee up! gee up!"" he said to his hack."
"""Nay, nay,"" said the King's men; ""if he won't stick there till he's starved to death."""
"And then they rode on, and laughed at him till they were fit to fall from their horses. When they were gone, he ran again to the lime, and came up to the battle just in the very nick of time. This day he slew the enemy's king, and then the war was over at once."
"When the battle was over, the King caught sight of his handkerchief, which the strange warrior had bound round his leg, and so it wasn't hard to find him out. So they took him with great joy between them to the palace, and the Princess, who saw him from her window, got so glad, no one can believe it."
"""Here comes my own true love,"" she said."
"Then he took the pot of ointment and rubbed himself on the leg, and after that he rubbed all the wounded, and so they all got well again in a moment."
"So he got the Princess to wife; but when he went down into the stable where his horse was on the day the wedding was to be, there it stood so dull and heavy, and hung its ears down, and wouldn't eat its corn. So when the young King for he was now a king, and had got half the kingdom spoke to him, and asked what ailed him, the Horse said:"
"""Now I have helped you on, and now I won't live any longer. So just take the sword, and cut my head off."""
"""No, I'll do nothing of the kind,"" said the young King; ""but you shall have all you want, and rest all your life."""
"""Well,"" said the Horse, ""if you don't do as I tell you, see if I don't take your life somehow."""
"So the King had to do what he asked; but when he swung the sword and was to cut his head off, he was so sorry he turned away his face, for he would not see the stroke fall. But as soon as ever he had cut off the head, there stood the loveliest Prince on the spot where the horse had stood."
"""Why, where in all the world did you come from?"" asked the King."
"""It was I who was a horse,"" said the Prince; ""for I was king of that land whose king you slew yesterday. He it was who threw this Troll's shape over me, and sold me to the Troll. But now he is slain I get my own again, and you and I will be neighbour kings, but war we will never make on one another."""
"And they didn't either; for they were friends as long as they lived, and each paid the other very many visits."
THE THREE BILLY-GOATS GRUFF
"Once on a time there were three Billy-goats, who were to go up to the hill-side to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was ""Gruff."""
"On the way up was a bridge over a burn they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly Troll, with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker."
So first of all came the youngest billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""Trip, trap! trip, trap!"" went the bridge."
"""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! it is only I, the tiniest billy-goat Gruff; and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, with such a small voice."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am,"" said the billy-goat; ""wait a bit till the second billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
A little while after came the second billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge."
"""WHO'S THAT tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! It's the second billy-goat Gruff, and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, who hadn't such a small voice."
"When it was morning the old woman said to the Raja's son, ""Now you must really go."""
"""Aunty,"" he answered, ""I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few days longer. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may see me."" So the old woman let him stay."
"When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely clothes and jewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room."
"There he said to his bag, ""Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring."""
"The bag gave him a glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Labam's hand gently to put on the ring, and she started up very much frightened."
"""Who are you?"" she said to the prince. ""Where do you come from? Why do you come to my room?"""
"""Do not be afraid, princess,"" he said; ""I am no thief. I am a great Raja's son. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to hunt, told me your name, and then I left my father and mother, and came to see you."""
"""Well,"" said the princess, ""as you are the son of such a great Raja, I will not have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that I wish to marry you."""
"The prince then returned to the old woman's house; and when morning came the princess said to her mother, ""The son of a great Raja has come to this country, and I wish to marry him."" Her mother told this to the king."
"""Good,"" said the king; ""but if this Raja's son wishes to marry my daughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill him. I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of this he must crush the oil in one day. If he cannot do this he shall die."""
"In the morning the Raja's son told the old woman that he intended to marry the princess. ""Oh,"" said the old woman, ""go away from this country, and do not think of marrying her. A great many Rajas and Rajas' sons have come here to marry her, and her father has had them all killed. He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do whatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the princess; if he cannot, the king will have him killed. But no one can do the things the king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas' sons who have tried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do go away."" But the prince would not listen to anything she said."
"The king sent for the prince to the old woman's house, and his servants brought the Raja's son to the king's court-house to the king."
"There the king gave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to crush all the oil out of it that day, and bring it next morning to him to the court-house. ""Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,"" he said to the prince, ""must first do all I tell him. If he cannot, then I have him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil out of this mustard seed, you will die."""
"The prince was very sorry when he heard this. ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day?"" he said to himself; ""and if I do not, the king will kill me."" He took the mustard seed to the old woman's house, and did not know what to do. At last he remembered the Ant-Raja, and the moment he did so, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to him. ""Why do you look so sad?"" said the Ant-Raja."
"The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not take the oil to the king to-morrow morning, he will kill me."""
"""Be happy,"" said the Ant-Raja; ""lie down and sleep; we will crush all the oil out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall take it to the king."" The Raja's son lay down and slept, and the ants crushed out the oil for him. The prince was very glad when he saw the oil."
"The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the king said, ""You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so, you must first fight with my two demons and kill them."" The king a long time ago had caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what to do with them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid to let them loose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country; and he did not know how to kill them. So all the kings and kings' sons who wanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these demons; ""for,"" said the king to himself, ""perhaps the demons may be killed, and then I shall be rid of them."""
"When he heard of the demons the Raja's son was very sad. ""What can I do?"" he said to himself. ""How can I fight with these two demons?"" Then he thought of his tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and said, ""Why are you so sad?"" The Raja's son answered, ""The king has ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them. How can I do this?"" ""Do not be frightened,"" said the tiger. ""Be happy. I and my wife will fight with them for you."""
"Then the Raja's son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were all gold and silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he put on the tigers to make them beautiful, and he took them to the king, and said to him, ""May these tigers fight your demons for me?"""
"""Yes,"" said the king, who did not care in the least who killed his demons, provided they were killed. ""Then call your demons,"" said the Raja's son, ""and these tigers will fight them."" The king did so, and the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons."
"""That is good,"" said the king. ""But you must do something else before I give you my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must go and beat it. If you cannot do this, I will kill you."""
"The Raja's son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old woman's house and sat on his bed. ""Little bed,"" he said, ""up in the sky is the king's kettle-drum. I want to go to it."" The bed flew up with him, and the Raja's son beat the drum, and the king heard him."
"Still, when he came down, the king would not give him his daughter."
"""You have,"" he said to the prince, ""done the three things I told you to do; but you must do one thing more."" ""If I can, I will,"" said the Raja's son."
"Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his court-house. It was a very, very thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax hatchet, and said, ""To-morrow morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet."""
"The Raja's son went back to the old woman's house. He was very sad, and thought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. ""I had his oil crushed out by the ants,"" he said to himself. ""I had his demons killed by the tigers. My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what can I do? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet?"""
"At night he went on his bed to see the princess. ""To-morrow,"" he said to her, ""your father will kill me."" ""Why?"" asked the princess."
"""He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet."
"How can I ever do that?"" said the Raja's son. ""Do not be afraid,"" said the princess; ""do as I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite easily."""
"Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to the prince."
"""To-morrow,"" she said, ""when no one is near you, you must say to the tree-trunk, 'The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in two by this hair.' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet's blade."""
"So the next afternoon, quite early, long before the beams of sunset announced the coming night, when everybody would be up and working, the two children got out of bed. Effie wrapped herself in a shawl of dragonproof muslin there was no time to make the frock and Harry made a horrid mess of himself with the patent dragon poison. It was warranted harmless to infants and invalids, so he felt quite safe."
"Then they joined hands and set out to walk to St. George's Church. As you know, there are many St. George's churches, but fortunately they took the turning that leads to the right one, and went along in the bright sunlight, feeling very brave and adventurous."
"There was no one about in the streets except dragons, and the place was simply swarming with them. Fortunately none of the dragons were just the right size for eating little boys and girls, or perhaps this story might have had to end here. There were dragons on the pavement, and dragons on the roadway, dragons basking on the front doorsteps of public buildings, and dragons preening their wings on the roofs in the hot afternoon sun."
"The town was quite green with them. Even when the children had gotten out of the town and were walking in the lanes, they noticed that the fields on each side were greener than usual with the scaly legs and tails; and some of the smaller sizes had made themselves asbestos nests in the flowering hawthorn hedges."
"Effie held her brother's hand very tight, and once when a fat dragon flopped against her ear she screamed out, and a whole flight of green dragons rose from the field at the sound, and sprawled away across the sky. The children could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew."
"""Oh, I want to go home,"" said Effie."
"""Don't be silly,"" said Harry. ""Surely you haven't forgotten about the Seven Champions and all the princes. People who are going to be their country's deliverers never scream and say they want to go home."""
"""And are we,"" asked Effie ""deliverers, I mean?"""
"""You'll see,"" said her brother, and on they went."
"When they came to St. George's Church they found the door open, and they walked right in but St. George was not there, so they walked around the churchyard outside, and presently they found the great stone tomb of St."
"George, with the figure of him carved in marble outside, in his armor and helmet, and with his hands folded on his breast."
"""How ever can we wake him?"" they said. Then Harry spoke to St."
"George but he would not answer; and he called, but St. George did not seem to hear; and then he actually tried to waken the great dragon-slayer by shaking his marble shoulders. But St. George took no notice."
"Then Effie began to cry, and she put her arms around St. George's neck as well as she could for the marble, which was very much in the way at the back, and she kissed the marble face, and she said: ""Oh, dear, good, kind St. George, please wake up and help us."""
"And at that St. George opened his eyes sleepily, and stretched himself and said: ""What's the matter, little girl?"""
So the children told him all about it; he turned over in his marble and leaned on one elbow to listen. But when he heard that there were so many dragons he shook his head.
"""It's no good,"" he said, ""they would be one too many for poor old George. You should have waked me before. I was always for a fair fight one man one dragon, was my motto."""
"Just then a flight of dragons passed overhead, and St. George half drew his sword."
But he shook his head again and pushed the sword back as the flight of dragons grew small in the distance.
"""I can't do anything,"" he said. ""Things have changed since my time. St."
"Andrew told me about it. They woke him up over the engineers' strike, and he came to talk to me. He says everything is done by machinery now; there must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way, what sort of weather have you been having lately?"""
"This seemed so careless and unkind that Harry would not answer, but Effie said patiently, ""It has been very fine. Father says it is the hottest weather there has ever been in this country."""
"""Ah, I guessed as much,"" said the Champion, thoughtfully. ""Well, the only thing would be ... dragons can't stand wet and cold, that's the only thing. If you could find the taps."""
St. George was beginning to settle down again on his stone slab.
"""Good night, very sorry I can't help you,"" he said, yawning behind his marble hand."
"""Oh, but you can,"" cried Effie. ""Tell us what taps?"""
"""Oh, like in the bathroom,"" said St. George, still more sleepily. ""And there's a looking glass, too; shows you all the world and what's going on. St. Denis told me about it; said it was a very pretty thing. I'm sorry I can't good night."""
And he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep again in a moment.
"""We shall never find the taps,"" said Harry. ""I say, wouldn't it be awful if St. George woke up when there was a dragon near, the size that eats champions?"""
"Effie pulled off her dragonproof veil. ""We didn't meet any the size of the dining room as we came along,"" she said. ""I daresay we shall be quite safe."""
"So she covered St. George with the veil, and Harry rubbed off as much as he could of the dragon poison onto St. George's armor, so as to make everything quite safe for him."
"""We might hide in the church till it is dark,"" he said, ""and then """
"The next day it rained, and the next, and the next. Mrs. Goldfinch did not dare leave her nest to make calls, lest the cold raindrops should chill and hurt the four tiny birds that lay curled up in their shells."
"At last the weather was warm and sunshiny, and Mrs. Goldfinch and some of her bird neighbors went to call on Mrs. Mourning Dove. They found her just coming from a wheat-field, where she had been to get grain. ""Oh, you poor creature!"" they cried. ""We have heard all about it. Your poor babies! How sorry we are for you!"""
"Mrs. Mourning Dove looked from one to another as though she did not know what to make of it. ""What do you mean?"" she cooed. ""My babies are well and doing finely. Won't you come to see them?"""
"Then it was the turn of the other birds to be surprised. ""Why,"" they chirped, ""we heard that your eggs had fallen through your nest and had broken and killed the tiny Dove babies inside. Is it true?"""
"""Not a word of it,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove. ""The nest is all right, and the eggs were not broken until my two little darlings broke them with their sharp beaks."""
"""Here they are,"" she added, fondly. ""Did you ever see such pretty ones?"
"See him open his bill, the dear! And did you ever see such a neck as she has? Mr. Mourning Dove thinks there never were such children."""
"""But do you feel perfectly safe to leave them in that nest?"" asked the Oriole politely. ""My babies are so restless that I should be afraid to trust them in it."""
"""That is what people always say,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove, with a happy coo, ""and I fear that I am a rather poor housekeeper, but it runs in our family. Mr. Mourning Dove and I have raised many pairs of children, and they never rolled out, or tumbled through, or blew away, and I do not worry about these. I shall never be thrifty like you good builders, perhaps, but I'm sure you cannot love your little ones any more than I do mine. It was very kind of you to be so sorry for me when you heard I was in trouble. I think I have the best neighbors in the world."""
"When her callers went away, they could not say enough about Mrs."
"Mourning Dove's pleasant ways, and her gentle, well-behaved children."
"""It is too bad she is such a poor nest-maker,"" the Vireo said, ""and I understand now what she meant when she told me that they sometimes used old Robins' nests for their young. She said they flattened them out and added a few twigs, and that they did finely. I thought it very queer in them to do so, but perhaps if I had not been a good builder I should have done the same thing."""
"""Perhaps we all would,"" the others agreed. ""She certainly is a very pleasant bird, and she is bringing up her children well. Mr. Mourning Dove seems to think her perfect. We won't worry any more about her."""
THE YOUNG BLUE JAY WHO WAS NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID
Everybody who is acquainted with the Blue Jays knows that they are a very brave family. That is the best thing that you can say about them.
"To be sure, they dress very handsomely, and there is no prettier sight, on a fine winter morning, than a flock of Blue Jays flitting from branch to branch, dining off the acorns on the oak trees, and cocking their crested heads on one side as they look over the country. They are great talkers then, and are always telling each other just what to do; yet none of them ever do what they are told to, so they might just as well stop giving advice."
"The other people of the forest do not like the Blue Jays at all, and if one of them gets into trouble they will not help him out. This always has been so, and it always will be so. If it could be winter all the time, the Blue Jays could be liked well enough, for in cold weather they eat seeds and nuts and do not quarrel so much with others. It is in the summer that they become bad neighbors. Then they live in the thickest part of the woods and raise families of tiny, fuzzy babies in their great coarse nests. It is then, too, that they change their beautiful coats, and while the old feathers are dropping off and the new ones are growing they are not at all pretty. Oh, then is the time to beware of the Blue Jays!"
"They do very little talking during the summer, and the forest people do not know when they are coming, unless they see a flutter of blue wings among the branches. The Blue Jays have a reason for keeping still then."
"They are doing sly things, and they do not want to be found out."
The wee babies grow fast and their mouths are always open for more food.
"Father and Mother Blue Jay spend all their time in marketing, and they are not content with seeds and berries. They visit the nests of their bird neighbors, and then something very sad happens. When the Blue Jays go to a nest there may be four eggs in it; but when they go away there will not be any left, nothing but pieces of broken egg-shell. It is very, very sad, but this is another of the things which will always be so, and all that the other birds can do is to watch and drive the Jays away."
"There was once a young Blue Jay in the forest who was larger than his brothers and sisters, and kept crowding them toward the edge of the nest. When their father came with a bit of food for them, he would stretch his legs and flutter his wings and reach up for the first bite."
"And because he was the largest and the strongest, he usually got it."
"Sometimes, too, the first bite was so big that there was nothing left for anyone else to bite at. He was a very greedy fellow, and he had no right to take more than his share, just because he happened to be the first of the family to break open the shell, or because he grew fast."
"This same young Blue Jay used to brag about what he would do when he got out of the nest, and his mother told him that he would get into trouble if he were not careful. She said that even Blue Jays had to look out for danger."
"""Huh!"" said the young Blue Jay; ""who's afraid?"""
"""Now you talk like a bully,"" said Mother Blue Jay, ""for people who are really brave are always willing to be careful."""
"But the young Blue Jay only crowded his brothers and sisters more than usual, and thought, inside his foolish little pin-feathery head, that when he got a chance, he'd show them what courage was."
"After a while his chance came. All the small birds had learned to flutter from branch to branch, and to hop quite briskly over the ground."
"One afternoon they went to a part of the forest where the ground was damp and all was strange. The father and mother told their children to keep close together and they would take care of them; but the foolish young Blue Jay wanted a chance to go alone, so he hid behind a tree until the others were far ahead, and then he started off another way. It was great fun for a time, and when the feathered folk looked down at him he raised his crest higher than ever and thought how he would scare them when he was a little older."
"The young Blue Jay was just thinking about this when he saw something long and shining lying in the pathway ahead. He remembered what his father had said about snakes, and about one kind that wore rattles on their tails. He wondered if this one had a rattle, and he made up his mind to see how it was fastened on. ""I am a Blue Jay,"" he said to himself, ""and I was never yet afraid of anything."""
"In a gloomy prison, in a foreign land, lay Richard I, King of England."
"He had been with some other kings to a great war in the Holy Land, where he had won battles, and taken cities, and gained much honour. Men called him Richard Lion-heart, because he was as brave as a lion in fighting, and his soldiers loved him and would follow him into any danger. One strong city, called Acre, held out for nearly two years against the armies of the other kings, but when Richard arrived it gave way almost at once."
"Because of his bravery, and his many victories, all men praised King Richard, and this made some of the other kings hate him, for they were jealous that he should have more honour than they. When he was on his way back to England, one of these envious men seized him secretly, and threw him into prison."
"And now poor Richard could fight no more, nor could he see the blue sky, and the green fields which he loved. One day, as he sat sad and lonely in his prison, he heard a voice singing, beneath the window. He started."
"""Surely,"" said he, ""that is the voice of my old friend Blondel, and that is the song we used to sing together."" When the song was ended, the king sang it again in a low voice. Then there was a joyful cry from the man outside, and Richard knew that it was indeed his friend."
"Blondel had journeyed many days seeking his lost master. Now he hastened to England, and told the people where to find their king, and very soon Richard was set free, and went back to his own land."
The White Ship
"The night was dark, and a stormy wind was blowing, when the White Ship set sail from the shore of France. Prince William of England and his sister and their young friends were going back to their own land, after a visit to the French king."
"The English king, Henry I, with his courtiers, had sailed earlier, and had now almost reached home. But the prince would not go with them, he wished to make merry before starting."
"There had been eating, and drinking, and dancing, and singing on board the White Ship, and everyone was merry."
"But the sailors had drunk so much wine that they could not see to steer aright. Soon there was a crash, and the ship trembled. It had struck a rock, and was sinking."
"Then the sounds of merriment were changed to cries of fear. ""Save us!"""
"shrieked the terrified people. ""Save the prince,"" cried the captain, ""the rest of us must die!"" There was only one small boat on the ship, and Prince William was put into this, and rowed away. But he had not gone far, when he heard his sister crying to him to save her."
"""Go back!"" shouted he. The boat was rowed back, but when it came near the ship, so many people jumped into it, that it was overturned and all in it were drowned."
"Soon the White Ship sank also, and of all the gay company upon it only one man was saved."
"When King Henry heard that his only son was dead, he was very sorrowful, and it is said that no man ever again saw a smile upon his face."
Joan of Arc
"In a village in the green country of France, there once lived a girl named Joan. She spent her days in sewing and spinning, and in minding her father's sheep."
"At that time there was a sad war in France, and the English had won many battles. Joan was grieved to hear of the trouble of her country. She thought of it night and day, and one night she dreamt that an angel came, and told her to go and help the French prince."
"When Joan told her friends of this dream, they laughed at her."
"""How can a poor girl help the prince?"" asked they."
"""I do not know,"" replied Joan; ""but I must go, for God has sent me."" So she went to the prince, and said: ""Sir, my name is Joan. God has sent me to help you to win the crown of France."""
"They gave Joan a suit of white armour, and a white horse, and set her at the head of the army. She led the soldiers to fight, and the rough men thought she was an angel, and fought so bravely that they won many battles."
Then the prince was crowned King of France.
"When this was done, Joan felt that her work was over. ""I would that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and my brothers; they would be so glad to see me,"" pleaded she. But the king would not let her go. So Joan stayed; but her time of victory was past. Soon, she was taken prisoner by the English, and cruelly burned to death. She died as bravely as she had lived, and her name will never be forgotten."
AFLOAT WITH A TIGER.
"A traveler in faraway India relates the following thrilling adventure with a tiger: From the heavy rain which falls upon Indian mountains the low-lying country is liable to such sudden floods that every year many beasts, and even human beings, are drowned ere they can make their escape to the higher grounds. On one occasion a terrible flood came up so suddenly that I had to spend a day and night in an open canoe in consequence, during which time I had good opportunities of seeing the good and bad effects produced by them. I lived at the time in a mat house, situated upon a hill which I supposed was quite above high-water mark, but an old Mahometan gentleman having told me that, when he was a little boy, he recollected the water once rising higher than the hill, I took the precaution of keeping a canoe in a small ditch close at hand."
"The rainy season began, and daily the river rose higher. One morning we noticed that the mountain tops were covered with heavy banks of dark clouds, though no rain fell out on the plain where we were; but we noticed many animals, a leopard among others, sneak out of the high grass and make for hilly ground. The most curious thing, however, was the smart manner in which rats and even grasshoppers came scampering away from the threatening danger. These latter came in such crowds toward my bungalow that not only the fowls about the premises had a good feed on them, but kites and crows began to swoop down in such numbers that the air was filled with their cries and the noise of their rushing wings."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! don't take me, wait a little till the big billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Very well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
But just then up came the big billy-goat Gruff.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge, for the billy-goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him."
"""WHO'S THAT tramping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""IT'S I! THE BIG BILLY-GOAT GRUFF,"" said the billy-goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" roared the Troll."
"""Well, come along! I've got two spears,             And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;             I've got besides two curling-stones,             And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones."""
"That was what the big billy-goat said; and so he flew at the Troll and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the burn, and after that he went up to the hill-side. There the billy-goats got so fat they were scarce able to walk home again; and if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why they're still fat; and so:"
"Snip, snap, snout,                         This tale's told out."
THE THREE PRINCESSES IN THE BLUE MOUNTAIN
"There were once upon a time a King and Queen who had no children, and they took it so much to heart that they hardly ever had a happy moment. One day the King stood in the portico and looked out over the big meadows and all that was his. But he felt he could have no enjoyment out of it all, since he did not know what would become of it after his time. As he stood there pondering, an old beggar woman came up to him and asked him for a trifle in heaven's name. She greeted him and curtsied, and asked what ailed the King, since he looked so sad."
"""You can't do anything to help me, my good woman,"" said the King; ""it's no use telling you."""
"""I am not so sure about that,"" said the beggar woman. ""Very little is wanted when luck is in the way. The King is thinking that he has no heir to his crown and kingdom, but he need not mourn on that account,"""
"she said. ""The Queen shall have three daughters, but great care must be taken that they do not come out under the open heavens before they are all fifteen years old; otherwise a snowdrift will come and carry them away."""
"When the time came the Queen had a beautiful baby girl; the year after she had another, and the third year she also had a girl."
"The King and Queen were glad beyond all measure; but although the King was very happy, he did not forget to set a watch at the Palace door, so that the Princesses should not get out."
"As they grew up they became both fair and beautiful, and all went well with them in every way. Their only sorrow was that they were not allowed to go out and play like other children. For all they begged and prayed their parents, and for all they besought the sentinel, it was of no avail; go out they must not before they were fifteen years old, all of them."
"So one day, not long before the fifteenth birthday of the youngest Princess, the King and the Queen were out driving, and the Princesses were standing at the window and looking out. The sun was shining, and everything looked so green and beautiful that they felt that they must go out, happen what might. So they begged and entreated and urged the sentinel, all three of them, that he should let them down into the garden. ""He could see for himself how warm and pleasant it was; no snowy weather could come on such a day."" Well, he didn't think it looked much like it either, and if they must go they had better go, the soldier said; but it must only be for a minute, and he himself would go with them and look after them."
"When they got down into the garden they ran up and down, and filled their laps with flowers and green leaves, the prettiest they could find. At last they could manage no more, but just as they were going indoors they caught sight of a large rose at the other end of the garden. It was many times prettier than any they had gathered, so they must have that also. But just as they bent down to take the rose a big dense snowdrift came and carried them away."
"There was great mourning over the whole country, and the King made known from all the churches that any one who could save the Princesses should have half the kingdom and his golden crown and whichever princess he liked to choose."
"You can well understand there were plenty who wanted to gain half the kingdom, and a princess into the bargain; so there were people of both high and low degree who set out for all parts of the country. But there was no one who could find the Princesses, or even get any tidings of them."
"When all the grand and rich people in the country had had their turn, a captain and a lieutenant came to the Palace, and wanted to try their luck. The King fitted them out both with silver and gold, and wished them success on their journey."
"Then came a soldier, who lived with his mother in a little cottage some way from the Palace. He had dreamt one night that he also was trying to find the Princesses. When the morning came he still remembered what he had dreamt, and told his mother about it."
"""Some witchery must have got hold of you,"" said the woman, ""but you must dream the same thing three nights running, else there is nothing in it."" And the next two nights the same thing happened; he had the same dream, and he felt he must go. So he washed himself and put on his uniform, and went into the kitchen at the Palace. It was the day after the captain and the lieutenant had set out."
"""You had better go home again,"" said the King, ""the Princesses are beyond your reach, I should say; and besides, I have spent so much money on outfits that I have nothing left to-day. You had better come back another time."""
"""If I go, I must go to-day,"" said the soldier. ""Money I do not want; I only need a drop in my flask and some food in my wallet,"" he said; ""but it must be a good walletful as much meat and bacon as I can carry."""
"Yes, that he might have if that was all he wanted."
"So he set off, and he had not gone many miles before he overtook the captain and the lieutenant."
"""Where are you going?"" asked the captain, when he saw the man in uniform."
"So one day, 'twas on a Thursday evening late at the fall of the year, the weather was so wild and rough outside, and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and wind blew, till the walls of the cottage shook again. There they all sat round the fire, busy with this thing and that. But just then, all at once something gave three taps on the window-pane. Then the father went out to see what was the matter; and, when he got out of doors, what should he see but a great big White Bear."
"""Good-evening to you!"" said the White Bear."
"""The same to you!"" said the man."
"""Will you give me your youngest daughter? If you will, I'll make you as rich as you are now poor,"" said the Bear."
"Well, the man would not be at all sorry to be so rich; but still he thought he must have a bit of a talk with his daughter first; so he went in and told them how there was a great White Bear waiting outside, who had given his word to make them so rich if he could only have the youngest daughter."
"The lassie said ""No!"" outright. Nothing could get her to say anything else; so the man went out and settled it with the White Bear that he should come again the next Thursday evening and get an answer."
"Meantime he talked his daughter over, and kept on telling her of all the riches they would get, and how well off she would be herself; and so at last she thought better of it, and washed and mended her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and was ready to start. I can't say her packing gave her much trouble."
"Next Thursday evening came the White Bear to fetch her, and she got upon his back with her bundle, and off they went. So, when they had gone a bit of the way, the White Bear said:"
"""Are you afraid?"""
"""No,"" she wasn't."
"""Well! mind and hold tight by my shaggy coat, and then there's nothing to fear,"" said the Bear."
"So she rode a long, long way, till they came to a great steep hill."
"There, on the face of it, the White Bear gave a knock, and a door opened, and they came into a castle where there were many rooms all lit up; rooms gleaming with silver and gold; and there, too, was a table ready laid, and it was all as grand as grand could be. Then the White Bear gave her a silver bell; and when she wanted anything, she was only to ring it, and she would get it at once."
"Well, after she had eaten and drunk, and evening wore on, she got sleepy after her journey, and thought she would like to go to bed, so she rang the bell; and she had scarce taken hold of it before she came into a chamber where there was a bed made, as fair and white as any one would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains and gold fringe. All that was in the room was gold or silver; but when she had gone to bed and put out the light, a man came and laid himself alongside her. That was the White Bear, who threw off his beast shape at night; but she never saw him, for he always came after she had put out the light, and before the day dawned he was up and off again. So things went on happily for a while, but at last she began to get silent and sorrowful; for there she went about all day alone, and she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters. So one day, when the White Bear asked what it was that she lacked, she said it was so dull and lonely there, and how she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters, and that was why she was so sad and sorrowful, because she couldn't get to them."
"""Well, well!"" said the Bear, ""perhaps there's a cure for all this; but you must promise me one thing, not to talk alone with your mother, but only when the rest are by to hear; for she'll take you by the hand and try to lead you into a room alone to talk; but you must mind and not do that, else you'll bring bad luck on both of us."""
"So one Sunday the White Bear came and said, now they could set off to see her father and mother. Well, off they started, she sitting on his back; and they went far and long. At last they came to a grand house, and there her brothers and sisters were running about out of doors at play, and everything was so pretty, 'twas a joy to see."
"""This is where your father and mother live now,"" said the White Bear; ""but don't forget what I told you, else you'll make us both unlucky."""
"""No! bless her, she'd not forget;"" and when she had reached the house, the White Bear turned right about and left her."
"Then, when she went in to see her father and mother, there was such joy, there was no end to it. None of them thought they could thank her enough for all she had done for them. Now, they had everything they wished, as good as good could be, and they all wanted to know how she got on where she lived."
"Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did; she had all she wished. What she said beside I don't know, but I don't think any of them had the right end of the stick, or that they got much out of her. But so, in the afternoon, after they had done dinner, all happened as the White Bear had said. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her bedroom; but she minded what the White Bear had said, and wouldn't go upstairs."
"""Oh! what we have to talk about will keep!"" she said, and put her mother off. But, somehow or other, her mother got round her at last, and she had to tell her the whole story. So she said, how every night when she had gone to bed a man came and lay down beside her as soon as she had put out the light; and how she never saw him, because he was always up and away before the morning dawned; and how she went about woeful and sorrowing, for she thought she should so like to see him; and how all day long she walked about there alone; and how dull and dreary and lonesome it was."
"""My!"" said her mother; ""it may well be a Troll you slept with! But now I'll teach you a lesson how to set eyes on him. I'll give you a bit of candle, which you can carry home in your bosom; just light that while he is asleep, but take care not to drop the tallow on him."""
"Yes! she took the candle and hid it in her bosom, and as night drew on, the White Bear came and fetched her away."
"But when they had gone a bit of the way, the White Bear asked if all hadn't happened as he had said."
"""Well, she couldn't say it hadn't."""
"""Now, mind,"" said he, ""if you have listened to your mother's advice, you have brought bad luck on us both, and then, all that has passed between us will be as nothing."""
"""No,"" she said, ""she hadn't listened to her mother's advice."""
"So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the old story over again. There came a man and lay down beside her; but at dead of night, when she heard he slept, she got up and struck a light, lit the candle, and let the light shine on him, and so she saw that he was the loveliest Prince one ever set eyes on, and she fell so deep in love with him on the spot, that she thought she couldn't live if she didn't give him a kiss there and then. And so she did; but as she kissed him, she dropped three hot drops of tallow on his shirt, and he woke up."
"""What have you done?"" he cried; ""now you have made us both unlucky, for had you held out only this one year, I had been freed. For I have a step-mother who has bewitched me, so that I am a White Bear by day, and a Man by night. But now all ties are snapt between us; now I must set off from you to her. She lives in a Castle which stands East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and there, too, is a Princess, with a nose three ells long, and she's the wife I must have now."""
"She wept and took it ill, but there was no help for it; go he must."
Then she asked if she mightn't go with him.
"The reason for shooting him stopped yesterday I heard Father say so so it wouldn't be fair, anyhow. I'm very sorry; but I can't so there!"""
"The sportsman said nothing, only he shook his fist at Jane, and then he got on the slide and tried to go toward the Crystal Palace which was not easy, because that way is uphill. So they left him trying, and went on."
"Before they started, the white grouse thanked them in a few pleasant, well-chosen words, and then they took a sideways slanting run and started off again on the great slide, and so away toward the North Pole and the twinkling, beautiful lights."
"The great slide went on and on, and the lights did not seem to come much nearer, and the white silence wrapped around them as they slid along the wide, icy path. Then once again the silence was broken to bits by someone calling: ""Hey! You there! Stop!"""
"""Tumble for your life!"" cried George, and tumbled as before, stopping in the only possible way, and Jane stopped on top of him, and they crawled to the edge and came suddenly on a butterfly collector, who was looking for specimens with a pair of blue glasses and a blue net and a blue book with colored plates."
"""Excuse me,"" said the collector, ""but have you such a thing as a needle about you a very long needle?"""
"""I have a needle book,"" replied Jane, politely, ""but there aren't any needles in it now. George took them all to do the things with pieces of cork in the 'Boy's Own Scientific Experimenter' and 'The Young Mechanic.' He did not do the things, but he did for the needles."""
"""Curiously enough,"" said the collector, ""I too wish to use the needle in connection with cork."""
"""I have a hatpin in my hood,"" said Jane. ""I fastened the fur with it when it caught in the nail on the greenhouse door. It is very long and sharp would that do?"""
"""One could but try,"" said the collector, and Jane began to feel for the pin. But George pinched her arm and whispered, ""Ask what he wants it for."" Then the collector had to own that he wanted the pin to stick through the great Arctic moth, ""a magnificent specimen,"" he added, ""which I am most anxious to preserve."""
"And there, sure enough, in the collector's butterfly net sat the great Arctic moth, listening attentively to the conversation."
"""Oh, I couldn't!"" cried Jane. And while George was explaining to the collector that they would really rather not, Jane opened the blue folds of the butterfly net, and asked the moth quietly if it would please step outside for a moment. And it did."
"When the collector saw that the moth was free, he seemed less angry than grieved."
"""Well, well,"" said he, ""here's a whole Arctic expedition thrown away! I shall have to go home and fit out another. And that means a lot of writing to the papers and things. You seem to be a singularly thoughtless little girl."""
"So they went on, leaving him too, trying to go uphill towards the Crystal Palace."
"When the great white Arctic moth had returned thanks in a suitable speech, George and Jane took a sideways slanting run and started sliding again, between the star-lamps along the great slide toward the North Pole. They went faster and faster, and the lights ahead grew brighter and brighter so that they could not keep their eyes open, but had to blink and wink as they went and then suddenly the great slide ended in an immense heap of snow, and George and Jane shot right into it because they could not stop themselves, and the snow was soft, so that they went in up to their very ears."
"When they had picked themselves out and thumped each other on the back to get rid of the snow, they shaded their eyes and looked, and there, right in front of them, was the wonder of wonders the North Pole towering high and white and glistening, like an ice-lighthouse, and it was quite, quite close, so that you had to put your head as far back as it would go, and farther, before you could see the high top of it. It was made entirely of ice. You will hear grown-up people talk a great deal of nonsense about the North Pole, and when you are grown up, it is even possible that you may talk nonsense about it yourself (the most unlikely things do happen) but deep down in your heart you must always remember that the North Pole is made of clear ice, and could not possibly, if you come to think of it, be made of anything else."
"All around the Pole, making a bright ring about it, were hundreds of little fires, and the flames of them did not flicker and twist, but went up blue and green and rosy and straight like the stalks of dream lilies."
"Jane said so, but George said they were as straight as ramrods."
"And these flames were the Aurora Borealis, which the children had seen as far away as Forest Hill."
"The ground was quite flat, and covered with smooth, hard snow, which shone and sparkled like the top of a birthday cake that has been iced at home. The ones done at the shops do not shine and sparkle, because they mix flour with the icing sugar."
"""It is like a dream,"" said Jane."
"And George said, ""It is the North Pole. Just think of the fuss people always make about getting here and it was no trouble at all, really."""
"""I daresay lots of people have gotten here,"" said Jane, dismally. ""It's not the getting here I see that it's the getting back again."
"Perhaps no one will ever know that we have been here, and the robins will cover us with leaves and """
"""Nonsense,"" said George. ""There aren't any robins, and there aren't any leaves. It's just the North Pole, that's all, and I've found it; and now I shall try to climb up and plant the British flag on the top my handkerchief will do; and if it really is the North Pole, my pocket compass Uncle James gave me will spin around and around, and then I shall know. Come on."""
"So Jane came on; and when they got close to the clear, tall, beautiful flames they saw that there was a great, queer-shaped lump of ice all around the bottom of the Pole clear, smooth, shining ice, that was deep, beautiful Prussian blue, like icebergs, in the thick parts, and all sorts of wonderful, glimmery, shimmery, changing colors in the thin parts, like the cut-glass chandelier in Grandmamma's house in London."
"""It is a very curious shape,"" said Jane. ""It's almost like"" she moved back a step to get a better view of it ""it's almost like a dragon."""
"""It's much more like the lampposts on the Thames Embankment,"" said George, who had noticed a curly thing like a tail that went twisting up the North Pole."
"""Oh, George,"" cried Jane, ""it is a dragon; I can see its wings."
"Whatever shall we do?"""
"And, sure enough, it was a dragon a great, shining, winged, scaly, clawy, big-mouthed dragon made of pure ice. It must have gone to sleep curled around the hole where the warm steam used to come up from the middle of the earth, and then when the earth got colder, and the column of steam froze and was turned into the North Pole, the dragon must have got frozen in his sleep frozen too hard to move and there he stayed."
"George Whitefield the eloquent, who often addressed audiences (even in those days, when advertising was still in its infancy and the advance agent was unheard of) of from five thousand to forty thousand people, founded an orphan asylum. One audience consisted of sixty thousand people. The money from this work all went to help and sustain the orphan asylum. While reading of him we are reminded of our own Dr. Talmage, who is said to be the wealthiest apostle on the road."
"The trustees of Georgia limited the size of a man's farm, did not allow women to inherit land, and forbade the importation of rum or of slaves."
"Several of these rules were afterwards altered, so that as late as 1893 at least a gentleman from Washington, D.C., well known for his truth and honesty, saw rum inside the State twice, though Bourbon whiskey was preferred. Slaves also were found inside the State, and the negro is seen there even now; but the popularity of a negro baby is nothing now to what it was at the time when this class of goods went up to the top notch."
Need I add that after a while the people became dissatisfied with these rules and finally the whole matter was ceded to the crown? From this time on Georgia remained a royal province up to the Revolution. Since that very little has been said about ceding it to the crown.
"North Carolina also remained an English colony up to the same period, and, though one of the original thirteen Colonies, is still far more sparsely settled than some of the Western States."
"Virginia Dare was the first white child born in America. She selected Roanoke, now in North Carolina, in August, 1587, as her birthplace. She was a grand-daughter of the Governor, John White. Her fate, like that of the rest of the colony, is unknown to this day."
"The author begs leave to express his thanks here for the valuable      aid furnished him by the following works, viz.: ""The Horse and his      Diseases,"" by Mr. Astor; ""Life and Times of John Oglethorpe,"" by      Elias G. Merritt; ""How to Make the Garden Pay,"" by Peter Henderson;      ""Over the Purple Hills,"" by Mrs. Churchill, of Denver, Colorado,      and ""He Played on the Harp of a Thousand Strings, and the Spirits      of Just Men Made Perfect,"" by S. P. Avery."
CHAPTER XI.
INTERCOLONIAL AND INDIAN WARS.
"Intercolonial and Indian wars furnished excitement now from 1689 into the early part of the eighteenth century. War broke out in Europe between the French and English, and the Colonies had to take sides, as did also the Indians."
"Canadians and Indians would come down into York State or New England, burn a town, tomahawk quite a number of people, then go back on snow-shoes, having entered the town on rubbers, like a decayed show with no printing."
"There was an attack on Haverhill in March, 1697, and a Mr. Dustin was at work in the field. He ran to his house and got his seven children ahead of him, while with his gun he protected their rear till he got them away safely. Mrs. Dustin, however, who ran back into the house to remove a pie from the oven as she feared it was burning, was captured, and, with a boy of the neighborhood, taken to an island in the Merrimac, where the Indians camped. At night she woke the boy, told him how to hit an Indian with a tomahawk so that ""the subsequent proceedings would interest him no more,"" and that evening the two stole forth while the ten Indians slept, knocked in their thinks, scalped them to prove their story, and passed on to safety. Mrs. Dustin kept those scalps for many years, showing them to her friends to amuse them."
"King William's War lasted eight years. Queen Anne's War lasted from 1702 to 1713. The brunt of this war fell on New England. Our forefathers had to live in block-houses, with barbed-wire fences around them, and carry their guns with them all the time. From planting the Indian with a shotgun, they soon got to planting their corn with the same agricultural instrument in the stony soil."
"The French and Spanish tried to take Charleston in 1706, but were repulsed with great loss, consisting principally of time which they might have employed in raising frogs' legs and tantalizing a bull at so much per tant."
"This war lasted eleven years, including stops, and was ended by the treaty of Utrecht (pronounced you-trecked)."
"After this, what was called the Spanish War continued between England and Spain for some time. An attempt to capture Georgia was made, and a garrison established itself there, with good prospects of taking in the State under Spanish rule, but our able friend Oglethorpe, the Henry W."
"Grady of his time, managed to accidentally mislay a letter which fell into the enemy's hands, the contents of which showed that enormous reinforcements were expected at any moment. This was swallowed comfortably by the commander, who blew up his impregnable works, changed the address of his Atlanta Constitution, and sailed for home."
"Oglethorpe wore a wig, but was otherwise one of our greatest minds. It is said that anybody at a distance of two miles on a clear day could readily distinguish that it was a wig, and yet he died believing that no one had ever probed his great mystery and that his wig would rise with him at the playing of the last trump."
"King George's War, which extended over four years, succeeded, but did not amount to anything except the capture of Cape Breton by English and Colonial troops. Cape Breton was called the Gibraltar of America; but a Yankee farmer who has raised flax on an upright farm for twenty years does not mind scaling a couple of Gibraltars before breakfast; so, without any West Point knowledge regarding engineering, they walked up the hill, and those who were alive when they got to the top took it. It was no Balaklava business and no dumb animal show, but simply revealed the fact that brave men fighting for their eight-dollar homes and a mass of children are disagreeable people to meet on the battle-field."
"The French and Indian War lasted nine years, viz., from 1754 to 1763."
"From Quebec to New Orleans the French owned the land, and mixed up a good deal socially with the Indians, so that the slender settlement along the coast had arrayed against it this vast line of northern and western forts, and the Indians, who were mostly friendly with the French, united with them in several instances and showed them some new styles of barbarism which up to that time they had never known about."
The half-breed is always half French and half Indian.
"The English owned all lands lying on one side of the Ohio, the French on the other, which led a great chief to make a P. P. C. call on Governor Dinwiddie, and during the conversation to inquire with some naïveté where the Indian came in. No answer was ever received."
"We pause here to ask the question, Why did the pale-face usurp the lands of the Indians without remuneration? It was because the Indian was not orthodox. He may have been lazy from a Puritanical stand-point, and he may also have hunted on the twenty-seventh Sunday after Easter; but still was it not right that he should have received a dollar or two per county for the United States? No one would have felt it, and possibly it might have saved the lives of innocent people."
"Verbum sap., however, comes in here with peculiar appropriateness, and the massive-browed historian passes on."
"The French had three forts along in the Middle States, as they are now called, and Western Pennsylvania; and George Washington, of whom more will be said in the twelfth chapter, was sent to ask the French to remove these forts. He started at once."
"The commanders were some of them arrogant, but the general, St. Pierre, treated him with great respect, refusing, however, to yield the ground discovered by La Salle and Marquette. The author had the pleasure of being arrested in Paris in 1889, and he feels of a truth, as he often does, that there can be no more polite people in the world than the French. Arrested under all circumstances and in many lands, the author can place his hand on his heart and say that he would go hundreds of miles to be arrested by a John Darm."
"Washington returned four hundred miles through every kind of danger, including a lunch at Altoona, where he stopped twenty minutes."
"""A woman!"" chorused the group."
"""That's what I said."""
"""Where is she now?"""
"""I don't know. I didn't see her at all. I grappled with the first"
"person I ran into. She must have gone out as you came in."" Boyd"
"indicated the side door, which was still ajar."
"""It's a lie,"" screamed Marsh."
"""It's the truth,"" stoutly maintained Emerson, ""and there was a man with"
"her, too. Who was she, Marsh? Who was the man?"""
"""She--she--I don't know."""
"""Don't lie."""
"""I'm hurt,"" reiterated the stricken man, feebly. Then, seeing the"
"bewilderment in the faces about him, he burst out anew: ""Don't stand"
"there like a lot of fools. Why don't you get him?"""
"""If I stabbed him I must have had a knife,"" Emerson said, again"
"checking the forward movement. ""You may search me if you like. See?"" He"
opened his coat and displayed his belt.
"""He's got a six-shooter,"" some one said."
"""Yes, and I may use it,"" said Emerson, quietly."
"Inside, a shadow of concern moved like a quick cloud across her"
"beautiful face. ""You don't look well, Frank."""
"""I'm quite all right, really. Haven't been sleeping too well, but"
"there's been a lot on my mind."""
"""I've been hoping you'd phone."""
"""I wanted to but there didn't seem to be anything to say. Nothing except"
"that I'm sorry I let you down so miserably."""
"""Frank! You didn't. You really didn't. It was just that--oh, it's not"
"important any more."""
"""No. It's not important now."""
"""Would you like a drink?"""
"""Thanks, no. I've come to say good-bye."""
"""Good-bye?"""
"""Yes. I'm leaving Park Hill--leaving New York. I'm going into a small"
Minnesota hospital to finish my internship. Then I'll probably practice
"out there somewhere."""
Behind the new glitter of her eyes there was stark misery.
"""Frank--Frank--what went wrong with us?"""
The appeal was a labored whisper.
"'None that can help you,' he replied; 'some that you can help.'"
"She started and looked at him wildly, her lips apart, her eyes wide"
"with hope, fear, expectation. What did he mean? What could he mean by"
this new turn? Ha!
"She had her face towards the window, and dark as the room was"
growing--outside the light was failing fast--he read the thought in
"her eyes, and nodded."
"'The Waldgrave?' he said lightly. 'Yes, he is alive, Countess, at"
present; and your steward also.'
"'They are prisoners?' she whispered, her cheeks grown white."
'Prisoners; and under sentence of death.'
'Where?'
'In my camp.'
'Why?' she muttered. But alas! she knew; she knew already.
"'They are hostages for your good behaviour,' he answered in his cold,"
"mocking tone. 'If their principal satisfies me, good; they will go"
"free. If not, they die--to-morrow.'"
'To-morrow?' she gasped.
"'To-morrow,' he answered ruthlessly. 'Now I think we understand one"
another.'
"When you were here, I sometimes tired,"
"Ah me! that you so loved me, dear."
"Now, in these weary days desired,"
You are no longer here.
"When you were here, did either know"
"That each so loved the other, dear?"
But that was long and long ago:
You are no longer here.
APRIL MIDNIGHT.
"SIDE by side through the streets at midnight,"
"Roaming together,"
"Through the tumultuous night of London,"
In the miraculous April weather.
"Roaming together under the gaslight,"
"Day’s work over,"
"How the Spring calls to us, here in the city,"
Calls to the heart from the heart of a lover!
"Cool the wind blows, fresh in our faces,"
"Cleansing, entrancing,"
"After the heat and the fumes and the footlights,"
Where you dance and I watch your dancing.
"Good it is to be here together,"
"""Nearly everything here is mine."""
Rosek shook his head.
"""The lease is in his name--you are his wife.  They can do it, I assure"
"you.""  A sort of shadow passed over his face, and he added: ""I cannot"
"help him any more--just now."""
Gyp shook her head quickly.
"""No--of course!  You ought not to have helped him at all.  I can't"
"bear--""  He bowed, and she stopped, ashamed.  ""How much does he owe"
"altogether?"""
"""About thirteen hundred pounds.  It isn't much, of course.  But there is"
"something else--"""
"""Worse?"""
Rosek nodded.
"""I am afraid to tell you; you will think again perhaps that I am trying"
"to make capital out of it.  I can read your thoughts, you see.  I cannot"
"afford that you should think that, this time."""
Gyp made a little movement as though putting away his words.
"""No; tell me, please."""
Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
"""There is a man called Wagge, an undertaker--the father of someone you"
"""Show-down."""
"""Cut!"" once more peremptorily from Rance; and then, when she had cut,"
"one question more: ""Best two out of three?"""
"""Best two out of three."" Swift, staccato sentences, like the rapid"
"crossing of swords, the first preliminary interchange of strokes before"
the true duel begins.
"Rance dealt the cards. Before either looked at them, he glanced across"
"at the Girl and asked scornfully, perhaps enviously:"
"""What do you see in him?"""
"""What do you see in me?"" she flashed back instantly, as she picked up"
"her cards; and then: ""What have you got?"""
"""King high,"" declared the gambler."
"""King high here,"" echoed the Girl."
"""Jack next,"" and he showed his hand."
"""Queen next,"" and the Girl showed hers."
"""You've got it,"" conceded the gambler, easily. Then, in another tone,"
"""but you're making a mistake--"""
"""If I am, it's my mistake! Cut!"""
"Rance cut the cards. The Girl dealt them steadily. Then,"
The spectral custodian had refilled the tankards with amber liquid.
Thereof the Abbot sipped understandingly.
"""Lacrymae Christi,"" he turned to the duke. ""Vestrae salubritati bibo!"""
The duke raised his goblet.
"""Waes Hael!"" and he drained its contents with a huge gulp."
"""I would chant twenty psalms for that beverage,"" he mused after a"
while.
"The Abbot suggested ""Attendite Populi!""--""It is one of the longest,"""
"he said, with meaning."
"""Don't trifle with a thirsty belly,"" growled the duke. ""In these"
"troublous times it behooves men to be circumspect!"""
"""Probatum est,"" said the Abbot. ""It is a noble vocation! Jubilate"
"Deo!"""
And he raised his goblet.
The Duke of Spoleto laid a heavy hand upon his arm.
"""It is a Vigil of the Church!"""
The Abbot gave himself absolution on account of the great company.
"""There's no fast on the drink!"" he said with meaning. ""Nor is there"
"better wine between here and Salamanca!"""
"""Sure."" Norton grinned. ""I am that."" He disappeared down the ladder"
towards the generator room.
"Andrews turned to Alice. ""You're not going to go for that fancy"
"routine, are you?"" he demanded crossly."
"""What routine?"""
"""First he uses power for hot water, power that I was storing up. Now"
"he's going to pedal that thing to waste more power."""
"Alice shrugged. ""He's the spaceman,"" she said simply. ""If he thinks we"
"can spare the power for a bath, I could certainly use one."""
"""How can you trust the likes of him?"""
"""We've got to,"" she said. ""We've got to."""
"""I wouldn't,"" said Andrews. ""I can't."""
"She looked at her employer seriously. ""We've both got to trust him,"""
"she said quietly. ""Because, right or wrong, he is the only one who"
"knows anything about space and what's likely to happen next."""
"""At a hundred an hour,"" Andrews said for the ninetieth time or so,"
scathingly.
"Alice nodded soberly. ""But you mustn't forget that isn't going to do"
"him any good unless he gets us all home so that he can use it."""
"Reluctantly, Andrews nodded. ""I suppose you're right."""
"can have heard, that it would distress you to speak of."""
"She said nothing, but fixed her eyes on his."
"""I am right?"" he asked. ""It is about--my wife?"""
"She bowed her head. He stood silent for a moment, and she cried,"
"""It was only gossip--a woman's gossip; I did wrong to listen to it."""
"""Gossip,"" he said, ""is often true. This is true,"" and he set his lips."
"The worst often finds or makes people calm. She had flushed at first,"
"but the colour went again, and she said quietly,"
"""If you have time and don't mind, I should like to hear it all."""
"She had forgotten what this request must mean to him, or perhaps she"
"thought the time for pretence had gone by. If so, he understood, for he"
"answered,"
"""It's your right."""
"Her eyes sank to the ground, but she did not quarrel with his words. She"
stood motionless while he told his story. He spoke with wilful brevity
and dryness.
"""I was a young man when I met her. She was married, and I went to the"
"house. Her husband----"""
"""Did he ill-treat her?"""
"""I don't know. Why?"""
"""I wonder if I could get one."""
"""What do you want it for?"""
"""Don't you think it might attract people to the place? Oh, well, perhaps"
"it wouldn't."""
And Paul withdrew.
Madder than ever. Some people see flies. Paul saw goldfish.
XX
The lawyer is constantly in Miss Torsen's company; he even swings her in
"the children's swing, and puts his arm around her to steady her when the"
"swing stops. Solem watches all this from the field where he is working,"
and begins to sing a ribald song. Certainly these two have so ill-used him
"that if he is going to sing improper songs in self-defense, this is the"
"time to do it; no one will gainsay that. So he sang his song very loud,"
and then began to yodel.
"But Miss Torsen went on swinging, and the lawyer went on putting his arm"
round her and stopping her....
It was a Saturday evening. I stood talking to the lawyer in the garden; he
"didn't like the place, and wanted to leave, but Miss Torsen would not go"
CHAPTER LXXXV
_Wherein a Man of the World commits the Indiscretion of putting his
Experiences into Writing_
"“Dear Noll,” writes Horace Malahide about this time, “I have a son."
He speaks English as yet with a strong foreign accent--but lack of
"experience may have more than something to do with it. If you come,"
I’ll let you play with him.
I live in a whirl of tangled emotions in these days.
"T’other evening I went home, to my father’s marble halls, to seek"
the old gentleman on an affair of hot urgency. It was in the long
hours. I lost some temper--the butler being a sphinx of ducal
"know-nothingness--so I rang up the housekeeper. Yes, she knew where a"
telegram would find Sir Pompey if I would leave it with her.
I!
Leave it!
"Gods! said I, am I utterly disinherit?"
Forthwith the heir of this branch of the Malahides demanded the address.
It lay at St. John’s Wood!
passing reference to yesterday's tragedy.
"""I didn't like him at all,"" she said; ""but still it's dreadful--a man"
"one knew ever so slightly!"""
"Alicia agreed, and the next instant she found herself practically alone"
with Medland; for Daisy ran off to pick a wild-flower that caught her
"eye in the wood, and Norburn followed her. Not knowing whether to be"
"glad or sorry, she made no effort to escape, and was silent while"
Medland began to speak of his prospects in that evening's division.
Suddenly she paused in her walk and lifted her eyes to his.
"""You look happier,"" she said."
Medland's conscience smote him: he was looking happier because the man
was dead.
"""It's at the prospect of being a free man to-morrow,"" he answered, with"
"a smile. ""You know, Cincinnatus was very happy."""
"""But you're not like that."""
"""No, I suppose not. Say it's----"""
"""Never mind."""
After a pause she made another attempt.
"""Mr. Medland!"""
"""Yes?"""
"This pallid afternoon,"
"With feet that tread as whitely as the moon,"
And in his fleet and shining feet I see
The footsteps of another voyager.
REQUIES.
O IS it death or life
That sounds like something strangely known
"In this subsiding out of strife,"
This slow sea-monotone?
"A sound, scarce heard through sleep,"
Murmurous as the August bees
That fill the forest hollows deep
About the roots of trees.
"O is it life or death,"
"O is it hope or memory,"
That quiets all things with this breath
Of the eternal sea?
MASKS AND FACES.
_gentleman_.”
"“Yes. Our gardener’s son has joined a circus too. Such an amusin’ boy,"
he was.”
"“It brings it all so home to one, doesn’t it!”"
"“Doesn’t it, indeed! But I confess I have always been fascinated by the"
stage. There’s somethin’ so very romantic about livin’ in green-rooms
"and paintin’ your face, and--pretendin’ to be someone else.”"
The other whispered in her ear.
"The lorgnettes were flicked open again, and glittered upon Sir Gilders"
Persimmon.
“Indeed! But he is so very old--and she--but there is such a difference
of social rank between a baronet’s wife and a mere painter--surely!
"Still, he _is_ very old. Almost permissible sin, Gerty.”"
They both tittered.
"“My dear,” said the other, “you are really quite naughty.”"
"Sir Gilders pounced upon Fosse, whom he had followed round the room,"
"put up a hand to aid his dull hearing, and said:"
“You were speaking of dotage----”
Fosse winced uneasily:
"“No, sir,” he shrieked--“I was _not_ talking of dotage. I say that the"
“Then we both saw the light creeping over the sea like a monstrous
"ghost. And it all lay so pallid and still,--did n't it?--as if it were"
a sea in a land of death. And then a cheeky little thrush began to
twitter.”
"“I heard the thrush,” replied John. “He said, 'Any old thing! Any old"
thing!' ”
He mimicked the bird's note. Stella laughed. “That's just what he
said--as though a sea in a land of death or the English Channel was all
the same to him. I suppose it was.”
"“It must be good to be a thrush,” said Risca. “There 's a _je m'en"
fich'isme_ about his philosophy which must be very consoling.”
"“I know what that is in English,” cried Stellamaris. “It is"
'don't-care-a-damativeness.' “ Her lips rounded roguishly over the
naughty syllable.
“Where did you learn that?”
“Walter told me.”
"“Walter must be clapped into irons, and fed on bread and water, and"
seriously spoken to.”
Unconsciously he had drifted into his usual manner of speech with her.
She laughed with a child's easy gaiety.
"“It's delightful to be wicked, is n't it?”"
“Why?” he asked.
_Far_ from the world.
_Far_ ...
_Far_ ***
"_Far_, *** B. F."
"_Far_ ..., J. B."
"_Farr_, John."
The arrangement of title-entries is first by the heading words; if
"they are the same, then by the next word; if that is the same,"
"by the next; and so on. Every word, articles and prepositions"
"included, is to be regarded, but not a transposed article: e.g.,"
_Uncovenanted_ Mercies.
_Under_ a Cloud.
_Under_ the Ban.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a novel.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a poem.
_Under_ Which King.
"_Undone_ Task, The."
_Undone_ Task Done.[53]
It makes no difference whether the words are connected with one another
in sense or not; the searcher should not be compelled to think of that.
Let the arrangement be by words as ordinarily printed. Thus _Home Rule_
"is one idea but it is two words, and its place must be determined"
"primarily by its first word _Home_, which brings it before _Homeless_."
If it were printed _Homerule_ it would come after _Homeless_. Similarly
"_Art Amateur_ is one phrase, but as the first word _Art_ is followed by"
"a word beginning with _am_, it must come before _Art_ and _Artists_,"
although its parts are more closely connected than the parts of the
latter phrase.
Now he is old: he asks for daily bread:
He who has sowed the bread he may not taste
Begs for the crumbs: he would do no man wrong.

"Fall strangely, like a dream, across the day;"
"And the dim sunshine is a dream. How clear,"
"New as the world to lovers’ eyes, appear"
The men and women passing on their way!
The world is very fair. The hours are all
Linked in a dance of mere forgetfulness.
"I am at peace with God and man. O glide,"
"Sands of the hour-glass that I count not, fall"
Serenely: scarce I feel your soft caress.

"they are pouring into this search is amazing."""
"The old man became all the more frightened, and glanced at his face."
"""You are lying!"" he said scornfully, when the teacher had finished."
"""What lie have I told?"" asked the teacher."
"""You mentioned tribes that are not mentioned in the Bible."""
"He got up and walked away, angry and deeply insulted."
"""You will go mad, Tyapa,"" called the teacher after him with conviction."
"Then the old man came back again, and stretching out his hand,"
threatened him with his crooked and dirty finger.

"""Tartars are descended from Ishmael, but he also came of the Jews ..."""
"""What do you want to tell me all this for?"""
"""Nothing!  Only why do you tell lies?""  Then he walked away, leaving"
his companion in perplexity.  But after two days he came again and sat
by him.

"Babylonians, or who are we?"""
"""We are Slavs, Tyapa,"" said the teacher, and attentively awaited his"

"He was speechless, for the first time."
The Russian bankers in the room were taken totally by surprise. Double-
"dealing KGB games had always been part of the landscape, but this was"
confusing in the extreme. Whose money was it anyway?
"""Michael."" Novosty's voice was trembling. ""This cannot be allowed to"
"happen."""
"""I agree. We've definitely got a situation here."""
He glanced around to see the four _Mino-gumi kobun _poised in the
"doorway, all with H&K automatics now out of their briefcases. Kenji"
"Nogami was standing behind them, his eyes defeated."
Novosty still looked stunned. The range of options was rapidly
narrowing to none.
"Vera indicated his Ruger. ""You would be wise to put that away. Now."""
"""If they take these securities, my life's not worth a _kopeck_."""
"Novosty seemed to be thinking out loud. ""What does it matter."""
It wasn't a question. It was a statement.
"Remembering it all later, Vance could barely recall the precise"
sequence of events. He did remember shoving Eva back against the wall
as the fireworks began.
Novosty's first round caught the lead _Mino-gumi kobun_ squarely

"""Self is my name,"" said the woman."
"That seemed a curious name to the girl, and she once more began to pull"
"the fire apart. Then the woman grew angry and began to scold, and built"
"it all up again. Thus they went on for a good while; but at last, while"
they were in the midst of their pulling apart and building up of the
"fire, the woman upset the tar-barrel on the girl from underground. Then"
"the latter screamed and ran away, crying:"

An hour after he'd finished delivering his speech on the floor of the
"Senate, Crane held a press conference in one of Washington's most"
"important hotels. The place was crowded. He stood on a platform, looked"
"out over a sea of heads, and pointed at an upraised hand for the first"
question.
"""Senator, have you gotten any reaction from the people of your state on"
"the revelations contained in your speech?"""
"""There has been very little time, but telegrams have been pouring in."""
"""What is the reaction?"""
"""How about covering the door? I think it's time we got down to business"

"""With pleasure."" She stepped over and glanced out. It was clear."
"""What do you think, Alex?"" Vance turned back. ""Word's going around"
there's a hot new issue of Mino Industries zero-coupons coming out
today. What do you say we go long? In for a hundred. Just take the

"""I heard the same rumor, this very morning,"" he smiled. ""You're right."
"My instincts say it's a definite buy."""
"""Fine."" Vance turned to MNB's jowled branch chief. ""We'd like to do a"

"""Michael."" It was Eva's voice, suddenly alarmed."
"""What?"""
"""We've got company. They look like field reps."""
"""Good God."" Novosty strode to the door and looked out. A group of four"
"leather-jacketed Japanese were headed down the hallway, two disarmed"
MNB guards in front. Also with them was Kenji Nogami.

"""Figure they came prepared."" He waved toward Eva. ""Better lose that"

"But the citizen was talking to vacancy. He turned and saw his hearer, a"
"fast receding black shadow, flying in the direction of a house with"
three lighted upper windows.
And in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats
they owned. The park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that
"sprawled, asleep, on a bench. They stopped and gazed upon it."
"“It’s Dopy Mike,” said one. “He hits the pipe every night. Park bum for"
"twenty years. On his last legs, I guess.”"
The other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp
in the hand of the sleeper.
"“Gee!” he remarked. “He’s doped out a fifty-dollar bill, anyway. Wish I"
knew the brand of hop that he smokes.”

"Looking at Alice thoughtfully, Andrews got up and began to rummage"
through a few lockers. Eventually he found a blanket and brought it to
her.
"""I'm not too familiar with these life cans,"" he told her, with a"
"disarming smile. ""I hope I remain in ignorance of them. But I found"
"what I was after. Now, Miss Hemingway, if you'll stretch out, I'll tuck"
"you in, and you can get some shut-eye."""
"""That I can use,"" she said honestly."
"The blanket felt good. So did his hands, smoothing out the blanket, but"
being carefully tender and proper. Andrews was a smooth operator of
many years' experience.
Eventually she slept.
"Andrews found another cigar, and smoked it languidly, his eyes roaming"

"""Bravo!"""
"There, by the door, stood Fiorsen."
"""Congratulations, madame!  I have long wanted to see you under the"

Gyp's heart began to beat desperately.  Monsieur Harmost had not moved.
"A faint grin slowly settled in his beard, but his eyes were startled."
Fiorsen kissed the back of his own hand.
"""To this old Pantaloon you come to give your heart.  Ho--what a lover!"""
Gyp saw the old man quiver; she sprang up and cried:
"""You brute!"""
"Fiorsen ran forward, stretching out his arms toward Monsieur Harmost, as"
if to take him by the throat.

He passed her before she had closed her own door--and would gladly have

her. But she did not delay to answer that question.
"A few minutes later, Slyne knocked at her door and entered, followed by"
the other two men. He had brought with him the papers which Mr. Jobling
"had prepared. Mr. Jobling carried an inkstand, and Captain Dove a"
decanter of brandy. Slyne seated himself at the table and waved Sallie
back to her chair by the window.

"""Fire ahead now, Dove. You want to know--"""
"""Is Sallie really--"""
"""_I_ don't know anyone of that name now. D'you mean Lady Josceline?"""
"Captain Dove glared at him, and then at the lawyer, and then at Sallie"
herself.
"""Is that really who I am now, Jasper?"" she asked, a most wistful"
inflection in her low voice.
"“H’m, h’m!--yes. Pills.”"
“Mr. Pangbutt’s father?”
"“H’m, h’m! Yes. I assure you.”"
“Dear me! And he has such a very distinguished manner!”
“And--d’you know?”
She whispered.
“Lady Persimmon? Indeed?”
The lady of the lorgnettes nodded mysteriously. The withered eyes
expressed shocked surprise. She gave a funny little laugh. The
"lorgnettes were raised again, and she said, surveying the assembled"
guests critically through the glasses:
“I absolutely _adore_ literary people--and artists--and actors--and

"manner--quite unlike a professional actor. And then, of course, his"
manager is rather exclusive--he called the company together the other

not right. You ought to be stricter with him. He’s very naughty.” She
"laughed her hard, bright laugh and patted her hair in a mirror."
"Strange! When she was a little girl she had such a soft, hesitating"
"voice; she had even stuttered, and now, whatever she said—even if it"
"was only “Jam, please, father”—it rang out as though she were on the"
stage.
"“Did Harold leave the office before you, dear?” asked Charlotte,"
beginning to rock again.
"“I’m not sure,” said Old Mr. Neave. “I’m not sure. I didn’t see him"
after four o’clock.”
“He said—” began Charlotte.
"But at that moment Ethel, who was twitching over the leaves of some"
"paper or other, ran to her mother and sank down beside her chair."
"“There, you see,” she cried. “That’s what I mean, mummy. Yellow, with"
touches of silver. Don’t you agree?”
"“Give it to me, love,” said Charlotte. She fumbled for her"
"tortoise-shell spectacles and put them on, gave the page a little dab"
"with her plump small fingers, and pursed up her lips. “Very sweet!” she"
crooned vaguely; she looked at Ethel over her spectacles. “But I
shouldn’t have the train.”
“Not the train!” wailed Ethel tragically. “But the train’s the whole
point.”
"“Here, mother, let me decide.” Marion snatched the paper playfully from"
"to record,--Cleopatras of cats, whom age could not wither, and whose"
"infinite variety custom could not stale,--and there was the approaching"
marriage of Arachne with a duke to report. And he told her of his
"gay, bright life in London and of the beautiful Belinda Molyneux, an"
"imaginary Egeria, who sometimes lunched with the queen. The effort of"
"artistic creation absorbed him, as it always had done, under the spell"
of Stellamaris's shining eyes. The foolish world of his imagination
"became real, and for the moment hung like a veil before his actual world"
of tragedy. It was in the nature of a shock to him when Stella's maid
entered and asked him if he could speak to Mr. Herold outside the door..
"“Tell him to come in,” said Stellamaris."
"“He says he will, Miss, after he has seen Mr. Risca.”"
Risca found Herold on the landing.
“Well?”
“Well?” said John.
“What has happened? How did she take it?”
"John looked away, and thrust his hands into his pockets."
“I 've not told her yet.”
Walter drew a breath. “But you 're going to?”
"“Of course,” said John. “Do you think it 's so damned easy?”"
"“You had better be quick, if you 're coming back to town with me. I'm"
"Jimmie told his chum of the arrival of Gilroy, and then the two boys"
hastened toward the camp.
“The outlaws were discussing the advisability of taking all the boys
"into their care,” Ned said, as they hustled along, “so I’m afraid"
they’ve been there and taken the lads by surprise.”
CHAPTER IX
IN QUEST OF INFORMATION
"Left at the camp by the departure of Ned and Jimmie, Jack, Frank and"
Harry sat for a long time in the warm sunshine in front of the barrier
and discussed the situation. Gilroy had tucked himself into a collection
of blankets at the rear of the cave and was sound asleep.
“What do you think Jimmie had in his mind when he went away alone?”
asked Harry. “He merely had some plan to carry out.”
"“Oh, he’s always going off alone,” Jack answered."
“Some day he’ll go away alone and won’t be able to get back!” Frank put
in. “He won’t always be able to get out of his scrapes.”
"“Pretty foxy boy, that!” Jack declared."
"“What strikes me as being singular,” Frank suggested, “is that Jack’s"
father never said a word to him about this land business.”
"give?"""
"Serious as was Johnson's predicament, he could not suppress a smile. In"
a surprisedly calm voice he told her to say that she had gone to bed.
The Girl's eyes flooded with admiration.
"""Why, o' course--that's it,"" she said, and turned back to the door and"
"called through it: ""I've gone to bed, Nick! I'm in bed now!"""
The barkeeper's answer was lost in another loud howl of the blast. Soon
"afterwards, however, the Girl made out that Nick was endeavouring to"
convey to her a warning of some kind.
"""You say you've come to warn me?"" she cried."
"""Yes, Ramerrez . . .!"""
"""What? Say that again?"""
"""Ramerrez is on the trail--"""
"""Ramerrez's on the trail!"" repeated the Girl in tones of alarm; and not"
waiting to hear further she motioned to Johnson to conceal himself
"behind the curtains of the bed, muttering the while:"
"""I got to let 'em in--I can't keep 'em out there on such a night . . ."""
He had barely reached his place of concealment when the Girl slid back
the bolts and bade the boys to come in.
"Headed by Rance, the men quickly filed in and deposited their lanterns"
"on the floor. It was evident that they had found the storm most severe,"
And Gyp thought: 'How wonderful of him not to have asked a single
question.'
"The cab stopped at the Bury Street door.  She took his hand, put it to"
"her cheek, and got out.  He said quietly:"
"""Do you want the dogs?"""
"""Yes--oh, yes!  He doesn't care for them."""
"""All right.  There'll be time to get you in some things for the night"
after I come back.  I shan't run any risks to-day.  Make Mrs. Markey give
"you tea."""
"Gyp watched the cab gather way again, saw him wave his hand; then, with a"
"deep sigh, half anxiety, half relief, she rang the bell."
XVII
"When the cab debouched again into St. James' Street, Winton gave the"
"order: ""Quick as you can!""  One could think better going fast! A little"
red had come into his brown cheeks; his eyes under their half-drawn lids
had a keener light; his lips were tightly closed; he looked as he did
"when a fox was breaking cover.  Gyp could do no wrong, or, if she could,"
he would stand by her in it as a matter of course.  But he was going to
"take no risks--make no frontal attack. Time for that later, if necessary."
"He had better nerves than most people, and that kind of steely"
determination and resource which makes many Englishmen of his class
"""Sid, I haven't played square,"" Lavender suddenly blurted out,"
"flushing. ""We promised to tell one another if any one of us found out"
"anything and _I did_--and I didn't tell!"""
Lavender's admission faded beside the fact that he knew something.
"""Oh, what?"" Sidney cried."
"""I wasn't going to tell you. I thought you didn't care anything about"
"the pirates any more. And the laugh's sort o' on me, anyway, because I"
"thought we were all crazy to suspect Jed Starrow."""
"""Tell me quick, Lav,"" commanded Sidney, quivering with excitement."
Lav leaned against the rail. To tell his story meant confessing his
state of mind.
"""I guess I've been sore because you and Mr. Dugald fooled 'round with"
those new folks. Jealous. I get that way lots of times--all hot inside
because I'm different. And I go off somewhere alone and stay there
"until I fight it down."""
"""I know, Lav. Aunt Achsa told me. Did you go to the dunes?"""
"""One night I did. Stayed there all night. But one evening I went out on"
the breakwall. There's a place out there where the rocks are piled so's
to make a cave. I used to play there a lot when I was a little kid. I
crawled into it. And I hadn't been there very long when I heard
somebody talking--two men. They were up close so's I heard everything
"they said."""
"address given in the letter, he found that his brother had gone out not"
fifteen minutes before.
"“Mebbe if you step in an’ wait he’ll be back soon,” suggested the"
slatternly woman who kept the house.
"Curly was shown to a room on the second floor back, where he recognized"
a number of Bill’s belongings scattered about in the usual disorder.
Perhaps it was the sight of them which aroused in the young fellow an
"increasing doubt of his ability to do what he came for. Would this man,"
"who had never been in the habit of taking any one’s advice, listen to"
"him? He wondered, and then, unable to remain still, arose and paced the"
floor anxiously.
"Presently he dropped in a chair before a rough deal table, on top of"
which was tacked a large sheet of blotting paper. A corner of white
"""You don't happen to have lost one of your crew, tryin' to desert by"
"swimmin', sir?"""
"""Have you picked him up?  What's his name, does he say?"""
"""It's Smith, sir."""
"""That's the man,"" said Sant.  ""I want him badly."""
But Smith cried out:
"""This is kidnappin', Mr. Sant.  I refuse to go."""
"""Oh, Smith,"" said Sant, ""I'll take all the chances of it's bein'"
"anythin' you like.  Throw them a rope."""
"“_Allons d’ici_,” she whispered, turning a terrified glance around."
The man raised his hat to his companions and signed to her to come. He
"was a handsome, careless, dissipated-looking fellow, with curly hair and"
a twirled black moustache; short and slightly made. He wore a Tyrolese
hat and a very low turned-down collar and a great silk bow outside
his waistcoat. There was a devil-may-care charm in his swagger as
he walked--also an indefinable touch of vulgarity; the type of the
_cabotin_ in easy circumstances.
"Yvonne, more dead than alive, followed him through the deserted _salle"
"des jeux_ on to the quiet bit of verandah, and sank into a chair that he"
"offered. She looked at him, still white to the lips."
“You?”
"“Yes,” he said laughingly, “why not? It is not astonishing.”"
"“But I thought you dead!” gasped Yvonne, trembling."
"“_A la bonne heure!_ And I seem a ghost. Oh, I am solid. Pinch me. But"
how did you come to learn? Ah! I remember it was given out in Paris. A
"_canard_. It was in the hospital--paralysis, _ma chère_. See, I can only"
"just move my arm now. _Cétait la verte, cette sacrée verte--_”"
"“Absinthe?” asked Yvonne, almost mechanically."
"He nodded, went through the motions of preparing the drink, and laughed."
"“I had a touch lately,” he went on. “That was the second. The third I"

"you. Talk quick, please—those fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of"

"“Oh, what are you talking about?” exclaimed the young lady. She rose to"
"her feet and gazed upon him, round-eyed."
"“Don’t you understand?” said Maxwell, restively. “I want you to marry"
"me. I love you, Miss Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I snatched a"
minute when things had slackened up a bit. They’re calling me for the
"’phone now. Tell ’em to wait a minute, Pitcher. Won’t you, Miss"
Leslie?”
The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with
amazement; then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she
"smiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly about"
the broker’s neck.
"“I know now,” she said, softly. “It’s this old business that has driven"
everything else out of your head for the time. I was frightened at
"first. Don’t you remember, Harvey? We were married last evening at 8"
o’clock in the Little Church Around the Corner.”

The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The
"impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few."

“Quick!” he repeated.
It was too late.
"“For God’s sake, Kennedy,” shouted a voice at the street door, “what"
are you doing here?”
"It was McLear himself. He had come with the Hale patrol, on his mettle"
now to take care of the epidemic of robberies.
Before Craig could reply a cab drew up with a rush at the curb and two
"men, half fighting, half cursing, catapulted themselves into the shop."
They were Winters and Moulton.
"Without a word, taking advantage of the first shock of surprise,"
Kennedy had clapped a piece of chemical paper on the foreheads of Mrs.
"Moulton, then of Moulton, and on Muller’s. Oblivious to the rest of us,"
he studied the impressions in the full light of the counter.
Moulton was facing his wife with a scornful curl of the lip.
“I’ve been told of the paste replica—and I wrote Schloss that I’d shoot
"him down like the dog he is, you—you traitress,” he hissed."
She drew herself up scornfully.
“And I have been told why you married me—to show off your wicked jewels
and help you in your—”
“You lie!” he cried fiercely. “Muller—some one—open this safe—whosever
"it is. If what I have been told is true, there is in it one new bag"
"calmly, and added, with a sigh, ""I have no doubt he would have landed"
"you in rather an awkward fix ... had we not taken pity upon you."""
"""Ah!""  And the angry soldier raised his hand.  ""There are two of them"
"...  One of them discovered it, the other wrote the petition, the"
"accursed reporter!"""
"""Why the reporter?"""
"""He writes for the papers ...  He is one of your lodgers ... there they"
"all are outside ...  Clear them away, for Christ's sake!  The robbers!"
They disturb and annoy everyone in the street.  One cannot live for
them ... And they are all desperate fellows ...  You had better take
"care, or else they will rob or burn you ..."""
"""And this reporter, who is he?"" asked Petunikoff, with interest."
"""He?  A drunkard.  He was a teacher but was dismissed.  He drank"
everything he possessed ... and now he writes for the papers and
"composes petitions.  He is a very wicked man!"""
"""H'm!  And did he write your petition, too?  I suppose it was he who"
discovered the flaws in the building.  The beams were not rightly put
"in?"""
"""He did!  I know it for a fact!  The dog!  He read it aloud in here and"
"boasted, 'Now I have caused Petunikoff some loss!'"""
"""Ye--es...  Well, then, do you want to be reconciled?"""
"""To be reconciled?""  The soldier lowered his head and thought. ""Ah!"
"This is a hard life!"" said he, in a querulous voice, scratching his"
"He shook hands with Lovegood and Aubrey; and, turning to Ffolliott, a"
faint smile flickered over his worried face:
"“Ffolliott!... Sorry to be late, but there have been domestic"
difficulties--my butler has gone sick.”
The guests were arriving fast.
“Mistair Maupassant Fosse!” bawled Rippley at the door.
"The little man glared at the servant, fussed into the room, and tripped"
across to his host.
"“A nickname they have for me,” he said--“a nickname....”"
"Rippley watched Blotte solemnly tramp down the stairs, his wig on one"
"side; heard him announce to a lady, just arrived, that he was going to"
sup with the gods; and he was gone.
Groups of guests came swarming up the stairs and passed into the studio.
"Rippley, glancing into the studio, saw the white satin dress of"
Ffolliott move uneasily amongst the arriving guests; and he heard his
"thin, affected drawl as he explained to his host:"
“D’you know--I feel such an ass----”
Pangbutt patted him upon the shoulder:
"“Never mind,” said he absently--“it can’t be helped. Make the best of"
it.”

"with a thin coat usually adnate to the pericarp, exalbuminous."

"""Yes, yes; that's nothing!  Don't cry--don't cry!"""
"Very slowly the sobbing died away, till it was just a long shivering, but"
still the girl held her hands over her face and her face down.  Gyp felt
"paralyzed.  The unhappy girl, the red and green room, the smell of"
mutton--creeping!
"At last, a little of that white face showed; the lips, no longer craving"
"for sugar-plums, murmured:"
"""It's you he--he--really loves all the time.  And you don't love"
"him--that's what's so funny--and--and--I can't understand it.  Oh, Mrs."
"Fiorsen, if I could see him--just see him!  He told me never to come"
again; and I haven't dared.  I haven't seen him for three weeks--not
"since I told him about IT.  What shall I do?  What shall I do?"""
His being her own husband seemed as nothing to Gyp at that moment. She
felt such pity and yet such violent revolt that any girl should want to
"crawl back to a man who had spurned her.  Unconsciously, she had drawn"
"herself up and pressed her lips together.  The girl, who followed every"
"movement, said piteously:"
"""I don't seem to have any pride.  I don't mind what he does to me, or"
"what he says, if only I can see him."""
Gyp's revolt yielded to her pity.  She said:
"""How long before?"""
"""Three months."""
"Winstanley, after Yvonne had gone again."
"“I am sacrificing them for my wife’s happiness, Emmeline,” he replied,"
with a touch of irony.
"“Yes, it would be a pity to spoil her pleasure. She is such a child.”"
"“I wish we all had something of her nature,” said the Canon."
Mrs. Winstanley noted the snub. She was treasuring up many resentments
against Yvonne. In her heart she considered herself a long-suffering
woman.
"“You seem to enjoy it too, Everard,” said Yvonne to him that evening."
They were sitting near the entrance watching the smartly-dressed people.
“And I am so glad to be alone with you.”
"He was pleased, smiled at her, and throwing off his dignity, entered"
into the frivolous spirit of the place. Yvonne forgot the restraint she
had always put upon her tongue when talking to him. She chattered about
"everything, holding her face near him, so as to be heard through the"
"hubbub of thousands of voices, the eternal shuffling of passing feet,"
and the crash of the orchestra in the far gallery.
"“It is a _Revue des Deux Mondes,_” she said, looking rapidly around"
"her, with bright eyes."
“How?” asked the Canon.
"“The _beau_ and the _demi_,” she replied, wickedly. She shook his knee."
"“Oh, do look at that woman! what does she think a man can see in her!”"
foreigners at his heels.  The true battle (for this was but an affair
"of outposts) joined on the crest of the rise, and in five minutes the"
English were in flight for the shelter of the piled-up _Potluck_.
"Old Jones was keeled over once, but Lampert and Mackenzie dragged him"
away and got him down to the ship.  He swore most terribly.
"""'Ere's a pretty kettle o' fish,"" said he at last; ""a pretty lot I"
'as to my back to let a few Frenchies lick 'em this way.  What's the
good o' diplomatics if my men 'asn't the guts to support me?  Where's
"that Simcox?"""
"""Here, sir,"" said the ambassador."
"""Who told you to start a row?"" demanded the skipper.  ""Don't you know"
your duty?  You was to give 'em the hultimatum and retire dignified.
"Do you call it retirin' dignified to run and beller like a bull-calf?"""
Simcox looked sulky and injured.
"""How was I to look dignified with six of 'em after me--and two with"
"knives and one with a meat-chopper?"" he asked.  ""And as for startin'"
"a rough house, 'twas Hart as done it."""
"""Where's Hart?"" yelled the Guffin."
"""'Ere, 'Art, where are you?"" said the crowd."
"""I believe he's a prisoner,"" said Lampert."
"""Oh, Lord,"" said the crowd, ""but Jack never 'ad no discretion."""
"""We must 'ave him liberated,"" said the skipper firmly.  ""No man of"
"""A man always says, 'who was the first one?' but the girl says, 'who'll"
"be the next one?'"" she returned, as she carefully laid the roses in her"
bureau drawer.
"""But the time comes when there never will be a next one."""
"""No?"""
"""No."""
"""I'd hate to stake my pile on that,"" observed the Girl, drily. She blew"
up each glove as it came off and likewise carefully laid them away in
the bureau drawer.
"By this time Wowkle's soft tread had ceased, her duties for the night"
"were over, and she stood at the table waiting to be dismissed."
"""Wowkle, git to your wigwam!"" suddenly ordered her mistress, watching"
her until she disappeared into the cupboard; but she did not see the
Indian woman's lips draw back in a half-grin as she closed the door
behind her.
"""Oh, you're sending her away! Must I go, too?"" asked Johnson, dismally."
"""No--not jest yet; you can stay a--a hour or two longer,"" the Girl"
informed him with a smile; and turning once more to the bureau she
busied herself there for a few minutes longer.
Johnson's joy knew no bounds; he burst out delightedly:

"Whereupon Rollo addressed himself to the others, setting clearly before"
them the gravity of the situation.
John Mortimer shook his head gravely. He could not approve.

all comes of trying to make up my disappointment about the Abbot's

Etienne shrugged his shoulders and philosophically quoted a Gascon
proverb to the effect that who buys the flock must take the black sheep
also.
El Sarria simply recollected that his gun and pistols were in good
"order, and waited for orders."
The conference therefore resolved itself into a trio of
"consultants--Rollo because he was the leader, Sergeant Cardono because"
"he knew the country, and Concha--because she was Concha!"
They were within an hour or two's rapid march of La Granja over a pass
in the Guadarrama. The sergeant volunteered to lead them down into the
gardens in that time. He knew a path often travelled by smugglers on
their way to Segovia.
"""It is clear that if we are to carry away the Queen-Regent and her"
"daughter, we must forestall the gipsies,"" said Rollo."
Concha clasped her hands pitifully.
"""Ah, the poor young Queen!"" she cried. ""Praise to the saints that I was"
"“Edith was looking at it when Mr. Trent came in, and forgot to return"
it.”
"“Ah! Boswell, I am sure you are sitting on Mrs. Pendleton’s foot. By the"
"way, how is your aunt?”"
“Dead—better.”
"“I wonder you could tear yourself away so soon,” said Trent, viciously."
“You’d better be careful. She might make a new will.”
“Don’t worry. I spent the happiest fifteen minutes of my life with her
this afternoon. She promised me all.” He turned to Severance. “You have
"been breaking hearts on the beach, I suppose.”"
"“Which is better, at all events, than breaking one’s head against a"
stone wall.”
"“Politics brought you here, I suppose, Mr. Trent,” interrupted Miss"
Decker. “I hear you made a stirring speech the other night.”
“I did. It was on the question of Radicalism in the Press _versus_ Civil
Service Reform. Something must be done to revolutionise this hotbed of
"iniquity, American politics. Such principles need courage, but when the"
hour comes the man must not be wanting—”
"“That was all in the paper next morning,” drawled Boswell. “Mrs."
"Pendleton, did you receive the copy of my new book I sent a fortnight"
"ago? Unlike many of my others, I had no difficulty in disposing of it."
"It was lighter, brighter, less philosophy, less—brains. The critics"
"understood it, therefore they were kind. They even said—”"
"""I have shown it you before.""  Vaviloff looked up suspiciously and"
closely scanned the Captain's face.
"""Show it me!"" shouted the Captain, striking the bar with his fist and"
sitting down on a stool close by.
"""But why?"" asked Vaviloff, knowing that it was better to keep his wits"
about him when Kuvalda got excited.
"""You fool!  Bring it at once."""
"Vaviloff rubbed his forehead, and turned his eyes to the ceiling in a"
tired way.
"""Where are those papers of yours?"""
"There was no answer to this on the ceiling, so the old sergeant looked"
"down at the floor, and began drumming with his fingers on the bar in a"
worried and thoughtful manner.
"""It's no good your making wry faces!"" shouted the Captain, for he had"
"no great affection for him, thinking that a former soldier should"
rather have become a thief than an eating-house keeper.
"""Oh!  Yes!  Aristid Fomich, I remember now.  They were left at the High"
"Court of Justice at the time when I came into possession."""
"""Get along, Egorka!  It is to your own interest to show me the plan,"
"the title-deeds, and everything you have immediately.  You will"
"probably clear at least a hundred roubles over this, do you understand?"""
Vaviloff did not understand at all; but the Captain spoke in such a
to his shoulders.
I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;
every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable
"soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the"
"blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,"
when I suddenly got scared right through.
His eyes.
They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.
Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did
"it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a"
surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it
opened two long tooth-studded jaws.
"""Green shatas!"" he said suddenly. ""Only a tadpole. I must be getting"
"jumpy enough to splash."""
Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly
"leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted"
"to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes."
"I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. ""My name is Ferdinand"
"Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.--Mr.--"""
"""Hope for your sake,"" he said to me, ""that you aren't what you"
"seem--tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura."""
"""_What?_"""
"""A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come"
"between the eyes. As he pitched backward, arms flailing, he tumbled"
"against the others, giving Novosty time to fire again. With deadly"
accuracy he caught another in the chest.
"Kenji Nogami had already thrown himself on the thick hallway carpet,"
"safely avoiding the fusillade. The Russian bankers, too, had all hit"
"the floor, along with the MNB guards and the two couriers."
Then came a shot with a different sound--the dull thunk of a silencer.
"Novosty jerked in surprise, pain spreading through his eyes. The"
"silencer thunked again, and again."
"It was Vera Karanova. She was holding a small .22 caliber Walther PP,"
with a specially equipped silencer. And her aim was flawless. Novosty
had three slugs arranged neatly down the side of his head before he
"even realized what was happening. He collapsed forward, never knowing"
whose hand had been on the gun.
"She's probably wanted to get rid of him for years, Vance thought"
"fleetingly. She finally got her golden opportunity, the double-crossing"
bitch.
He briefly considered grabbing back one of the .38's and avenging Alex
"then and there, but he knew it would be suicidal."
"""Alex, no!"" Eva's voice sobbed."
"""Both of you, hands on the wall."" Comrade Karanova was definitely in"
charge.
"""Michael,"" Eva said, turning to comply, ""what happened to our well-laid"
"plans?"""
“There is my husband.”
"“_Nom de Dieu!_” cried Bazouge, stifling a guffaw before the austere"
"decorum of the English churchman. “_Ça?_ Oh, my poor Yvonne!” She shook"
"hands rapidly with him and turned away. He bowed gracefully, including"
the new-comers in his salute. The Canon responded severely. Mrs.
Winstanley stared at him through her tortoise-shell lorgnette.
"“We have been looking all over the place for you,” said the Canon,"
"as they passed through the window into the _salle des jeux_, leaving"
Bazouge in the corner of the verandah.
"“I’m sorry,” said Yvonne penitently."
“And who was that rakish-looking little Frenchman you were talking to?”
"“An old friend--I used to know him,” said Yvonne, struggling with her"
agitation. “A friend of my first husband--I had to speak to him--we went
"there to be quiet. I could n’t help it, Everard, really I could n’t.”"
"“My dear child,” said the Canon, kindly, “I was not scolding you--though"
he did look rather undesirable.”
“I suppose you had to mix with all kinds of odd Bohemian people in your
professional days?” said Mrs. Winstanley.
"“Of course,” faltered Yvonne."
They went through the great hall. At the door they parted with Mrs.
"Winstanley, who was waiting for the Wilmingtons. “We will call for you"
"on our way to the concert this afternoon,” said the Canon."
"“Oh, dear! I wish they would not fight at your school, Tom. Didn't it"
hurt you?”
"“Hurt me? No,” said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a large"
"pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at"
meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it. Then he added:
“I gave Spooner a black eye--that's what he got for wanting to leather
me. I wasn't going to go halves because anybody leathered me.”
"“Oh! how brave you are, Tom. I think you are like Samson. If there came"
"a lion roaring at me, I think you'd fight him, wouldn't you, Tom?”"
"“How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There's no lions"
only in the shows.”
"“No, but if we were in the lion countries--I mean in Africa where it's"
"very hot, the lions eat people there. I can show it you in the book"
where I read it.”
"“Well, I should get a gun and shoot him.”"
"“But if you hadn't got a gun?--we might have gone out, you know, not"
"thinking, just as we go out fishing, and then a great lion might come"
"towards us roaring, and we could not get away from him. What should you"
"do, Tom?”"
"Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying: “But the"
lion _isn't_ coming. What's the use of talking?”
This passage illustrates also the difference between the
sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York.
It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.”
The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.
“I’ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to
call time on him sharp?”
“I should say not!” said the other. “I’ll give him half an hour at
"least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he’ll be here by that time. So long,"
officer.”
"“Good-night, sir,” said the policeman, passing on along his beat,"
trying doors as he went.
"There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from"
its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir
in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars
turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware store
"the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain"
"almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and"
waited.
"About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat,"
"with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite"
side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.
"“Is that you, Bob?” he asked, doubtfully."
"“Is that you, Jimmy Wells?” cried the man in the door."
"“Bless my heart!” exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other’s"
"“Oh, don't you?” cried Sir Oliver, in sinister exultation. “Then your"
whole historical fabric of the Crucifixion must fall to the ground.”
"“I don't see why you need be irreverent and blasphemous,” said Lady"
Blount.
"Herold laid his hand on Lady Blount's and looked at her, with his head"
on one side.
"“But do you believe in Stellamaris, Julia.”"
"His smile was so winning, with its touch of mockery, that she grew"
mollified.
"“I believe she has bewitched all of us,” she said."
Which shows how any woman may be made to eat her words just by a little
kindness.
"So the talk went back to Stella and her ways and her oddities, and the"
question of faith in Pontius Pilate being necessary for salvation was
"forgotten. A maid, Stella's own maid, came in with a message. Miss"
"Stella's compliments, and were Mr. Risca and Mr. Herold having a good"
"supper? She herself was about to drink her egg beaten up in sherry, and"
would be glad if the gentlemen would take a glass of wine with her.
"The young men, accordingly, raised their glasses toward the ceiling and"
"drank to Stella, in the presence of the maid, and gave her appropriate"
messages to take back to her mistress.

the door yawned open.
Noll turned at the sound of its unlatching.
The mother of Netherby Gomme stood in the dark hollow of the doorway;
and a grim triumph lurked in her eyes.
"Noll saluted her, hat in hand; and she returned his greeting with a"
grave smile of surprise.
"“Is Netherby at home, Mrs. Gomme?” he asked."
"The grim triumph slipped back to her eyes, and came lurking into the"
corners of the old mouth again:
"“He came home from his honeymoon to-day, Noll,” she said--“will you go"
up and see him?”
"Noll walked into the house, and the door was shut behind him with"
a triumphant slam. He followed the grim old lady into the little
"sitting-room, and as he went the memory of the queenly figure of the"
little child Betty as she walked into the dingy room and kissed the
"jealousy out of this old woman’s heart, came back to him like the"
"fragrance of her sweetness, so that for a while he could not speak what"
he would have said.
"“It was only the other day,” she said, “that you were boys together...."
To me it is only yesterday that he was a--little one--in my--arms.”
Her eyes filled with tears. “But it is all gone.... This passing of
youth is as strange as death....” And she added after awhile: “I think
he--was glad--to come back.”
"""Vera, my love,"" Eva said, cutting her off, ""if you try and double-"
"cross us, you're making a very big mistake. You seem to forget we've"
got that protocol. What we didn't get around to telling you is that
"we've deciphered it."""
"""You--?"""
"""That's right. As it happens, I don't think you're going to like what"
"it's got to say, but you might at least want to know the story before"
"you read about it in The Times day after tomorrow."""
"Alex Novosty's face had turned ashen. ""Michael, Tanzan Mino's people"
are probably headed here by now. Unless they go to the main office on
"King William Street first."" He was nervously glancing out the window."
"""We're running out of time."""
"The game's about to get rough, Vance thought. Better take charge."
"But before he could move, Novosty was gripping a Ruger P-85, a"
"lightweight 9mm automatic, pulled from a holster under the back of his"
jacket. He'd worn it where the MNB guards would miss it.
The two Victoria couriers were caught flat-footed. Bankers weren't
supposed to start drawing weapons. They stared in astonishment as he
gestured for them to turn and face the wall.
"""Michael,"" he said as he glanced over, ""would you kindly give me a hand"
"and take those two .38's? We really must get this party moving."""
"Vera Karanova was smiling a thin smile. ""I don't know how far you think"
"you will get with this."""
"Kilshaw's got a gadfly that does instead, and of course, Coxon, I add"
"you to the list."""
"""Much obliged for your testimonial,"" said Coxon sourly."
"""I add any man I'm talking to, to the list,"" continued the Chief"
"Justice. ""I expect him to do the same by me. But, honestly, I add you"
even in your absence. You're not a man who puts party ties above
"everything."""
"Mr. Coxon darted a suspicious glance at the head of his profession, but"
the Chief Justice's air was blandly innocent.
"""My party's my party,"" he remarked, ""just so long as it carries out my"
"principles. I don't say either party does it perfectly."""
"""I dare say not; but of course you're right to act with the one that"
"does most for you."""
Again the Chief Justice had hit on a somewhat ambiguous expression.
"Coxon detected a grin on the face of Captain Heseltine, who was sitting"
"near, but he could not hold Sir John's grave face guilty of the"
Captain's grin.
"""I see,"" remarked the Captain, perhaps in order to cover the retreat of"
"his grin, ""that they've discharged the woman who was arrested last night"
"for the murder."""
"""Really no evidence against her,"" said the Chief Justice. ""But,"
"Heseltine, wasn't this man Benham the fellow Medland had a sort of"
"shindy with at that flower-show?"""
"It relieves me to know she is alive, revives me, and makes me"
"superlatively brave: if he has dared to kill her, I will report it at"
once. I shall not spare him. I shall accuse him of both her death and the
lawyer's. I shall go further: I shall accuse others--the thief of last
"winter, the man that stole the sides of bacon from a tradesman and sold me"
"rolls of tobacco out of his bag. No, I shall not keep silence about"
anything then....

"When it grew light, Solem went to the kitchen, had his breakfast, settled"
"his business with Paul and the women, and returned to his room. He was in"
"no hurry; though it was no longer early in the day, he took his time about"
"tying his bundles, preparatory to leaving. Lingeringly he looked into the"
windows of the south wing as he passed.
Then Solem was gone.
A little later Miss Torsen came in to breakfast. She asked at once about
Solem. And why might she be so interested in Solem? She had certainly
stopped in her room intentionally so as to give him time to leave; if she
wanted to see him she could have been here long ago. But was it not safest
"to seem a little angry? Supposing, night owl that I was, that I had seen"
something!
"""Where is Solem?"" she asked indignantly."
"""Thank you, sir."""

Obviously there had been something on the young intern's mind for weeks
"now. Too bad. But let the Minnesota hospital, wherever it was, worry"
about the trouble and perhaps put Corson on the right track again.
He was their baby now.

Another hour passed and Taber shifted from one aching foot to the other

"When the man had turned a corner, Taber crossed over and looked up at"

_A Terrifying Tale Of Horror In The Skies_
THE FLYING EYES
By J. Hunter Holly
Author of ENCOUNTER and THE GREEN PLANET
Linc Hosler was sitting in a packed football stadium when the Flying
Eyes appeared and cast their hypnotic power over half the crowd.
Thousands of people suddenly began marching zombie-like into the woods
where they vanished into a black pit.
Linc used every resource of the Space Research Lab and the National
"Guard to destroy the Eyes. But nothing could stop them, for they proved"
immune to bullets and bombs.
"In desperation, Linc captured an Eye and found a way to communicate with"
it through his mind. He learned that radiation was fuel for the
creatures' lives. And then they issued their terrible ultimatum: Explode
a series of atom bombs to supply them with radiation or they would turn
the world's population into mindless robots.
It gave the world two harrowing choices--self-destruction via fallout
from the bombs or annihilation via the sinister Flying Eyes....

Before the flotilla regained Dover Harbour the remaining seaplanes

CHAPTER XXIX.
"""LIEUTENANT AUBYN, R.N., D.S.O."""
"ON the evening following the return of the ""Sunderland"" to Dover,"
Terence obtained leave to go ashore in order to visit a
"brother-officer who, owing to his ship being under repairs, was"
temporarily installed in the Lord Warden Hotel.
Aubyn was proceeding along the Admiralty Pier when his progress was
"barred by a tall, bronzed young fellow in the uniform of a"
flight-lieutenant of the Naval Air Service.
"""Hullo, Aubyn, old man!"" exclaimed the latter cordially, as he"
"extended his hand. ""Forgotten me already?"""
"forthcoming he would cut the throats of all his prisoners, many of them"
"the leading merchants of the town. While waiting for the Governor's reply,"
Richards and his companions scandalized the towns-folk of Charleston by
their outrageous and swaggering conduct.
"RICHARDSON, JOHN."
"His father was a goldsmith at New York. John, tiring of the trade of"
"cooper, to which he was apprenticed, ran away to sea. For many years he"
served both in men-of-war and in merchant ships. Although an unmitigated
"blackguard, he did not commit piracy nor murder until some years later,"
"when, being at Ancona, he met a Captain Benjamin Hartley, who had come"
there with a loading of pilchards. Richardson was taken on board to serve
"as ship's carpenter, and sailed for Leghorn. With another sailor called"
"Coyle, Richardson concocted a mutiny, murdered the captain in the most"
"brutal manner, and was appointed mate in the pirate ship. As a pirate"
Richardson was beneath contempt. His life ended on the gallows at
"Execution Dock on January 25th, 1738."
"RICHARDSON, NICHOLAS."
"One of Captain Quelch's crew. Taken out of the brigantine _Charles_, and"
tried for piracy at Boston in 1704.
"RIDGE, JOHN."
Of London.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged in 1718 at Charleston, South"
"was he all alone, climbing up and down? Where was Harold? Ah, it was no"
"good expecting anything from Harold. Down, down went the little old"
"spider, and then, to his horror, old Mr. Neave saw him slip past the"
"dining-room and make for the porch, the dark drive, the carriage gates,"
"the office. Stop him, stop him, somebody!"
Old Mr. Neave started up. It was dark in his dressing-room; the window
"shone pale. How long had he been asleep? He listened, and through the"
"big, airy, darkened house there floated far-away voices, far-away"
"sounds. Perhaps, he thought vaguely, he had been asleep for a long"
time. He’d been forgotten. What had all this to do with him—this house
"and Charlotte, the girls and Harold—what did he know about them? They"
were strangers to him. Life had passed him by. Charlotte was not his
wife. His wife!
"... A dark porch, half hidden by a passion-vine, that drooped"
"sorrowful, mournful, as though it understood. Small, warm arms were"
"round his neck. A face, little and pale, lifted to his, and a voice"
"breathed, “Good-bye, my treasure.”"
"My treasure! “Good-bye, my treasure!” Which of them had spoken? Why had"
they said good-bye? There had been some terrible mistake. _She_ was his
"wife, that little pale girl, and all the rest of his life had been a"
dream.
"Then the door opened, and young Charles, standing in the light, put his"
"hands by his side and shouted like a young soldier, “Dinner is on the"
"table, sir!”"
"“I’m coming, I’m coming,” said old Mr. Neave."
"""But there's jest one thing you've overlooked explainin', Mr. Johnson."
It shows exactly what you are. It wasn't so much your bein' a road agent
"I got against you. It's this:"" And here she stamped her foot excitedly."
"""You kissed me--you got my first kiss."""
Johnson hung his head.
"""You said,"" kept on the Girl, hotly, ""you'd ben thinkin' o' me ever"
"since you saw me at Monterey, an' all the time you walked straight off"
"an' ben kissin' that other woman."" She shrugged her shoulder and laughed"
"grimly. ""You've got a girl,"" she continued, growing more and more"
"indignant. ""It's that I've got against you. It's my first kiss I've got"
against you. It's that Nina Micheltoreña that I can't forgive. So now
"you can git--git!"" And with these words she unbolted the door and"
concluded tensely:
"""If they kill you I don't care. Do you hear, I don't care . . ."""
At those bitter words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide
"their misery, the Girl's face became colourless."
"With the instinct of a brave man to sell his life as dearly as possible,"
"Johnson took a couple of guns from his pocket; but the next moment, as"
if coming to the conclusion that death without the Girl would be
"preferable, he put them back, saying:"
"""You're right, Girl."""
The next instant he had passed out of the door which she held wide open
for him.
"“No, French.”"
"“Ah, then, you needn’t be surprised. A Frenchman has no obligation to"
understand anything that’s not French.”
“Nevertheless he was an intelligent man.”
“Did he perhaps have a good deal of veneration?”
"“No, he boasted of not having any.”"
“Doubtless he did have without suspecting it. With a man who had no
"veneration, what difference would it make whether there was one bad"
thing among a lot of good ones?”
"The German with the green hat, who understood something of the"
"conversation, was indignant at Cæsar’s irreverent ideas. He asked him"
"if he understood Latin, and Cæsar told him no, and then, in a strange"
"gibberish, half Latin and half Italian, he let loose a series of facts,"
"dates, and numbers. Then he asserted that all artistic things of great"
"merit were German: Greece. Rome, Gothic architecture, the Italian"
"Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci, Velázquez, all German."
"The snub-nosed young person, with his cape and his green hat with its"
"cock-feather, did not let a mouse escape from his German mouse-trap."
"The data of the befeathered German were too much for Cæsar, and he took"
his leave of the painters.
"While walking from the Bridge to the Old Swan, I remarked to Frances, ""My"
"engagement with Mary Hamilton is likely to be broken by her family."""
"""Why, Baron Ned?"" she asked in surprise."
"""Count Hamilton has challenged me to a duel, to be fought when he"
"returns, and you see, if I kill him or if he kills me, well--"" I"
"answered, shrugging my shoulders."
"She was much alarmed at my disclosure, but was reassured when I made"
"light of the affair, probably because there was no danger in it to George"
"Hamilton, and, perhaps, because if I should kill Count Hamilton, George"
would inherit the title and estates.
"""But poor Mary! She will grieve,"" said Frances."
"""I think you need waste no tears for her sake,"" I answered. ""She is a"
"fine, pretty little creature, who will take what comes her way without"
excess of pain or joy. She is incapable of feeling keenly. God has been
"good to her in giving her numbness."""
"""No, no, cousin Ned, you are wrong!"" she returned. ""Life without pain"
"is not worth living. I have heard that the Arabs have a saying, 'All"
sunshine makes the desert.' God is good to us when he darkens the sun
"now and then and gives us the sunshine afterwards."""
"""Perhaps you are right, Frances,"" I returned. ""But you and I are in the"
"cloud now, and a little sunshine would be most welcome."""
"""Not enough sunshine to make a desert,"" she answered."
"""I suppose so."""
"""And the way I phrased it. I actually said I'd bought the lower right"
"hand drawer and hadn't used it--take me with you, Frank."""
"""Rhoda, I was so wrong in--"""
"""_I_ was wrong, Frank. I was trying to mold you into my way of life. I"
"wanted you, but only as a part of my own eager little world. I had money"
"so I furnished my apartment. I put this here and that there, and hung a"
"toothbrush over the sink as necessarily functional, and then I decided I"
needed a man in the same way and so I picked you.
"""But I found out that the man in the bed was the most important part of"
it and without him there wasn't anything. Without him I didn't want any
of the other. Now ... I want to be a wife. A wife is a person who goes
where her husband goes and lives where he lives and shares what he has.
You don't barter and trade--this for that--give up this part to get
that. You give up everything and yet it isn't like that at all because
"you're really getting everything."""
He took out another cigarette.
"""Oh, Frank, it's all mixed up and I'm going to cry, I think."""
"""It's not mixed up at all,"" he said quietly. He turned to look at her,"
"half frowning, half smiling. ""Now why in the hell couldn't you have"
given me a little notice? Twenty minutes to plane time and I've got to
"get another reservation."""
"""I'm sorry, Frank."""

"pack it--and take it away? We..."""
"""Your luggage has been packed and is in the corridor. If you send"
"round for it, it shall be delivered to your messenger. But you are"
"not to stop on the premises another minute. You understand?"" he"
almost shrieked.
"""But--"""
"For answer, the soldiers took them by the shoulders and whirled"
"them through the revolving door on to the pavement, where a crowd"
"began to collect, as it does in peace or war if you cough twice or"
"sneeze three times in Brussels. ""Englische Hure! Englische"
"Küpplerin,"" shouted the soldiers as they retreated and locked the"
revolving door. Mrs. Warren turned purple and swayed. Vivie caught
her round the waist with her strong arm.... Thus was Mrs. Warren
ejected from the once homely inn which she had converted by her
"energy, management and capital into the second most magnificent"
hostelry of Brussels; thus was Vivie expelled from the place of her
birth....
Hearing the shouting and seeing the crowd a Belgian gendarme came
"up. To him Vivie said, ""Si vous êtes Chrétien et pas Allemand--"""
"""Prenez garde, Madame,"" he said warningly--""Vous m'aiderez à porter"
"ma mère à quelqu' endroit ou elle peut se remettre..."""
"Dawson came back after a few minutes, picked up another cigar from"
"Cary's box, and sat down. ""You see, I have a letter from him. I found"
"it in his quarters where I went straight from the _Malplaquet_."""
"""May we read it?"" I asked gently. ""I was greatly taken with Trehayne"
"myself. He was a clean, beautiful boy. He was an enemy officer on"
"Secret Service; there is no dishonour in that. If he were alive, I"
could shake his hand as the officer of the firing party shook the hand
"of Lody before he gave the last order."""
"Dawson took a paper from his pocket, and handed it to me. ""Read it"
"out,"" said he; ""I can't."""
CHAPTER VIII
TREHAYNE'S LETTER
I took the letter from Dawson and glanced through it. The first sheet
and the last had been written very recently--just before the boy had
left his quarters for the last time to go on board the _Malplaquet_;
the remainder had been set down at various times; and the whole had
"been connected up, put together, and paged after the completion of the"
"last sheet. Trehayne wrote a pretty hand, firm and clear, the writing"
of an artist who was also a trained engineer. There was no trace in
the script of nervousness or of hesitation. He had carried out his
"Orders, he saw clearly that the path which he had trod was leading him"
"to the end of his journey, but he made no complaint. He was a Latin,"
"""You need not assure me of that,"" I answered, taking Betty's hand. ""I"
"already know it. I am glad you--"""
"But here I was interrupted by a soft cry from Bettina, and by a"
"half-smothered scream from Frances, both of whom deserted me suddenly"
"and ran toward the door I had just entered. Turning, I saw Frances with"
"her arms about the Abbé's neck, and Bettina clasping one of his hands."
"I thought the two had gone mad, but when Bettina saw my look of surprise"
"and inquiry, she dropped his hand, came to me, and asked:--"
"""Did you want us to pretend that we did not know him? If so, you should"
"have told us."""
"""But you don't know him,"" I declared."
"""Perhaps I don't,"" she returned, laughing softly and shrugging her"
"shoulders, ""but evidently your cousin does. If not, she should take her"
"arms from around his neck."""
"""But she is mistaken,"" I insisted."
"""She seems to be convinced,"" answered Bettina, with a curious little"
"glance up to me, half laughing, half inquiring. Evidently she was"
doubtful whether I spoke in jest or in earnest.
"Frances still clung to the Abbé, her head resting on his shoulder, so I"
"started toward her, intending to correct her mistake. Bettina, seeing my"
"purpose, caught me by the arm, saying:--"
"""Don't you really know?"""
"The Abbé turned his face toward me, and when I caught a glimpse of his"
"“Phoebe,” she said, when the angular and jilted maid appeared, “we are"
"going to keep house for my nephew, Mr. Risca, and a young lady whom"
he has adopted. Will you tell me one thing? Is the lady of the house
supposed to clean the gentlemen's pipes?”
"“My father is a non-smoker, as well as a teetotaler, miss,” replied"
Phoebe.
“Dear me!” murmured Miss Lindon. “It's going to be a great puzzle.”
CHAPTER VII
"IT was a puzzle to John as much as to the palpitating lady, and in the"
maze of his puzzledom the gleam of humour that visited him during
"their interview lost its way. Walter Herold's eyes, however, twinkled"
maliciously when he heard John's account at once rueful and pig-headed.
Then he grew serious.
“It will be comic opera all the time. It can't be done.”
"“It 's going to be done,” said John, obstinately. “There's nothing else"
"to do. If I were a rich man, I could work wonders with a scratch in my"
cheque-book. I could hire an unexceptionable colonel's or clergyman's
widow to do the business. But I'm not. How I'm going to get the house
"together, as it is, I don't know. Besides,” he added, turning with some"
"savageness on his friend, “if you think it a comic-opera idea, kindly"
remember it was you who started it.”
"Though Herold was silenced for the moment, to the back of his mind still"
"He told her--he told her all he knew. She listened, horror-stricken,"
regarding him with open mouth and streaming eyes.
"“And what do you think is my duty?” asked John, abruptly."
Miss Lindon shook her head. “I 'm sure I don't know what to advise
"you, dear. I 'll try to find out some kind Christian people who want a"
servant.”
"“I don't want any kind Christian people at all,” said John. “I'm going"
to make up in ease and happiness for all the wrongs that humanity has
"inflicted on her. I am going to adopt her, educate her, fill her up with"
the good things of life.”
"“That's very fine of you, John,” said Miss Lindon. “Some people are"
as fond of their adopted children as of their own. I remember Miss
"Engleshaw adopted a little child. She was four, if I remember right,"
and she used to dress her so prettily. I used to go and help her choose
frocks. Really they were quite expensive. Now I come to think of
"it, John, I could help you that way with little Unity. I don't think"
gentlemen have much experience in choosing little girls' frocks. How old
is she?”
"“Nearly sixteen,” said John."
"“That's rather old,” said Miss Lindon, from whose mind this new interest"
seemed to have driven the tragic side of the question. “It's a pity you
could n't have begun when she was four.”
"“It is,” said John."
"“Only if you had begun with her at four, you would n't be wanting to"
the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution.

He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown
up in a surfacing boat.
"""Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we"
"might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,"
"she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four."""
"""How's that?"""
"""The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on"
Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way
"back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with"
the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die
or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the
"planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal"
"husband, he's not much to boast about."""
"The stranger nodded violently. ""Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody"
"anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a"
"bellyful!"""
"He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been"
able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little
islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a
"surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive"
"planet, he didn't know ""it's a woman's world,"" like the older boys in"
school used to say.

"Little-Englanders, denounced him as a Turk, an assassin, a"
"seventeenth-century Spanish _conquistador_ of the bloodiest type, and"
"held him up to popular execration, and recalled him, and put him on a"
beggarly pension years before he had reached his age limit. He could
tell them stories which seemed (and in truth deserved to be) incredible.
"“John,” said Lady Blount, “has heard all this a thousand times,”--as"
"indeed he had,--“and must be sick to death of it. He is not going out to"
Australia as governor-general.”
"“Who said he was, my dear?” said Sir Oliver."
"“If you did n't imply it, you were talking nonsense, Oliver,” Lady"
Blount retorted.
"“Anyhow, Oliver, do you think John is taking a wise step?” Herold"
hastily interposed.
"“I do,” said he; “a very wise step.”"
"“I don't agree with you at all,” said Lady Blount, with a snap of"
finality.
"“Your remark, my dear,” replied Sir Oliver, “does not impress me in the"
least. When did you ever agree with me?”
"“Never, my dear Oliver,” said Lady Blount, with the facial smile of"
the secretly hostile fencer. “And I thank Heaven for it. I may not be a
"brilliant woman, but I am endowed with common sense.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at her for a moment, with lips parted, as if to"
"“Powder,” answered the Canon. “She has been using her puff too freely.”"
"“She has been putting it on with a _muff_,” cried Yvonne."
He laughed. Yvonne had such a triumphant air in delivering herself of
little witticisms.
"A magnificently dressed woman, in a great feathered hat and low-dress,"
"with diamonds gleaming at her neck, passed by. “You are right, I fear,"
"about the two worlds,” said the Canon."
“Are n’t there crowds of them? I like to look at them because they wear
such beautiful things. And they fit so. And then to rub shoulders with
"them makes one feel so delightfully wicked. You know, I knew a girl"
once--she went in for that life of her own accord and she was awfully
happy. Really. Is n’t it odd?”
"“My dear Yvonne!” said the Canon, somewhat shocked, “I sincerely trust"
"you did not continue the acquaintance, afterwards.”"
"“Oh, no,” she replied, sagely. “It would not have done for me at all."
A lone woman can’t be too careful. But I used to hear about her from my
dressmaker.”
Her point of view was not exactly the Canon’s. But further discussion
"was stopped by the arrival of the Wilmingtons, who carried off Yvonne"
"to the dancing-room. The Canon, drawing the line at his own appearance"
"there, strolled back contentedly to the hotel to finish the evening over"
a book.
Two mornings afterwards Yvonne was walking by herself along the _digue_.
"They were to leave for Switzerland the next day, and she determined to"
"Colonel Carmichael thrust her behind him, and an instant later she"
heard the report of his revolver. There was no answering volley. A
"dark, scantily-clad figure sprang through the trees, waving one hand"
as though in imperative appeal.
"""Don't fire--don't fire! It's me!"""
"The Colonel's still smoking revolver sank, and the supposed native"
"swayed toward him, only to sink a few yards farther on to the ground."
Carmichael ran to his side and lifted the fainting head against his
shoulder.
"""Good God, Geoffries! Don't say I've hit you! How on earth was I to"
"know!"""
"""That's all right, Colonel. Only winded--don't you know--never hurried"
so much in life. Have been in the midst of the beggars--just managed
"to slip through. O Lor', give me something to drink, will you?"""
Colonel Carmichael put his flask to the parched and broken lips.
"""Thanks, that's better. We got your message, and are coming on like"
fun. The regiment's only an hour off. You never saw Saunders in such a
"fluster--it's his first big job, you know."" He took another deep"
"draft, and wiped his mouth with the corner of his ragged tunic. ""I"
"say--don't look at me, Miss Lois. I'm not fit to be seen."" He laughed"
"hoarsely. ""These clothes weren't made in Bond Street, and Webb assured"
"me that the fewer I had the more genuine I looked. I say, Colonel,"
"this is a lively business!"""
Colonel Carmichael nodded as he helped the gasping and exhausted man
into the bungalow.
and said to the eating-house keeper:
"""Egor Terentievitch Vaviloff?  Are you he?"""
"""I am,"" answered the sergeant, leaning on the bar with both arms as if"
intending to jump over it.
"""I have some business with you,"" said Petunikoff."
"""Delighted.  Please come this way to my private room."""
"They went in and sat down, the guest on the couch and his host on the"
chair opposite to him.  In one corner a lamp was burning before a
"gigantic icon, and on the wall at the other side there were several oil"
"lamps.  They were well kept and shone as if they were new.  The room,"
"which contained a number of boxes and a variety of furniture, smelt of"
"tobacco, sour cabbage, and olive oil.  Petunikoff looked around him and"
"made a face.  Vaviloff looked at the icon, and then they looked"
"simultaneously at one another, and both seemed to be favourably"
"impressed.  Petunikoff liked Vaviloff's frankly thievish eyes, and"
"Vaviloff was pleased with the open, cold, determined face of"
"Petunikoff, with its large cheeks and white teeth."
"""Of course you already know me, and I presume you guess what I am going"
"to say to you,"" began Petunikoff."
"""About the lawsuit? ... I presume?"" remarked the ex-sergeant,"
respectfully.
"""Exactly!  I am glad to see that you are not beating about the bush,"
"but going straight to the point like a business man,"" said Petunikoff,"
encouragingly.
“It must be such an adventure. It must make you hold your breath and
your heart beat.”
John wondered grimly whether a certain doer of wickedness had felt this
"ecstatic rapture. She, too, must have seen the gray dawn, but creeping"
through prison-bars into her cell. God of Inscrutability! Was it
"possible that these two co-watchers of the dawn, both so dominant in his"
"life, were of the same race of beings? If the one was a woman born of"
"woman, what in the name of mystery was Stellamaris?"
"“Don't look so grave, Great High Belovedest,” she said, squeezing a"
finger. “I only spoke in fun. It must really be horrid to be wicked.
When I was little I had a book about Cruel Frederick--I think it
"belonged to grandmama. It had awful pictures, and there were rhymes--"
"He tore the wings off little flies,"
And then poked out their little eyes.
And there was a picture of his doing so. I used to think him a
detestable boy. It made me unhappy and kept me awake when I was quite
"small, but now I know it's all nonsense. People don't do such things, do"
they?”
"Risca twisted his glum face into a smile, remembering the Unwritten Law."
"“Of course not, Stellamaris,” said he. “Cruel Frederick is just as much"
"of a mythical personage as the Giant Fee-fo-fum, who said:"
"I smell the blood of an Englishman,"
"And be he alive or be he dead,"
He made his way down through an ascending stream of newly-arrived
"guests, with some difficulty, just as Ffolliott, seeing Sir Tankerton"
"Wollup hesitate at the door, went up to the great man mincingly, and"
said affectedly:
"“Oh, I say, Sir Tankerton--d’you know, I feel such an awful ass--but"
they told me it was a fancy-dress affair.”
"Sir Tankerton, staring with bloodshot eyes of ruffled dignity at the"
"thing before him, sniffed."
“Go away!” he said testily.
Ffolliott went away.
"As the pompous millionaire stood irresolute at the doorway, an"
"absent-minded snuffy little old gentleman shuffled up to his elbow,"
followed at a couple of paces by a little faded old lady of withered
"prehistoric design, and, touching him on the sleeve inquiringly, said:"
"“My good man--before you announce our names, will you tell me which is"
the host? I have never seen my host before--in fact----”
"“Poof--poof!” squealed Sir Tankerton Wollup, and strutted into the room."
“Dear me!” The little old gentleman turned to his little old lady; and
added in a confidential undertone:
“A most extraordinary person--a most extraordinary _house_!... But I
"have always heard, my dear, that Bohemia was a strange country.... In"
"fact, Charlotte, it’s _rather_ thrilling, is it not?”"
"There was no one about, and a few children's faces at a window suddenly"
"disappeared. Everything here was small and poor, though only the barn was"
of peat; the house was a timbered fisherman's home. As I entered the
"house, I saw that though it was as poor within as without, the floor was"
clean and covered with pine twigs. There were many children here. The
mother was busy cooking something over the fire.
"I was offered a chair, and sitting down, began to chat with a couple of"
"small boys. As I was in no hurry and asked for nothing, the woman said:"
"""I expect you want a boat?"""
"""A boat?"" I said in my turn, for I had not come by boat on my last visit;"
I had walked instead over fjelds and valleys many miles from the sea.
"""Yes, why not?"" I said. ""But where does it go?"""
"""I thought you wanted a boat to go to the trading center,"" she replied,"
"""because that's where the steamer stops. We've rowed over lots of people"
"this year."""
Great changes here; the motor traffic in Stordalen must have completely
altered all the other traffic since my last visit ten months ago.
"""Where can I stop for a few days?"" I asked."
"""At the trading center, the other side of the islands. Or there's Eilert"
and Olaus; they're both on this side. You could go there; they've got big
"houses."""
"She showed me the two places on this side of the water, close to the"
"shore, and I proceeded thither."

and social and scientific prestige. When an exposé of the methods
employed by him in furthering his schemes for the glorifying of the
"name of ""Weaver"" in the medical world is threatened, it is frustrated"
"through the efforts of the famous doctor's younger brother, Dr. Jim."
"The story is powerful and compelling, even if it uncovers the problems"

"""Mart!"" she cried. ""It's _not_ Jed Starrow! It's--it's--Cap'n Phin"
"Davies! And that means that--_Lav_--_made_--_it_!"" And happy tears ran"
down her cheeks.
Under the skilled guidance of the man at its wheel the _Sally_ soon
came alongside of the _Arabella_. Cap'n Davies promptly boarded the
schooner and the next instant Sidney was in his arms.
"""All I'll say is praise be to God!"" the old mariner muttered. ""And now"
I cal'late you and your mates here are 'bout ready to abandon your
"cruisin'--"""
"""Lav, is he--all right?"" demanded Sidney, still clinging to Cap'n Phin."
"""Well, he jest about made port and how he is now I can't say for I"

"lyin' there at Rockman's. Give us a hand, Saunders, while we load on"
"this cargo of distress!"" A roughness in the old man's voice betrayed"
that the big heart was not as light as he would have the girls think.
For hours they had searched the bay with only their knowledge of tides
and winds to guide them; more than once the others had been ready to
"abandon the search as futile, but the Captain had held them stubbornly"
to it.
Pola needed no urging but leaped into the _Sally_ and sank to its
bottom with a long gasp of relief. Sidney and Mart were about to follow
her example when a word from Cap'n Davies held Sidney.
"""We'll let a government boat pick up the _Arabella_. We'll take no"
"chances tryin' to tow her in with the _Sally_."" And then Sidney thought"
of the treasure.
"RAYNER, CAPTAIN."

"READ, MARY. Woman pirate."
Born in London of obscure parentage; all that is known for certain is that
"her mother was a ""young and airy widow."" Mary was brought up as a boy, and"
at the age of 13 was engaged as a footboy to wait on a French lady. Having
"a roving spirit, Mary ran away and entered herself on board a man-of-war."
"Deserting a few years later, she enlisted in a regiment of foot and fought"
"in Flanders, showing on all occasions great bravery, but quitted the"
service to enlist in a regiment of horse. Her particular comrade in this
"regiment was a Fleming, with whom she fell in love and disclosed to him"
"the secret of her sex. She now dressed as a woman, and the two troopers"
"were married, ""which made a great noise,"" and several of her officers"
attended the nuptials. She and her husband got their discharge and kept an
"eating house or ordinary, the Three Horseshoes, near the Castle of Breda."
“I am not!” sobbed Jessica.
“You are.” He glanced about. No one was in sight. He put his arm about
"her shoulders, forcing her own to her sides, then bent back her head and"
kissed her on the mouth.
“Checkmate!” he said.

GERTRUDE ATHERTON was born in San Francisco and received her
"early education in California and Kentucky, but her best"
"training was in her grandfather’s library, a collection, it is"
"said, of English masterpieces only, containing no American"
fiction whatever. Yet Mrs. Atherton is as thorough an American
"as a niece, in the third generation, of Benjamin Franklin should"
be.
It seems to have been the English critics who first recognised
"her originality, power, intensity, vividness, and vitality, but"
"from her first book, “What Dreams May Come,” published in 1888,"
her writings have revealed the unusual combination of brains and
"feeling. This gives her work both keen, clever strength and"
"brilliancy of colour, developed through years of hard work, many"
"of which were spent abroad, and reaching their best"
"manifestation in her latest fiction, the one quality in “The"
Conqueror” and the other in “The Splendid Idle Forties.” Both of
"these books go to prove the foresight of Mr. Harold Frederic,"
"""What do you want it for?"""
"""Give it to me ...  Perhaps there is something in it about us ..."""
"""About whom?"""
"""About the village."""
"They laughed at him, and threw him the paper.  He took it, and read in"
"it how in the village the hail had destroyed the cornfields, how in"
"another village fire destroyed thirty houses, and that in a third a"
"woman had poisoned her family,--in fact, everything that it is"
"customary to write of,--everything, that is to say, which is bad, and"
which depicts only the worst side of the unfortunate village.  Tyapa
"read all this silently and roared, perhaps from sympathy, perhaps from"
delight at the sad news.
"He passed the whole Sunday in reading his Bible, and never went out"
"collecting rags on that day.  While reading, he groaned and sighed"
"continually.  He kept the book close to his breast, and was angry with"
any one who interrupted him or who touched his Bible.
"""Oh, you drunken blackguard,"" said Kuvalda to him, ""what do you"
"understand of it?"""
"""Nothing, wizard!  I don't understand anything, and I do not read any"
"books ...  But I read ..."""

"are insects in your head, you know it is uncomfortable, but if some"
"thoughts enter there too, how will you live then, you old toad?"""
your watchfulness. I had full information of King Charles's design upon
"my life from no less a person than Monsieur le Grand himself, who showed"
me the letter asking that I be returned to England.
"""I explained to Monsieur le Grand that the English king sought my life,"
"not because he is in fear of me, but because he thought I stood between"
him and a lady who despises him. While Monsieur le Grand was much in
"sympathy with the English king's grievance, his contempt for Charles,"
"his regard for me, which seems to be sincere, and his longing to possess"
"Dunkirk all induced him to laugh at the request, the nature of which he"
had imparted to no one save me.
"""My account of the lady who despised King Charles's love gave Monsieur le"
"Grand a new idea, and suggested a method of purchasing Dunkirk which he"
hopes will save the heavy cost of bidding against the citizens of London.
I had no hint of what he intended till one day he took me to his closet
and began to question me.
"""'Do you possess the love of the lady who despises King Charles?' he"
asked.
"""'I do, your Majesty,' I answered."
"""'Do you know you possess it?' he asked."
"""'As well as a man who is not a king may know,' I returned."
"""'Tush, tush! Kings are no more certain than other men.'"
"""'I know I possess this woman's love,' I said."
"""'Would she be willing to make a great sacrifice to help you?'"
"Mr. Myre read the letter; and, as he read, his face became more like"
the hue of badly-made paste.
"He was a long time reading it, Gaston Latour’s sleepy eyes never"
leaving him.
"He burst into a harsh laugh, and flung the letter into the air:"
"“A challenge, eh? ... ha-ha! ho-ho-ho!... Tell your cousin, Monsieur"
"Latour, that the duel is relegated to the limbo of opera-bouffe."
Ho-ho-ho! We do not do these things in England.”
He prepared himself for a flight of oratory.
Gaston Latour nudged the other youth--they bowed solemnly and withdrew.
“Ho-ho! ha-ha-ha!” laughed Quogge Myre.
The following morning Mr. Quilliam O’Flaherty Macloughlin Myre’s name
"was posted in every club in Paris, and struck from the list of those to"
which he had belonged; so it came about that he had to live his day at
cafés.
"And it was as he stood at a table, giving authoritative utterance with"
"loud yawing voice to a group of youths that sat about him, vowing that"
he had determined to shake the dust of Paris from off his splay feet
"and to start a great renaissance of the English drama, when a handsome"
"young woman, sister to Gaston Latour, entered the place, walked"
"straight up to Mr. Myre, and struck him a sounding buffet on the ear"
that sent his hat flying from his head.
"""Ay! But enough to make a garden,"" I returned, as we climbed the narrow"
flight of steps leading to the private entrance to the Old Swan.
"When we paused at the door, Frances said, ""Your garden is at hand."" And"
"when she opened the door, there stood Betty, and I was in Eden. The moist"
"glow of her eyes, the faint blush of her cheeks, the nervous fluttering"
"of her voice, spoke more eloquently than all the tongues of Babel could"
"have spoken, and I could not help comparing her welcome with that which"
Maxy Hamilton had given me at the queen's ball.
"Bettina led us to the parlor, and while we were drinking a cup of tea,"
we had the great pleasure of asking and answering questions of which we
always had a large supply in reserve.
"When it was time to go, Bettina walked down to the Bridge with us. As it"
"was growing dark, Frances suggested that I walk back to the Old Swan with"
"Betty, which I did, she taking my arm of her own accord, and both of us"
"very happy, though we spoke not a word, for fear of saying too much, save"

CHAPTER XII
A PERILOUS EMBASSY
"Four or five days after our visit to Bettina, I met De Grammont at"
and an uneasy eye.
"“That is the Hungarian violinist Kolozsvar,” said Susanna."
"“Kolozsvar, Kolozsvar!” they heard everybody saying."
“Is he a great virtuoso?” Cæsar asked Kennedy.
"“No, I think not,” answered Kennedy. “It seems that this Hungarian’s"
"speciality is playing the waltzes and folk-songs of his own country,"
which is certainly not anything great; but his successes are not
"obtained with the violin, but among the women. The ladies in London"
"fight for him. His game is to pass himself off as a fallen man,"
"depraved, worn-out. There you have his phraseology.... They see a man to"
"save, to raise up, and convert into a great artist, and almost all of"
them yield to this temptation.”
"“That is comical,” said Cæsar, looking curiously at the fiddler and his"
lady.
"“To a Spaniard,” replied Kennedy, “it is comical; and probably it would"
be to an Italian too; but in England there are many women that have a
"purely imaginative idealism, a romanticism fed on ridiculous novels, and"
"they fall into traps like these, which seem clumsy and grotesque to you"
"here in the South, where people are more clear-sighted and realistic.”"
"Cæsar watched the brave fiddler, who played the role of a man used up,"
to great perfection.
"After tea, Susanna invited them to go up to her rooms, and Laura and her"
brother and Kennedy and Mr. Russell went.
dance-contracts.
"Next morning, she found Mr. Wagge with a tall, crape-banded hat in his"
"black-gloved hands, standing in the very centre of her drawing-room.  He"
"was staring into the garden, as if he had been vouchsafed a vision of"
that warm night when the moonlight shed its ghostly glamour on the
"sunflowers, and his daughter had danced out there. She had a perfect view"
"of his thick red neck in its turndown collar, crossed by a black bow over"
"a shiny white shirt.  And, holding out her hand, she said:"
"""How do you do, Mr. Wagge?  It was kind of you to come."""
Mr. Wagge turned.  His pug face wore a downcast expression.
"""I hope I see you well, ma'am.  Pretty place you 'ave 'ere.  I'm fond of"
"flowers myself.  They've always been my 'obby."""
"""They're a great comfort in London, aren't they?"""
"""Ye-es; I should think you might grow the dahlia here.""  And having thus"
"obeyed the obscure instincts of savoir faire, satisfied some obscurer"
"desire to flatter, he went on: ""My girl showed me your letter.  I didn't"
like to write; in such a delicate matter I'd rather be vivey vocey.  Very
"kind, in your position; I'm sure I appreciate it.  I always try to do the"
Christian thing myself. Flesh passes; you never know when you may have to
"take your turn. I said to my girl I'd come and see you."""
"""I'm very glad.  I hoped perhaps you would."""
"Mr. Wagge cleared his throat, and went on, in a hoarser voice:"
"""I don't want to say anything harsh about a certain party in your"
*       *       *       *       *
"Sis nodded to herself, waved the door open, and walked out."
"""Let's hope,"" the Captain said. ""Like any father used to say, a man who"
"knows how to handle women, how to get around them without their knowing"
"it, doesn't need to know anything else in this life. I'm plain wasted"
"in space. You can lower your hands now, son."""
We sat down and I explained the blaster to him. He was very interested.
He said all Butt had told him--in the lifeboat when they decided to
use my arrest as a club over Sis--was to keep the safety catch all the
way up against his thumb. I could see he really had been excited about
"carrying a lethal weapon around. He told me that back in the old days,"
"captains--sea captains, that is--actually had the right to keep guns"
in their cabins all the time to put down mutinies and other things our
ancestors did.
"The telewall flickered, and we turned it on. Sis smiled down."
"""Everything's all right, Captain. Come up and marry us, please."""
"""What did you stick him for?"" he asked. ""What was the price?"""
"Sis's full lips went thin and hard, the way Mom's used to. Then she"
"thought better of it and laughed. ""Mr. Brown is going to see that I'm"
"elected sheriff of the Galertan Archipelago."""
"""And I thought she'd settle for a county clerkship!"" the Captain"
muttered as we spun up to the brig.
The doors were open and girls were chattering in every corner. Sis came
up to the Captain to discuss arrangements. I slipped away and found

"(_e_) Oriental authors, including Jewish rabbis: e.g., _Abu Bakr ibn"
Badr_.
This rule has many exceptions. Some Oriental writers are known and
"should be entered under other parts of their name than the first, as"
"""_Abu-l-Kasim, Khalaf ibn Abbas_,"" _Firdusi, Abul Kasim_, etc., _known"
"as_, or under some appellation as ""_al-Masudi_,"" ""_at-Tabari_."""
"In Arabic names, the words of relationship _Abu_ (father), _Umm_"
"(mother), _Ibn_, _Bin_ (son), _Ahu_ (brother), though not to be treated"
"as names by themselves, are yet not to be disregarded. They form a"
"name in conjunction with the word following (e.g., _Abu Bakr_), and"
determine the alphabetical place of the entry. But the article _al_
"(changed by assonance to _ad_-, _ar_-, _as_-, _at_-, _az_-, according"
to the letter it precedes) is neglected (al- _Masudi_).
"In all Oriental names, the indexer must be careful not to take titles,"

"a cross-reference from the second; if there are three or more, enter"

thought that she had been unjust was iron through Mrs. Carmichael's
"soul, for above all things she prided herself on her fairness. She"
pushed her work away and went over to Beatrice's side. Mrs. Cary's
"head still rested against the aching shoulder, and Mrs. Carmichael"
made a sign to let her improvize a cushion substitute. Beatrice shook
her head.
"""No, thank you,"" she whispered, glancing down at the flushed, sleeping"
"face. ""We have done each other so little real service that I am glad"
to be able to do even this much. I don't suppose it will be for long.
"How quiet everything is!"""
Mrs. Carmichael looked at the clock on the writing-table.
"""It is not yet midnight,"" she said. ""Probably the Rajah is keeping his"
"promise."" Her expression relaxed a little. ""Don't tire yourself,"" she"
"added bruskly to Mrs. Berry, who had been fanning the unconscious"
"woman's face with an improvized paper fan. ""I don't think she feels"
"the heat."""
The missionary's wife continued her good work with redoubled energy.
It was perhaps one of the few really unselfish things which she had
"ever done in the course of a pious but fundamentally selfish life, and"
it gave her pleasure and courage. The knowledge that some one was
weaker than herself and needed her was new strength to her new-born
heroism.
"""It is so frightfully hot,"" she said half apologetically. ""Why isn't"
"the punkah-man at work?"""
"""The 'punkah-man' has bolted with the rest of them,"" Mrs. Carmichael"
"answered. ""I dare say I could work it, though I have never tried."""
"allow her,--and great gladness lit her face."
“Darling! Are you going to stay here to-day and to-morrow and the next
day?”
"“My dear,” said John, “I've got to get up to town this morning.”"
"“You won't do that,” said Stella. “Look at the clock.”"
"It was a quarter to one. He had spent the whole morning with her, and"
the hours had flown by like minutes.
“Why did n't you tell me that I ought to be catching my train?”
She regarded him in demure mischief.
“I had no object in making you catch your train.”
"And then Her Serene High-and-Mightiness, the nurse (who had been called"
"in for Stella when first she was put to bed in the sea-chamber, and,"
"falling under her spell, had stayed on until she had grown as much"
involved in the web of her life as Sir Oliver and Lady Julia and
"Constable and Herold and Risca), came into the room and decreed the end"
of the morning interview.
"Risca went down-stairs, his purpose unaccomplished. He walked about the"
"garden and argued with himself. Now, when a man argues with himself, he,"
"being only the extraneous eidolon of himself, invariably gets the worst"
"of the argument, and this makes him angry. John was angry; to such a"
"point that, coming across Sir Oliver, who had just returned from an"
inexplicably disastrous game of golf and began to pour a story of
"bunkered gloom into his ear, he gnashed his teeth and tore his hair and"
"A Christian hymn is a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally"
"conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the"
"worshiper’s attitude toward God, or God’s purposes, in human life."
"L. F. Benson, America’s foremost hymnologist, defines a hymn in these"
simple words:
The Christian hymn ... is a form of words appropriate to be sung or
chanted in public devotions.
"A hymn is to be sung _by a congregation_. Its message must be simple,"
"not subtle. It must read well and sing well. In modern usage, the hymn"
is not limited to the praise of God but includes other moods of worship
such as resignation and consecration.
2. The Beginnings of Christian Song.
Hymn singing has always been associated with Christian worship. Jesus
"and the Twelve sang a hymn, presumably a portion of the _Hallel_ (Ps."
"115-118), after the Supper was ended. Paul and Silas sang hymns, “songs"
"of the night,” during the midnight hours of their imprisonment in"
Philippi. The great Apostle recognized the value of song when he
exhorted the churches thus:
Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns
"and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the"
"Lord. Eph. 5:18, 19."
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and
"admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,"
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. Col. 3:16.
"bought Lilly, body and soul--with promises."" The king shrugged his"
"shoulders and whispered: ""With promises, you understand, Baron Ned, with"
"promises. Now give him a chance at the Abbé."""
"Charles laughed and chuckled in self-gratulation, not the least"
suspecting that he was talking to the wrong man and playing into the
French king's hand. I bore in mind the fact that the king had bought
"Lilly with promises, and I determined to buy the good Doctor with ready"
gold.
"""I'll try to carry out your Majesty's commands,"" I answered, apparently"
"doubtful of my ability. ""But of course you would not have me insist, if"
"the Abbé seems disinclined to consult Lilly."""
"""No, no! Odds fish, man, no! But find a way to bring them together,"
"and your reward will come later. I choose, you for this little piece of"
business because you are in no way connected with the affair between the
"French king and me, and because I know you are to be trusted."""
I to be trusted! So was Brutus!
"""I shall do my best, your Majesty, and if I fail, I shall notify you at"
"once,"" I said, taking my leave."
"I hastened to De Grammont's house, which at that time was over near the"
"Mall, and told the count what the king had said."
"""Ah, that is good!"" cried De Grammont. ""A fool, who knows himself to be a"
"fool, is likely to be wary, but one who deems himself wise is the easiest"
"dupe in the world. I'll see Monsieur l'Abbé. Wait."""
"De Grammont returned in a few minutes, saying that the Abbé would go with"
they walked along the waterfront fishermen and tourists and boys and
girls stared and nodded and Sidney's sensitive soul mistook their
obvious interest for ridicule. She walked with lowered eyes lest she
encounter Mrs. Calkins or Pola's mother.
Cap'n Phin was waiting outside the door of the shed on Rockman's wharf.
He nodded to Sidney and Trude and beckoned them inside. At any other
"time, in any other state of mind, Sidney would have thrilled to his air"
of mystery.
Four men sat in wooden chairs tipped at various angles and on the floor
before them stood the wooden box from the _Arabella_. The men nodded
and smiled at Sidney and brought their chairs to the floor as though to
attention.
Cap'n Davies solemnly motioned Sidney and Trude to two vacant chairs
and then cleared his throat.
"""I cal'late, Miss Sidney, that you've a sort o' interest in this cargo"
we brought in on the _Sally_ so we stood by 'til you hove in sight.
"Now, mebbe it's what we think it is and mebbe it isn't. Si, give a hand"
"and unload."""
One of the men knelt down by the box and proceeded to open it with a
hammer and a chisel. The others leaned forward with interest. Sidney
held her breath.
"The man Si, having torn off the cover, put his hands into the paper"
wrappings and drew forth yards and yards of magnificently embroidered
fabric that made Sidney and Trude gasp in admiration and astonishment.
But the others were plainly disappointed. A low murmur of disgust went
around the room.
Mrs. White took the sketch forcibly from Trude. She frowned over it.
One of the girls certainly did look like Sidney as she remembered the
child from their one meeting.
"""How do you explain it, Trude?"""
"Trude sighed heavily. ""I can't explain it. There's something wrong"
"somewhere. And it's my fault, Aunt Edith. I--I consented--we all"
consented to let Sidney go off down there just so that we could go
ahead with our own plans. But we thought--we felt _certain_ that these
cousins were very nice--I--I mean had a lovely home and were rich so
that Sidney might get something out of her visit that she couldn't get
"at home. It sounds shameful to _say_ it."""
"""I understand, my dear. But what made you think so?"""
"""The--the letter this Cousin Achsa wrote. It _was_ a very nice letter!"""
"""Well, _I_ have always thought you could judge anyone's character and"
"background by a letter. There must be something wrong. This girl--"""
"pointing to the sketch, ""is positively shocking! At least she would be"
"around here."""
"""I remember now something Sidney said--when she was begging us to let"
her go away. 'I want to be different! I want to go somewhere where I
won't be Joseph Romley's daughter. I want adventure and to do exciting
"things--' Those were her very words! I didn't take them seriously then,"
"but, oh, Aunt Edith, perhaps she meant them more than we guessed!"" Poor"
"Trude rose quickly to her feet. ""Aunt Edith, I simply _must_ go to"
Provincetown at once. May I ask Pepper to find out about trains?
"You'll--you'll understand, won't you? I can't be happy one minute until"
"I see the child. I feel that it's all my fault."""
Frances and I felt that we were traitors to our country in helping the
"French king, but we knew that in the end he would buy Dunkirk from our"
"spendthrift monarch, and that out country's loss would be no greater by"
reason of our gain. Therefore I wrote George as follows:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""The Duchess of Hearts is eager and confident. Write at once, giving full"
directions.
"""YOUR FRIEND."""
"Frances added a postscript in cipher, but I shall not translate it."
"One morning, some three weeks after sending my letter, Frances came to me"
"in my closet in the Wardrobe, and I saw at once she was in great trouble."
"Her eyes were red with weeping, and the woebegone expression of her face"
would have been amusing had I not known that some good cause was back of
"it. As soon as she entered I saw that she was going to speak, but closets"
"in Whitehall have ears, so I placed my finger on my lips to enjoin"
"silence, and spoke loud enough to be heard if any one was listening:--"
"""Ah, Frances, I forgot that I had promised to go with you to your"
father's this morning. Wait for me at Holbein's Gate. I'll be there in
"ten minutes."""
"Within the promised time I found Frances at Holbein's Gate, and we walked"
"up to Charing Cross, thence down the Strand toward Temple Bar."
"""What is the trouble, Frances?"" I asked, anxious to hear her news, which"
"I feared was bad. She was in great distress, and I saw that a flood of"
"""I'm here with a message from your mistress, Betty.  Keep your head;"
"don't look round, but listen to me.  She's at Bury Street and going to"
"stay there; she wants you and baby and the dogs.""  The stout woman's eyes"
grew round and her mouth opened.  Winton put his hand on the
"perambulator.  ""Steady, now!  Go out as usual with this thing.  It's"
about your time; and wait for me at the turning to Regent's Park.  I'll
come on in my cab and pick you all up.  Don't get flurried; don't take
"anything; do exactly as you usually would. Understand?"""
It is not in the nature of stout women with babies in their charge to
"receive such an order without question.  Her colour, and the heaving of"
that billowy bosom made Winton add quickly:
"""Now, Betty, pull yourself together; Gyp wants you.  I'll tell you all"
"about it in the cab."""
"The poor woman, still heaving vaguely, could only stammer:"
"""Yes, sir.  Poor little thing!  What about its night-things?  And Miss"
"Gyp's?"""
"Conscious of that figure still at the window, Winton made some passes"
"with his fingers at the baby, and said:"
"""Never mind them.  As soon as you see me at the drawing-room window, get"
"ready and go.  Eyes front, Betty; don't look round; I'll cover your"
"retreat!  Don't fail Gyp now.  Pull yourself together."""
"With a sigh that could have been heard in Kensington, Betty murmured:"
"""Very well, sir; oh dear!"" and began to adjust the strings of her bonnet."
"With nods, as if he had been the recipient of some sage remarks about the"
"baby, Winton saluted, and began his march again towards the house.  He"
"know--all strangers, save one.  This was a cabinet portrait in a heavy"
"silver frame, and as I took it up to scrutinise it more closely a cry"
involuntarily escaped my lips.
The picture was a three-quarter length representation of a
"black-bearded, keen-eyed man, standing with his hands thrust idly in his"
"pockets, and smoking a cigarette.  There was no mistaking those"
features.  It was the photograph of the man the discovery of whose
presence in Paris had produced such an extraordinary effect upon her--
Rodolphe Wolf.
CHAPTER SEVEN.
BY A THREAD.
"I was still standing by the window, holding the photograph in my hand,"
"and gazing upon it in wonder, when Dick Deane was shown in."
"""What's the matter, old chap?  Are you the man in possession here?"" he"
"asked breezily, gripping me by the hand."
"He was a fair, merry-faced fellow of thirty-five, rather good-looking,"
"smartly dressed in black frock-coat of professional cut, and wearing a"
"pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez.  He had been born in Paris, and had spent"
"the greater part of his life there, except during the years when he was"
"at school with me before going to Edinburgh, where he took his degree."
"Then he had returned to Paris, taken his French degree, and had soon"
risen to be one of the fashionable doctors in the French capital.  He
"was an especial favourite in the salons, and, like every good-looking"
"doctor, a favourite with the ladies."
"""I'm not in possession,"" I answered.  ""A very serious affair has"
*CHAPTER IX.*
"*""A MAD WORLD, MY MASTERS.""*"
"""Master, master, wake up!  What ails you? Have you forgot the day, and"
"what has to be done?"""
"Dick, with an expression of uneasiness and determination upon his face,"
was shaking Grey somewhat vehemently by the shoulder.  The latter seemed
"to find it hard to wake; and when his eyes opened at last, there was a"
lack-lustre expression in them that was strange and unnatural.  Dick’s
honest face clouded over yet more.
"""I was certain there was some devilry afoot when they all came here last"
"night.  I have never seen my master in such a mad mood of merriment,"" he"
"muttered half aloud, as he turned away to get a brimming glass of pure"
"cold water from the table.  ""What has come over them, I don’t know.  But"
I like not the change. I liked not the look in Lord Sandford’s eyes.  He
"is a great man, I doubt it not; but I wish my master had chanced upon"
another as a friend and comrade in this great Babylon of a city.  There
"is more going on here than I well understand."""
"""What are you grumbling over there to yourself, Dicon?"" asked Grey from"
"his bed, and his voice sounded more natural and quiet than his servant"
"had heard it yet; ""and where am I?  For sure this room is strange to"
"mine eyes, nor have I any recollection of it overnight; and how come you"
"to be here, for that matter, honest Dicon?  Methought you were at"
"Hampstead, watching over Don Carlos, that he might be ready for"
"Saturday’s race."""
"""The murder!"" exclaimed the Captain."
"""Don't talk to me about it, Perry,"" the Chief Justice requested, opening"
"a paper in front of his face. He did not, however, withdraw out of"
earshot.
"""They've got a sort of a clue. A wretched hobbledehoy of a fellow,"
"something in the bookseller's shop at the corner of Kettle Street, has"
come with a rigmarole about a society that he and a few more belonged
"to, including this François Gaspard, who is missing. He protests that"
"the thing was legal, and all that--only a Radical inner ring--but he"
says that at the last meeting this fellow was dropping hints about
putting somebody out of the way. Dyer--that's the lad's name--swears the
"rest of them disowned him and said they'd have nothing to do with it,"
"and hoped he'd given up the idea."""
"""I suppose he's in a blue funk?"" asked the Captain."
"""He is no doubt alarmed,"" said Sir Robert. ""He gave the police the names"
"of the rest of their precious society, and, oddly enough, Ned Evans, of"
"the House--you know him, Coxon?--was one."""
"""Heard such an awful lot of debates, poor chap,"" observed Captain"
Heseltine.
"""Well, they went to Evans' and collared him. For a time he stuck out"
"that he knew nothing about it, but they threatened him with heaven knows"
"what, and at last he confessed to having seen this Gaspard in company"
with the murdered man in Digby Square a little before twelve on the
"night."""
"""By Jove! That's awkward!"" said the Captain."
"'Guffin.'  And hevery skipper was the 'Guffin,' new and old, go or"
"stay.  But when we broke hoff to hargue, why, we was talkin' about"
them French jossers and whether Sallis-bury was a-goin' to let 'em
"chip into our game and straddle the Nile."""
"""That's so,"" said the crowd, and the House was rough."
"Meanwhile, the skipper, or ""old man"" (who henceforward, by the way,"
"was called the ""Guffin""), and his two mates were discussing the"
"latest aspect of world politics, as they drank whiskey and water."
"""What's wrong with Salisbury,"" said the Guffin, who was as stout as a"
"barrel and as sturdy, ""is, that he ain't got a backbone.  He just"
lets 'em blow him about like so much paper.  What he wants is
"stiffenin': he's like a sprung spar.  That's what he's like."""
"The mate, a tough-looking dog with hair like anæmic tussac grass in"
"patches on his face, shook his head."
"""I've a greater opinion of him, captain, than you have.  All his"
double shuffle is cunning.  It's getting back so's to lead them
"French on.  Mark me, he'll play them yet a fair knock-out."""
The Guffin sneered.
"""He may have cunnin', Lampert, but he ain't no real tact.  Now,"
"diplomatic tact, I take it, is not givin' way into the gutter, but"
just showin' as you're a nice pleasant-spoken chap as don't mean to
be put on.  It's my good opinion as these foreigners don't yearn to
"fight us.  And men like you and me, Lampert, gets to learn the way of"
handlin' foreigners.  Who has so much experience with 'em as them in
"command of English ships?"""
"_never_ find my way back to mamma. Goodby, Miss Romley."""
"Behind Pola's back Mr. Dugald cast such a despairing, apologetic and"
altogether furious look toward Sidney as to make Sidney suddenly laugh.
And with her laugh all her sense of dismay and humiliation vanished.
She forgot her red hands and the big gingham apron and the dishes
spread about her in her amusement over Pola's pathetic attempt to be
very grown-up and sophisticated. And _so_ ill-bred! How ashamed Mr.
Dugald had been of her!
Then a thought struck Sidney with such force that she sat down in the
"nearest chair. Why, if Mr. Dugald was Pola's own cousin, belonged to"
"the grandeur that was Pola's, he would _never_ be attracted by poor,"
plain Trude. Her beautiful hopes were shattered! She felt distinctly
aggrieved.
"However, there was Vick. Sidney hated to give Mr. Dugald to Vick, who"
"always got everything, yet it seemed the only thing to do if any of the"
"sisters were to have him. Almost sadly she went to her room, opened her"
"satchel and took from it a small framed photograph of Victoria, a"
"photograph which, while it did not flatter Victoria, paid full justice"
"to her enticing beauty. Considering it, Sidney reflected on how lucky"
it was that at the last moment she had put the pictures of her sisters
into her baggage. Then she carried it to the kitchen and stood it on
the narrow mantel next to the clock where Mr. Dugald's eyes must surely
find it. Unlike the snapshot of Trude the picture remained there
undisturbed.
CHAPTER XVII
"""Sidney Romley, you're _crazy_!"" cried Aunt Achsa, in a quavering"
"voice. ""Go away! How _can_ he go away when we ain't even the money to"
"go 'sfar as Orleans. And he ain't plannin' to go on anyone's _charity_!"""
"""Oh, I don't mean he's going away _soon_! I shouldn't have told anyway"
for Lav told me as a secret. But I thought maybe it would make you
happier knowing he had great ambitions. And he'll tell you sometime
"himself."""
"When Aunt Achsa spoke it was in a thin, grieved voice."
"""It's what I didn't want him to ever take into his head. Goin' off"
"somewhere--alone. For I'm too old to go with him and he'll need me!"""
"""Oh I wouldn't have told you if I'd thought it would make you unhappy."
"He won't go for a long time, Aunt Achsa. And when he does he'll come"
"back real often."""
Now Aunt Achsa sat so still that Sidney thought she had consoled her.
But Aunt Achsa was facing in her own way this at which Sidney had
"hinted, drawing for it from that courage of hers that had not yet been"
"exhausted. Well, if it was best for Lavender some day to go away she'd"
"send him away with a smile even though the heart that had taken him, a"
"wee baby, from the dying mother did burst with loneliness. Besides,"
even if Lavender went away she could go on praying to the Lord to keep
"him ""happy""--no distance could keep her from doing that!"
"""It's like as not his plans in his head that's makin' him act so quiet"
like and short-spoken. And last night he didn't sleep in his bed at
"all!"""
"""Why, Aunt Achsa, where _was_ he?"" gasped Sidney, really startled."
And then madness descended upon and occupied James Williams. He pushed
his hat far upon the back of his head.
"“My wife seems to think I am a burglar,” he said, recklessly. “I never"
"heard of her being crazy; therefore I must be. And if I’m crazy, they"
can’t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness.”
Whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops
"had to be whistled for, and afterwards the reserves, to disperse a few"
thousand delighted spectators.
At the station-house the desk sergeant asked for his name.
"“McDoodle, the Pink, or Pinky the Brute, I forget which,” was James"
Williams’s answer. “But you can bet I’m a burglar; don’t leave that
out. And you might add that it took five of ’em to pluck the Pink. I’d
especially like to have that in the records.”
"In an hour came Mrs. James Williams, with Uncle Thomas, of Madison"
"Avenue, in a respect-compelling motor car and proofs of the hero’s"
innocence—for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an
automobile mfg. co.
After the police had sternly reprimanded James Williams for imitating a
copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the
"department was capable of, Mrs. Williams rearrested him and swept him"
into an angle of the station-house. James Williams regarded her with
one eye. He always said that Donovan closed the other while somebody
was holding his good right hand. Never before had he given her a word
of reproach or of reproof.
"""Come inside,"" Mr. Jobling begged hurriedly, and, looking round as he"
"followed them into his sanctum, ""Mullins!"" he snapped, ""don't stand"
"there staring. Get on with your work, at once."
"""You're later than I expected,"" he remarked to Slyne as he closed the"
"door, ""but just in time. The Court's closed, of course, for the"
"Christmas vacation, but I've filed an application for a hearing in"
"Chambers, and--"""
"He paused as a telephone-bell rang shrilly outside, and a moment later"
"the shock head of his ""managing clerk"" protruded into the room, almost"
as if it did not belong to a body at all.
"""Mr. Spettigrew says that our application in Chambers will be heard by"
"Mr. Justice Gaunt, in 57B, at eleven-thirty sharp this forenoon,"""
"announced that youth and, with a final wriggle of his long neck,"
withdrew.
"""Devil take him!"" exclaimed Captain Dove, somewhat startled and much"
"incensed. ""I wouldn't keep a crested cobra like that about me for--"""
"""Let's see those accounts of yours, now,"" said Slyne, disregarding that"
"interruption, and Mr. Jobling, having first looked at his watch,"
"produced from another drawer a great sheaf of papers, all carefully"
docketed. He slipped off the top one and somewhat reluctantly handed
that to his friend.
"Slyne took it from him eagerly, and sat for a time gloating over it with"
eyes which presently began to glow.
"But when Captain Dove, growing restless, would have glanced over his"
"how the merchant passed the factory and disappeared into the wood, and"
he wished very much that he might fall and break all his bones.  He sat
"imagining many horrible forms of disaster while watching Petunikoff,"
who was descending the hill into the wood like a spider going into its
web.  Last night he even imagined that the wood gave way before the
merchant and he fell ... but afterwards he found that he had only been
dreaming.
"And to-day, as always, the red building stands out before the eyes of"
"Aristid Kuvalda, so plain, so massive, and clinging so strongly to the"
"earth, that it seems to be sucking away all its life.  It appears to be"
laughing coldly at the Captain with its gaping walls.  The sun pours
its rays on them as generously as it does on the miserable hovels of
the main street.
"""Devil take the thing!"" exclaimed the Captain, thoughtfully measuring"
"the walls of the factory with his eyes. ""If only ..."""
Trembling with excitement at the thought that had just entered his
"mind, Aristid Kuvalda jumped up and ran to Vaviloff's eating-house,"
muttering to himself all the time.
"Vaviloff met him at the bar, and gave him a friendly welcome."
"""I wish your honour good health!""  He was of middle height, and had a"
"bald head, grey hair, and straight moustaches like tooth-brushes."
"Upright and neat in his clean jacket, he showed by every movement that"
he was an old soldier.
"""Egorka, show me the lease and plan of your house,"" demanded Kuvalda,"
impatiently.
"""That's so,"" said the second mate, who had been listening.  ""Now last"
"v'y'ge in the _Battleaxe_, there was a Dago in my watch as come from"
the betwixt and between land where Spain jines France.  And he was
"the Dagoest Dago I ever sailed with.  But I knew the breed, and the"
first time he opens his garlicky mouth I hauled off and hit him.  And
then I took his knife away and snapped the point off.  And I says to
"him, 'Now, you black beggar, every time at muster you'll show me that"
"knife, and there'll be peace in the land.'  And he done so, and there"
"was peace."""
"The captain (or ""Guffin"") smote his thigh."
"""You're right, Simcox, you're right, and if Salisbury was to take a"
"leaf out of your log-book in respects of handlin' Dagoes, 'twould be"
"better for all concerned.  But no, not him.  He goes on seein' them"
French make a fleet and he lets 'em!  He actually sees 'em with their
"fleet sharpenin' on the grindstone and never says from the poop,"
"'Chuck that overboard, you swine, or I'll come and 'andle you so's"
"you'll be glad to die.'"""
"The second mate was much gratified, as was obvious by his standing"
first on one foot and then on another.  But Lampert was not so
pleased.
"""Why, you talk--you, captain and you, Simcox--as if they had a fleet."
"Why, it's my opinion--and experts say 'ditto' to me there--that a"
"string o' band-boxes with crackers in 'em, and all on a mud-flat,"
would do as much harm as the French fleet--unless they blows up when
"we takes 'em."""
The Guffin shook his head.

"""The Child of Mary"" (Asbjörnsen, and Moe, N.F.E., p. 34, No. 8,"
"taken from the Bresemann translation [1847]), is a pious"

takes the place of the Virgin Mary.
XI
STORM MAGIC
The cabin-boy had been traveling around all summer long with his
"captain; but when they began to prepare to set sail in the fall, he grew"
"restless and did not want to go along. The captain liked him, for though"
"he was no more than a boy, he was quite at home on deck, was a big, tall"
"lad, and did not mind lending a hand when need arose; then, too, he did"
"as much work as an able seaman, and was so full of fun that he kept the"
whole crew in good humor. And so the captain did not like to lose him.
But the youth said out and out that he was not minded to take to the
blue pond in the fall; though he was willing to stay on board till
"the ship was loaded and ready to sail. One Sunday, while the crew was"
"ashore, and the captain had gone to a farm-holding near the forest, in"
order to bargain for small timber and log wood--presumably on his own
"account--for a deck load, the youth had been left to guard the ship."
"But you must know that he was a Sunday child, and had found a four-leaf"
"“One or two other little things,” replied Herold, judiciously. “I 'll"
copy them out and bring them to you. But go on.”
"“Well,” she said, “yesterday afternoon a little bird--I don't know what"
"kind of bird it was--came and sat on the window-sill, and turned his"
"head this way and looked at me, and turned his head that way and looked"
"at me, and I did n't move hand or foot, and I said, 'Cheep, cheep!' And"
he hopped on the bed and stayed there such a long time. And I talked
"to him, and he hopped about and looked at me and seemed to tell me all"
"sorts of wonderful things. But he did n't somehow, although he came from"
"the sky, and was a perfect dear. He must have known all about it, but he"
"did n't know how to tell me. Now, you and John come from the beautiful"
world and tell me wonderful things about it; and I shall never go there
"really, but I can live in it through you.”"
"Constable, the Great Dane, known by this abbreviated title in familiar"
"life, rose, stretched himself, and went and snuggled his head beneath"
"John's arm. John turned, his arm round the hound's neck."
"“But you can live in it through anybody, dear,” said he--“your Uncle"
"Oliver, your Aunt Julia, or anybody who comes to see you.”"
Stellamaris looked at Herold for a characteristically sympathetic
"moment, and then at John. She sighed."
"“I told you it was hard to explain. But don't you see, Belovedest? You"
and Walter are like my gull. Everybody else is like the little bird. You
"know how to tell me and make me live. The others are darlings, but they"
don't seem to know how to do it.”
John scratched his head.
"""Oh, I don't know,"" Sidney laughed. ""I'm all mixed up. I guess I was"
"trying to say something Mr. Dugald said once to me."""
"""Oh, _Dug_!"" laughed Pola. ""He's nutty about all that! Look at the way"
he lives here on the Cape. But mother says he'll get over it when he
marries. Now I have no intention of getting serious this grand day so
"let's have another piece of that chocolate fudge cake--it's on me, too,"
"remember!"" Which was Pola's pretty way of pretending she did not know"
that Sidney did not have any money with her. The dollar Sidney had
earned for posing had long since been spent.
"Sidney was relieved that Pola had rescued her from the ""deep water."" At"
the same time she suffered from the sense that she had not made Pola
see Mart in another light. She had failed in loyalty. The sparkling
blue of the bay that stretched before them only reminded her that this
"was the hour she usually went swimming. Due to Pola's ""complex"" she had"
not gone swimming for a whole week.
"Even with her mouth full of the fudge cake, she vowed to herself that"
the very next day she would hunt out her chums and her old pastimes.
Pola and Mr. Dugald must plan without her!
She had promised to dine again at the hotel with Pola and her mother
but as soon as she could after dinner she returned to Sunset Lane.
Because of her determination her heart was lighter. And her way was
"made easier, too, for Mrs. Allan had told Pola at dinner that the"
"""Truxtons were at Chatham Bars."" Pola had been as excited over the"
Truxtons as her mother.
"""Can we go and see them right away?"""
"""Not tonight. But I have arranged for a car and Shields will drive us"
"the water for him to fetch, this being in his view the only reason why"
anything was carried in the hand.
"She found Monsieur Harmost fidgeting up and down the room, whose opened"
windows could not rid it of the smell of latakia.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""I thought you were not coming!  You look pale; are you"
"not well?  Is it the heat?  Or""--he looked hard into her face--""has"
"someone hurt you, my little friend?""  Gyp shook her head. ""Ah, yes,"" he"
"went on irritably; ""you tell me nothing; you tell nobody nothing!  You"
"close up your pretty face like a flower at night.  At your age, my child,"
one should make confidences; a secret grief is to music as the east wind
"to the stomach.  Put off your mask for once.""  He came close to her."
"""Tell me your troubles.  It is a long time since I have been meaning to"
"ask. Come!  We are only once young; I want to see you happy."""
But Gyp stood looking down.  Would it be relief to pour her soul out?
Would it?  His brown eyes questioned her like an old dog's. She did not
want to hurt one so kind.  And yet--impossible!
Monsieur Harmost suddenly sat down at the piano.  Resting his hands on
"the keys, he looked round at her, and said:"
"""I am in love with you, you know.  Old men can be very much in love, but"
"they know it is no good--that makes them endurable. Still, we like to"
feel of use to youth and beauty; it gives us a little warmth.  Come; tell
"me your grief!""  He waited a moment, then said irritably: ""Well, well, we"
"go to music then!"""
"It was his habit to sit by her at the piano corner, but to-day he stood"
"as if prepared to be exceptionally severe.  And Gyp played, whether from"
"overexcited nerves or from not having had any lunch, better than she had"
"prevents re-absorption, and mechanically excites peristaltic action, as"
"Magnesium Sulphate, etc."
"CATHARTIC SIMPLE.--A medicine that is more active then a laxative, but"
is accompanied by some griping; it causes active peristalsis and larger
"and softer stools than laxatives, as Rhubarb, Aloes, etc."
"CAUSTIC.--A medicine or agent used to destroy living tissue, as Caustic"
"Potash, Silver Nitrate, etc."
"CAUTERY.--An agent used to sear or burn living tissue, with a cautery or"
"a caustic, as a hot iron or Nitric Acid, etc."
CAUTERY ACTUAL.--A metal instrument heated by an electric current or by
"flame, used to destroy bone or muscular tissue or for producing"
"counter-irritation, much preferred to setons in diseases of the bones"
"especially of their joints, as in Bone Spavin, Ringbone, etc., also"
valuable in the treatment of sprained tendons. The methods used are
either puncture or line firing.
"CAUTERY POTENTIAL.--A chemical used for destroying or cauterizing flesh,"
"as Nitric Acid, etc."
"CHALYBEATE.--A medicine containing iron, as Tincture Chlorid of Iron."
"CONDIMENT.--A medicine used to improve palatability of food, as"
"Fenugreek, Aniseed, Salt, Pepper, etc."
CONSERVATIVE.--A medicine or substance used for the preservation of
"other medicines without loss, as Alcohol, Honey, etc."
"CONSTRINGENT.--A medicine which causes contraction of organic tissues,"
CHAPTER XV
THE JOURNEY HOME--THE FISHING AND WORKING OF THE KALOMA SHELL
I
The return journey of the Sinaketan fleet is made by following exactly
the same route as the one by which they came to Dobu. In each inhabited
"island, in every village, where a halt had previously been made,"
"they stop again, for a day or a few hours. In the hamlets of Sanaroa,"
"in Tewara and in the Amphletts, the partners are revisited. Some"
"Kula valuables are received on the way back, and all the talo'i"
gifts from those intermediate partners are also collected on the
return journey. In each of these villages people are eager to hear
about the reception which the uvalaku party have received in Dobu;
"the yield in valuables is discussed, and comparisons are drawn between"
the present occasion and previous records.
"No magic is performed now, no ceremonial takes place, and there"
would be very little indeed to say about the return journey but for
two important incidents; the fishing for spondylus shell (kaloma)
"in Sanaroa Lagoon, and the display and comparison of the yield of"
Kula valuables on Muwa beach.
"for some word of Lavender, but the words failed in her throat. Cold,"
"forlorn, hungry, she crept to her room, threw off her clothes and"
huddled down into the bed-clothes.
"They would all blame her--Miss Vine and Mr. Dugald, Aunt Achsa, Doctor"
Blackwell. Probably now Pola would have more complexes to suffer;
Pola's mother would be angry and they could never be friends again. And
Mart--Aunt Achsa had said old Mrs. Calkins could be terrible when she
"was ""worked up!"" Even if Lavender lived Aunt Achsa would never forgive"
her and if he _didn't_ live--Mr. Dugald had said he was fighting. Those
boards creaking faintly meant that Doctor Blackwell and Aunt Achsa were
helping Lavender fight. Dear old Lav with his fine dreams!
The desperate longing for Trude shook her. She sobbed into her pillow.
And yet the longing brought only added remorse. Trude would scold her.
Trude would take her home. That meant stinging humiliation. How Vick
would laugh at her when everything was over. A case of rum! Sidney
writhed under the soft covers.
Somewhere boards creaked again--Lavender's fight. Sidney pictured the
doctor and Aunt Achsa bending over him. And outside everything was so
"quiet and gray. That was the way death probably came, Sidney thought."
On the morrow they would send her home--in disgrace. She might not even
"be allowed to see Lavender, or Mart, or Pola--or Mr. Dugald. Someone"
would telegraph to Trude and Trude would meet her back at Middletown.
"She would live a long, sad life of penance behind the crumbing stone"
wall she had so detested.
But the thought of the wall and the shelter of the old house brought
such a surcease of torment that the girl had fallen into a heavy sleep.
When she wakened it was to a consciousness of bright sunshine--and
"Mr. Dugald ran with all speed to Rockman's, the other men after him. As"
their hurrying steps echoed through the silent street heads popped out
"of windows, doors opened. Then more men, half-dressed and dressing as"
"they ran, rushed after them toward Rockman's. They knew, with that"
"intuition inbred in seacoast communities, that something was wrong. Old"
"Simon Tibbetts, too crippled to join the gathering crowds, rang up"
Commander Nelson at the Life Guard station on the backside.
"When, in the gray light of the dawn, the _Sally_ chugged up to"
"Rockman's wharf with its precious cargo Sidney and Mart found a weary,"
anxious crowd of men and women gathered there. And as Cap'n Davies and
Saunders lifted the girls ashore a lusty shout of rejoicing went
up--eager hands reached out to touch the rescued as though to make
certain they were safe and sound.
"Sidney had eyes only for Mr. Dugald who seemed to tower above them all,"
"his eyes dark lined with the strain of anxious watching, his mouth set"
"sternly. And strangely enough, at first, Dugald Allan saw only Sidney,"
"yet it was not strange, for the white-faced, shrinking, abject girl,"
"barefooted and disheveled, who was hiding behind Mart and Sidney, had"
little semblance to his gay young cousin.
Mr. Dugald opened his arms and Sidney ran into them like a little
"child, and clung to him. He felt her slender body shaking."
"""I--I can't help crying. I wanted Trude--so much!"""
"""_I_ was thinking of Trude, too. Thank God!"" But Sidney was too moved"
at the moment to wonder at his words or that the cheek he bent to hers
was wet with tears.
But when in her mirror she saw him standing behind her--he had crept into
the bedroom like a cat--fierceness came into her.  She could see the
"blood rush up in her own white face, and, turning round she said:"
"""No, Gustav, go out to the music-room if you want a companion."""
"He recoiled against the foot of the bed and stared at her haggardly, and"
"Gyp, turning back to her mirror, went on quietly taking the pins out of"
"her hair.  For fully a minute she could see him leaning there, moving his"
"head and hands as though in pain. Then, to her surprise, he went.  And a"
vague feeling of compunction mingled with her sense of deliverance.  She
"lay awake a long time, watching the fire-glow brighten and darken on the"
"ceiling, tunes from ""The Tales of Hoffmann"" running in her head; thoughts"
"and fancies crisscrossing in her excited brain.  Falling asleep at last,"
"she dreamed she was feeding doves out of her hand, and one of them was"
"Daphne Wing.  She woke with a start.  The fire still burned, and by its"
"light she saw him crouching at the foot of the bed, just as he had on"
"their wedding-night--the same hungry yearning in his face, and an arm"
"outstretched.  Before she could speak, he began:"
"""Oh, Gyp, you don't understand!  All that is nothing--it is only you I"
want--always.  I am a fool who cannot control himself. Think!  It's a
"long time since you went away from me."""
"Gyp said, in a hard voice:"
"""I didn't want to have a child."""
He said quickly:
"""No; but now you have it you are glad.  Don't be unmerciful, my Gyp!  It"
is like you to be merciful.  That girl--it is all over--I swear--I
so damned easy?”
"“Tell us why you say that, Stellamaris,” said Herold."
"John rose suddenly and stood by the west window, which was closed."
Stella's high bed had been drawn next to the window open to the south.
"The room was warm, for a great fire blazed in the tall chimneypiece. He"
"rose to hide his eyes from Stella, confounding Herold for a marplot. Was"
this the way to make his task easier? He heard Stella say in her sweet
contralto:
“Do you imagine it 's just for silly foolishness I call you Great High
"Belovedest and Great High Favourite? You see, Walter dear, I gave John"
"his title before I knew you, so I had to make some difference in yours."
"But they mean everything to me. I live in the sky such a lot, and it's"
a beautiful life; but I know there 's another life in the great world--a
"beautiful life, too.” She wrinkled her forehead. “Oh, it 's so difficult"
"to explain! It's so hard to talk about feelings, because the moment you"
"begin to talk about them, the feelings become so vague. It's like trying"
to tell any one the shape of a sunset.” She paused for a moment or two;
Herold smiled at her and nodded encouragingly. Presently she went on:
"“I 'll try to put it this way. Often a gull, you see, comes hovering"
"outside here and looks in at me, oh, for a long time, with his round,"
"yellow eyes; and my heart beats, and I love him, for he tells me all"
"about the sea and sky and clouds, where I'll never go,--not really,--and"
"I live the sky life through him, and more than ever since you sent me"
that poem--I know it by heart--about the sea-gull. Who wrote it?”
"“Swinburne,” said Herold."
“Did he write anything else?”
Three months--and in this state of misery!
"""I think I shall do something desperate.  Now that I can't dance, and"
"THEY know, it's too awful!  If I could see him, I wouldn't mind anything."
"But I know--I know he'll never want me again.  Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I"
"was dead!  I do!"""
"A heavy sigh escaped Gyp, and, bending suddenly, she kissed the girl's"
"forehead.  Still that scent of orange blossom about her skin or hair, as"
"when she asked whether she ought to love or not; as when she came,"
"moth-like, from the tree-shade into the moonlight, spun, and fluttered,"
"with her shadow spinning and fluttering before her.  Gyp turned away,"
"feeling that she must relieve the strain and pointing to the bowl, said:"
"""YOU put that there, I'm sure.  It's beautiful."""
"The girl answered, with piteous eagerness:"
"""Oh, would you like it?  Do take it.  Count Rosek gave it me.""  She"
"started away from the door.  ""Oh, that's papa.  He'll be coming in!"""
"Gyp heard a man clear his throat, and the rattle of an umbrella falling"
into a stand; the sight of the girl wilting and shrinking against the
"sideboard steadied her.  Then the door opened, and Mr. Wagge entered."
"Short and thick, in black frock coat and trousers, and a greyish beard,"
"he stared from one to the other.  He looked what he was, an Englishman"
"and a chapelgoer, nourished on sherry and mutton, who could and did make"
"his own way in the world.  His features, coloured, as from a deep"
"liverishness, were thick, like his body, and not ill-natured, except for"
"a sort of anger in his small, rather piggy grey eyes.  He said in a voice"
"permanently gruff, but impregnated with a species of professional"
ingratiation:
"Bilkins entered with the tray, wishing us a happy new year. Outside the"
"whistles were beginning to blow. After we had pledged each other, and"
"drunk to 1919, the Mater, a light of challenge in her eyes, looked at me"
and gave another toast:
"""To a cruise and an adventure, Jack!"""
"""To romance,"" Dad cried, gallantly raising her fingers to his lips."
"There was no use being a wet blanket, so with a laugh I said:"
"""To adventure and romance!--Mater, if they're still on earth I'll bring"
"them home to you!"""
"I knew it was a very silly toast, but let it go to please them--for why"
disillusion those who believe in the actuality of nonexistence?
CHAPTER II
THE MYSTERIOUS MONSIEUR
"Ten days later Tommy and I--and Bilkins, whom I had begged of my father"
"at the eleventh hour--stepped off the train at Miami, stretched our arms"
"and breathed deep breaths of balmy air. Gates, his ruddy face an augury"
"of good cheer, was there to meet us, and as he started off well laden"
"with a portion of our bags, Tommy whispered:"
"""Reminds me of the old chap in that picture 'The Fisherman's Daughter'!"""
"Rollo bowed, but did not reply, awaiting the general's pleasure."
"Presently Cabrera, recollecting the sealed letter in his hand, gave it"
unopened to the youth.
"""There,"" he said, ""that, I see, is to be opened in the camp of General"
"Cabrera. Well--where Cabrera is, there is his camp. Open it, and let us"
"see what it contains."""
"""I will, general,"" said the young Scot, ""in so far, that is, as it"
"concerns your Excellency."""
The Carlist general sat watching Rollo keenly as he broke the seal and
discovered a couple of enclosures. One was sealed and the other open.
"The first he presented to Cabrera, who, observing the handwriting of the"
"superscription, changed colour. Meanwhile, without paying any attention"
"to him, Rollo read his own communication from beginning to end. It had"
"evidently been passed on to him from a higher authority than the Abbot,"
for only the address was in the handwriting of that learned ecclesiast.
It ran as follows:
"""To the Man who shall be chosen by our trusted Councillor for"
the Mission Extraordinary in the service of Carlos
Quinto--These:
"""You will receive from General Cabrera such succour and"
assistance as may seem to you needful in pursuance of the
"project you have in hand, namely the capturing of the young"
"Princess Isabel together with her mother, the so-called Regent"
Cristina. Thereafter you will bring them with diligence within
"our lines, observing all the respect and courtesy due to their"
exalted rank and to the sex to which they belong.
"--_Amrita Bazar Patrika_, 26-7-1915."
HISTORY OF A DISCOVERY
Substance of a Lecture delivered by Prof. J. C. Bose on the 20th
"November 1915, at the Ram Mohan Library, under the Presidency of the"
"Hon'ble Mr. P. C. Lyon, and published at p. 693, Vol. xviii, of the"
"""Modern Review"" (July to December, 1915)."
"At the tournament held before the court at Hastinapur, more than"
"twenty-five centuries ago, Karna, the reputed son of a Charioteer, had"
challenged the supremacy of Prince Arjuna. To this challenge Arjuna had
returned a scornful answer; a prince could not cross swords with one who
"could claim no nobility of descent. ""I am my own ancestor,"" replied"
"Karna, and this perhaps the earliest assertion of the right of man to"
choose and determine his own destiny. In the realm of knowledge also the
great achievements have been won only by men with determined purpose and
without any adventitious aids. Undismayed by human limitations they had
struggled in spite of many a failure. In their inquiry after truth they
"regarded nothing as too laborious, nothing too insignificant, nothing"
too painful. This is the process which all must follow; there is no
easier path.
The lecturer's research on the properties of Electric Waves was begun
just twenty-one years ago. In this he was greatly encouraged by the
"appreciation shown by the Royal Society, which not only published his"
"researches, but also offered a Parliamentary grant for the continuance"
"""Ah!  Vraiment!  Voyons!  Donnez--un instant--vous verrez."""
"The fiddler, doubting but hypnotized, handed him the fiddle; his dark"
face changed when he saw this stranger fling it up to his shoulder and
the ways of his fingers with bow and strings.  Fiorsen had begun to walk
"up the street, his eyes searching for the flower-boxes.  He saw them,"
"stopped, and began playing ""Che faro?""  He played it wonderfully on that"
"poor fiddle; and the fiddler, who had followed at his elbow, stood"
"watching him, uneasy, envious, but a little entranced.  Sapristi!  This"
"tall, pale monsieur with the strange face and the eyes that looked drunk"
"and the hollow chest, played like an angel!  Ah, but it was not so easy"
as all that to make money in the streets of this sacred town!  You might
play like forty angels and not a copper!  He had begun another tune--like
"little pluckings at your heart--tres joli--tout a fait ecoeurant! Ah,"
"there it was--a monsieur as usual closing the window, drawing the"
curtains!  Always same thing!  The violin and the bow were thrust back
into his hands; and the tall strange monsieur was off as if devils were
"after him--not badly drunk, that one!  And not a sou thrown down!  With"

"understand, the lame, dark fiddler limped his way round the nearest"

"he used the word, ""Bigre!"" and started for home."

He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother
when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a
"growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very"
"off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh"
fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat
and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.
"Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have"
been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way
"to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things"
like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.
"Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering"
and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things
about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....
I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the
native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference
between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the
"slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,"
"Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it"
so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from
the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no
"matter what, he would never let me hold it."
"""Sorry, Ford, old tad,"" he would drawl, spinning around and around in"
"changing slowly."""
"""Nay, the Queen herself will never change!"" cried Wylde, with an"
"emphatic gesture.  ""The Duchess has changed, and she seeks to use her"
"influence with the Queen to make her change also, and give up her Tory"
advisers altogether.  But she will not succeed.  The Queen may be timid
"and gentle, but she has all her father’s tenacity and obstinacy.  Let my"
Lady of Marlborough look to it!  She may strain the cord to breaking
"point.  Already they say that the new favourite, Mrs. Masham, is ousting"
"her kinswoman, the Duchess, from the foremost place in the Queen’s"
affections.  Favourites have fallen ere this through too great
"arrogance.  The victories of Ramillies and Oudenarde, and the successes"
"that have followed, make the Duke the idol of the nation and the"
"favourite of the Queen yet; but the day may come when this may change,"
"and then the high Tories may come in once more with a rush."""
"""I should be sorry for the Duke to lose favour,"" spoke Grey"
"thoughtfully.  ""I did see him once, and had speech with him after the"
"battle of Ramillies, and a more gracious and courtly gentleman it has"
"never been my lot to meet."""
Suddenly the Old Lion’s eyes flashed fire.
"""You have seen and had speech with the Duke on the field of Ramillies?"
"You saw the battle, or something of it?  Speak!  Tell me all!  I must"
"hear this tale.  It may mean much to us both."""
"""In sooth it is little I can tell you of the battle, for I was in the"
thick of it myself.  It was by accident that my servant and I came upon
the rival armies; and another happy accident gave me the chance of doing
"a small service for the Duke.  After the battle, when we were hard by"
"Louvain, he called me to him, and spoke many gracious words. I would"

"_Von G._: ""I understand! We have a dr-r-eadful reputation, we poor"
Germans! The French stuff you up with lies. But we are better than
you think. You shall take them in two--three days to Brussels when
"things are quiet, and put them in some bank. Here I fear I must"
stay. I must intrude myself on your hospitality. But better for you
perhaps if I stay here at present. I will put a few of my men in
your--your--buildings. Most of them shall go with their officers to
"Tervueren for billet."" (Turning to Mrs. Warren.) ""Madam, you must"
cheer up. I foresee your daughter and I will be great friends. Let
us now look through the rooms and see what disposition we can make.
"I think I will have to take this room for my writing, for my work. I"
"see you have telephone here. _Gut_!"""
"Leaving Mrs. Warren still seated, but a little less stertorous in"
"breathing, a little reassured, Vivie and Oberst von Giesselin then"
"went over the Villa, apportioning the rooms. The Colonel and his"
orderly would be lodged in two of the bedrooms. Vivie and her mother
would share Mrs. Warren's large bedroom and retain the salon for
their exclusive occupation. They would use the dining-room in common
with their guest.
"Vivie looking out of the windows occasionally, as they passed from"
"room to room, saw the remainder of the soldiery strolling off to be"
"lodged at their nearest neighbour's, the farmer who had driven them"
"in to Brussels that morning. There were perhaps thirty, accompanying"
"a young lieutenant. How would he find room for them, poor man? They"
were more fortunate in being asked only to lodge six or seven in
"addition to the Colonel's orderly and soldier-clerk. Before sunset,"
"the Villa Beau-séjour was clear of soldiers, except the few that had"
gone to the barn and the outhouses. The morning room had been fitted
two-franc piece in change as I paid the admission fees to see certain
paintings and sculptures behind the high altar.
"However, I am wandering from my subject; I may conclude my eulogy"
"on the baby above mentioned by saying that, young as she is, she"
sits through the seventy or eighty minutes of the customary tedious
"European dinner almost as circumspectly as a graven image might, but"
reminding us of one of Raphael's cherubs in her blue-eyed combination
"of sweetness, archness and dignity."
Next time we will resume our account of matters of more general
interest.
CHAPTER XXIX.
"RELICS IN GENERAL, AND THE IRON CROWN OF LOMBARDY IN PARTICULAR."
"ROME, _December 23, 1902_."
I had heard of relics before. Years ago I had read Mark Twain's account
of the large piece of the true cross which he had seen in a church in
the Azores; and of another piece which he had seen in the Cathedral
"of Notre Dame in Paris, besides some nails of the true cross and a"
part of the crown of thorns; and of the marble chest in the Cathedral
"of San Lorenzo at Genoa, which he was told contained the ashes of St."
"John, and was wound about with the chain that had confined St. John"
when he was in prison; and of the interesting collection shown him in
"the Cathedral of Milan, including two of St. Paul's fingers and one"
"temporal, but the things which are unseen are spiritual.” To those who"
"wish to try the effect of such stories on children, I present for their"
encouragement the following lines from Whitcomb Riley:
THE TREASURE OF THE WISE MAN.[39]
"Oh, the night was dark and the night was late,"
When the robbers came to rob him;
"And they picked the lock of his palace-gate,"
The robbers who came to rob him--
"They picked the lock of the palace-gate,"
Seized his jewels and gems of State
"His coffers of gold and his priceless plate,--"
The robbers that came to rob him.
But loud laughed he in the morning red!--
For of what had the robbers robbed him?
"Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,"
"When the robbers came to rob him,--"
They robbed him not of a golden shred
Of the childish dreams in his wise old head--
"“And they're welcome to all things else,” he said,"
When the robbers came to rob him.
"There is a great deal of this romantic spirit, combined with a"
"delightful sense of irresponsibility, which I claim above all things"
"for small children, to be found in our old Nursery Rhymes. I quote from"
the following article written by the Rev. R. L. Gales for the _Nation_.
After speaking on the subject of Fairy Stories being eliminated from
"the school curriculum, the writer adds:"
"""Immortal Jehoshaphat!"" said Captain Prowse; ""here's a go!  What, we"
"with passengers?  Oh, get out!"""
"""You've got to take 'em,"" said the agent philosophically; ""maybe"
"they'll teach you something, and it'll be a good advertisement."""
"""Gah'n!"" said Prowse; ""carryin' scientific jossers won't bring better"
freight next season.  I wish you'd get me chock up with cattle.  I
can't stand scientists; my sister married one that was an 'erbalist
in the Old Kent Road--and since he went to chokey I've lost conceit
"with science.  However, if it must be--why, send 'em along!"""
Captain Prowse was not a popular skipper with sailors.  They said
"that he was a ""hard nut"" and a ""sailor-robber,"" and that his American"
experience had made him nearly as deadly as any American captain with
a belaying-pin.  But sailors' experience only works backward: they
"are good at reminiscence only, and the _Nemagosenda_ got a crew in"
spite of the captain's reputation.  It is possible they would not
have shipped if they had known that men of European light and leading
were to come with them.  Those who follow the sea have a great
"respect for knowledge, but they despise men in soft hats and"
spectacles.  And it cannot be denied that scientific men are as a
rule too simple and gentle to look as if they could take care of
"themselves.  According to Jack, that is the first duty of man, though"

"... Yes, madam, it was all left to me. Oh, she did look sweet. I did"
"her hair, soft-like, round her forehead, all in dainty curls, and just"
to one side of her neck I put a bunch of most beautiful purple pansies.
"Those pansies made a picture of her, madam! I shall never forget them."
"I thought to-night, when I looked at my lady, “Now, if only the pansies"
was there no one could tell the difference.”
"... Only the last year, madam. Only after she’d got a"
"little—well—feeble as you might say. Of course, she was never"
dangerous; she was the sweetest old lady. But how it took her was—she
"thought she’d lost something. She couldn’t keep still, she couldn’t"
"settle. All day long she’d be up and down, up and down; you’d meet her"
"everywhere,—on the stairs, in the porch, making for the kitchen. And"
"she’d look up at you, and she’d say—just like a child, “I’ve lost it,"
"I’ve lost it.” “Come along,” I’d say, “come along, and I’ll lay out"
your patience for you.” But she’d catch me by the hand—I was a
"favourite of hers—and whisper, “Find it for me, Ellen. Find it for me.”"
"Sad, wasn’t it?"
"... No, she never recovered, madam. She had a stroke at the end. Last"
"words she ever said was—very slow, “Look in—the—Look—in—” And then she"
was gone.
"... No, madam, I can’t say I noticed it. Perhaps some girls. But you"
"see, it’s like this, I’ve got nobody but my lady. My mother died of"
"consumption when I was four, and I lived with my grandfather, who kept"
a hair-dresser’s shop. I used to spend all my time in the shop under a
"table dressing my doll’s hair—copying the assistants, I suppose. They"
"were ever so kind to me. Used to make me little wigs, all colours, the"
"latest fashions and all. And there I’d sit all day, quiet as quiet—the"
customers never knew. Only now and again I’d take my peep from under
"""Why are they sending you away?"" asked Vivie drily, compelled to"
interest herself in his affairs since they so closely affected her
own and her mother's.
"""Because of this,"" said von Giesselin, nearly in tears, pulling from"
"a small portfolio a press cutting. ""Do you remember a fortnight ago"
"I told you some one, some Belgian had written a beautiful poem and"
sent it to me for one of our newspapers? I showed it to you at the
"time and you said--you said 'it was well enough, but it did not seem"
"to have much point.'"" Vivie did remember having glanced very"
perfunctorily at some effusion in typewriting which had seemed
unobjectionable piffle. She hadn't cared two straws whether he
"accepted it or not, only did not want to be too markedly"
indifferent. Now she took it up and still read it through
"uncomprehendingly, her thoughts absent with the fate of Miss Cavell."
"""Well! what is all the fuss about? I still see nothing in it. It is"
just simply the ordinary sentimental flip-flap that a French
"versifier can turn out by the yard."""
"""It is _far_ worse than that! It is a horrible--what the French"
"call 'acrostiche,' a deadly insult to our people. And I never saw"
"it, the Editor never saw it, and you, even, never guessed its real"
"meaning![1] The original, as you say, was in typewriting, and at the"
bottom was the name and address of a very well-known homme de
lettres: and the words: 'Offert à la rédaction de l'Ami de L'Ordre.'
"He say now, _never never_ did he send it. It was a forgery. When we"
came to understand what it meant all the blame fall on me. I am sent
"back to the Army--I shall be killed before Verdun, so good-bye dear"

War--It has spoilt everything. Now we can never be friends with

damage done to her property.
The two women readily agreed. In the curtailment of their movements
and the absence of normal means of communication their life at Villa
Beau-séjour was belying its name. Their supply of money was coming
to an end; attempts must be made to regularize that position by
drawing on Mrs. Warren's German investments and the capital she
still had in Belgian stock--if that were negotiable at all.
Where should they go? Mrs. Warren still had some lien on the Hotel
"Édouard-Sept (the name, out of deference to the Germans, had been"
changed to Hotel Impérial). With the influence of the Government
Secretary behind her she might turn out some of its occupants and
"regain the use of the old ""appartement."" This would accommodate"
Vivie too. And there was no reason why their friend should not place
"his own lodging and office at the same hotel, which was situated"
conveniently on the Rue Royale not far from the Governor's residence
in the Rue de la Loi.
"So this plan was carried out. And in December, 1914, Mrs. Warren had"
"some brief flicker of happiness once more, and even Vivie felt the"
nightmare had lifted a little. It was life again. Residence at the
Villa Beau-séjour had almost seemed an entombment of the living.
"Here, in the heart of Brussels, at any rate, you got some news every"
"day, even if much of it was false. The food supply was more certain,"
"there were 700,000 people all about you. True, the streets were very"
badly lit at night and fuel was scarce and dear. But you were in
contact with people.
"In January, Vivie tried to get into touch with the American"
"Legation, not only to send news of their condition to England but to"
ascertain whether permission might not be obtained for them to leave

[Footnote 134: The motor imagery suggested by music is in some persons
"profuse and apparently capricious, and may be regarded as an anomaly"
"comparable to a synaesthesia. Heine was an example of this, and he has"
described in _Florentine Nights_ the visions aroused by the playing of
"Paganini, and elsewhere the visions evoked in him by the music of Berlioz."
"Though I do not myself experience this phenomenon, I have found that there"
is sometimes a tendency for music to arouse ideas of motor imagery; thus
some melodies of Handel suggest a giant painting frescoes on a vast wall
space. The most elementary motor relationship of music is seen in the
tendency of many people to sway portions of their body--to 'beat time'--in
sympathy with the music. (This phenomenon has been experimentally studied
"by J. B. Miner, 'Motor, Visual, and Applied Rhythms,' Monograph Supplement"
"to the _Psychological Review_, vol. v., No. 4, June 1903). Music is"
"fundamentally an audible dance, and the most primitive music is dance"
music.]
[Footnote 135: The instinctive nature of this tendency is shown by the
fact that it persists even in sleep. Thus Weygandt relates that he once
fell asleep in the theatre during one of the last scenes of _Cavalleria
"Rusticana_, when the tenor was singing in ever higher and higher tones,"
and dreamed that in order to reach the notes the performer was climbing up
ladders and stairs on the stage.]
offence had only been that of loving her.
"Fiorsen had been taken to her room, which was larger and cooler than his"
own; and the maid was standing by the side of the bed with a scared face.
Gyp signed to her to go.  He opened his eyes presently:
"""Gyp!  Oh!  Gyp!  Is it you?  The devilish, awful things I see--don't go"
"away again!  Oh, Gyp!""  With a sob he raised himself and rested his"
forehead against her.  And Gyp felt--as on the first night he came home
drunk--a merging of all other emotions in the desire to protect and heal.
"""It's all right, all right,"" she murmured.  ""I'm going to stay. Don't"
"worry about anything.  Keep quite quiet, and you'll soon be well."""
"In a quarter of an hour, he was asleep.  His wasted look went to her"
"heart, and that expression of terror which had been coming and going"
until he fell asleep!  Anything to do with the brain was so horrible!
Only too clear that she must stay--that his recovery depended on her.
"She was still sitting there, motionless, when the doctor came, and,"
"seeing him asleep, beckoned her out.  He looked a kindly man, with two"
"waistcoats, the top one unbuttoned; and while he talked, he winked at Gyp"
"involuntarily, and, with each wink, Gyp felt that he ripped the veil off"
one more domestic secret.  Sleep was the ticket--the very ticket for him!
Had something on his mind--yes!  And--er--a little given to--brandy?  Ah!
all that must stop!  Stomach as well as nerves affected.  Seeing
things--nasty things--sure sign.  Perhaps not a very careful life before
marriage.  And married--how long?  His kindly appreciative eyes swept Gyp
"from top to toe.  Year and a half!  Quite so!  Hard worker at his violin,"
too?  No doubt!  Musicians always a little inclined to be immoderate--too
much sense of beauty--burn the candle at both ends!  She must see to
"that.  She had been away, had she not--staying with her father?  Yes."
But--no one like a wife for nursing.  As to treatment?  Well!  One would

"another'n bursts, so I flops down agin, but it didn't come so near that"
time. I waits a bit an' then I gets up an' goes to see what they done. I
"couldn't see nothin' at first, but I sees some fellers runnin' about wi'"
"lights. There was a noise in one o' the wards, so I goes in. A bomb must"
'a' burst on the roof--there was a big 'ole in the canvas. The bed
"underneath was all twisted an' torn, but there wasn't nobody in it."
"There was some wounded lyin' in beds at the fur end of the ward, an' one"
of 'em was cryin' somethin' chronic. Then someone brings a light an' I
sees an orderly lyin' by the side o' the bed with a big 'ole in 'is face
an' the blood pourin' out. I goes roun' to the other side--gorblimy--an'
there I sees the Sister lyin' on the floor with 'er 'ead blown clean

Private Trotter was trembling in every limb. He was the pluckiest man I
ever knew and capable of any piece of foolhardy daring. But this time he
was near a nervous breakdown.
"We went to bed full of anxiety. For a long while we lay awake, straining"
our ears to catch the sound of firing or the drone of German propellers.
"But no sound broke the stillness of the night, and one by one we dropped"
off to sleep.
The next morning was clear and sunny. The sky remained blue all day. Not
"a cloud could be seen. ""Our turn next""--that was the thought in"
everybody's mind.
The evening was starlit once again. As we lay on the floor of the
"marquee, wrapped up in our blankets, we heard the sound of bombing and"
Our talk began over Mr. Bruce Smith's notice of motion in the Australian
Parliament.
"'Yes, I have seen the proposal,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'and I am very"
glad an Australian representative has taken up the question. He proposes
to amend the Immigration Restriction Act so as to permit Japanese to
enter the Commonwealth. The reason given is that Japan has placed
"herself in the front rank of nations, has granted religious freedom, has"
"established consulates, and become the honoured ally of Great Britain. I"
understand that Australian papers are saying there is no chance of the
motion being carried. I care not whether the motion is carried or not
this time. Of one thing I am certain--it will be carried eventually.
'What reason has Australia for shutting out the Japanese?'
"'The dread of cheaper labour and of the ""Yellow Peril,"" as it is called."
"Whatever there be in that, it certainly does not apply to the Japanese."
"This is already being realised in Australia, as Mr. Bruce Smith's motion"
shows. The Japanese are making it clear that they have to be regarded by
Europeans in a different light from the rest of Asiatics. Europeans
consider themselves superior to all other races. I do not blame them for
"thinking that, for of modern civilisations theirs is certainly the best."
"But with the exception of the British people, Europeans have not yet"
realised that modern Japan is built up on European methods. She has no
"more to do with the so-called ""Yellow Peril"" than America has. She takes"
"her place by the side of the other powers, with very much the same"
civilisation as theirs. England having been the first to recognise the
"new Japan, I am certain her colonies will soon follow. That is why I"
feel it is only a question of time before Australia excludes Japan from
its Restriction Act.'
"""Please don't make scenes in the street, and don't follow me like this."
"If you want to talk to me, you can--at home."""
"Then, very calmly, she turned and walked on.  But he was still following"
"her, some paces off.  She did not quicken her steps, and to the first"
"taxicab driver that passed she made a sign, and saying:"
"""Bury Street--quick!"" got in.  She saw Fiorsen rush forward, too late to"
"stop her.  He threw up his hand and stood still, his face deadly white"
under his broad-brimmed hat.  She was far too angry and upset to care.
"From the moment she turned to the window at Monsieur Harmost's, she had"
determined to go to her father's.  She would not go back to Fiorsen; and
the one thought that filled her mind was how to get Betty and her baby.
"Nearly four!  Dad was almost sure to be at his club.  And leaning out,"
"she said: ""No; Hyde Park Corner, please."""
"The hall porter, who knew her, after calling to a page-boy: ""Major"
"Winton--sharp, now!"" came specially out of his box to offer her a seat"

"Gyp sat with it on her knee, vaguely taking in her surroundings--a thin"
"old gentleman anxiously weighing himself in a corner, a white-calved"
footman crossing with a tea-tray; a number of hats on pegs; the
"green-baize board with its white rows of tapelike paper, and three"
"members standing before it.  One of them, a tall, stout,"
"good-humoured-looking man in pince-nez and a white waistcoat, becoming"
"conscious, removed his straw hat and took up a position whence, without"
"staring, he could gaze at her; and Gyp knew, without ever seeming to"
"glance at him, that he found her to his liking.  She saw her father's"
"unhurried figure passing that little group, all of whom were conscious"
"now, and eager to get away out of this sanctum of masculinity, she met"
the name of these societies and they are known outside of the
State by its name. Cross-reference when necessary.
Enter churches under the name of the place.
"Single churches have usually been entered under the place, a practice"
"which arose in American indexes from our way of naming churches ""The"
"First Church in----,"" ""The Second Church of----,"" etc., and applies"
"very well to a majority of English churches, whose name generally"
includes the name of the parish. It is more in accordance with indexing
"principles to limit the local entry of churches to _First Church_,"
"etc., and those which have only the name of the town or parish, and to"
"put all others (as _St. Sepulchre's_, _St. Mary Aldermansbury_) under"
"their names, as they read, and to treat convents and monasteries in the"
same way; but the convenience of having a single definite rule has been
held to outweigh in this case the claims of consistency.
"The parishes of London (as _Kensington_, _Marylebone_, _Southwark_),"
"like the parts of Boston (_Dorchester_, _Roxbury_, etc.), or of any"
"other composite city, would be put under their own names, not under the"
name of the city.
A few cathedrals generally known by some other name may be entered
"under it: e.g., _St. Paul's, London; Notre Dame, Paris; St."
"Peter's, Rome; St. Sophia, Constantinople_."
"Put monasteries and convents, like churches, under the place,"
unless better known by the name.
National banks designated merely by number (as _First National Bank
of Boston_) go under the name of the place.
"laid hold on fame while as yet deeming himself unfamous. It's curious,"
"but true, nevertheless, that very often the writers who thought least"
of themselves during their lifetime have become the most universally
"renowned after their deaths. Shakespeare, I dare say, had no very"
"exaggerated idea of the beauty of his own plays,--he seems to have"
"written just the best that was in him, without caring what anybody"
thought of it. And I believe that is the only way to succeed in the
"end."""
"""In the end!"" repeated Alwyn dreamily--""In the end, no worldly success"
"is worth attaining,--a few thousand years and the greatest are"
"forgotten!"""
"""Not the GREATEST,""--said Villiers warmly--""The greatest must always be"
"remembered."""
"""No, my friend!--Not even the greatest! Do you not think there must"
"have been great and wise and gifted men in Tyre, in Sidon, in Carthage,"
"in Babylon?--There are five men mentioned in Scripture, as being 'ready"
"to write swiftly'--Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Ariel--where is"
the no doubt admirable work done by these? Perhaps ... who knows? ...
"one of them was as great as Homer in genius,--we cannot tell!"""
"""True,--we cannot tell!"" responded Villiers meditatively--""But, Alwyn,"
if you persist in viewing things through such tremendous vistas of
"time, and in measuring the Future by the Past, then one may ask what is"
"the use of anything?"""
"""There IS no use in anything, except in the making of a strong,"
"persistent, steady effort after good,"" said Alwyn earnestly ... ""We men"
"are cast, as it were, between two swift currents, Wrong and"
"Right,--Self and God,--and it seems more easy to shut our eyes and"
"cold, frosty; Gyp hurried down the path.  Four little icicles had formed"
"beneath the window of the music-room.  They caught her eye, and, passing"
"round to the side, she broke one off. There must be a fire in there, for"
she could see the flicker through the curtains not quite drawn.
"Thoughtful Ellen had been airing it!  But, suddenly, she stood still."
There was more than a fire in there!  Through the chink in the drawn
curtains she had seen two figures seated on the divan.  Something seemed
to spin round in her head.  She turned to rush away.  Then a kind of
"superhuman coolness came to her, and she deliberately looked in. He and"
Daphne Wing!  His arm was round her neck.  The girl's face riveted her
"eyes.  It was turned a little back and up, gazing at him, the lips"
"parted, the eyes hypnotized, adoring; and her arm round him seemed to"
"shiver--with cold, with ecstasy?"
Again that something went spinning through Gyp's head.  She raised her
"hand.  For a second it hovered close to the glass.  Then, with a sick"
"feeling, she dropped it and turned away."
Never!  Never would she show him or that girl that they could hurt her!
Never!  They were safe from any scene she would make--safe in their nest!
"And blindly, across the frosty grass, through the unlighted drawing-room,"
"she went upstairs to her room, locked the door, and sat down before the"
fire.  Pride raged within her.  She stuffed her handkerchief between her
teeth and lips; she did it unconsciously.  Her eyes felt scorched from
"the fire-flames, but she did not trouble to hold her hand before them."
Suddenly she thought: 'Suppose I HAD loved him?' and laughed.  The
"handkerchief dropped to her lap, and she looked at it with wonder--it was"
"blood-stained.  She drew back in the chair, away from the scorching of"
"the fire, and sat quite still, a smile on her lips. That girl's eyes,"
"like a little adoring dog's--that girl, who had fawned on her so!  She"
"had got her ""distinguished man""!  She sprang up and looked at herself in"
official reception at the Elysee the appearance of a bal travesti--I
"passed Monsieur Casimir Perrier, former President of the Republic;"
"Monsieur Paul Deschanel, the lion of the hour; Monsieur"
"Benjamin-Constant, always a prominent figure; Prince Roland Bonaparte,"
"smiling and bowing; the Duchess d'Auerstadt, with her magnificent"
"jewels; and Damat, the dapper Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour."
"All diplomatic Paris was there, chattering, laughing, whispering, and"
"plotting.  Around me sounded a veritable babel of tongues, but no part"
of the function interested me.
"From time to time I saluted a man I knew, or bent over a woman's hand;"
but my thoughts were of the one woman who had so suddenly and so
forcibly returned into my life.  The representatives of the Powers of
"Europe were all present, and as they passed me by, each in his bright"
"uniform, his orders flashing on his breast and a woman on his arm, I"
asked myself which of them was actually the employer of my well-beloved.
The startling events of the day had upset me.  Had it been possible I
would have left and returned to my rooms for a quiet smoke and for calm
"reflection.  But my duty required my presence there; hence I remained,"
strolling slowly around the great crowded salon with its myriad lights
"and profuse floral decorations, until I suddenly encountered the"
"wizen-faced, toothless old Baronne de Chalencon, whose salon was one of"
"the most popular in Paris, and with whom I was on excellent terms."
"""Ah! my dear M'sieur Ingram!"" she cried, holding forth her thin, bony"
"hand laden with jewels.  ""You look tired.  Why?  No one here to-night"
"who interests you--eh?"""
"""No one save yourself, Baronne,"" I responded, bending over her hand."
"""Flatterer!"" she laughed.  ""If I were forty years younger I might accept"
"Commanded a Dutch vessel, the _Edward and Thomas_, that sailed from Boston"
"in 1674, and took several small English vessels along the coast of Maine."
"Tried for piracy at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and condemned to be hanged,"
but was afterwards pardoned.
"ROGERS, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"Commanded a ship, the _Forlorn_. Routed the Spaniards at Venta Cruz in"
1671. One of Morgan's captains in his attack on Panama.
"ROGERS, CAPTAIN WOODES."
"As the life of this famous navigator and privateer is, very justly,"
"treated fully in the ""Dictionary of National Biography"" it is unnecessary"
to mention more than a few incidents in his adventurous career. Woodes
"Rogers was not only a good navigator, for on many occasions he showed a"
remarkable gift for commanding mutinous crews in spite of having many
"officers on whom he could place little reliance. On leaving Cork in 1708,"
after an incompetent pilot had almost run his ship on two rocks off
"Kinsale called ""The Sovereigne's Bollacks,"" Rogers describes his crew"
"thus: ""A third were foreigners, while of Her Majestie's subjects many were"
"taylors, tinkers, pedlars, fiddlers, and hay-makers, with ten boys and one"
"negro."" It was with crews such as these that many of the boldest and most"
"remarkable early voyages were made, and they required a man of Woodes"
Rogers stamp to knock them into sailors. Rogers had a gift for inspiring
"friendship wherever he went. On arriving at the coast of Brazil, his boat"
was fired on when trying to land at Angre de Reys. This settlement had but
lately received several hostile visitors in the way of French pirates. But
before a week was passed Woodes Rogers had so won the hearts of the
"Portuguese Governor and the settlers that he and his ""musick"" were invited"
"Charing Cross, and he surprised me with an invitation to his house"
that night to meet Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise at supper.
"""The king and a dozen other gentlemen will be present,"" he said, ""but"
"there will be no ladies. Monsieur l'Abbé, being of the church, is not a"
"ladies' man, and besides, ladies have sharper eyes than men, and might"
"see much that is intended to remain unseen."""
"The count's remark seemed to settle the question of the Abbé's identity,"
and I hastened to Frances with the news. She assured me that she was
"ready to die of fright, but showed no outward sign of dissolution, and"
"when I complimented her on her power of self-control, said:--"
"""Fortunately, I am part hypocrite, and can easily act a part."""
"""You have a hard one ahead of you,"" I returned, ""and will need all your"
"strength before it is played to the end."""

"I was on hand early at De Grammont's supper, but found several gentlemen"
"ahead of me, awaiting, with the count in his parlor, the arrival of the"
"king. Soon after I entered the room, De Grammont presented me to the"
"Abbé. I was convinced at once that he was not George Hamilton. His beard,"
"worn à la Richelieu,--a mustache and a tuft on the chin,--was snow white,"
"and his hair, which was thin, hung in long white waves almost to his"
"shoulders. He walked with a stoop and wore spectacles, the glasses of"
"which were slightly colored. Being an ecclesiastic, though not a priest,"
"he wore no wig; but he was of the Order of the Cordon Bleu, and wore, in"
"addition to his badge and blue ribbon, a sword beneath his long coat. It"
"was the first time I had ever seen an ecclesiastic wearing a sword,"
"though it has since become common in France, where there are many ""Abbés"""
"la police des moeurs."""
Mrs. Warren at least died with the reputation of one who promptly
"paid her bills; and the whole _assistance_, as it walked slowly back"
"to Brussels, recalled many a deed of kindness and jovial charity on"
the part of the dead Englishwoman.

"Vivie, on sizing up her affairs, got Monsieur Walcker, the Baptist"
"pasteur, to convey a letter to the American Consulate General."
"Walcker was used to such missions as these, of which the German"
"Government was more or less cognizant. The Germans, among their many"
"contradictory features, had a great respect for religion, a great"
tolerance as to its forms. They not only appreciated the difference
"between Jews and Christians, Catholics and Lutherans, but between"
the Church of England and the various Free Churches of Britain and
America. The many people whom they sentenced to death must all have
their appropriate religious consolation before facing the firing
"party. Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists were all provided for;"
there was a Church of England chaplain for the avowed Anglicans; but
what was to be done for the Free Churches and Nonconformist sects of
the Anglo-Saxons? They were not represented by any captive pastor;
"so in default this much respected Monsieur Walcker, the Belgian"
"Baptist, was called in to minister to the Nonconformist mind in its"
last agony. He therefore held a quasi-official position and was
often entrusted with missions which would have been dealt with
punitorily on the part of any one else. Consequently he was able to
deliver Vivie's communication to the American Consul-General with
some probability of its being sent on. It contained no further
appeal to American intervention than this: that the Consul-General
would try to convey to England the news of her mother's death to
widely deposited over the continent of North America.
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The Cambrian system of North America comprises
"three distinct series, the LOWER CAMBRIAN, the MIDDLE CAMBRIAN,"
"and the UPPER CAMBRIAN, each of which is characterized by its own"
peculiar fauna. In sketching the outlines of the continent as it
"was at the beginning of the Paleozoic, it must be remembered that"
wherever the Lower Cambrian formations now are found was certainly
"then sea bottom, and wherever the Lower Cambrian are wanting, and"
"the next formations rest directly on pre-Cambrian rocks, was"
probably then land.
EARLY CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. In this way we know that at the opening
"of the Cambrian two long, narrow mediterranean seas stretched from"
north to south across the continent. The eastern sea extended from
the Gulf of St. Lawrence down the Champlain-Hudson valley and
thence along the western base of the Blue Ridge south at least to
Alabama. The western sea stretched from the Canadian Rockies over
the Great Basin and at least as far south as the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado in Arizona.
Between these mediterraneans lay a great central land which
included the pre-Cambrian U-shaped area of the Laurentian
"peneplain, and probably extended southward to the latitude of New"
Orleans. To the east lay a land which we may designate as
"APPALACHIA, whose western shore line was drawn along the site of"
"the present Blue Ridge, but whose other limits are quite unknown."
"The land of Appalachia must have been large, for it furnished a"
"great amount of waste during the entire Paleozoic era, and its"
eastern coast may possibly have lain even beyond the edge of the
present continental shelf. On the western side of the continent a
narrow land occupied the site of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
"RACKAM, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ CALICO JACK."
Served as quartermaster in Captain Vane's company. On one occasion Vane
"refused to fight a big French ship, and in consequence was dismissed his"
"ship and marooned on an uninhabited island off the coast of America, while"
the crew elected Rackam to be their captain in his place. This was on
"November 24th, 1718, and on the very first day of his command he had the"
good fortune to take and plunder several small vessels.
"Off the Island of Jamaica they took a Madeira ship, and found an old"
"friend on board as a passenger--a Mr. Hosea Tisdell, who kept a tavern in"
"the island, and they treated him with great respect."
"Christmas Day coming, the pirates landed on a small island to celebrate"
"this festival in a thorough manner, carousing and drinking as long as the"
"liquor lasted, when they sailed away to seek more. Their next prize was a"
"strange one. On coming alongside a ship, she surrendered, and the pirates"
"boarding her to examine her cargo, found it to consist of thieves from"
"Newgate on their way to the plantations. Taking two more vessels, Rackam"
"sailed to the Bahama Islands, but the Governor, Captain Woodes Rogers,"
"sent a sloop, which took away their prizes."
"Rackam now sailed his ship to a snug little cove he knew of in Cuba, where"
he had more than one lady acquaintance. Here the pirates were very happy
until all their provisions and money was spent. Just as they were about to
"sail, in comes a Spanish Guarda del Costa with a small English sloop which"
"they had recently taken. Rackam was now in a very awkward position, being"
"unable to get past the Spaniard, and all he could do was to hide behind a"
"small island. Night came on, and when it was dark Rackam put all his crew"
"into a boat, rowed quietly up to the sloop, clambered aboard, threatening"
"composed himself to sleep, his chest rising and falling with regular,"
"uninterrupted breathing. Once he smiled: he was thinking of Ned Evans,"
"the doorkeeper; then he gave himself a little shake, closed his eyes,"
"and forgot all the troubles of this weary world. So sleep children,"
"so--we are told--the just: so slept M. François Gaspard, on his way to"
seek fresh woods and pastures new.
CHAPTER XXI.
ALL THERE WAS TO TELL.
The custom in New Lindsey was that every Monday during the session of
"Parliament the Executive Council should meet at Government House, and,"
"under the presidency of the Governor, formally ratify and adopt the"
arrangements as to the business of the coming week which its members had
"decided upon at their Cabinet meetings. It is to be hoped that, in these"
"days, when we all take an interest in our Empire, everybody knows that"
"the Executive Council is the outward, visible, and recognised form of"
"that impalpable, unrecognised, all-powerful institution, the Cabinet,"
"consisting in fact, though not in theory, of the same persons, save that"
"the Governor is present when the meeting is of the Council, and absent"
"when it is of the Cabinet--a difference of less moment than it sounds,"
"seeing that, except in extreme cases, the Governor has little to do but"
"listen to what is going to be done. However, forms doubtless have their"
"value, and at any rate they must be observed, so on this Monday morning"
"the Executive Council was to meet as usual, although nobody knew where"
"the Cabinet would be that time twenty-four hours. Lady Eynesford, who"
"wanted her husband to drive her out, thought the meeting under the"
[Sidenote: The Footprints of Christ in Stone.]
"About two miles northeast of the Three Fountains, and the same distance"
"from the city, on the Appian Way, stands the Church of St. Sebastian."
"Over an altar on the right, as you enter, the attendant priest, drawing"
"aside a curtain, shows you a slab of dark red stone with two enormous"
"footprints on it. These, we are told, were made by the feet of Christ"
"during an interview with Peter which took place near here, on the site"
of the small Church of Domine Quo Vadis. The story is as follows: After
"the burning of Rome, Nero charged the Christians with having fired"
"the city. Straightway the first persecution broke forth, and many of"
the Christians were put to death with dreadful torture. The survivors
"besought Peter not to expose his life. As he fled along the Appian Way,"
Christ appeared to him travelling towards the city. The fleeing apostle
"exclaimed in amazement, ""_Domine, quo vadis?_"" (Lord, whither goest"
"thou?), to which, with a look of mild sadness, the Saviour replied,"
"""_Venio iterum crucifigi_"" (I come to be crucified a second time), then"
"vanished, whereupon the apostle, ashamed of his weakness, returned to"
"Rome, and shortly afterwards was crucified there himself."
[Sidenote: The Chains of St. Peter.]
Another relic of great interest connected with the same apostle is
"shown in the Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, in Rome, and indeed gives"
the church its name. The church is not without interest for other
"reasons. For instance, it possesses portions of the crosses of St."
"Peter and St. Andrew, and we are told that the high altar covers the"
remains of the seven Maccabean brothers. But the basilica is specially
famous for the possession of the greatest masterpiece of sculpture
"since the time of the Greeks--the majestic ""Moses"" of Michelangelo,"
which draws thousands of sightseers who might otherwise never set foot
"your aeroplanes, a rising against us in the Marolles quarter--"" said"
"very plainly what she thought of Edith Cavell's execution. ""It makes"
me think of Talleyrand--was it not?--who said 'It is a blunder;
"worse than a crime' ... these terrible old generals, they know"
"nothing of the world outside Germany."" As to her cousin, Gottlieb"
"von Giesselin--""Really dear, if in this time of horrors one _dare_"
"laugh at anything, I feel--oh it is too funny, but also, too"
"'schokking,' as we suppose all English women say. Yet of course I am"
"sad about him, because he is a good, kind man, and I know his wife"
"will be very very unhappy when she hears--And it means he will die,"
"for certain. He must risk his life to--to--regain his position, and"
"he will be shot before Verdun in one of those dreadful assaults."""
"Then she told Vivie where she might find rooms, where at any rate"
"she could use her name as a reference. Also: ""Stay away at present"
"and look after your mother. When she is quite comfortably settled,"
come back and work with me--here--it is at any rate the only way in
"which you can see and help your countrymen."""
One day in November when their notice at the hotel was nearly
"expired, Vivie proposed an expedition to her mother. They would walk"
slowly--because Mrs. Warren now got easily out of breath--up to the
Jardin Bontanique; Vivie would leave her there in the Palm House. It
was warm; it was little frequented; there were seats and the
Belgians in charge knew Mrs. Warren of old time. Vivie would then go
on along the inner Boulevards by tram and look at some rooms
recommended by Minna von Stachelberg in the Quartier St. Gilles.
Mrs. Warren did as she was told. Vivie left her seated in one of the
"long series of glass houses overlooking Brussels from a terrace,"
"wherein are assembled many glories of the tropics: palms, dracaenas,"
"yuccas, aloes, tree-ferns, cycads, screw-pines, and bananas:"
promising to be back in an hour's time.
and small fishes miraculously multiplied to feed the five thousand;
the linen cloth with which he dried the feet of his apostles; also
"Aaron's rod, the rod with which Moses smote the Red Sea,"" etc., etc."
"(_Cook's Southern Italy_, p. 114.) We did not see these, but in the"
cloister behind this church we were shown a marble slab on pillars
"which was once an altar, ""at which the officiating priest doubted of"
"the Real Presence, when the wafer fell from his hand through the stone,"
"leaving a round hole, which still remains."" Here, too, we were shown"
"a larger slab resting on pillars, more than six feet from the ground,"
"which marks the height of our Saviour; also a porphyry slab, upon which"
the soldiers cast lots for his seamless robe; and some columns from
"Pilate's house in Jerusalem, which were rent by the earthquake of the"
crucifixion.
"[Illustration: THE SCALA SANTA, ROME.]"
[Sidenote: The Holy Stairs from Pilate's Palace.]
"But the great relic of Pilate's House, and one of the most interesting"
"of all the relics in Rome, is across the street from St. John Lateran,"
"viz., the world-renowned _Scala Santa_, or Holy Stairway, a flight of"
"twenty-eight marble steps, once ascended by our Saviour in the palace"
"of Pilate, and brought from Jerusalem to Rome in 326 by the Empress"
"Helena, mother of Constantine the Great. They are covered with a wooden"
"casing, but holes have been left through which the marble steps can be"
seen. Two of them are stained with the Saviour's blood. These spots
"are covered with glass. The light was rather dim, and as we entered a"
gentleman struck a match and held it over one of these glass-covered
"stains to show it to his little girl, so that, passing just at that"
"moment, we also had a good view."
[Sidenote: The Man who Crawled Up and Walked Down.]
This was written by Erasmus to a member of the University of Leipzig in
December 1520. This one-sided and academic conception of the great
"events, a conception which arose in the study of a recluse bending over"
"his books, did more than anything else to prevent Erasmus from"
understanding the true nature and purport of the Reformation.
CHAPTER XVI
FIRST YEARS OF THE REFORMATION
Beginning of the relations between Erasmus and Luther--
"Archbishop Albert of Mayence, 1517--Progress of the"
Reformation--Luther tries to bring about a _rapprochement_ with
"Erasmus, March 1519--Erasmus keeps aloof; fancies he may yet act"
as a conciliator--His attitude becomes ambiguous--He denies ever
more emphatically all relations with Luther and resolves to
remain a spectator--He is pressed by either camp to take
"sides--Aleander in the Netherlands--The Diet of Worms,"
"1521--Erasmus leaves Louvain to safeguard his freedom, October"
1521
"About the close of 1516, Erasmus received a letter from the librarian"
"and secretary of Frederick, elector of Saxony, George Spalatinus,"
written in the respectful and reverential tone in which the great man
was now approached. 'We all esteem you here most highly; the elector has
all your books in his library and intends to buy everything you may
publish in future.' But the object of Spalatinus's letter was the
"execution of a friend's commission. An Augustinian ecclesiastic, a great"
"Now, Maung Kan's wife had born to him twin sons. They were born at"
"Okshitgon shortly before their parents had to run away, and they were"
"named, the eldest Maung Gyi, which is Brother Big-fellow, and the"
"younger Maung Ngè, which means Brother Little-fellow. These lads grew up"
"at Kabyu, and soon learned to talk; and as they grew up their parents"
"were surprised to hear them calling to each other at play, and calling"
"each other, not Maung Gyi and Maung Ngè, but Maung San Nyein and Ma"
"Gywin. The latter is a woman's name, and the parents remembered that"
these were the names of the man and wife who had died in Okshitgon about
the time the children were born.
So the parents thought that the souls of the man and wife had entered
"into the children, and they took them to Okshitgon to try them. The"
children knew everything in Okshitgon; they knew the roads and the
"houses and the people, and they recognised the clothes they used to wear"
"in a former life; there was no doubt about it. One of them, the younger,"
"remembered, too, how she had borrowed two rupees once of a woman, Ma"
"Thet, unknown to her husband, and left the debt unpaid. Ma Thet was"
"still living, and so they asked her, and she recollected that it was"
true she had lent the money long ago.
Shortly afterwards I saw these two children. They are now just over six
"years old. The elder, into whom the soul of the man entered, is a fat,"
"chubby little fellow, but the younger twin is smaller, and has a curious"
"dreamy look in his face, more like a girl than a boy. They told me much"
about their former lives. After they died they said they lived for some
"time without a body at all, wandering in the air and hiding in the"
"trees. This was for their sins. Then, after some months, they were born"
"again as twin boys. 'It used,' said the elder boy, 'to be so clear, I"
"could remember everything; but it is getting duller and duller, and I"
cannot now remember as I used to do.'
"Netherlands, drawing thither the unearned revenues of the Americas, and"
"still contrived to keep Spain subject to his rule, the latter country"
"would have been thrown back on her great natural resources, her"
"industry, and her commerce, which, as it was, developed markedly during"
"his reign,[765] despite the heavy burdens of his wars. And in that case"
Spain might conceivably have become the Protestant and rebellious
"territory, and the Netherlands on the contrary have remained Catholic"
"and grown commercially decrepit, having in reality the weaker potential"
economic basis.
"The theorem that the two races were vitally opposed in ""religious"
"sentiment,"" and that ""it was as certain that the Netherlanders"
would be fierce reformers as that the Spaniards would be
"uncompromising persecutors"" (Motley, p. 31), is part of the common"
"pre-scientific conception of national development, and proceeds"
upon flat disregard of the historical evidence. It is well
established that there was as much heresy of the more rational
"Protestant and Unitarian sort in Spain, to begin with, as in"
Holland. Under Ferdinand and Isabella the Inquisition seems to
"have struck mainly at Judaic and Moorish monotheistic heresy, which"
"was not uncommon among the upper classes, while the lower were for"
"the most part orthodox (Armstrong, _Introd._ to Major Hume's"
"_Spain_, pp. 14, 18). Thus there is good ground for the surmise"
that Ferdinand's object was primarily the confiscation of the
"wealth of Jews and other rich heretics. (See U.R. Burke, _History"
"of Spain_, 1895, ii, 101; Hume's ed. 1900, ii, 74.) In Aragon,"
"Valencia, and Catalonia there was general resistance to the"
Inquisition; in Cordova there was a riot against it; in Saragossa
"the Inquisitor was murdered before the altar (Armstrong, p. 18;"
"Llorente, _Hist. crit. de l'Inquisition d'Espagne_, éd. 1818, i,"
"185-213; M'Crie, _Reformation in Spain_, ed. 1856, pp. 52-53. Cp."
"U.R. Burke, as cited, ii, 97, 98, 101, 103, 111; Hume's ed. ii, 66,"
Rossiter and the indignation of the W.S.P.U. became so alarming that
the agitated Secretary of State--not at all sure how we were going
"to come out of the War--gave way, and an order was signed for"
Vivie's release on the 11th of August; on the understanding that she
would immediately proceed abroad; an understanding to which she
would not subscribe but which in her slowly-formed hatred of the
British Government she resolved to carry out.
"Mrs. Warren, assured by Praed and Rossiter that Vivie's release was"
"a mere matter of a few days, had left for Brussels on the 5th of"
August. If--as was then hoped--the French and Belgian armies would
"suffice to keep the Germans at bay on the frontier of Belgium, she"
would prefer to resume her life there in the Villa de Beau-séjour.
If however Belgium was going to be invaded it was better she should
"secure her property as far as possible, transfer her funds, and make"
her way somehow to a safe part of France. Vivie would join her as
soon as she could leave the prison.
CHAPTER XVI
BRUSSELS AND THE WAR: 1914
The Lilacs in Victoria Road had been disposed of--through
"Honoria--as soon as possible, after the sentence of Three years'"
imprisonment had been pronounced on Vivie; and the faithful
"Suffragette maid had passed into Honoria's employ at Petworth, a"
fact that was not fully understood by Colonel Armstrong until he had
become General Armstrong and perfectly indifferent to the Suffrage
"Figure 207, a strong unconformity parts the schists and the"
Algonkian. The floor on which the Algonkian rests is remarkably
"even, and here again is proved an interval of incalculable length,"
during which an ancient land mass of Archean rocks was baseleveled
before it received the cover of the sediments of the later age.
THE LAKE SUPERIOR REGION. In eastern Canada an area of pre-
"Cambrian rocks, Archean and Algonkian, estimated at two million"
"square miles, stretches from the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence"
"River northward to the confines of the continent, inclosing Hudson"
"Bay in the arms of a gigantic U. This immense area, which we have"
"already studied as the Laurentian peneplain, extends southward"
"across the Canadian border into northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and"
Michigan. The rocks of this area are known to be pre-Cambrian; for
"the Cambrian strata, wherever found, lie unconformably upon them."
The general relations of the formations of that portion of the
area which lies about Lake Superior are shown in Figure 262. Great
"unconformities, UU' separate the Algonkian both from the Archean"
"and from the Cambrian, and divide it into three distinct systems,"
"--the LOWER HURONIAN, the UPPER HURONIAN, and the KEWEENAWAN. The"
Lower and the Upper Huronian consist in the main of old sea muds
"and sands and limy oozes now changed to gneisses, schists,"
"marbles, quartzites, slates, and other metamorphic rocks. The"
"Keweenawan is composed of immense piles of lava, such as those of"
"Iceland, overlain by bedded sandstones. What remains of these rock"
systems after the denudation of all later geologic ages is
"enormous. The Lower Huronian is more than a mile thick, the Upper"
"Huronian more than two miles thick, while the Keweenawan exceeds"
nine miles in thickness. The vast length of Algonkian time is
shown by the thickness of its marine deposits and by the cycles of
erosion which it includes. In Figure 262 the student may read an
Somehow I suspected her of a deliberate intention to mislead me in this
"matter.  She was a shrewd woman, who only disclosed her secrets when it"
was to her own interests or the interests of her friends at the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs to do so.  In Paris there is a vast network of French
"intrigue, and it behoves the diplomatist always to be wary lest he"
should fall into the pitfalls so cunningly prepared for him.  The
dividing line between truth and untruth is always so very difficult to
define in modern diplomacy.  It is when the European situation seems
most secure that the match is sufficiently near to fire the mine.
"Fortunate it is that the public, quick to accept anything that appears"
"in the daily journals, can be placed in a sense of false security by"
articles inspired by one or other of the embassies interested.  If it
"were not so, European panics would certainly be of frequent occurrence."
"My Chief sauntered by, chatting with his close personal friend, Prince"
"Olsoufieff, the Russian Ambassador, who looked a truly striking figure"
"in his white uniform, with the Cross of St. Andrew glittering at his"
"throat.  The latter, as he passed, exclaimed confidentially in Russian"
"to my Chief, who understood that language, having been first Secretary"
of Embassy in Petersburg earlier in his career:
"""Da, ya po-ni-mai-u.  Ya sam napishu.""  (""Yes, I understand.  I will"
"write for you myself."")"
"Keen antagonists in diplomacy though they very often were, yet in"
private life a firm friendship existed between the pair--a friendship
dating from the days when the one had been British Attache in Petersburg
and the other had occupied a position in the Russian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs--that large grey building facing the Winter Palace.
"""The lion and the bear strolling together,"" laughed the toothless old"
"Baronne, after they had passed.  ""Olsoufieff is a charming man, but he"

In discussing dreams of flying I have referred to a dream in which a
slight disturbance of the heart's action was transformed by sleeping
consciousness into the image of an athlete manipulating an elastic ball.
"This objectivation of what are really the dreamer's subjective sensations,"
"although he is not conscious of them as subjective, is, indeed, a"
"phenomenon which we have encountered many times. It is, however, so"
"important a feature of dream psychology, and probably of such significant"
"weight in its influence on waking life, that it is worth while to deal"
with it separately.
"The dramatisation of subjective elements of the personality, which"
"contributes so largely to render our dreams vivid and interesting, rests"
"on that dissociation, or falling apart of the constituent groups of"
"psychic centres, which is so fundamental a fact of dream life. That is to"
"because the war with Spain ""threw open to her attack the whole"
"boundless possessions of her antagonist in the New World, which"
would have been closed to her in peace. By conquest she made for
"herself an empire, and this empire made her rich."" In the first"
place it was not in the New World that she mainly sought her
"empire, but in the East Indies, in the sphere of the Portuguese"
"conquests. Her hold of Brazil lasted only from 1621 to 1654, and"
"was not a great source of wealth, though she captured much Spanish"
"and Portuguese shipping. But even her eastern trade was, as we have"
"seen, small in quantity, and as a source of wealth was not to be"
compared with the herring fishery. In 1601 John Keymor declared
"that more wealth was produced by the northern fisheries ""in one"
"year than the King of Spain hath in four years out of the Indies"""
(_Observations made upon the Dutch Fishing about the Year
"1601_--reprint in _Phoenix_, 1707, i, 225). The Dutch takings in"
"six months' fishing were then reckoned at 3,600,000 barrels, valued"
at as many pounds sterling (_id._ p. 224); the fishing fleet
"numbered 4,100 sail of all kinds, with over 3,000 tenders, out of a"
"roughly estimated total of 20,000; while the whole Indian fleet is"
"stated at only 40 or 50, employing 5,000 or 6,000 men (_id._ p."
"223), as against a total of some 200,000 of Dutch seafaring"
"population. Howell, writing in 1622 (ed. Bennett, 1891, vol. i,"
"205), also puts the Amsterdam ships in the Indian trade at 40."
Professor Seeley's statement cannot have proceeded on any
comparison of the European Dutch trade with the revenue from the
"conquered ""empire."" It stands for an endorsement of the vulgar"
"delusion that ""possessions"" are the great sources of a nation's"
"wealth, though Seeley elsewhere (p. 294) protests against the"
"""bombastic language of this school,"" and notes that ""England is"
"not, directly at least, any the richer"" for her connection with her"
"""dependencies."""
An apology seems to be called for from anyone who gives to the world a
new Life of Napoleon I. My excuse must be that for many years I have
sought to revise the traditional story of his career in the light of
facts gleaned from the British Archives and of the many valuable
materials that have recently been published by continental historians.
To explain my manner of dealing with these sources would require an
"elaborate critical Introduction; but, as the limits of my space"
"absolutely preclude any such attempt, I can only briefly refer to the"
most important topics.
"To deal with the published sources first, I would name as of chief"
"importance the works of MM. Aulard, Chuquet, Houssaye, Sorel, and"
"Vandal in France; of Herren Beer, Delbrück, Fournier, Lehmann, Oncken,"
and Wertheimer in Germany and Austria; and of Baron Lumbroso in Italy.
I have also profited largely by the scholarly monographs or
"collections of documents due to the labours of the ""Société d'Histoire"
"Contemporaine,"" the General Staff of the French Army, of MM. Bouvier,"
"Caudrillier, Capitaine ""J.G.,"" Lévy, Madelin, Sagnac, Sciout, Zivy,"
"and others in France; and of Herren Bailleu, Demelitsch, Hansing,"
"Klinkowstrom, Luckwaldt, Ulmann, and others in Germany. Some of the"
recently published French Memoirs dealing with those times are not
"devoid of value, though this class of literature is to be used with"
caution. The new letters of Napoleon published by M. Léon Lecestre and
M. Léonce de Brotonne have also opened up fresh vistas into the life
of the great man; and the time seems to have come when we may safely
revise our judgments on many of its episodes.
"But I should not have ventured on this great undertaking, had I not"
been able to contribute something new to Napoleonic literature. During
"a study of this period for an earlier work published in the ""Cambridge"
"Historical Series,"" I ascertained the great value of the British"
records for the years 1795-1815. It is surely discreditable to our
"of St. Peter's, a bone of Judas Iscariot (black, not white), and also"
"bones of all the other disciples (presumably of the normal color), a"
"handkerchief in which the Saviour had left the impression of his face,"
"part of the crown of thorns, a fragment of the purple robe worn by"
"Christ, a picture of the Virgin and Child painted by St. Luke, and a"
nail from the cross--adding in another place that he thought he had
seen in all not less than a keg of these nails.
"But I had hardly taken Mark Twain seriously in these statements, not"
"knowing at the time that his _Innocents Abroad_ was, notwithstanding"
"its broad humor, really one of the best guide-books to Europe that was"
ever written.
[Sidenote: The Palladium of Venice.]
I had read repeatedly the story of the bringing of St. Mark's bones
"from Alexandria, in Egypt, to their present resting-place in St. Mark's"
Cathedral at Venice--a story which is related as follows in that same
lively volume:
"""St. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt. He was martyred, I think."
"However, that has nothing to do with my legend. About the founding of"
the city of Venice--say four hundred and fifty years after Christ--(for
"Venice is much younger than any other Italian city), a priest dreamed"
that an angel told him that until the remains of St. Mark were brought
"to Venice, the city could never rise to high distinction among the"
"nations; that the body must be captured, brought to the city, and"
a magnificent church built over it; and that if ever the Venetians
"allowed the Saint to be removed from his new resting-place, in that"
day Venice would perish from off the face of the earth. The priest
"proclaimed his dream, and forthwith Venice set about procuring the"
"corpse of St. Mark. One expedition after another tried and failed, but"
had continuous performances; there was Grand Opera; there were
"exhibitions of toys, or pictures, and charitable bazaars. Ten days"
after the fall of Antwerp _char-à-bancs_ packed with Belgians drove
out of Brussels to visit the scenes of the battles and those
"shattered forts, so fatuously deemed impregnable, so feeble in their"
resistance to German artillery.
"Vivie, even had she wished to do so, could not have joined the"
sight-seers. As the subjects of an enemy power she and her mother
had had early in January to register themselves at the Kommandantur
and were there warned that without a special passport they might not
pass beyond the limits of Brussels and its suburbs. Except in the
"matter of the farewell visit to the farm at Tervueren, Vivie was"
"reluctant to ask for any such favour from von Giesselin, though she"
was curious to see the condition of Louvain and to ascertain whether
her father still inhabited the monastic house of his order--she had
an idea that he was away in Germany in connection with his schemes
for raising the Irish against the British Government. Von Giesselin
however was becoming sentimentally inclined towards her and she saw
no more of him than was necessary to maintain polite relations. Frau
"von Giesselin, for various reasons of health or children, could not"
join him at Brussels as so many German wives had done with other of
the high functionaries (to the great embitterment of Brussels
society); and there were times when von Giesselin's protestations of
his loneliness alarmed her.
The King of Saxony had paid a visit to Brussels in the late autumn
of 1914 and had invited this Colonel of his Army to a fastuous
banquet given at the Palace Hotel. The King--whom the still defiant
"Brussels Press, especially that unkillable _La Libre Belgique_,"
"reminded ironically of his domestic infelicity, by enquiring"
whether he had brought Signor Toselli to conduct his orchestra--was
"original plank bearing the inscription, ""_Jesus, Nazarene King_,"" in"
"Hebrew, Greek and Latin, which was placed over his head; also one"
"of the nails used in his crucifixion, and two of the thorns of his"
crown; besides a large piece of the cross of the penitent thief who was
"executed with him; and, most interesting of all in some respects, the"
finger used by Thomas to resolve his doubts as to the resurrection of
Christ (John xx. 24-28).
[Sidenote: A Bottle of The Blood of Christ.]
"In Percy's _Romanism_ it is said that ""the list of relics on the right"
"of the apsis of S. Croce includes the finger of S. Thomas, apostle,"
with which he touched the most holy side of our Lord Jesus Christ; one
of the pieces of money with which the Jews paid the treachery of Judas;
great part of the veil and of the hair of the most blessed Virgin; a
"mass of cinders and charcoal united in the form of a loaf, with the fat"
"of S. Lawrence, martyr; one bottle of the most precious blood of our"
Lord Jesus Christ; another of the milk of the most blessed Virgin; a
little piece of the stone where Christ was born; a little piece of the
stone where our Lord sat when he pardoned Mary Magdalene; of the stone
where our Lord wrote the law given to Moses on Mount Sinai; of the
stone where reposed SS. Peter and Paul; of the cotton which collected
the blood of Christ; of the manna which fed the Israelites; of the rod
of Aaron which flourished in the desert; of the relics of the eleven
"prophets!""[11]"
But our party saw none of these except the finger of Thomas. It is
"to be hoped that the others have been withdrawn from exhibition, for"
"surely superstition and vulgarity can no further go. I fear, however,"
"that those who are willing to pay enough can still see ""one bottle of"
"the most precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,"" and ""another of the"
"milk of the most blessed Virgin""! There is also ""_una ampulla lactis"
"of later days, Sir William Hamilton, whose monumental learning created"
"him a reputation while still an undergraduate. Sir Roundell Palmer,"
"afterwards Lord Selborne, was a contemporary of Ferrier's at Oxford;"
Sheriff Campbell Smith was at the bar of the House of Lords acting as
"Palmer's junior the day after Ferrier's death, and Sir Roundell told"
him that he remembered Ferrier well at College; he described him as
"'careless about University work,' but as writing clever verses, several"
of which he repeated with considerable gusto. Of other friends the
"names alone are preserved, William Edward Collins, afterwards"
"Collins-Wood of Keithick, Perthshire, who died in 1877, and J. P."
"Shirley of Ettington Park, in Warwickshire;[3] but what influences were"
"brought to bear upon him by his University life, or whether his"
interest in philosophical pursuits were in any way aroused during his
"time at College, we have no means of telling. A later friend, Henry"
"Inglis, wrote of these early days: 'My friendship with Ferrier began"
"about the time he was leaving Oxford, or immediately after he had left"
it--I should say about 1830 or thereabout. At that University I don't
think he did anything more remarkable than contracting a large tailor's
bill; which annoyed him for many years afterwards. At that time he was
"a wonderfully handsome, intellectual-looking young man,--a tremendous"
"""swell"" from top to toe, and with his hair hanging down over his"
shoulders.' Though later on in life this last characteristic was not so
"marked, Ferrier's photographs show his hair still fairly long and"
"brushed off a finely-modelled square forehead, such as is usually"
associated with strongly developed intellectual faculties.
"[2] The gentlemen-commoners at Magdalen, as elsewhere, paid"
higher fees and wore a distinctive costume; at Magdalen they
"had a common room of their own, distinct from that of the"
"Fellows, or the Demies or Scholars, and seldom read for"
honours. In Ferrier's days Magdalen College admitted no
"ordinary commoners, and there were but few resident"
instruction which he received. He kept up his friendship with the sons
"of his instructor as years went on, and always expressed himself as"
deeply attached to the place where a happy childhood had been passed.
"Nor was learning apparently neglected, for Ferrier began his Latin"
"studies at Ruthwell, and there first learned--an unusual lesson for so"
"young a boy--to delight in the reading of the Latin poets, and of"
"Virgil and Ovid in particular. After leaving Ruthwell, he attended the"
"High School of Edinburgh, the great Grammar School of the metropolis,"
"which was, however, soon to have a rival in another day school set up"
in the western part of the rapidly growing town; and then he was sent
"to school at Greenwich, where he was placed under the care of Dr."
"Burney, a nephew of the famous Fanny Burney, afterwards Madame"
"d'Arblay. From school, as the manner of the time was, the boy passed to"
"the University of Edinburgh at the age of seventeen,--older really than"
"was customary in his day,--and here he remained for the two sessions"
"1825-26 and 1826-27, or until he was old enough to matriculate at"
"Oxford. At Edinburgh, Ferrier distinguished himself in the class of"
"Moral Philosophy, and carried off the prize of the year for a poem"
which was looked upon as giving promise of literary power afterwards
fulfilled. His knowledge of Latin and Greek were considered good (the
"standard might not have been very high), but in mathematics he was"
nowhere. At Oxford he was entered in 1828 as a 'gentleman-commoner' at
"Magdalen College, the College of his future father-in-law, John Wilson."
A gentleman-commoner of Magdalen in the earlier half of the century is
"not suggestive of severe mental exercise,[2] and from the very little"
one can gather from tradition--for contemporaries and friends have
naturally passed away--James Ferrier was no exception to the common
"rule. That he rode is very clear; the College was an expensive one,"
and he was probably inclined to be extravagant. Tradition speaks of
his pelting the deer in Magdalen Park with eggs; but as to further
"distinction in more intellectual lines, record does not tell. In this"
"respect he presents a contrast to his predecessor at Oxford, and friend"
resemblance to his mother's. And his close connection with the Wilson
family had the result of bringing the young man into association with
"whatever was best in literature and art. While yet a boy, we are told,"
he sat upon Sir Walter's knee; the Ettrick Shepherd had told him tales
and recited Border ballads; while Lockhart took the trouble to draw
"pictures, as he only could, to amuse the child."
In surroundings such as these James Frederick Ferrier was born on the
"16th day of June 1808, his birthplace being Heriot Row, in the new town"
of Edinburgh--a street which has been made historic to us by the
"recollections of another child who lived there long years afterwards,"
and who left the grey city of his birth to die far off in an island in
the Pacific. But of Ferrier's child-life we know nothing: whether he
"played at 'tig' or 'shinty' with the children in the adjoining gardens,"
"or climbed Arthur's Seat, or tried to scale the 'Cats' Nick' in the"
"Salisbury Crags close by; or whether he was a grave boy, 'holding at'"
"his lessons, or reading other books that interested him, in preference"
to his play. Ferrier did not dwell on these things or talk much of his
"youth; or if he did so, his words have been forgotten. What we do"
know are the barest facts: that his second name was given him in
"consideration of his father's friendship with Lord Frederick Campbell,"
"Lord Clerk Register of Scotland; that his first name, as is usual in"
"Scotland for an elder son, was his paternal grandfather's; and that he"
"was sent to live with the Rev. Dr. Duncan, the parish minister of"
"Ruthwell, in Dumfriesshire, to receive his early education. Dr. Duncan"
"of Ruthwell was a man of considerable ability and energy of character,"
"though not famous in any special sphere of learning. He is well known,"
"however, in the south of Scotland as the originator of Savings Banks"
"there, and his works on the Seasons bear evidence of an interest in the"
natural world. At anyrate the time passed in Dumfriesshire would appear
to have left pleasant recollections; for when Ferrier in later life
"alluded to it, it was with every indication of gratitude for the"
Yeah.

He's good with the boys.
He likes my mother.
He likes your mother?
Sober?
Go figure.
Pain in the ass.
"Well, you know, if I don't like him, this whole thing is off."
Right.
Seriously.
Okay.
"Better, right?"
You know it's better.
"Mmm, mmm."
Fuck ratings.
I don't care about ratings.
"Well, that's easy to say..."
Stay up.
Stay up!
- Most home runs?
- Most home runs?
Hank Aaron beats Babe Ruth.
That's nothing.
That's an easy one.
Here we go.
Are you ready?
"Okay, we got it."
We got it.
"All right, come here."
- You gotta push your leg out.
Ready?
- I can't feel....
"It's okay, I'll help you."
"All right, here we go."
"All right, buddy."
It's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
"All right, listen, give me your hands."
You gotta hold on right here.
Hold on with both hands.
You hold on!
You gotta keep your head up above water.
Do you understand?
"- Yes, you do."
- I can't....
- I can't hold....
- I'll knock out these hinges.
- I can't.
Thanks.
- Nice isn't it?
- Yes.
Can we go out and try?
Yes?
Yes?
What is it?
- Can you help us?
- Yes.
What is it about?
- Are you a priest?
"- No, I'm the sexton."
Where is the priest?
He is not here.
- Can we call him?
- Yes.
Of course that's possible.
You can go with us to the police station?
And talk to the agent and explain to him?
No problem.
Open the door!
Get out!
Come one!
Thanks.
Don't you owe me any explanation?
It was all a little bit too much.
The accident.
The divorce.
What is this?
What is this?
Where is our mother?
I'm going crazy.
[Grunts]
Jab out.
Always jab out.
"When you get in trouble, just jab out."
"No, you're telegraphing those kicks."
You're staring right at his leg that you're kicking.
"Jab, jab."
Constantly moving.
"Jab, jab, jab, jab."
Ah.
Hips.
Hips.
Get out of there.
Hips.
"All right, all right, all right."
- Fuck!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Fuck.
- Relax.
Just relax.
"Stop saying ""fuck."""
"Jay, show her how to do it."
Show her how to chamber the kick.
Jay:
See how the knee comes off?
This is the only part I'm worried about.
Turn it.
There you go.
Take a little distance.
Get in.
I saw you both!
Open up right now!
You can't do this to me!
Open up!
Right now!
What are you doing?
It's the middle of the night.
Who are you?
"- No, I'm fine."
Go away.
- Go where?
She has a lot built up inside her.
Let's stay quiet for a bit.
I'm just here to look for a friend.
"Alright, I'll be quiet."
Your friend is in this room?
"Then, why are you screaming?"
Everyone's in bed at this hour.
You have to be quiet.
"Okay, sir, I'm sorry."
It's empty.
Come on over.
"Here, take this."
"- Careful, careful."
- Okay.
Slowly.
Oh no.
"Good, good."
Go ahead.
"Quiet, quiet."
Where am I?
Where is this?
(screaming)
"Get off her, let go, let go!"
Pang!
I've been waiting for you!
Get him!
Listen.
Spare my life.
"Last time I spared you, you didn't learn."
It's not my idea.
I disobeyed orders.
Who's orders?
Talk!
We're all hired.
Who by then?
"Lun, Lun Sanye."
(groaning)
(whipping)
(going ringing)
The great whip.
Good.
Great whip.
That's some great throwing.
But I'll never be able to do anything as good as he does.
Sanye!
What's wrong?
"Wide-Eye, Tiger-Wang and Playboy, all of them killed by that young kid!"
What?
Where is he now?
"He's out front, fighting like mad with our men."
Let's go.
No.
Like this.
They massacred us and destroyed our beans.
I heard it the other way.
That's because the victors get to tell the story.
(GRUNTS)
Okay!
Stop!
Here.
See?
I'm not the bad guy.
Maybe you are telling the truth.
It doesn't really matter.
I have to go.
Are there any more of you?
No.
I'm alone.
What's this?
Is this a bean?
Can this make a portal?
Not anymore.
It was destroyed like the rest of them.
I wear it as a reminder.
A reminder that you're all killers.
You're wrong.
- (LOUD CLANKING)
- GIANT:
Aah!
(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTS)
(CLATTERS)
GIANT:
Go.
Why?
So let 'em wait.
Get rid of the cigar.
- Why?
- Because I said so.
That was a new cigar.
You stay here.
"If anything happens, whistle."
- Whistle?
- Don't you understand?
- What's wrong?
- Let me outta here!
Hey!
Shut up!
Let me out!
I gotta get outta here!
I want out!
I gotta get out!
Out of the way!
"Come on, let's go!"
That's not one of ours!
- It's a different car!
- Someone squealed on us!
Looks like the police!
Police?
Push him out!
- He won't squeal on us again!
- He'll slow down the cops.
I told you he'd be trouble.
"What was that, Karl?"
It's an awful road.
You can't see a thing.
- Who's there?
Aah!
You're dead!
"You better not touch me, Sonny Curley!"
I've witnesses!
What did you do to him?
Nothing!
I just gave him a piece of advice!
I dare ya.
I bleeding' dare ya.
I told him to stop fiddling' with himself... when he thought there was no one looking!
I'll batter you!
Sorry.
You'll have to make an appointment.
You're dead!
Is that a fact?
Very interesting.
Shut up!
You're dead.
I'm telling Ma!
If you tell Ma...
Where you going?
Piss off!
Don't!
You're what?
You heard me.
"Oh, my Jesus."
"You're pregnant, you said?"
Yeah.
"That's lovely, that is."
You sure?
Yeah.
Sort of.
"Okay, guys, we'll let him go and take her."
Out!
I'm also poor.
That's not true.
"She owns a ten story building, a farm and livestock."
That's enough!
- We'll take her.
- Yes...
"And you, douche bag, take off your pants."
"Yes, yes."
I'll take them off right away...
- I can't.
- Why not?
I crapped myself.
Drop your pants.
Now!
Faster!
Pig!
Wimp!
Put on the hood.
- No!
"- Put on the hood, bitch."
- No!
- Dammit...
Let go of me!
Help her down.
We are gentlemen.
We won't do anything to a woman.
"Come on, get out."
Count to one hundred and take off the hood.
Let's go!
Miss...
- No.
"I'll wait here, okay?"
- Hi.
- Hi.
Would you like to come in?
"I mean, please come in."
Thanks.
I don't know what to say.
It's a little new to me.
For me too.
Didn't you know I existed?
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't say sorry.
You're the only one who can't be blamed.
- Would you like a Coke?
"- Yes, please."
I think we've got one here.
- There aren't any more.
Some water?
- That's fine.
- He's nice...
Christian.
"- Yes, Christian."
He's waiting in the car.
- Mom said you were dead.
"- Well, okay."
But apparently I'm not.
Would you like a glass?
It's a little tight.
It needs a...
How long are you staying?
Do you have time to meet?
Master Huang!
Where?
Where is he?
She was just calling you.
"Yes, I'm here!"
That's my wallet!
Here!
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Can you go out with Master Huang?
"Sure, but don't too night."
I'll make you look like Master.
Liang Foon!
Master!
It's hot in this.
You've got to look smart for your date.
What if we fail?
Don't worry!
Keep your cool!
I'll give you a chance to save her.
How?
The masked killer that you most scared at will appear to-night.
Huang...you want to hit me?
No.
I was trying to get this mosquito.
Don't be afraid...
Let me teach him a lesson.
Ward me off!
Kick me!
How?
A kick below the belt!
You've kicked at the wrong place.
Or we miss our chance to cross.
Please.
You have to.
Please.
Please.
- I like those.
- Huh?
They make you look younger.
listen.
okay?
I got a long ride for some good money... we're gonna get outta here.
We're gonna drive down to Yelapa.
We're gonna get ourselves a boat.
And we're gonna go live on the ocean.
Will you be safe there?
Yeah.
We'll be safe.
Charles.
Be back in a few days.
Shit.
- Logan.
- Yeah?
What happened?
Did something go wrong?
The job was wrong to begin with.
Logan!
Logan!
What?
Who does this belong to?
Who's that?
Thought you were supposed to see shit coming.
I can track mutants.
- Why did you do it?
- He was blackmailing Mumsie...
- Ethel!
"Good night, Constable."
- Good night.
"Once he's in the pond, we'll go to the barge and destroy the cabinet's contents."
- Can't we do it without killing him?
- Of course not.
He'd just hide himself away and write it all over again.
Of course we must kill him.
Whoops!
Steady.
We mustn't hurt him.
"Come along, Ethel."
Give us a hand.
Come along!
We'll tip him out from here.
"Come along, Ethel."
Right.
Up.
There!
Give him a pull.
Come on.
Botheration!
He's stuck.
You'll have to launch him!
"Come along, Ethel!"
Shh!
You'll wake him!
Shh!
"Hurry, girl."
Hurry!
"I was in the blouse, too!"
"She was there, too."
I see.
That's all right.
"You aren't hurt, are you?"
"I'll tell you, if I'm hurt."
She'll tell us.
Let me take a look.
What are you doing?
Will she cook for me?
What misbehaviour is this!
Go away!
Just go away...!
Don't forget!
I own the place!
And you owe me the rent!
And you're driving me out!
Don't misunderstand me!
What do they consider guests to be in India?
They're called guests!
Yes.
That's right!
Yes!
Guests are like God!
Yes.
You're right!
"So, what is it?"
I've got to know your secret.
Really?
What secret?
You're not a dance assistant alone.
Joseph and I share the secret now.
Have you ever waited tables?
But it can't be that hard.
please.
Thanks.
You can start tomorrow?
You want a drink?
Come on.
Beer?
Their daughter died.
– She was 15.
– That's horrible.
you're at the right place.
Do you know a place where I could stay?
Stay here until you find something better.
It will be fine.
Thanks.
I'll let you unpack.
You want a drink?
I don't think this is a good idea.
Here.
Cheers.
I'm gonna go.
Just relax.
What is it?
Camille is here.
What?
She says she loves you.
She misses you.
She misses Léna too.
What happened to her wasn't your fault.
Tell her I love her.
She's gone.
It could end up being a hit.
We'll see.
Step by step.
"Yes, step by step."
So...
"Good night, Yitzhak."
Good night.
Get up.
Daddy.
What's wrong?
- Why didn't you get up?
What time is it?
Five after ten.
I gave you the alarm clock.
I forgot to set it.
"We're late, that's not good."
"No, it's not."
Get up.
Good morning.
"Please tell Alex we're running a bit late, we'll be right there, I just can't get a cab."
"It's Goni, Yitzhak Ben-Shmuel's daughter, I'm sorry."
Yes.
"Okay, then don't bother Alex about it."
"Okay, we'll be right there."
What are you doing?
I have to take my pills.
Come on!
Would you please hurry up?
I'm almost ready.
All I need is my shoes.
Alex.
Goni.
"Happy Birthday, Linda!"
"Oh, it is my birthday..."
"Don't worry, I'm gonna get you out of here."
Yay!
And then I'm gonna eat you.
No...!
Shush!
Where is she?
She should be out there by now!
Who's that?
I don't know... it's too early for Ethan to come back.
Aah!
I'm not decent!
Come back later!
Thank you!
I must use the kerplunker!
There's a line for the other one.
Make it fast.
"Don't tell me, make it fast."
Just go.
"Don't tell me, just go."
Just da... ah...
Make some noise.
Sing songs or something.
"Look, look..."
look at the legs on the glass.
You see the legs?
I see fe... it looks like feet.
"Oh, Linda."
"You're such a sweet, simple person."
Thanks.
"Wait, what?"
Under duress.
Please hold.
"Blackleg Miner, what's going on?"
Terminal was compromised.
What's your status?
Terminal secure.
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Numbers secure?
Of course.
That's all that matters.
Yeah.
And the girl?
All assets retired.
She's dead?
Yes.
"All right, then."
Get out!
Get out of the car!
"Hey, don't shoot, don't shoot."
I got money.
I don't want your fucking money.
Help me get her in the car.
We gotta get into town.
We need to get to a hospital.
- What happened to her?
- She's shot?
- Shot?
Out here?
- Help me!
Help me get her in.
"Okay, come on."
"Come on, come on, come on."
- I'll be fine.
- You come with me.
You first.
I'm right behind you.
Miss Voss.!
Miss Voss.!
"Okay, stay down."
"Oh, you're a lucky girl."
You're a lucky girl.
Just get behind the door there.
Just get right behind the door there.
We will take care of him.
Don't worry.
"Boy, I hope he tries something now."
"Come on, Hammond."
Just give me one reason.
"Way to go, Jack."
Way to go.
"Come on, Hammond!"
You're in a no-win situation!
Put your hands out of the car where I can see them!
"- Stand up, Hammond.!"
Stand up.!
- Get up.!
"Turn around, turn around.!"
Turn around.!
Hands on your head.!
On your head.!
You know the drill.
- You got him?
You got him.
"- We got you now, my friend."
What was the matter with you?
"I don't know, exactly... but..."
I need help.
Don't go any closer.
Why?
"What is it, Tony?"
"Tony, stop it!"
"Stop it, Tony, stop it!"
Exert a force greater than hers.
"Why are you doing this, Tony?"
Stop.
Crush her.
Kill her!
Crush her!
Crush her!
Crush her!
Finish her!
Now!
Tia.
Where are we?
What's happened?
Tony.
"Tony, we can still do it."
We can still make use of molecular control.
"OK, doc, let's do it."
Letha!
"Why don't we all go and have some... some candy and, uh, sodas and ice cream?"
Next time...
- ...next time I'll...
- Forget it.
I've lost my faith in science.
Sickle!
"This is going to be great, he'll get such a kick from this."
"Good stuff, Dermot."
Are you ready and settled?
Yeah.
Sid?
Yeah.
"Hi, Sid, how are you?"
"All right, yeah."
"I know we haven't met, I'm Dermot."
"Good, good."
You're the new lad?
I am.
"I'm Dermot, how are you?"
Good.
Good to meet you.
Yeah.
It's your last day.
Is it?
Yeah.
"No, it's not."
"No, shall I..."
"You're leaving, aren't you?"
You what?
"You're leaving and Sleet said I've got to sort of like, you know, just give you a surprise and give you presents for your daughter."
"Well, I'm not..."
There we go.
Wonderful.
"OK, then he's written some words for you."
"Yeah, go on."
"Yeah, this'll be good."
What?
Go on.
- I would do bad things.
- I do not believe.
You're only a child.
Have to believe me.
My brother worked for a very long time.
You know.
Always been interested in him ...
I like that.
I love you.
- I do not believe.
- But it's true.
- Where is my brother?
- Good question.
"This, we also want to know."
We believe that some kind of trouble.
"Us, we found him want to help?"
- Okay.
- Fine.
- Cookie?
Here you go.
- Milk.
I need to find a statue.
In this sculpture.
A very special statue.
Angel?
Have you seen anything like this before?
- Yes.
- Well done to you.
"- Where, honey?"
Where did you see?
One church.
-Dad.
- Can you feel me squeezing your hand?
- A little.
Good.
All right.
Now all you gotta do is just think warm thoughts.
You gotta think Hawaii and you gotta think the Sahara Desert.
You gotta think about....
Come here!
Come on!
You listen to me.
You gotta stay awake!
"You gotta stay awake for me, all right?"
Okay.
All right?
- I'm so tired.
- I know that.
Why don't we just sing a song.
"- You know songs, don't you?"
- No.
"All right, yeah."
Yeah.
"How about ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game""?"
"All right, listen."
Come here.
I've gotta get some help.
- No!
Don't go.
Don't!
- It's okay.
"Please, don't."
"You gotta sing as loud as you can, so I can hear you."
All right?
"I know, I know, I got it."
No phones inside.
"Hey, if it were up to me, I couldn't care less."
Gone.
Done.
Okay?
Should be out by now.
Yeah.
Probably just got a last-minute broadcast.
What?
Nothing.
One sec.
No...
I can't hear.
Okay.
Eardrums.
"- Stay quiet, okay?"
- Okay.
Stay quiet.
Stay here.
"Be quiet, okay?"
Katherine.
- We're clear.
- Are you sure?
We'd know by now if somebody else were in here.
Whose hand is that?
I don't know.
- Can you hear?
- Yeah.
"If they know the code from before, they're gonna come back in."
They're gonna use it again.
"No, the codes change with every shift."
You should have let me break your arm.
Help!
Let go of me!
Help!
- So you're not seeing anyone?
- Nobody regular.
- Why?
- Would you like to?
Maybe.
How about going down to the car?
On your front.
Not anal.
You whore.
You're hurting me.
You bastard.
My pleasure.
I want to report a rape.
- 26000.
- I expected it'd be more.
Thursdays are never that full.
- Have you seen Sofie?
- She OD'ed on X.
The ambulance came.
- Which hospital?
- Bispebjerg.
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
Hello?
"Hi, mummy."
I'm in a bit of a rush.
"No, my birthday was yesterday."
"Yes, I'm sure."
How's Tetty?
Be careful.
"Let's find those parts, okay?"
Okay!
We're going.
It's okay.
I'll do it.
You mean your Mom will...
Thanks for having us.
Um...
It's kinda dark.
I'll walk you home.
Really?
Don't bother.
She lives near me.
"Misaki, let's go!"
"Okay, I'll come back soon."
"Bye, Tetty."
See ya.
An unexpected rival appears...
His chances are good.
Yusuki is on the defensive...
Get lost!
"Ooh, I'm scared."
Why get in the way?
"They're so soppy, it makes me puke."
Really?
Really what?
What're you saying?
Don't you like her as well?
"Childhood friends, blossoming into more..."
No way!
We can't live with that.
We should have done what Connor was saying all along.
Play dead.
Go on offence.
Go on offence.
"Blair, I know what you're thinking, but I am putting you first."
"If we don't stop them, we'll never be safe."
"No, I know."
We have to do the right thing.
Hey guys.
Look.
"I know you don't have any reason to trust me right now, but, I think I have a plan."
We should pull a heist on them.
Shit.
What happened?
Tripped.
"Oh, go go go."
Blair.
Okay.
Shit.
First door.
Connor.
Open the door.
I don't know.
Don't just stand there.
C'mon.
Open the door.
Wrong door.
"Wrong door, Connor."
C'mon.
I'm trying.
Hurry.
"Oh, OK."
"See you later, Tone."
"Bye, Tony."
Bye.
Fuck!
Take this.
It's stuff.
Maps and shit.
OK.
"You look really good, Tony."
Like you're ready for anything.
Thanks.
See you later.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
"A bloke, he wakes up one morning."
He gets dressed.
He goes down the stairs.
He makes himself a little bit of breakfast.
"He walks to the garage, he gets in his car."
He starts his car.
"Drives off, I don't know, a couple of miles."
Stops.
Gets out his car.
Has a couple of blokes pour petrol over his head and...
Sets fire to himself.
He...
What?
He sets fire to himself.
Fucking boom!
What's in the bag?
My sandwiches.
So what we got?
This is your pass.
Where are we going?
Let's go!
Wait!
Come!
Good morning.
"Minmin, you're late."
Who's this?
This is Rin.
Rin Sakurazawa.
I'm here to observe your practice.
Grade?
An SIU student?
Ever played lacrosse?
I will play lacrosse.
So you'll learn Shaolin Kung Fu.
"""ShaoIin Kung Fu""?"
What is it?
It's a martial art.
This is weird.
"What's ""a martial art""?"
Like kendo?
Or karate?
"I've heard about ShaoIin, but..."
I think it's geeky.
It's not!
What do you wear?
I hate ugly uniforms.
Is it practiced outside?
Even the UV creams don't help anymore.
I bought a good moisturizer.
Show us!
- Fuck from there!
"I inference here, or he dies!"
Did you hear me?
!
Bring me a car!
S.ktirip go from here!
"Jesus Christ, John!"
- John ...
- What are you waiting for?
You can not do!
"God damn it, John!"
No!
Let me go!
Let me go!
- John!
- Get off of me this wicked guy!
Damn!
Jesus Christ.
- Took my gun!
- Do you eat out of my mind?
!
- Are too!
Officially the head eaten.
"- That's it, John!"
- I heard he had in his hand the quality of goods.
- Are you Searching for?
- If you is good.
- Let us go to my office.
"Here you go, chief."
- Before you why do not you?
- I do not use.
- Do you hear that?
Pastures new?
No?
"Anyway, I'm leaving this behind."
Do you want to take it?
What is it?
It's a gramophone.
"Go on, take it."
Who have I to give it to?
No-one.
You.
It's for you.
It's new.
"There's a record in it, Happiness Street."
I'm singing on it.
"All right, Sal?"
What's this?
I'm sailing to Canada.
I've brought him this.
Right.
"I'll send you my address, shall I?"
"Well, I will."
"Jimmy, go and get washed."
"And remember, always hold a record by its edges."
Yes?
"Is this all right, Mam?"
Yeah.
Go on.
"Well, I'll probably not see you."
No.
You know how I'm fixed.
Yeah.
Is she going with you?
You can't face the world?
Why not?
You think I'm a traitor like you!
Traitor?
Help me break his chain.
What chains?
"These chains, of course."
"Gosh, it's broken already!"
Why didn't you tell me before?
What a waste of time!
I should have left you sleep away!
Where's Hiroshima?
B must have chased him into a secret passage!
How do we get in?
I always manage.
Let me try!
Open sesame...!
I get it...!
You can't get me!
"Hiroshima, don't run!"
Bi Boo...!
Bridget!
Bi Boo!
Bi Boo!
What does she mean by that?
A mechanical chair!
Open sesame...!
That's out of fashion.
Watch this.
Bi Boo is the latest password!
Watch me!
Bi Boo!
Which dude?
- That dude?
- Yeah.
No way.
He'd kick my ass.
True that.
"This is so hard, you know?"
Yeah.
I know.
It's simple.
"If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you."
It's in the Constitution.
Constitution of America?
So go ahead and ask.
- Are you a cop?
- Not like that.
"Ask it, like, official."
Are you a police officer?
No.
I am not a police officer.
"Okay, then."
175 for a teenth.
"The price is the price, yo."
All right.
There you go.
Enjoy.
"Thanks, man."
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest!
Get on the ground!
Get on your stomach now!
"On your stomach, get on the ground!"
He can not get away from us.
There is the informer!
I can see him.
Yes.
Two shots to the head should be enough.
- Here they come.
- We necks him inside the toilet.
"You bastard, Wagner."
Now necks we need you!
"Stand still, Frank Wagner!"
Moving on!
Moving on!
Come on!
Hey!
Back!
Back!
Let him kill the pig!
Could not have waited a little longer?
- Have you seen the Russians?
- I saw them on the other side.
- Shit!
- Beware!
Femmanhuset!
Give me the gun!
Lasse van.
Turn on the laser.
Downwardly.
There.
Nak is a bitch.
Matched.
Hands over your head!
"Frank, I'm out on seven to eight years."
"Yeah, I skated away and called you a big baby."
"Sophie threw a rock at me and you yelled, ""you're so gay."""
I did do that.
"Oh, didn't I?"
We used to use that word a lot.
You used to be able to call anything gay.
Ugh.
Do you ever miss that?
- No.
- No.
That's hurtful.
Yeah.
"I'm sorry, Mitchell."
"You were scared, and I should've held your hand through the tunnel, and I was..."
I was not a good big sister.
I'm so sorry.
Will you forgive me?
"- Yes, yes."
- You do?
- Yes!
I forgive you.
- I love you.
"- Love you, too."
- Love you!
"- Okay, okay."
- Okay.
- Let's do this.
"- Yes, let's do this."
- Come on.
- What?
What's happening?
"No, no, no, we're going..."
You're crazy.
"You can go [bleep] off, Chef Ramsay."
We are so [bleep].
He's gonna eat us alive.
This will be the hardest...
You guys are useless!
I wanted to slap his ass.
[bleep] off!
fiercest...
Shut your [bleep] mouth!
I'm fine!
I'm just so pissed.
You'd better start listening.
I don't want to hear [bleep]!
How dare you?
"Fight back, young man."
Come on!
Come here!
wildest...
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
sexiest...
D-a-m-n.
Damn!
I'm just gonna completely
Pop out of my shirt.
"Like, goodness, gracious!"
and most rewarding season yet.
Yay!
Yeah!
I like winning.
and that's just the beginning.
You're a donkey!
"Yeah, Jacob!"
- Fuck.
- Jacob!
- Jacob!
"You all right, man?"
"Dude, take the helmet off."
"Dude, you hit that corner way too fast."
"- Yeah, no shit."
- Shut up.
- Come on.
Get up.
Get up.
I'm going again.
- Are you sure?
"- Yeah, I just fucking..."
I turned too quick.
"- So, uh, talk to Lauren yet?"
"- Yeah, I talked to her yesterday."
- So what'd she say?
- I don't know.
- Y'all dating?
- Yeah.
- Since when?
- Since yesterday.
- Where'd you guys go?
- We really didn't go anywhere.
"Went to her house, but..."
"- What do you mean, nowhere?"
- It's... nowhere.
- Wait.
"So you haven't been on a real date yet, but you're dating?"
"- Yes, it's been one day."
I might be back of house.
"Wrong gift, then?"
Good luck.
Hena.
Thanks.
"I plan to forget everything that happened here, too."
Goodbye.
Later.
May I come in?
It's open.
I'm coming in.
"Hello, I'm Ilia, nice to meet..."
Don't turn the light on.
But...
Leave it off.
Okay.
I need to call the office first.
"Sir, would you like a one-hour or two-hour session?"
It's up to you.
"A two-hour session, then?"
Sure.
Great.
"I'm here, it'll be a two-hour session."
"Yes, got it."
Would you wear that eye mask?
I don't like being seen.
This?
Okay.
Will you give me the body shampoo?
Not easy washing you without seeing you.
Let me wash you.
"Is it you, Chong-su?"
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...
Over here.
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
"Hey, we need to get her to a hospital."
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
Come to the front desk.
Yes or no?
We're here.
"Fine, we don't have to."
You're leaving?
Not like I'm desperate for girls.
Nice shot.
You suck.
Watch and learn.
"""Hello dear I have to work overnight"""
"""so please take Miki to day care tomorrow."""
Hey.
Feel how hard I am.
Your room's ready.
Go ahead.
Excuse me.
Here.
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, and this too."
What's wrong?
The cleaning lady...
She looks familiar.
"She's not your neighbor, is she?"
"If she is, we're in trouble."
"Darn, where have I seen her?"
What if we're caught?
"Hey, hey..."
I don't care anymore.
"So you can't pay up, huh?"
Maybe call the police.
She doesn't even have an ID on her.
She can't pay.
"Riley, you want your gun back?"
Yeah.
You can have it if you go first.
Are you sure?
Deal?
Let's just get this over with.
"Hey, you know who always dies first in these situations?"
The black guy.
What the fuck is this place?
What is that?
Blair.
"Sorry, sorry."
You still do that?
She laughs when she's scared.
"Dude, I thought it was a ghost."
Really?
A ghost?
"I'm afraid of ghosts, okay."
"Riley, keep going."
"Okay, okay, okay."
Wait a second.
What?
What do you think are behind these doors?
"Oh, you know."
"Cleaning supplies, toilet paper."
Really?
No!
Not really.
"Connor, sssh."
You idiot.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm your crew.
He seems to...
"Well, he has..."
- a female.
- A female?
!
Cedric!
"Why, you brazen hussy!"
- Good heavens.
They're asleep!
"- Mumsie, look!"
Sergeant...
"The police, they found out!"
They've doped themselves.
We may still get away.
"- Mumsie, look!"
His moustache!
- They're onto us all right.
He's a plain-clothes brute disguised as an ordinary policeman.
We must get an earlier plane.
Stand guard while I finish packing.
- What's this for?
- To crown him with if he wakes.
- No!
"- In for a penny, in for a pound."
(Screams) No!
No!
Another?
!
Who is he?
- It's him!
- Him?
- It's him!
the way you tell the story.
Funny how?
What's funny about it?
you got it all wrong.
Anthony how?
you know.
You're funny.
Let me understand this.
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.
how?
Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
funny?
How am I funny?
how you tell a story.
I don't know.
You said it.
You said I'm funny.
How am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny!
Tommy.
Motherfucker!
I almost had him!
you!
was he shaking?
Henry.
You may fold under questioning!
What's with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.
You keep it away!
It burns!
"Oh, it burns!"
Who are you?
No one.
Who are you?
"She's, she's all right."
"I don't want to talk about it, okay?"
"Okay, I'll talk to you."
"I'll call as soon as it's over, all right?"
"No, I just, I'm going through something and I just have to...."
"No, no...."
There's nothing.
"Hey, thanks a lot."
-Want a drink?
-Please.
What do you drink?
Scotch.
Ice and water.
No ice.
I'll get some from the kitchen.
That's all right.
I'll take it straight.
Please sit.
Where's her father?
In Europe.
-Have you told him what's happening?
-No.
"Well, I think you should."
I told Regan that was holy water.
I sprinkled it on her and she reacted very violently.
It's tap water.
Let me work!
You're always working.
When do I tickle you then?
This sieve is steaming hot!
It could hurt you.
"Well, dear?"
What are you doing here?
I came here for a soft-drink.
What are you messing with the refrigerator for?
I want a fruity.
"It's over, I say."
Go away.
I want one!
Go away!
"Didn't I warn you, dear?"
You've burnt your hand now.
"Look what has happened, Mom!"
"Don't disturb me, Bharti."
Let me work.
Aunty!
See what's wrong with Bharti.
So what's wrong?
What happened?
Kaushalya has burnt my hand.
"Burnt you, did she?"
!
But what happened?
"She burnt Banwa first and then me, too."
Banwa?
What was he doing there?
He was only tickling her.
I see.
What's been happening?
- What's been happening?
"- Oh, some of the girls aren't feeling good."
- You're kidding.
Which girls?
- One
- One passed away.
Max passed away.
And he was my best friend.
- Did you know about that?
"- Yeah, you told me."
Yeah.
"- So, does it make you feel sad?"
- Pardon?
- Are you sad?
- Of course.
I will always miss Max.
Of course you will.
Come.
We'll sit here.
Yeah.
"So, um, what hap - How did this happen?"
I don't know.
What are you feeling now?
- What am I feeling?
- Yeah.
How are you feeling?
- I don't feel very good since then.
- No?
How do you feel?
It
- It struck me.
I have problems with food in my house.
"Could you ask aunty to cook for me, too?"
How could I do that?
You don't have to cook!
Ask her to cook for me!
It's the same thing!
God!
She must have fallen!
I'll take a look!
Where to?
Aren't you ashamed to watch a woman bathing?
!
And where are you going?
"But I'm a girl, too."
Aunty's not a girl;
She's a woman!
Do something.
"You stand and watch, while she falls inside!"
I can't even watch...
the doors are shut.
Let me see...
Relax!
I'll ask her!
Aunty!
What has happened?
Nothing.
What fell inside?
It was my blouse.
A blouse?
Did a blouse make so much of noise?
!
Did a blouse make the noise?
He has a child.
"I know, but, come on, you've seen them together."
She's sort of lost her mind.
- This is her fault?
- It's nobody's fault.
It's just...
I don't know.
I think he just needs to talk to somebody.
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna be late.
- I'll be at my dad's till around 11:00.
- Okay.
"God, what's happening?"
Everyone around us is falling apart.
I know.
- Have fun.
- Thanks.
- Hi!
- I got this!
I don't need it!
"- Oh, my God!"
- My God!
"Oh, my God."
My top is totally clinging.
You can see everything.
"Don't worry, I promise I won't look."
Then I'll be insulted.
"- Well, I don't want to offend you."
"- Well, then."
Your top's wet.
Okay.
Where am I going?
-No.
"I'll go alone, I'll go alone."
"-No, I'll go with you."
"-No, I'll go by myself."
I'll go.
"No, I also have to get something."
"The recipe, so I can cook for you."
I'll go with you?
.
"Fine, it's up to you."
And tomorrow's your birthday!
You're already 28 years old!
What would you like me to cook for you?
It's up to you.
-No!
"Just tell me, I'll cook it for you."
-Anything.
What?
Anything you want.
"Sorry, I can't come later."
Joy said she's coming with me.
Okay then.
I'll find a way.
I really need to see you.
Yes...okay.
I'll just call you.
Yes.
Who were you talking to?
You heard it right?
"I was talking to mommy, I just asked how she's doing."
-Are you sure?
.
"Parfitt, you met."
Rising partner.
Delighted to have you on-board.
Report!
So what do you think?
Hm...father leaves a bad taste.
Dunkin says it's good though.
Aa..make him an uncle?
No.
Uncle Frank.
Yes.
Sassed in the hold.
Waits up in Dunkirk.
Double takes when he sees the stooges.
Gives us the laughs and takes the bullet in act 3.
Comic life.
Tragic death.
Tears all around.
Yeah.
"First mate, bloke in France, needs to be her boyfriend."
"No, it's Eric."
Either.
"Girls, what are they like?"
"Shy, quiet."
Really hardly spoke.
"One quite, one chatty."
They both quite.
Not if they want them in our dialogue.
How old are they?
Thirty.
Ah!
Marvelous.
Where is it?
Where's what?
"Look, when I get through working you over, you'll tell me where it is."
Or do you want to talk now?
"All right, I'll talk."
"Well, talk!"
How's Mama?
(GRUNTING)
This way.
I don't know what you're mad at me for!
"I didn't do anything to you, and I didn't do anything to your wife!"
No one ever double-crossed me.
No one living.
What do you want from me?
I know you have that diamond.
I put it in your pocket myself.
There's nothing in my...
Is this what you want?
"All right, here."
I don't want it.
Are we friends now?
BOB:
Wilbur!
Huh?
"Stop him, he's a crook!"
Hey!
"Hey, man!"
Man!
Man!
"Man, wait!"
"Mister, will you wait?"
They want...
I am.
It's just that you're sometimes...
What?
"I'll finish this quickly, OK?"
Here.
I put a vitamin pill in it.
A vitamin pill.
- Shall I let in a little light?
"- No, please don't!"
It's better this way.
- I wanted to ask you out.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- To dinner.
- To dinner?
- Don't you want to?
"- Yes, dinner."
OK.
It's you.
"- You don't like it, do you?"
"- No, it's different."
- You didn't even recognize me.
"- Sorry, I was daydreaming."
- Well?
Black coffee as always?
- Yeah.
What were you thinking about?
I forgot.
I think it was important.
- I know the feeling.
"- No, not like that."
- I have a problem here anyway.
- Yeah?
Tell me...
Where were you on Sept 3?
Sept 3?
I've been touring in China for the Asian Fight.
I just got back.
It was live on TV.
Sorry.
We made a mistake.
Sorry.
Jesus.
"Chairman, Don't be afraid?"
There's 10 of us.
He only has 7 bullets.
"Yes, chairman."
Don't be afraid!
Big mouth.
It's 15 bullets.
Get it?
Want one in you?
What about you?
No loyalty.
And you?
That was close...
You didn't do much to save me last night.
"But I almost died for you today, we're even."
"Bro, yours is a fake gun."
"We're friends, forget it."
Where are you sneaking off?
"You said you're sleepy, right?"
"You go back first, I'll dine with Lisa."
"You didn't sleep too, right?"
How embarrassing to fall asleep on the dinning table.
Which one?
"Over there, near the lady sitting on the steps."
You can't see much from here.
"Let's go up higher, I'll show you."
- Which way?
- This way.
Let's go.
Farzad.
Why don't you bring us back the soup bowl?
I'll return it.
I need it.
Who is that lady?
That lady there?
"No, the neighbour."
Mim Khamman.
What does that mean?
My aunt on my father's side.
"- Hello, engineer."
"- Hello, are you well?"
- How's your family?
- Very well.
- Who's that?
- My mother.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."
Are you Mr Hashemi's sister?
He sends his greetings.
He wasn't able to come.
I understand.
I'm at your service.
"Farzad, help them bring the gear in."
All right.
"He's in his crib, like you said."
"Well, you can't... you can't just walk out and leave him alone."
He's not alone.
He has you.
"Look, this isn't just about us."
We have a child.
You were hurt.
"And everyone thinks that maybe you need time, but Lucas doesn't care."
He needs you now.
"But... and if I'm gonna be a good father,"
I've gotta do what's best for him.
I can't fix you.
I can't... make you walk out the front door.
You have to do it yourself.
And I have to let you.
Ow!
Ow!
It's okay...
leave me alone!
Aah!
"Tammy, stop it!"
Ah!
Don't!
Leave me alone.
"I got her. 5 milligrams of lorazepam, now."
What happened?
I don't know.
It came out of nowhere.
No!
Mom's here.
Mom's here.
It hurts.
Just sleep!
Actually we can stop thinking...
Shit!
But her nail is broken!
Stop thinking of stop thinking already!
Excuse me.
The hell kind of machine?
"This heavy, who the hell can lift it?"
Damn!
Hey do you need any help?
I am coming for you.
I'm gonna get you.
You damn rash!
Wait.
Shit I forgot to turn on my cell phone.
Je
Damn it. 57 missed calls.
Did a client die?
What's up?
Sup?
Didn't you call me?
Never mind.
Never mind?
Just tell me why you called?
Nothing.
"The Girls Group's cover, I noticed a nail was broken."
But I already got Jerd to fix it.
So it's ok.
Hey!
You sent my work to Jerd.
That really sucks.
C'mon it was just a little job.
Are you OK?
"You, of all people, drive me home!"
- To ease my guilty conscience.
"- Oh, dear."
Everybody else was completely drunk.
Theo?
Go to sleep.
As the moisture flowed into droplets...
- Slaving away again?
- What?
What are you doing?
Surprise.
I moved out of my apartment.
- You agreed.
- I told you.
I had to talk to Laura first.
It's her house.
- But there's so much space here.
- Yeah...
But you're not very easy on her.
- What do you mean?
- You know.
"You don't like Laura, and you don't try to hide it."
That's mutual.
Exactly.
"A great basis, huh?"
Shit.
- You aren't pleased.
"- Yes, I am."
"Yes, I am."
Really.
"I'll talk to Laura later, OK?"
Slab.
What?
-There What you want to say.
I did not say you were bad.
You've already talked about.
I did not say you were bad.
You've already talked about.
Why not say again?
Slab.
I did not say you were bad.
I did not say that you are weak.
-Do you love me?
It's not about that.
"No, not about that!"
"No, it's not about that!"
-It's About it!
-Not!
-You did not answer me!
"Yes, I love you."
-When You love someone...
Amends.
Do not turn your back.
You have to be careful with that.
It may never get.
"I can not do this to work with you, Edward."
I can not keep doing this.
Susan.
You can not turn your back on problems all the time.
Come on.
Come on.
-Shit.
I told you I do not know.
- My kind of guy.
"- You are such an unfaithful, characterless woman..."
- Me?
Him?
"Dude, I swear."
Thank you so much.
What would have happened if you hadn't showed up.
"Sorry, sorry."
Shiv.
Nice to meet you.
It feels as if we go way back.
Me?
"No, people generally feel so."
But it isn't so.
"So, why are you being so intense?"
"Okay, we are childhood buddies."
Happy?
We are childhood buddies.
Happy?
Okay?
Sorted?
- Oh.
- Thanks.
- Aww.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
How cute!
You can buy her a drink but I'll be the one taking her home.
Guys?
It was a joke.
He gets serious very quickly.
"Just loosen up, okay?"
It's for the better.
"I'm tied down for a week, so I'll just stay put here and write."
"Mr. Director, you are wonderful."
Does it hurt?
A little.
"Damn it, this sucks."
Hello.
- Did you like the food yesterday?
"- Yes, it was delicious."
I'd like to order the soup again.
"Sure, but how's the movie director?"
He's still in pain.
- Hope he recovers soon.
- So do I.
- It'll be ready in a moment.
- Okay.
What's this?
"Oh, that?"
It's a cane.
Why?
Do you need it?
Is anyone using it?
We don't use it anymore.
My husband used it way back.
"If you need it, take it."
"Oh, thank you."
You're welcome.
- Hello.
- Hello.
"- Want some fried eggs, too?"
- Yes.
How many?
You know.
How do you say?
- Tail.
Do you want to taste it?
- No thanks.
But you have never tried it.
Assaggiala.
"- Probate, burglary."
You have never experienced it.
"- Monna, tell her to try it."
You have to taste it.
"Yes, is..."
But it hurts.
"- Thank you very much, but..."
She barked and tossed it.
She does not like the queue.
"I do not like it, but you're sitting on mine."
My dear friend.
Go straight and then left.
"Right, right."
"Sorry, right."
"Nice, huh?"
"Oh, fuck."
Louise?
Is it his version of the disciple?
"She takes, takes and takes, is not it, Mr. Lloyd?"
For what noble purpose?
"Good morning, Ludovic."
- My jacket.
Thing?
- My jacket.
Thing?
He's got a gun.
Bobbi?
-Shit!
"Shoot him, Toni!"
"Come back, you little bastard!"
Yes.
Yes.
"No, please."
Are you okay?
'll Repent for this.
I repent now.
I'm a Catholic.
I do not believe in abortion.
I'm so sorry.
I feel so useless.
You are all but useless.
You always know what to do.
Thank you.
I think I will never be able to look Edward
After what I did to his child.
He will never know.
What did I do?
What did I do?
I promise I'll be all right.
I will do everything to be in order.
"God, no."
Edward.
Toni.
"You know I had to shoot him, right?"
I do not care what you had to shoot him!
I'm glad you shot him!
I'm glad he's dead!
Yeah.
Rock star!
- Hi.
"- Sarah, hi."
I'm Vanessa.
I'm sorry.
"I didn't realize you had a lesson, Joe."
"Oh, no."
Just us playing a few tunes...
And I made the mistake of saying it looked easy.
It's nice to see the guitar.
It's been a while since it's had any recreational activity.
Yeah.
"You know, I should get going."
Time to round up my little warrior.
"Oh, she's great."
- I'll ring you tomorrow.
- Sounds good.
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
"- You, too."
"Vanessa, right?"
- Right.
- See you.
Don't tell me.
You're jealous.
Don't be ridiculous.
Come on.
She's just another mom.
Lovely.
"Oh, my."
This is so beautiful.
"You know, your home says a lot about you."
It's enough.
It's really enough for me.
And you would be willing to take the whole marriage thing off the table completely?
"If you promise to commit to me and to love me, and..."
- I already have.
- I'm not finished.
Okay.
All right.
- But I've loved you for seven years...
- Ah-ah.
Okay.
You have to snake the drain when my hair gets clogged.
You know that happens.
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
And also you have to let me eat those Wheat Thins in bed.
You gotta give me that.
"- Okay, fine."
All right.
- Okay?
And...
- Yeah.
- And?
- That's it.
- Okay.
Do I get to come home now?
I guess you can.
But these cannot come.
"- What, my pants...?"
- That's correct.
- Can't come home?
Calientetate.
"Hey, everything will be fine... do not die!"
Do you listen?
Calientetate.
Returns!
Do not die!
I want to see it again ... last time.
I promise!
"I swear today until the end of days,"
"I will love you and honor you, if you are with me."
"I will, now and forever."
"Stop, before you get hurt!"
I'm Atka.
It's okay.
I am here to help you.
Let go!
I helped you.
Where are my clothes?
How long I was passed out.
Not enough.
You're welcome!
Bishop.
Bishop?
where we are?
This is Quannik's house.
- Quannik?
- He's been waiting for you.
- As it did?
- He died.
Forget this.
I have to get back on the road.
How can I get out of here?
The cat.
The composer's dead.
Okay.
Shit!
_
Abby?
What?
Is this usual for your...
people in your native form?
She's building a nest.
We do it during molting and breeding.
"- I know, it looks..."
- Freaky as shit.
No offense.
"Trust me, it's a good sign."
Can I ask you something?
"Is everyone here, all the workers, are they... what you are?"
"No, a few are human, scientists like you are."
- They're here of their own accord.
- Lucky them.
I'm sorry I had to bring you here like this.
It's not me that I'm worried about.
It's my family.
- My kids.
- You have children?
Two.
Six and eight.
They live with my ex.
You?
You have any little ones?
A daughter.
She's 16.
- Yes.
When?
"No, when?"
Ten minutes ago.
Thank you.
He'll be here soon.
You can sign in here.
Sorry...
- Well?
- Forget it.
"If someone pisses on the slopes, they stage a manhunt... but a stolen car..."
It's like a UFO landing here:
"""A car?"
"""A car with four wheels, or what?"""
"Becky, the keys are in my pants' pocket."
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Thanks.
"OK, let's go."
Max!
Of you go!
Next.
I saw something...
A car...
It nearly crashed into me.
"At the last second, I swerved."
It was all so sudden.
There were these lines... like a snake.
Where?
Like waves.
"What are you looking at, you idiot?"
I can't remember!
"- Yes, you can!"
- I can't!
- Yes--
"Yes, you can."
Hey!
Damn it!
"You hold on, damn it!"
You hold on.
You hold on.
You hold on!
You understand me?
Hold on!
Here we go.
Come on.
We almost did it.
"No, l--"
No!
Ben!
Come here!
No!
Ben!
Ben!
"You're not dying on me, Ben!"
Not now!
Hey.
I shot the Hell Knight with my plasma rifle but he nailed me with a rocket launcher.
Watch out for the fireballs.
"- Excuse me, Dr. Benton."
- Yeah?
I sorted through the charts and compiled the discharge summaries.
I think your patient has a paraesophageal hernia.
"If you need anything else, I'll be in the Suture Room."
I'll meet you there.
Hey.
Hi.
"Hey, Marissa come back?"
Uh uh.
You smell like smoke.
"Yeah, we, uh...hot boxed Nordlin's car."
And didn't invite me?
"Dude, that kid was messed up."
He was breathing.
"Yeah, I hope so."
I can't believe this.
This house is cursed.
You the owner?
"Yes, I am."
What happened?
Not sure yet.
But it looks like someone's been living here.
What?
It's my fault.
You're okay.
Disappointed?
Where are you going?
Don't know.
We both keep our mouths shut.
They may never know it was us.
What are you doing?
You're giving me a ride.
I don't know what happened.
I do not know why the house burned down.
What was he even doing there?
Why didn't you tell us?
What are you doing?
Tell him that it's in the petrol tank!
Petrol tank!
It's my diamond!
- It's my diamond!
I have bought the car!
Its mine!
I had come for the diamonds!
- It is mine. - it's mine!
I have the gun!
"So the diamond is mine, papa!"
But petrol tank is not opening.
How to get the diamond?
"One, two, three."
Then..
Heave!
Everybody heave!
What are you doing?
Vomiting!
- Vomiting!
- Vomiting!
- Vomiting!
I said to turn the car!
- Oh!
Which one?
This one or that one?
His questions and answers!
What do want?
- Give me two batteries.
Which one?
"Big, medium, small?"
- For remote!
"Stay low, stay close, shoot first."
Got it?
On me.
Do you have the vice president?
"- I repeat, do you have the vice president?"
- We do.
- We're two miles away from Andrews.
- The speaker?
Negative.
We do not have the speaker.
- Please evacuate the Capitol.
- This way.
Excuse me.
Kellerman!
"Carol, COD says we go to the Pentagon."
I have the speaker.
Going to the secondary location.
Watch yourself.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Downstairs, second door to the left."
Emily.
"No, no, no, please."
Please don't!
I was just on the tour!
- You had a gun!
"- it's a phone, it's a phone."
- I swear.
"Look, I got a daughter."
Please.
- Get up!
Okay.
That was close.
Next!
You better catch them for me!
What are you doing here!
Line up!
Go!
Line up!
Line up!
Shut up!
You're all useless!
I'm so mad!
Next!
Put down your hands!
It's so embarrassing!
Like a piece of cardboard?
Looks like she hasn't had enough nutrition
"Even though it's a bit flat, but on a closer look"
It's actually not bad.
"Throw at her, it's funny!"
Really?
"Thanks, Master Zhou!"
"Master Zhou, keep on playing!"
"Thanks Master Zhou, thank you!"
"She got it again, throw at her, quick!"
"Master Zhou, come on!"
Stop!
Get off!
Get off!
Are you blind!
"Sorry, sorry!"
Open the door!
Boss!
Open the door!
"Mummy, can I have my room back?"
Of course you can.
"Come on, darling."
Get out of the bath.
Do try not to cross-question him.
I'm not cross-questioning.
It's perfectly normal to wonder who he is.
I just think it would be nice if you didn't go on at him.
I'm only trying to find out what happened.
Come in.
Good evening.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
"Better, thank you."
I'm Henry Baker.
Hello.
I'm Lucy.
Lucy Rose.
- How do you do?
- This is my husband David.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Have some hot soup.
Thank you.
- Bread?
"- Yes, thank you."
"Can you tell me the time, please?"
It's ten to nine.
Ten to nine?
- Help yourself to cider.
"- No, thank you."
Thank you.
"Master Huang, here's to you."
Thanks.
Help yourself!
I can help myself!
Make yourself at home!
I'll never be Master Huang's student.
Forget it!
We're still friends.
I'll help you.
I've got it.
What?
You...
"You saved a girl last time, right?"
This time you'll get yourself beaten up.
I don't want to do it!
You must win my master's sympathy.
I see!
Let's do it.
Master...
What's wrong?
Someone just raided the bank.
Mousy went and fought them.
He was outnumbered.
What's happened?
He was badly beaten up.
Where were the police?
They've all disappeared.
Mousy is righteous.
"Take him as your student, please."
Mousy!
He can't even stand straight.
I'll treat you in a special way.
"Fish, fish... go on, stop that, will you?"
Lay off of that stuff.
"I don't give that fish stuff a nod, no matter how many you've caught."
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?
Always feeling sorry.
"Don't do that, kid, will you?"
Waste of time.
Come on.
I'm sor...
"I mean, ok."
Attaboy.
"You'll smarten up with me, all right."
Yes?
Washington?
"Ok, put them on."
"Yes, yes, speaking."
What?
"Yes, where?"
But what about my...
Oh.
Yes.
I'll be here all the time.
What?
"Nothing about Paul yet, darling."
They caught up with the Krozac gang and shot it out with them.
They're all dead.
But they didn't have Paul.
But what about him?
"He wasn't with them, either."
Then he has him.
He has my little boy!
Drink rakia.
- He does not like.
You have to make it fast.
"Look at me, my friend."
"Look, like that."
"Do it, do it, and after that you will feel better."
You do not like it?
"- Yes, it's very good."
Then I drink it.
And the country is 'hello'.
"Belgium, your country, is 'hello'."
"Half and Half,  or..."
- Maybe.
Maybe.
And what...
What did you find out?
Is Turkey closer to Europe?
I think so.
I think  that...
- And US?
You do not want to.
"You want Turkey, right?"
"- No, well... well..."
But how?
And when?
- It depends...
We've heard these bullshit for centuries.
"Well, at least ten years, okay?"
And it never happened.
We are about to sneeze this exquisite Serbian pork.
"Lady Louise, a gift for you."
She's a little...
So you knew.
Yeah.
Wash me.
Wash me.
Make my body clean.
Maybe it won't come off... but wash me.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We'll call it even.
I was sleeping with a Japanese woman
for money on the side.
Now hit me.
"Hit me, too."
Hit me!
Here's your sushi delivery.
How much?
Please pay when you check out.
It's Kiriko Kashiwagi.
- No!
- Kiriko Kashiwagi.
You're under arrest.
What's going on?
Are you really police?
"Those handcuffs are fake, but we need to talk to you."
Where's Yasuo Ikezawa?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
"I'm not lying, we broke up ten years ago."
No way for me to know.
Why should I trust you?
It's been 15 years since that day.
Understood.
"Yankee, can you see it?"
Yes.
Do it!
Dropping hellfire.
Started!
Shit!
"How's that, bastard!"
You draw his attention!
"Ram, shoot!"
Shut up!
The GONKU is now inoperative.
Every one.
Good job.
What happened?
Hey!
As expected... it's underground.
Let's work.
Here is today's crucial moment.
"Good night, this is Tokyo Rose."
Your jokes are hard to understand.
Receiving you clear.
Yankee.
From now on we will split and start the search.
Ram and Male search east side.
Ok.
We will turn to the west.
Understood.
Are you going to search with Male's RC?
Right?
It's just for precaution.
I know...
See you later.
Don't forget the meeting!
Try to be there!
What do you say?
The work is hard.
You have to get used to it.
I don't think it's that hard.
It's just getting used to it.
Try to make it to the meeting.
I'm very tired.
I'm asking you... as the organizer.
I'll see.
I'm counting on you.
"Founé, my thurible!"
"Founé, hand me the phone."
Good morning.
"Yes, it's me."
Is the boss in?
Let me speak to him.
"Hold on, I'll go and see."
Founé!
Put Sissoko on the phone.
Who is it?
Zangué?
What's the matter?
Are the workers meeting... with your permission?
Never!
This is Balla's idea.
Incredible!
I can't trust anybody.
Don't wait for me.
"Take Kariba or Drissa with you, and follow procedure."
"He'll probably be furious, but we're used to that."
Who's we?
"Oh, me and Pauline."
It's my boss.
That's who I've been sort of seeing.
You met him that day.
Oh.
I thought he was married.
"Well, yes."
That's been the complication.
The boss I met?
Mr Stanley?
Yes.
But he is married.
I heard him saying something about his wife.
They don't get on.
They're all very showjump-y.
Who are?
The wife and the daughters.
He's got daughters?
Yes.
Two.
They do dressage.
But you haven't had an affair with him?
"Well, yes."
What did you think you were doing?
To them?
What I was doing?
To their family.
You had no right.
He was somebody's husband and he was somebody's father.
"That's wrong, Enid."
What are you doing?
Please stop it.
There must have been a misunderstanding.
I only came here to take over for one night.
Will you just stop that?
Please stop it.
No.
Won't someone stop him!
?
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
No!
Stop it!
"Hey, stop looking so serious."
Let me go.
Mr Muraki?
Ah.
Hello.
Don't you know you shouldn't put plastic rubbish out until tomorrow?
Sorry.
"Oh dear, look at her."
Isn't she looking beautiful?
You must be popular amongst the boys.
"Hi, Chie."
Are you alright?
- Alright?
"- Yeah, fine."
Are you going somewhere nice again?
- We're getting obsessed.
- Really?
'Course it does.
You bugger.
Mam!
Wait!
What did he say?
Who?
Him.
Nothing.
He said he'd given me a ball or something.
A ball?
He didn't say to come with him or anything?
To Canada?
No.
No.
"Because you're staying with me, aren't you?"
"Mam, can we play the record?"
No.
I told you.
But why?
Because I don't want to hear it!
Now fasten it up.
"You don't get it out, you don't show it anybody, and you don't tell anybody."
I mean it.
"She said, ""Pop in."""
She wants me to pop in.
"I'm not making this up, am I?"
"She wants me, Tubby Baker, to come and see her in her office."
"Got to mean something, hasn't it?"
Ooh.
"One, two."
And...
"# In this grove, in this grove"
So what's up?
Let me get at you.
You want my number?
"Yeah, I want it."
I want to take you out.
"I could treat you real good, you know?"
"Oh, word?"
Yeah.
(Whispering)
Trans what?
Transsexual.
"Oh, for..."
For real?
"Hold up, you know, that's cool, ma."
"So, like, it's... it's gone, right?"
"No, um..."
I still have a thing.
You real freaky with it?
What?
Like... you suck dick?
Um...
I mean...
"No, I'm sayin', like, you like that?"
You suck dick?
You don't even know my name.
"It's Vanessa, right?"
(Door closing)
(Man) What do we got here?
"' 95, two years grand larceny."
"'01, a year on arms possession, resisting arrest."
Last bid's a three out of five.
"Drugs, possession and selling."
Understood.
Dropping the hellfire.
Yankee... that's all?
Yes.
"It's a GUNK, isn't it?"
Everyone listen!
Gimlet here.
The bombing failed.
The enemy is getting closer.
As shown on the screen it's a self-supported tank.
"But, we will proceed as in practice."
I will move to position too.
"Male, until then, be the look out."
Male here.
Understood.
I should be able to see it.
It's coming!
Marking it with the laser.
What is he doing?
"Male, are you ok?"
I marked it with the laser!
It looks like we finished the job.
"Male, life check."
All green.
Male.
System check.
It made me run...
All green.
Let's start.
Understood.
Dropping one.
"Yeah, come... 4 seconds until impact... 3... 2 1"
"I-I'm just finally getting lucky, I guess."
Just lucky.
You guess.
Listen!
"There's no fix, okay?"
Is it an owner?
Huh?
No!
I swear!
"Fuck, it was just a streak, okay?"
"Look, okay, okay!"
I have a source!
I have a source.
It's reliable.
I can't explain it.
It could cause some serious problems.
Was it a doctor?
Tell me what they're doing to bring in the fix!
"No, it- it's nothing like that."
"Look, you wouldn't believe me if I told you."
Bullshit.
(GRUNTING)
Can't you just ride my bets?
Yeah.
"Just make the same bets I do and-I know what ""ride"" means."
(DOOR UNLOCKS)
You are such a piece of shit.
"I hope you enjoyed the peep show, Jasper!"
I'll... take that.
"- Finn, this is-"
- IVAN:
I was just leaving.
Yeah.
"Cigar, pal?"
"Oh, thanks, pal."
(COUGHING)
It's a cigar!
It's a real cigar!
"What did you think it was, Wilbur?"
W-What did I think it was?
"Oh, I..."
I thought it was a candy cigar.
My daddy always gave me candy cigars.
Candy cigar?
Yeah.
Did it taste anything like this?
Did it taste...
I'll see.
I'll wait.
I...
I'm not sure.
"Let's try again, Wilbur."
I don't think it's the same.
We must be positive.
Pal.
I feel awful.
I got some medicine that'll fix you right up.
How do like your Scotch?
Plain or with soda?
On the rocks.
On the rocks?
"Oh, on the rocks is what my daddy always says when he orders that nasty whiskey."
I can't make up my mind about you.
Let me feel your muscle.
Come here.
I wish you wanted to go out.
I am out.
I don't live here.
"Oh, I adopted a cat."
I know.
You send me pictures.
I send them or I sent them once?
"- Oh, more than once."
- I think I'm going to name my cat Gadzookey.
You have a little situation there.
With your...
Oh.
I love him.
You should love a human.
I just don't want him to be one of those exes I have to see every few years.
You know?
He's making it really easy.
I hate that you think this is easy.
That's nice.
- Should I do anything?
"- No, no, no, just look that way."
There you go.
Smile.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
Think of something funny.
Nice.
There you go.
It's me.
Work it.
Work it.
"Classic, but not a comedy."
(telephone rings)
"- Hi, Camilla, it's me."
- Anna!
- You sound so close.
Are you back?
"- No, I'm way too busy here."
"Yeah, doing great."
- I just wanted to check.
- Don't worry about us.
We're fine.
Everything is fine.
- What's up?
You sound strange.
- I can't talk now.
He's here.
- Johan?
In your room?
- No.
"Oh, good."
So who's there?
Are you still fooling around with Albert?
No.
- A new lover?
- No.
And my other tenant?
Is he seeing someone too?
I bet you're building a little love nest.
"I mean, separately."
"No, I don't think he's seeing anyone at the moment."
I just really miss that bastard.
- Johan?
"- No, for Christ's sake!"
"- Yes sir, right away!"
"Back so soon, you're not dumb this time!"
What?
What happened?
Take it out!
What are you doing?
Fat Pat?
- Take him to toilet and get the 'Beast'!
- Yes Sir!
"Don't do that, I'm against violence!"
I'm against violence...!
"Boss, I can't find it!"
I don't believe!
Did he hide it there?
Not here...!
To hell with you...!
Fat Pig!
"- Boss, he calls you Fat Pig!"
- You want us to beat him up?
No need!
"I'll help him to this drink, and he'll curse no more."
There's no poison!
I don't want to take...
"Here you are, $1.00 please!"
What the hell do you want?
Want some water?
Alright?
Feeling better?
It's poison!
Damn it!
Couldn't find the American and the Jew's dead.
"And my half a million dollars too, oh hell!"
- Your wives.
- Yeah.
Commitment.
You have to care.
You're not going to stir?
- Stir?
"- Yeah, you mix it"
- quick while it's cooking.
Here.
"- No, no, no, no."
"My omelette, my way."
OK.
"Your PSAs, your porters they're your family."
Why won't you give one of 'em a break?
"- Come on, Allen..."
- We all fail.
You failed at marriage.
- Twice.
Someone gave you a third chance.
- I didn't do drugs.
"Frank, all I'm asking, as a colleague, as a friend..."
And it's still no.
What are you doing here?
You're not on graveyard.
A friend was admitted so I thought I'd stick around.
Everything OK?
Think so.
I hope so.
- Cup of tea?
- Green.
Thanks.
Thanks...
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
What's the matter?
Why is everybody so sullen?
Do you want us to dance around?
Hey!
This is a ladies handkerchief!
A ladies handkerchief?
In brother's hand?
It is not possible.
- But it is!
"- lf it is, it must have fallen down."
- Return it to whoever it belongs.
- lt didn't fall down.
It has been forced into his hand.
- But why?
We saved you a muffin.
- Right?
- Yes.
- Look. I said I was sorry.
- l left five messages for you.
Five!
"I mean, my father is in the..."
I mean...
- l need you.
- Right.
So... I've got to create a circuit for shop.
"- So, I'll call you later."
Okay?
- Kyle.
"Look, I didn't hear anything just now."
Okay?
She is in such a state.
Hanne...
I know a girl who felt just like you.
Her parents stopped talking after they broke up.
You know what she did?
"Hi, darling."
Long time no see!
- Do you still do boxing?
- I've just won a big fight.
We're celebrating.
- Is something wrong?
- Will you help me?
Sure.
Are you scared?
Better now?
Maybe you should check the basement.
Sofie?
Sofie?
Can you hear me?
Sofie?
Stop...
- You wanted me to do it.
- I'm not in the mood now.
Stop it!
You and your sister have fucked half the Edge tonight; now it's my turn.
Fuck you!
You bitch!
Sofie?
What's up with her?
Do you want me to call anyone?
My mother and father.
Both of them.
I won't hurt her.
I'll just kill her!
Release her!
"- Let her go,Johnny!"
- No way!
What if I don't?
"Like I said, drop your guns!"
Dumbo.
Will you do what you promised?
No problem.
"Remember, there's always a friend to backyou up."
"Drop the guns, or I'll kill her!"
"Drop your gun, idiot!"
Jeffrey!
Jeffrey!
-Jeffrey!
-Jenny!
"Jeffrey, where are you?"
Jeffrey!
Jeffrey!
- Freeze!
Don't move!
"- Okay, okay, I surrender."
I'll cooperate.
"Arrest me, please!"
You're an unusual cop.
And you're an unusual killer.
"I believe in justice, but nobody trusts me."
I have the same problem.
- Arrest him!
"- Yes, sir."
I'll do it.
Want some coffee or something?
Let's sit here.
I saw Helen in the newspaper.
It was crazy.
Four guys were killed.
'You know something more than us?
-Do Not.
"No, they are keeping secret."
I stayed out of me to know that there is a killer where you live.
"How are you going, Mom?"
-Incredible!
I can not wait to get out here and fix my life.
You are halfway yet.
Need to complete the program.
I suppose.
I need.
And how are you?
How are they?
Have done well?
-They Are good.
Okay.
And the school then?
-Are You ... cool.
Dating?
"Oh, tell me."
What is her name?
Henning.
He treats you well?
Do not say anything to Helen and Svend.
-You Can leave.
-Are You good?
"Yes, yes."
(Rachel) You don't have to do this.
Call for backup.
They'll kill you.
John?
I'm Armant.
Where's the little girl?
"Well, how do I know you've actually got what I want?"
Thank you.
Okay.
Let the little girl go and I'll take you to it.
I'm scared.
"Listen, listen."
"I want you to go with Rachel, okay?"
"Yes, go with Rachel."
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Lord grant me the wisdom and the strength to do what must be done.
[bell tolling]
You gotta be shitting me.
It's inside there?
This little girl was right all along?
"Well, c'mon."
Let's go to church.
"Good afternoon, Father."
You look a little lost.
May I help you?
"I once was lost, but now I'm found."
[low beeping]
"Ah, what a beautiful sound."
[fast beeping]
No.
Thank you. one of your friends is here to see you.
what's up?
bro.
But I don't think Victor likes you very much-- just the sense I'm getting.
don't sweat him.
It was him and Jason.
You shouldn't be thinking about that stuff right now.
Are you all right?
Do you need anything? please?
bro.
So when's your next fight?
It's tomorrow.
I'll be there.
Are you gonna be all right to come?
don't worry.
Just get ready.
all right?
okay?
man.
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I'll be all right.
Price.
I hope this isn't your fighter.
No.
This is Brandon.
Kyle.
- All right.
- Let's get going.
These boys came all the way down here from Dallas.
10 large.
Right.
Perfectly harmless.
- Vets use them all them time.
- Will it hurt it?
No.
It'll put it out for a few minutes.
Everyone stay quiet.
"Jo, don't miss this."
I never miss.
- Did you miss?
- No.
There's two of them.
Two beasts?
Wait.
They might not be fully under yet.
- I have to see them.
- Let me and Steve get them into the container.
"Safety first, OK?"
- OK.
- Jo.
What about safety first?
Fine.
Miss the reveal.
"Steve, go ahead and check they are out."
Maddy and Rhydian are going to be mad they missed this.
- You OK?
"- Yeah, why?"
You're shaking.
Is this happening?
"Like, is this actually happening?"
Yeah.
Believe it.
I don't think I can.
- The Mayor!
- What did he want?
Wanted to know why he wasn't invited tonight.
What did you say?
"You heard me, bullshit!"
Get me...the phone!
What are you doing?
Don't you do that to me again!
Why not?
I have full command here?
That's true!
- Why is he here?
- Who?
Have we met before!
"I'd recognize your ashes, you're..."
You!
You!
We've met in Japan!
I've never been abroad!
"In Chungking, that's it!"
Who am I now?
The Special Envoy from Chungking!
Smart guy!
You got something in your eye?
Allow me.
She's the Commissioner's daughter.
"Friends call me ""Dumplings""!"
- Doesn't look it!
- You really don't quite look it!
I love men with moustaches.
We make quite a pair!
is it really she?
- Hello.
Creative director of the company.
And this man is also the backbone of the company.
- Yeah.
Red Chillies' design is ready?
I am working on it.
It will be ready by tomorrow.
I am putting her under your charge from today.
From today she will assist you.
Okay?
- Great.
"Fine then, welcome."
Congrats.
"My pleasure, sir."
- You're on.
Come
"So, if there is anything you need, just let me know."
Sure.
Sure.
Hi.
- Hi.
"So, how are you, Adi?"
- I am good.
Thanks.
You?
I am good too.
"So how is your first day in the office, Gul?"
Going great so far.
- Yeah?
That's really nice.
So how did you find Gul?
She seems nice enough.
You know the Bowlmor Lanes?
Okay.
I'll see you there in a while.
Good.
- What's up?
- I'm going to roust a couple guys.
"Well, let me cancel this."
I'll go with you.
- I'll take Martinez.
"- Andy, it's no problem."
"Don't worry, I'll take him."
Those guys who took off that Vietnam vet?
He's crippled.
They left him lying there.
- Let me go with you.
"- No, I'll take the kid."
Okay.
You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I'll see you later.
HEYWOOD:
John Kelly?
Stan Heywood.
"Sit down, Stan."
Why did you pick this place to meet?
"Well, I wanted a place you'd be familiar with."
"- Can I get some coffee, please?"
WAITRESS:
Sure.
- Thank you.
WAITRESS:
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hyo-jin?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
"More importantly,"
I am a Harvard-educated medical profsional with 14 years of clinical experience of trauma and depression.
So believe me when I am telling you that I do not have crazy head.
Now I'm holding the baby.
Go to work.
We'll be fine.
Watch out...
Morning.
Morning.
Good shoes.
Thanks.
"Yours, too."
"Oh, can you..."
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
Press 4?
Thanks.
How's it going there?
It's great.
It's really great.
I redecorated.
Oh.
Good.
How's it going up there?
Fine.
Yeah?
"Hey, what ever happened with that guy?"
What guy?
The... the heart guy.
"The one you really liked, but he was married and his wife was your patient."
What was his name?
Noah.
"Yeah, Noah."
So why should I care?
Fuck.
-What?
"-He missed the punch, fucked up--"
"Mickey, could you keep that to yourself next time, let him play through?"
Let me talk to him.
Sorry.
Yeah.
"It's not there, but that's a direction."
-It's okay?
-Yeah.
We'll finesse it in the mix.
We'll make it work.
What do you think?
-Truthfully?
"-No, lie to me."
"Yeah, truthfully."
I'm not feeling it.
You're not feeling it.
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.
Don't apologize.
Just tell me what you mean.
"I don't know what I mean, exactly."
I just....
"I mean, l--"
I guess it's just not pulling me in.
Or it feels like it's not pulling them in exactly....
Or enough.
I don't know.
They don't seem inspired.
Inspired?
I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
Damn it!
Don't you leave me down here by myself!
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
"Indy, the torch is going out!"
Indy?
Marion!
Look.
Look.
They're going to fly it out of here.
"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
"Ah, monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert."
To the Ark.
When we are very far from here.
That will do.
"Hey, you now.. come here!"
Come here!
Indy!
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!
Look out!
"Oh, my God."
Marion.
These good people want to see me fuck you now.
No!
"We're gonna go away, We're gonna go away."
We're going to Berlin.
Right after you fuck me.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Berlin.
"Help me hold her down, she likes it."
It's Ok.
"It's Ok baby,"
No!
You'll die Adrian!
Kill me baby!
Kill me baby!
No!
What have we done?
Wait a minute.
We think clearly this cannot be explained.
It's easy to explain.
You wanna know who and what I am?
I'm a killer.
I kill with my cunt.
You can write about it... in Midnight Magazine.
Or National Enquirer.
It's gonna be a new sensation.
You wanted to know where I'm from?
I'm from connecticut.
Mayflower stock.
I was taught that my prince would come.
Okay?
"It's a long way to your station, the whole night, we'll think of something."
Wait!
What are you doing?
!
Turn it on now!
Turn on the light!
Hooligans!
Oh...
Where's that man?
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
It's a tunnel.
I know.
Why did you get scared?
- Come in.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
My name is Yuri Nikolayevich Lyapin.
Do you mind?
This is Georgian dry wine.
My friend sent it from Georgia.
"- Nah, I don't drink colored wine."
"- Well, I don't drink much either."
I even quit smoking.
"But sometimes it helps, it calms you."
Really?
Then pour me some.
For you too?
That'll do.
- To our meeting.
It's a yellow school bus.
"I heard it on the radio, but I ain't seen no school bus."
Thank you.
"You kids, now, give me this."
"All right, get in back."
Stay back there.
You stay up here.
Leave your brother alone.
- Give me that.
"- Excuse me, sir."
What do you want?
I'm looking for a yellow bus.
"All right, give me that squirt gun."
"Look, all I'm looking to do is get out of here."
- Get up in the front.
- Thank you.
"Yellow school bus, have you seen one?"
Thank you.
Are you sure you didn't see a school bus?
"Okay, I'll talk to you later."
- Nothing.
- Me neither.
Tapia Park's just over the hill.
Let's check that out.
There it is.
- What's wrong?
"- Well, that baby food is poisoned."
L.A. 15-7 Mary 4.
Code 33.
Attention all units.
Code 33.
All frequencies clear.
This sucker's got a lot of symptoms.
"No shissh, Sherlock."
Good luck faking the goiter.
Goiter?
"Oh, my God."
That's why they wanted to see my neck.
"Oh, good lord."
Ooh.
- It worked.
- Yay.
"She says she loves you and she's sorry and-- oh, she's sending you a picture."
Yes.
Perky.
Just erase it.
He's coming.
Done.
"Hey, will."
We found your phone.
"Oh, awesome, thanks."
"Oh, no."
"What, is something wrong?"
"It's just this girl, Stephanie,"
I have to break up with.
What?
She's kind of psycho and we dated a couple months.
Now she thinks we're engaged.
"Yeah, because you proposed to her."
Were you spying on my phone?
Ugh...
"Oh, honey, yes."
And that's how I found out you were engaged.
And I went crazy so I texted back.
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
Of course.
Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Goodbye, and thank you."
627...
Wait.
... 9 6... ... 6 1... .
... o 9.
"No, 9."
Fuck.
627...
Hello?
"Marco, is that you?"
"Yes, Benigno."
It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
Where are you?
Outside the clinic.
Dr. Vega told me everything.
"Hi, guys."
- Hey!
Let me ask you something.
Did you bring a gift?
- Of course.
- Yeah.
- See...
- He said no gifts.
Nobody means that.
You took that seriously?
- Of course I did.
Look at all these.
- I know.
"Oh, what do you got there, chicken?"
"Oh yeah, thank you."
"- No, I'm fine, thank you."
"- No, thank you."
"- You brought something, right?"
"- No, I didn't bring anything."
"He said no gifts, so I didn't bring anything."
- You're the only one.
- You guys are making me look bad.
- Happy birthday!
"- Hey, thank you."
"- Hey, happy birthday!"
"- Thanks for making it, yeah."
"- So it's the two of you, huh?"
"- Mm-hmm, yeah."
"Exciting, that's great."
- Up on the boards together.
- Yeah.
- Figuring it out.
"- No, I'll walk."
- As you wish.
- How much?
450 francs.
"- No, keep it."
Good evening.
- Thank you.
"Say, Sir..."
I think your walk might be on the long side.
- On the long side?
"- Yes, it's quite far."
"- Come on, get in."
Tonight you get to ride for free.
"- Ah, thanks!"
"No, not back there."
"Up front, next to me!"
Thanks a lot!
- Who is it?
"- Me, Andrea."
- Hold on.
"Listen, Andrea..."
"It would be better if you went to sleep in Mimì's room, she's not feeling well."
What's all this about?
You gave me permission...
"- No, no..."
- Now you send me to sleep alone?
She really doesn't feel well.
I've made your bed in there.
- What happened?
"No, because..."
- She's just fallen asleep.
"But, I didn't do anything..."
"- Hi, I'm Mackie."
- Danny Mitchell.
Danny used to work in the D.A.'s office.
You look good.
You still on patrol?
"No, actually, today is the first day of my new job-- I made detective."
Congratulations.
Which department?
Internal Affairs.
Wow!
Bet your family loved that.
"Oh, no, she hasn't told them yet."
Oh...
Okay.
Good luck with that.
I should get going.
- It's really great seeing you.
- You too.
"Maybe we could grab lunch, catch up."
"Yeah, sure."
Sounds great.
"Here, call me with a time."
Call me if you need a lawyer.
Thanks.
All right.
He is so cute.
What is the story with you guys?
We're just friends.
The guy was totally into you.
"No, he wasn't."
- Do you mind if I call him?
- No.
[all] Whoo.
Look.
Those rangers won't quit.
Skyship cannons.
Port side.
Fire. [grunting]
- Everyone all right?
- I'm fine.
- Lovin' it.
- I'm okay.
- Yep.
- Good.
Release the zords.
[yellow] Super mega wheeler.
[pink] Super mega sub.
[green] Super mega racer.
[blue] Super mega jet.
- Our turn.
- Good idea.
[green/blue] Fire.
[yellow/pink] Fire.
- Bull's-eye.
- That's one down.
Come back to the skyship.
I think I figured out how to form the megazord.
Zords combine. [all] Legendary megazord ready.
[all] Full speed ahead.
Evasive maneuvers. [laughs] You forgot to watch your back.
He's trying to clog our gears.
I'll open this tin can.
They're in for a surprise.
[grunts] What?
Where's Sefton?
I don't know.
- He wouldn't be at the kommandant's?
"-I don't know, I told you."
What did the Krauts trade him for the radio?
I don't know.
- Why don't we look in these footlockers?
-No.
"Come on, you stooge."
Hand over them keys.
I haven't got any keys.
"- Okay, then I'll get me a key."
-Ow.
- Hey!
-Okay.
Hoffy?
- Okay.
"-Hey, wait a minute."
"Hey, don't."
Sefton will get mad.
Of all the hoarding cruds.
"Looks like Macy's basement, don't it?"
That kid's richer than my mother.
"Oh, shut up!"
For crying out loud.
What would he be doing with these?
Suppose you ask me.
"Go on, ask me."
Because I got the goods on Mr. Sefton.
Because this time he didn't shake me.
Take a look for yourself.
It'll curdle your guts.
Mm.
See?
That was easy.
It's like I always say.
"When it comes to good parenting, you have to be fair but firm."
"You just show him that you mean business, and he's out of bed again, isn't he?"
You never have this problem with sock puppets.
Aah!
Oh!
All right.
What's this all about?
Voices.
- Voices?
- Uh-huh!
In here!
Telling me what to do!
You have voices inside your head.
Sometimes.
And what kind of things do they tell you to do?
Oh!
Oh...
The early bird catches the worm!
What's gotten into this kid?
Hey...
Ow!
Hey!
Maybe you sing him a little song.
"Come here, y..."
I...
Do I look like the kind of guy that knows a lullaby?
Sing!
♪ Lullaby and good night ♪
Right here.
Right in the old breadbasket.
Hit it!
Touchdown!
I got it!
I got it!
"Thankfully, range anxiety would be a thing of the past."
Yeah!
Plug it in!
Hold on.
Stay with me.
I'm plugging.
We got it!
You got it?
I'm charging!
Yes!
- I'm charging while driving!
- Great!
- How many amps is that?
- 15.
I need 400.
"A couple days, you should be fine."
We could do this as a service for people...
Rut and Adam's electro refueling.
I knew it would work!
"You're a man of science, Rutledge Wood."
This is genius!
"Well, it's something."
It only takes a truck getting 17 miles a gallon for an electric car to charge.
You're saving the earth.
One charge at a time.
Excellent.
- I'm coming.
- Look after Gucci.
- But you're way till Sunday!
I've got Robbie Williams tonight.
Helene says Gucci can't be left on her own.
She gets scared.
Just do it.
Then you and I can do something nice next weekend.
Can we go to mum's?
It's her birthday.
- You know I can't.
- Why not?
You know my lawyer says we mustn't see each other.
But call me.
"- Hi, Yugo Danny."
- Fuck off.
- I thought the cops had got you.
- I need your blow.
Where the hell is that coke?
About fucking time.
- What's that?
- Sherbet.
What do you think?
My blow comes in one big bag.
There were problems.
That's not 20 grams.
"As I said, problems."
You get the rest tomorrow.
No.
I want it now.
Or you give back my card.
This is Alexander's.
Let's go.
"Yes, of course."
There.
Set it up and push it.
Never take this off.
Let me know when it rings.
You know why I gave you this important thing?
Yeah.
I don't trust the others.
Try not to touch it.
"Dad, have a look here."
Is everyone here?
Have a look.
Champagne?
We need this for such a great day like today.
And I've prepared one more thing.
Want to see?
What's he doing now?
He makes me so nervous.
Don't be surprised.
Congratulations on being human!
Congratulations on being human!
Who's that?
"Wait, that's..."
Hurry and escape.
- What are you doing?
- Be quiet.
Just do what I say.
Now go!
Where the hell are we going?
"Mr. Hong, where've you been?"
Stay there.
"And something sweet, like a cookie or a piece of candy."
- And a CD player.
- And a Cody Chesnutt CD.
I don't have that CD.
Uh-oh.
That's ourfavorite music.
So I guess we can't do it.
"Oh, but look."
- I have it.
- Go get the stuff.
"Don't forget the towel, the washcloths or the cookie."
- Or candy.
- Or candy.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- Hey.
Ready to do this?
- I am.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
"- Yeah, we're good."
"Okay, here are the rules."
You have to keep this pillow on your face.
You can't watch us.
- Okay.
- You can't touch us.
You can't touch our heads.
And we're not going to touch each other.
"And you have to tell us when you're going to ""scooch."""
- Okay.
"- So, take off your pants."
Lift it.
Careful.
You'll have it bursting all over the place.
Come on!
Do you realise that the contents of this cabinet could rock London to its foundations?
"And provide very interesting reading, too!"
"Oh, Henry?"
"- Oh, my heart!"
"- Yes, that's the trouble."
Another storm?
No...
Seaweed.
That's it.
That's it.
"Yes, I..."
I had a dip.
- A midnight dip.
- Fully clothed?
"Well, I couldn't go in in the nude, could I?"
"Well, could I?"
- I fell in.
"- Well, fall into bed."
- I'll get the doctor.
- I'm going out again.
Where to this time?
The Serpentine?
(Tuts)
I'll get Maria to lay out your frogman's outfit.
Go and clean up.
You look a terrible sight.
(Doorbell)
"Oh, good evening."
You got any problems picking up the van?
No.
"All right, so it's all filled up, we're ready to go?"
Filled up?
Riley.
"Come on, man."
Details.
No...
I'm sorry.
You mad?
"I'm not mad, I just,"
I'm disappointed.
All right?
You're my crew.
So bring your A game.
I'll go do it right now.
"No, forget it."
"I mean, we have enough time tomorrow morning to fill up the tank."
It's the principle of the thing.
Let's just go over this again.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Ollie.
What's he doin' here?
Just hear 'im out.
No.
"Connor, I just came by to say that"
I appreciate all the help.
Jellyfish.
"Yeah, I'm really just helping my sister out."
So...
A bullet proof vest!
Who's the best cop now?
"- Come on, Jimmy!"
Me and you!
- Go on.
"Run, you son of a bitch."
Tommy!
I just want to talk to you!
"Tommy, what are you making me chase you for?"
"Come on, are you mad at me?"
I just shot my dad.
"Call me, Tommy."
"No, I'll call you."
- Get these handcuffs off me.
- Why are you handcuffed?
Where's Detillo?
- He's been shot!
Get off!
- I'm not getting off.
"Hardy, you son of a bitch!"
Get away from me!
You could never beat me!
You like to jump off bridges.
Who's the best cop now?
- Take these handcuffs off me.
- Get some handcuff keys.
- Do you want to take a shot at me?
- No.
"It wouldn't do any good, Eddie."
On the other hand...
Hardy!
You're okay.
It's most embarrassing.
I'll come and see you tomorrow...
I can't.
I've got a board meeting and a charity dance.
I'll come the day after tomorrow.
"Until then, expose nothing."
"- Where do you live, by the way?"
"- 54, Chillingdon Court."
You know it?
"Yes, I used to have..."
Day after tomorrow.
- Ah-ah.
This way.
The firm will...
- The firm?
!
"Yes, the firm will try to straighten out matters."
- We will try and find the man.
- Dennis?
But I know...
Do nothing till you hear from me.
"12:30, the day after tomorrow."
Phew!
54... 54...
Darling...
Shall I jot it down for you?
No!
(Silence)
"(Irish accent) A drop o' the hard stuff, please."
Right away.
"- Three and six, please."
"- Right, right, right..."
[indistinct yelling]
[guard screams]
"Oh, no."
Letha!
Letha!
[indistinct shouting] [chortling]
- [gasps] - look out.
[man] get out of my way.
[moaning]
[guards yell]
[man] can't you put that thing out?
"Come on, take a shot."
Move it.
"Now, Tony,"
Make a hole in the plastic shield.
And it doesn't have to be neat.
"Tony, unstack the gold bars and deliver them to Mr. Sickle."
"[man] move it buddy, move it."
We gotta get out of here!
"Las Vegas, here we come."
Oh!
- Look.
- [bars thudding]
"Come on, follow me."
"Tony, make them go faster."
[woman] watch out!
"Hey, Letha!"
"Hey, Letha!"
- [woman screams] - [man] hey!
[indistinct chatter]
"Look out, lady."
"Yeah, why don't you watch where you're going, you big dummy."
That's my chips!
Alright.
"Catrin Pule, you're coming with me."
"Try again, Johnnie."
Positions.
No.
"No, no makeup."
Quiet please.
Quiet please everyone.
I'll give you a finger click for a sniper shot.
"Just a very quite click, please."
"It's hard to explain to a non-actor but I want to react to the sniper up there and not the click down here, you see?"
Is there a chance to find a real gunner up there?
No.
Right.
Up for take?
Sounds.
Sound rolling.
Scene.
"Dunkirk film scene 17, take 1."
Good luck Lieutenant Lundbeck.
Action.
Here boy.
Here.
Cmon boy!
Don't be a fool Johnnie!
There's a sniper out there!
And he's got a friend.
It's a Karabiner 98 kurz.
Best damn gun since the wor...that's the 73!
I...
I'm awfully sorry.
Way to go.
You made it.
"How about that, kiddo?"
Excuse me.
Are you the parents of the little boy in the tunnel?
How does it feel to know that Mercy was three minutes--?
Excuse me.
I think you'd better leave.
"Sorry, I'm talking with these people."
"No, you're not."
"Hey, how are you feeling?"
-You made it.
-Just like you promised.
-Thank you.
-It's all right.
You remember Wrigley Field.
We got a date.
Sit down.
Let me finish.
-That one was crooked.
-Yeah?
Next time you can do it yourself.
"-Hey, Mark, thanks."
-For what?
You did all the hard work.
I don't think I could've gone up in that helicopter.
I just got lucky.
No.
You know about kids.
As good as new.
-Where are you going?
-Check for reporters.
Shut up and eat!
That's too much.
I don't want to get fat.
Idiot...
You were supposed to pick me up...
Who is this?
Can't I have friends?
"Friends, sure."
"I'd watch out, if I were you."
"Watch it, you're only here because of me..."
OK OK.
I may as well clearthe table.
"Yeah, and the floortoo please."
Fuck off!
Mom...
Some snacks please.
I love you mom.
You're the best mom of all.
He's depressed.
He doesn't tell fortunes anymore...
I've been looking for a job all day.
I quit the cafe.
Fuck!
Did you get fired?
Boss kept nagging me about being late all the time.
And this military service thing suffocates me.
Shit.
Come here.
Fight at the bar?
Someone threw a bottle?
I got fired from the cafe.
Couldn't pay the rent...
!
For the person I love...
I guess.
Who could she have meant?
What's wrong?
Yikes!
W-Wha...?
What...?
!
You had a frown on your face.
Worried about something?
"Well, this physical is so unexpected..."
It's strange that it's happening when Dr. Kazamaki's away.
I know...
But Ms. Tamahara did check on it...
The Commander probably has his reasons.
Is that so...?
"It's a pain, but..."
We've got to do it.
Hey!
Wait a minute!
What's with that string?
Don't touch me there!
Penalty...?
Why do I have to pose?
"Stop it, I said!"
Follow his orders?
!
Are you serious?
You can't call that a physical!
Wait!
I haven't finished talking!
Dad?
What?
Is it morning?
You were asleep?
"Yeah, I was."
What's going on?
Well...
I wanted to talk about Ryan.
"Yeah, I know, it's cool."
We don't need to discuss it.
"Well, I think we do."
"I mean, I know you're upset, your mother and I are upset."
But our responsibility is... is to our family.
"Yeah, that's okay."
"No, I get it."
"I mean, this is a person's life we're talking about and we need to leave it in the hands of the authorities."
There's no need for sarcasm.
I'm not being sarcastic.
"Well, it's hard to tell sometimes."
Dad... it's okay.
Really.
When you want to talk about it...
"Yeah, I know."
You're the one to talk to.
Got it.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
"Come on, Seth."
"Okay, got it."
"I'll be there in, like, 20 minutes."
Hey.
"That Japanese man- he's a shaman, like me."
Was the woman... wearing white?
Did you see her?
A young woman?
That's her.
...defend us in battle.
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil.
Where is she?
Where's Hyo-jin?
!
Hyo-jin!
What is it?
Where are you headed in the dark of night?
I'm asking you.
Where is my daughter?
Where is she?
Girl about this tall?
Yeah.
Hvo-jm?
That's right.
She's possessed by an evil spirit.
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He's trying to suck her blood dry...
Shut the fuck up!
"Answer me, bitch!"
Where is Hyo-jin?
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?
"At your home, where else?"
She's not home.
She is.
She just got back.
I called them.
Uncle.
Hello uncle.
You should've told me earlier.
I...
Uncle why did you take the trouble?
You should've called me.
What would you like to have?
Black coffee green tea?
Get some water for uncle.
Take a seat don't stand.
Sit.
Sit.
Please.
Ayushman!
What the...
Filmy emotion.
Hit here but the pain's there.
Stop it!
Ayushman!
ACP sir what are you doing?
Get lost.
Listen old man.
Ayushman!
I'm going to skew your son everyday in my jail.
Day-night.
I'll make him suffer slowly.
I'll pressure him to death.
Every time he breathes...
I'll file new charges against him.
I'll make his life hell but won't kill him.
Because people are mistaken about death.
You look like shit.
But your boat looks great.
Yeah.
"I live on my boat, man."
Personal hygiene goes out the window.
A lot of time to work on the place.
BEN:
You should try working on a shower.
NEIL:
Yeah.
"Hey, what can I tell you?"
"Standing on principle, man."
It's all I got.
Cigarette?
"No, I'm good."
"That's right, you quit."
Good for you.
BEN:
So did Janine send you out here to check up on me?
"Yeah, pretty much."
What are you gonna tell her?
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look out here on the ocean.
[LAUGHS]
Break.
Any word from Beth?
"She's so busy organizing her sister's funeral, I think she must be..."
Sister's what?
Her wedding.
Her sister's wedding.
- Isn't that what I said?
- No.
"You said ""funeral."""
"I know, sweetheart."
I know.
Come here.
"Look, I have to debrief Chappelle."
"I'll see you in a minute, okay?"
"Dad, I know about your drug problem."
Why didn't you come to me with this?
Come here.
Come here.
"I'm sorry, baby."
I'm sorry.
I was embarrassed.
"And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't."
I didn't want you to worry.
"Well, is it over?"
"No, not exactly."
"I think I'm going to have to go into a program, and get some help."
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
Chappelle wants me to go into the clinic and get checked out.
"- We'll talk about this later, okay?"
- Okay.
Don't worry.
- I love you.
"- Me, too."
Okay.
Jack.
I'm glad you're back.
It's been difficult without you.
"Thanks, Chloe."
- Chase.
- Yeah.
I'd rather have four honest words than 50 pages of bilge.
"- Now, you play Rose..."
"- No, I play Rose."
And I play Lily.
This script is the best thing I have read in a month of Sundays.
- Don't you think?
- Well...
- Wyndham Best.
I play Johnnie.
- Johnnie?
- The soldier.
- Ah.
"Or the hero, if you will."
...a documentary about the Clydeside dockers.
Right.
Who have we got here?
"Ah, Alex, mind if I join you?"
Documentary makers and authenticity.
- The rancid curds.
"Buckley, just hide me, hide me."
What?
Uncle Frank.
Mr. Hilliard.
- You knew he was gonna be here.
"- Yes, but I didn't expect to be."
- Is she all right?
Avoiding Hilliard.
Unfortunate experience.
- Carnal?
- What?
No.
"Oh, that?"
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Renee!
Let me in.
Where's John?
Ain't he with you?
No.
"What do you mean, ""no""?"
"Cliff, where is he?"
As...
"As soon as I heard the police coming in, I told him to get out."
I screamed at him that he had to go.
But you saw him leave?
"Where is he, then?"
Where's David?
Did he make it back?
He's... waiting for us at Reg's.
"Cliff, please, do the right thing and let him go."
You can take responsibility for this.
- What are you on about?
- David's not like you.
He won't cope in prison.
Give him a chance to get away.
Nobody's going to prison.
Look.
You should have seen what we left behind.
There's enough here.
Grab your case.
Come on.
"I'm staying here, in case John comes back."
Father!
...
Mother!
You killed us all.
- And ... three!
- Higher!
- Hey
"- Higher, higher!"
- You wanna go higher.
Okay everyone back to classes now
I just wanted to do something different.
Yeah.
Well that's definitely different.
- You don't like it?
"- No, I like it, I like it a lot"
"I'm just surprised, that's all."
"- What's going on, Tris?"
- Nothing.
I'm fine.
Just...
Still having nightmares?
No.
We're good.
You and me.
"I know nothing else is, but we are."
Time for chores.
How much longer do we have to stay here for?
Until we know it's safe to leave.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Son!
You can't ignore me forever.
Who's your favorite player?
"Who's your favorite player, Ben?"
"Hey, come on!"
Who's your favorite?
- Mark Grace.
- Mark Grace?
What?
Are you nuts?
Shawon Dunston's the man.
Best shortstop in the game.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Next season I'll take you to Wrigley Field.
"Come on, stick with me!"
Stay here.
I'll take you to Wrigley Field....
"Come on, damn it!"
We'll get a couple of dogs then we'll compare Grace to Dunston.
All right?
There you go.
"Hey, stay up!"
Stay awake!
Keep your head up.
Keep your head above water.
All right.
"All right, so you think that you know a lot about baseball, do you?"
Come on.
All right.
Ask me a question.
Come on.
Ask me a tough one.
Let's go.
Stay with me.
They're probably a bit damp.
"I'll take him the pot too, shall I?"
"Well, I'm sure he hasn't got nothin' that I haven't seen before."
They're nice and warm.
[Speaking Polish] Hmm?
- Danke schon.
- Oh.
English - thank you.
Thank you.
Polnisch - dziekuje.
I see.
"I'll just, um... leave the door ajar."
And I'm going to get my knitting.
Why are you creeping about?
I'm not creeping about.
I'm just...
Ollendorff and I are going to speak to him.
"- What, now?"
- Yes.
He might be asleep.
"Well, if he is, I won't."
What's the matter with you?
I think he's Polish.
What?
"He used the word ""Polnisch."""
"Well, why didn't you say so?"
Neither of us speak Polish; we haven't even been to Poland.
"Hopeless, Ursula."
"Shh, shush!"
When did he say it?
Don't push!
[Footsteps]
The clinic called.
They said my ass was a perfect match for your hand.
They can start the skin grafts next week.
"Reese, what do you think you're doing?"
-What?
He loves the stuff.
He goes through three or four cans a day.
I don't know how he does it.
Half a can makes me nuts.
Based on true events
"- Well done, Casper."
- Let me have a go.
- Happy with the flat?
"- Yes, two floors."
I love it.
"One floor is Mia's, the other is mine."
"- Splash, Frank!"
The champ.
- I'm off.
- Where to?
- Some sort of lunch at the Gimp's.
- No change in Bodil?
"- No, she's a wreck."
- What's wrong with Bodil?
- She's suffered brain damage.
- Up here?
"- In the brain, yes."
Surprise.
- How did it happen?
- She choked on a giant olive.
- This big.
Have you seen a... wet boy running around here?
He's lost.
And he's truly in a lot of trouble.
"We have witnessed no moist children of the masculine variety gallivanting within these halls, no."
"Oh, hey, Poll."
How's it going?
Oh...
"Hi, Matt."
"You, er, you thought about what I asked you?"
"Yes, actually, I have..."
And?
"All right, you can shag me."
But only once.
You're lucky Bruce is in Guatemala.
Fine.
I'll be around later.
"Can't allow our friends to be naked alone, Matthew."
It's just not cricket.
Got ya...
They're beautiful.
"Oh, thanks."
I do them myself.
Do you?
Yeah.
So you could do me... now?
Sure... if you're up for it.
Does it hurt?
Beautifully.
What are you getting?
A mark...
Passion...
Want...
"Hey, George."
Gary?
Where the hell have you been?
I've been leaving messages for months.
"- I know, I've been busy."
- Don't give me busy.
Who's not busy?
I'm busy.
We're all busy.
Everybody's busy.
All right.
Tell me.
What's kept you so busy?
Mostly chemotherapy.
"Hey, I'll see you."
"Hey, pig!"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
So you called the cop a pig?
I was yelling at the litterbug.
"I mean, this is my town."
You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
"So, didn't you explain that to the cop?"
"No, I fled the scene."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Kramer, I need to talk to Jerry privately."
What about?
- Kramer.
"- Oh, come on, George you can share it with me."
- You're hurting me.
- You gonna share with me next time?
- Sure.
"Why, King Triton!"
[Chuckles] How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance!
She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I...
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
[Ursula laughs]
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you."
"Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
"Eric, what are you doing?"
"Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!
- [Ursula laughs]
- No!
"Oh, no!"
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
- [Cackles]
- You!
You monster!
That's paper inside.
Paper?
Paper for...
Our first anniversary.
"Oh my god, it's tonight."
- I don't even know what to say.
"- Don't worry, you've been so busy."
"No, please."
Don't make excuses for me.
I will make this up to you.
You promise to do ...
What's on the paper?
My love for you.
Sealed forever.
It's pretty dark out there huh?
Oh my God!
I love it.
I love you.
You're welcome.
Thanks for telling me.
He made me promise.
Sneak.
You do everything your big brother tells you?
Yeah right.
"I'm I'd listened to him, I wouldn't be such a fuck up and you two never would've met."
Can't fault you on that one.
Alright.
- I'm gonna get outta your hair.
"- No, no."
No rush.
I uh...
I gotta go change anyway.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
-lf he does anything...
-Like?
Anything weird or bizarre...
Anything.
Anything evil!
(sighs)
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
(sighs)
(SCOFFS)
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
(sighs) I gotta do this.
I gotta do this.
"No, I am gonna go to work."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a little bit.
Just a tad.
He won't even know I was here.
(MELLOW ROCK SONG playing)
(TlCKlNG)
You just scared the hell out of me.
"Sorry, I..."
"I was just, I was..."
Nothing.
That's a...
Nice heels.
"Yeah, my feet were hurting, so I..."
Look at my face!
- What's it called?
"- Oh, God."
Perspirex.
"Hello, it's Marco."
Remember me?
Of course.
- How are you?
- Naked.
I should buy some clothes.
This is all I have.
I could go to your house and get what you need.
"No, I don't want anything from there."
Maybe later.
- Where are we going?
- To Sybilla.
- You must think I'm mad.
- Why?
- I don't ever want to go back home.
"- No, I understand."
"When we broke up,"
I couldn't carry on sleeping in the same bed.
- I slept on the couch.
- Yeah?
"I did that for over a week, until I decided to buy a new bed."
So you're single.
I'm alone.
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
We have to talk after the fight.
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You.
Not me.
All right.
Here they come.
All right.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Come on.!
Come on.!
"Come on, Island Hoppers.!"
Let's go.!
"Come on, Island Hoppers.!"
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
"I'm telling you, I don't know where it is."
I buried it under a Bougainvillea Priscilla.
But that was a year ago.
The whole garden's changed since then.
"Ain't buying' it, Roger."
The sun's almost gone down and the race is over.
"If you don't get that money before they close this place, there's gonna be something else planted here."
What's with the tender loving care?
Pull it up!
"Nine, 10, 11, 12..."
Thirteen!
There's 13 riders ahead of him!
This is ridiculous!
It's okay.
He can still win.
There's still 60 miles to go.
Tom!
"Come on, Magnum!"
- Come on!
I led him to Minks' daughter.
What if something goes wrong?
How long will you stay?
A week?
A month?
"Then you'll be gone, and I'll be free for slaughter."
You are already.
Gentlemen...
Nowthe back.
What if he doesn't get in touch?
Don't worry.
He won't pass up this opportunity.
Go on.
Talk to her.
Irezumi!
"Take the suitcase to Convention Center, place it in a van with the number 1969."
We have to put something in it.
"Lynn's tattoo, the 3rd Hiromitsu."
When's the exchange?
- Midnight.
Just one more hour.
Come on.
I'm here.
Do you have me?
I see you.
The transmitter's working.
Midnight.
"Okay, Poscher, let's go."
Take the suitcase and get out.
Check if one of the vans has the number 1969.
I got it.
Try the doors.
Yes.
"Well, I have at last heard ""yes""."
So... that's enough.
And I'm happy.
So we'll go back to Paris.
(LISZT AND MARIE ARGUING)
(BABY SCREAMS)
Sophie!
Will you please take them for a walk?
Throw them in the Seine!
I don't care!
So George has caught another butterfly.
Why shouldn't he fall in love with her?
He hasn't fallen in love.
He has succumbed to her.
The poor man was simply standing there and was crushed under her wheels.
It's not too late.
"Franz, you must go over at once and talk to him."
Please.
Excellent.
Thank you.
Show me.
That is perfect.
Thank Monsieur Villon for me.
We can be off.
Franz.
I...
I didn't know you were back.
- Countess.
- You're going out?
"Er, yes, I'm just leaving."
The Etudes are published.
Damn.
- Damn it.
- What are you doing?
I'll talk to the pilot shit!
Who's there?
Who is This fly ...?
Open the damn door!
Addons
- Open the damn door!
- Please return to your seat.
Fuck you!
I do not want to sit down!
Addons
- Open the door!
- Go back to your seat ...
Addons This is your last warning.
Open the door!
Let me in!
I said let me go.
If you there ...
Let me go.
Why no answer?
"Addons like breaking the rules, and I ignored the instructions."
Addons I have no choice to start a sentence.
A penalty?
Afraid that ...
Does it look like I care?
I will never play again.
"All my friends Addons Dave, will be selected."
What are you doing?
Rory?
Addons We will visit your friend Rory ...
"Hey, boy."
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Hey.
I know you did.
"I missed you, too."
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?
"OK, let's get something to eat."
Let me see what we got here.
Let me see.
"Chicken, liver, beefy beef."
Come in.
What up?
"Got you your mail... bills, bills, Upscale, Jet."
"Michael, I can talk to Ellington."
Watch.
"Man, this is crazy."
You barked.
The dog barked.
"Trippin', Jeff."
That's right.
You can't hear me talk to Ellington.
"Michael, something happened to me."
I can touch a book and for thirty seconds... know and do everything in the book.
"I mean, grab any book in this house."
All right.
Jet.
I know you ain't read this one yet.
Touch it.
Put a stop to this madness right quick.
"OK, page twenty."
"Good Lord, what are you doing?"
"Nibet, you still have a lot to learn."
- Excuse me.
- Sir?
- The Number 10?
- To your right.
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Why am I in the garden?
Someone tried to suffocate you with the gas from the kitchen.
But the gas has been cut for two days.
You have not seen the men at work?
I have.
You escaped the worst.
How are you?
I do not know.
I feel drunk.
You have to walk.
Stand up.
Come on.
Breathe deeply.
Go ahead.
I remember.
- They gave me an injection.
- An injection?
Same as your brother: a soporific.
The man who pushed the needle was dressed in black.
Fantômas...
Fantômas?
"Ah, yes, the list."
Were you looking for dr.
Shep--
Are you a good girl?
I-- What?
A good girl.
I don't mean perfect.
I mean...
Relatively speaking.
- Are you?
- Yes.
How many sexual partners have you had?
I won't judge.
Six.
"No, s-seven."
K-kinda six.
But kinda seven.
- Criminal record?
- Speeding ticket.
- How fast?
- 12 miles over.
That's fast.
"Well, it wasn't too-- it wa-- it was way too fast."
But I was-
- I was downhill and I was-
- I was-
"- I was coasting, ma'am."
Now I don't suppose you can tell me...
Where the gift shop is?
"First floor, east wing."
It's like pudding in here.
This is exactly why I don't do this procedure.
"I mean, you're living with broken legs for months."
"Now, who is ready for their yoga?"
My name's Jason.
Jason.
"Pleasure, hi."
Nice.
Cynthia.
Hi.
Can't wait.
"Hello, Cynthia."
"Yes, we have a brave peacock."
Use that.
Yes.
Yes.
"Hi, you must be Veronica."
Hi.
"Yeah, how did you know?"
"Why, I have read that you have studied the yoga for five years."
"Oh, well, I mean, just off and on, you know, before the kids came."
Nonsense.
"You know, there is such thing called the muscle memory?"
"And I could tell by looking at your gait, your muscles remember."
Thank you.
Yes.
"Okay, we are going to do the children's position."
What's that?
"Head down, buttocks up."
Everybody on your mats.
"Yeah, that's good."
That's good.
Very nice posture.
Yes.
Encouragement.
-Go fuck yourself!
"Let me handle this, Jemina."
-Go handle the garbage!
"See his ""use, Senna?"
It's red and round like a clown's nose.
They must've had a clown for a boss.
Let go!
I can't breath.
My nasal cavities are built that way.
No more kiddy games.
Get in the garbage can.
I'll let go of your nose.
Damn you...
Need help?
"Jemina, I've got to go."
Peku went to get more birds and the cops took him.
You're talking to me again!
Peku is out of the game now that he's in the can.
Of course he is.
"Did I, like, win?"
-Maybe.
LEVEL 2
Give him a shot when he wakes up.
Remember how?
-Yeah.
Where am I?
-In the bar.
It hurts.
-Would this help?
I'd rather take a bottle of rum.
-Coming up.
"You're a nice girl, Jemina."
"Okay, I ran away."
Last party.
- Our records this long.
Something did.
"- OK, Shaolin."
"- Then you do not have a problem, right?"
"- Yes, no problem."
Who is this idiot?
- The Car Go down
- Fuck!
Damn!
Let's See!
Oyanalıyor know?
Ez on the guy!
Now!
Do it!
John?
!
- Out of the fingerprint is the output?
- No.
Nothing.
Every place cleaned up.
- What computer?
Nothing can be recovered?
- I do not know.
I can not understand.
Need to take to the center.
Out there can handle.
"- Hey, I play it."
"Yan says the woman in the office, 2 staff leaving devoted to one before."
"Young like, maybe in the 20s."
Long brown hair.
I promise you.
Pinkie swear.
Okay.
Enough.
Shit!
"Fun, huh?"
What's the worst that could happen?
Life is hard when you don't know who you are.
It's harder when you don't know what you are.
My love carries a death sentence.
"I was lost for years, searching while hiding only to find that I belong to a world hidden from humans."
I won't hide any more.
I will live the life I choose.
"This is not the day to piss me off, kid."
"I told you, man."
I wasn't even there.
Because I was banging your old lady.
"- Yo, Dy."
Dyson.
- He broke my arm.
- Just breathe.
-It's not broken.
"- Breathe, breathe, breathe."
-It's just dislocated.
What's gotten under your collar?
- See?
All better now.
- You got fleas?
You okay?
Ready and begin.
Yes!
Bust it!
Miss...
- Doctor!
- Mr. Santarelli...
- What happened?
- Something... something terrible!
Three men kidnapped me.
"- Oh, God..."
- Three men?
- Yes...
No!
- What is it?
"No, it's not possible."
It's impossible!
What?
The three men...
were you and your friends!
Me?
I can't forgive your prank this time!
"It wasn't funny, you understand?"
- I'll have you thrown in jail.
- It wasn't us!
Twenty years in prison!
People don't do this for a joke!
You're thugs!
Criminals!
"No, you mustn't call."
What are you doing?
Of course I'm calling.
"Okay, I confess, I was with my friends."
"Ah, he confesses at last."
Of course.
I can't bear to see you with Dr. Cicchirini...
I'll start getting bigger in a few weeks.
You can hang around with someone else then.
No fellas'll come near us if one of us is pregnant.
"So, Sharon, who you havin' it for?"
I can't tell.
Sorry.
Sharon.
Give us a hint.
- No.
- Just a little one.
Do we know him?
You're scarlet.
We must know him.
Is he married?
- Jesus!
"- No, he's not."
I'll bet you he is.
- Is he in here?
"- Jesus, Yvonne!"
Would you do it with anyone here?
I was only asking!
"You're right, though."
"Sorry for insulting you, Sharon."
"Seriously, though, Sharon."
Do we really not know him?
No.
Swear to God.
Where did yous...
"Look, I don't want to talk about it, all right?"
"Let's get pissed, will we?"
"Oh, yeah."
Young Sharon's after getting herself up the pole.
A little too rich for my blood.
Maybe they fell out of your pocket— or maybe Cindy's.
"Now, you go home and you sleep... and you wake up and you guide the traffic through this town... and everything will be the way it was."
I'm taking him in tomorrow morning at 6:00.
That's in a few hours.
"I'd like you to come with me, Ray."
There's nothing I can say?
Okay.
Then 6:00 it is.
Yeah.
"No, Lis."
Who was he supposed to call?
Ray knows everybody.
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone?
What?
You know what?
"Okay, fine."
Why don't you go home?
I mean...
"I wanna be here for you, Freddy, but—"
"Lisa's nervous, you know."
She's pregnant.
- I mean—
"- So, go on."
I'll be fine.
Yeah.
"You be careful, Freddy."
Yeah.
You too.
Shut the fuck up!
"Would ya, please?"
But I didn't mean nobody to get killed.
Quit stalling.
Who paid ya to do it?
Hanley and Grayce.
How did you frame him?
I socked his head.
Then planted the liquor in the car.
Yeah.
Then started the car and then jumped out.
"Yeah, I did, but I didn't mean to have nobody get killed."
[GUNFIRE]
Have you heard enough?
"Plenty, Stacey."
And thanks.
"Okay, pal."
That's just what I hoped.
[GUNSHOTS]
[EXPLOSION]
"I'm all right, Frank."
"Stacey, you can't wash out on me now."
I need you.
I'll get you out of here.
"I'm going out, pal."
My way.
I wanna tell you something.
[GUNFIRE]
"That dame of yours is the one that sprung ya, not me."
Take care of her.
She's worth it.
I think I can hold 'em!
"No hurry now, Dale."
"So long, kid."
He likes to take me because I know all of his business partners.
It's just...
It's easy for him.
What's he do for a living?
He's an entertainment lawyer.
Mmm!
[Smacks lips] Mmm!
- Is he rich?
- Does it matter?
I don't know.
Does it matter to you?
"If it mattered, I'd be with him, and I'm not."
I'm with you.
[Laughs]
I told my friends about you.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
What did you say?
- That you're crazy...
- [Laughs]
And that I'm having a sexual awakening with you.
Wow.
A sexual awakening.
I told them that I've never come so much in my life.
[Laughs]
"Oh, wait a second."
Even more than with Paul?
- Way more than Paul.
- Yeah.
Paul was too big.
I couldn't take it unless I was really drunk.
What's wrong?
Please.
Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacksin there.
"Yeah, in there."
So your name's Henry and...
"Okay, what a good news is that you gonna a while."
"Bad news is that in this case,"
"""a while"" means 20, 30 minutes tops, Henry."
"Unless you're very, very lucky."
Which you are.
Uncle Jimmy is gonna take you to his lab.
Hang on.
"Ah, Shit."

Unplug yourself.

And a six.
Pair of threes still best.

- Yeah!
Yeah.
"Hey, if you get a chance, can you take a look at it for me?"
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal...
-...the poor box?
-Ha.
That's an insult.
I got a vow of poverty.
"Where'd you get it, then?"
I stole it.
I believe you.
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.
I figure I saved him from a big temptation.
"Oh, Christ!"
I should have been there.
I wasn't there.
Should have been.
There was nothing you could do.
Lie down.
Give me the butt.
Come on.
-Now you think you can sleep?
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
-No.
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
"Now, shut up and go to sleep."
Good night.
"""Just tell her we're getting married""?"
"Oh, my God."
He's only 20 years old.
I've never even heard of this girl.
And how does that make you feel?
"Uh, ""my mom got married young... and still regrets it."""
That ought to do it.
"""Are you trying to tell me something?""..."
"What, is she stupid?"
"""Just that we should slow down."""

Thanks for letting me borrow this.
Oh.
What did you think of my mall walk mix?
Not bad.
A little surprised by all the Justin bieber.
Really?
I love her.
He's a guy.
They keep saying that.
But I'm not buying it.
What am I gonna do?
I-I broke them up.
He's gonna hate me.
"Oh, will."
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
"But first, did you bring the flower?"
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
"But since you don't have it,"
I'm gonna need that kiss.

Pull her up.
Is she dying?
"She might, I..."
Which is why this is gonna hurt.

You broke her arm!
It'll trigger the healing process.
I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.

You make a good Batman.
"Oh, my God."
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
It's either a cat leg or a finger.
It's freaking me out.
Let's just get out of here before these people get home.
"Axl, we can't stop now!"
"We have come all this way, and why?"
For aunt Edie!
To give her the one thing in her life
She has always dreamed of!
Wait!
I remember!
It was a book.
You buried a book?
No.
"It was in a ""Nancy Drew"" book."
"She buried a time capsule,"
"And I always thought that I should do it,"
And I never did.
I'm digging a lot bigger hole.
I'll tell you one case Nancy Drew's not gonna solve!
Who's out there?
"Ooh, run!"
Run!
"Oh, look."
"Oh, ms."
Rinsky's here...
In our meeting.
Wow.
You look so pretty.
Is that a new top?
No.
Thank you for coming down.
"Whenever parents have a complaint,"
"Wow, in stereo."
Great.
Thanks.
You ready to go?
"Hey, perfect timing."
"- How is it, haole?"
- Shamu.
What's with the stick?
You got slammed in a cruncher?
"- Um, I don't know what that means."
- Sand facial.
"You ate a big one, huh?"
There was no surfing accident.
"He, uh, busted his knee getting out of bed."
- How white can you get?
- Pretty white.
- Who's this?
"- This is my sister, Mary."
"- Mary, meet Kamekona."
- Hey.
This is the reason I called.
I want a friendly face to make sure she stays put.
"Oh, come on."
You want me to babysit your little sister?
- Correct.
"- Shoots, small kine."
"She doesn't leave this office, you under..."
"Whoa, whoa!"
Hold on.
Seriously?
What if I have to use the bathroom?
- Don't spill.
Dori!
Dori!
"Dori, you're here."
Why is he here?
Do you know this dog?
"Yes, he's Dori."
Somebody abandoned him.
Do you know the owners?
"Yes, I've seen them here before."
They abandoned him?
"Yes, I think so."
I couldn't find the owners.
So my uncle decided to raise him.
Really?
That's terrible.
How could they abandon Dori?
That's his name?
Yes.
"We didn't know, so we named him Ocean."
"Oh, you did?"
"Dori, what's happened to you?"
Will you keep him?
"Yes, my uncle is fond of dogs."
And he's just a little puppy.
That's better for him.
Huh?
It's better than being raised in Seoul.
"Dori, are you alright?"
Do you like it here?
Don't you miss your owner?
Some owners they are for ditching him.
The crazy bastards.
- Send them in.
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, come on."
Hats off.
"Well, what do you want?"
Why aren't you at your work?
"Well, Mr. Thompson, sir, we wanted to ask you."
Please don't fire Miss Griffith.
Get back to your work.
"- But, Mr. Thompson, please--"
"- Get back to your work, I said."
This is no Boy Scout camp.
Those days are over.
This is a reformatory.
Now get back where you belong.
You can't do that.
Oh.
Can't I?
"Now the rest of you boys, get out of here."
You stay.
I'll show you what I can do.
- Watch that door.
- Okay.
"It don't work, huh?"
Shh.
"Not so much noise, you guys."
Are you crazy?
We got enough food here to feed all the kids in the dormitory.
Shh!
Here comes somebody.
- It's Charlie.
- Get away from that door.
- God dang.
The things I would do to that.
- You gonna talk to her or what?
- I don't know.
- Show us your tits!
"- What the fuck, Lance?"
- You stupid idiot.
- It's all good.
- Seriously?
- They're leaving.
Great going.
- Come on.
Don't be like this.
Come back.
"- Fucking idiot, dude."
- Hold on one second.
"- Well, well, well."
- Hey.
"- Hi, honey."
What are you troublemakers up to?
- Just hanging out.
- Yeah?
Hanging out?
- That's all we're doing.
I swear.
- Where's your dad?
Fuck if I know.
"- You know, you're getting yourself quite a reputation around here."
"- Come on, Jacob."
"- Hey, Jacob."
"- All right, whatever."
- Shoot.
For sure.
Bye.
Drake set it up for Saturday.
Sweet.
Good.
Now I can get some sleep.
What?

he hit me up like three times today.
He's freaking crazy.
Stop for a minute.
What?
This boy Erin's seeing-- do you know anything about him?
Yeah.
He's-- he's new in town.
He works for Garret.
He's a fighter?
I guess so.
Could you deal with him?
I already have once.
smartass.
Yeah.
Why?
The word's up somebody's trying to book him some big money fights.
I was thinking of bringing some of my friends in.
l want to make sure you can take this guy.
Set it up.
This is it?
What the fuck were you expecting?
It's a private bout.
Come on.
This should be interesting.

Where's the tunnel then?
We've passed it.
When?
Someone's been sleeping!
Where is it?
"We've passed it, back near Biston."
We're heading nowhere.
Read the address to see where it is.
How many times do I have to read it?
"After the junction, we take a winding road."
This is the winding road.
We're on it.
"After this road, we head downhill."
Then there's a single tree.
"Thank you, Roko."
"Look at it, a real champion."
- Thank you.
- No problem.
"Come on, folks!"
Come and get it!
"Hello, 13 Ribarska St."
What do you say?
"Out here, all the fish is as big as this one."
"I'd like to ask you something, if I can..."
"No, you can't."
What devil brings you here?
Praise the Lord.
Now and forever.
"It was opened, so I came in for a prayer."
Do you need any help?
"Thank you, my child."
I'm done.
Sister...
I'd like to give a donation to your church... if I may.
You may... of course you may.
We pass this on to the Child Care Centre.
Here.
My child...
Thank you.
On behalf of them.
What brings you here?
"Have you come alone, or..."
I'm alone.
My child...
"If you need anything, just ask."
"Thank you, Sister."
"Yes, I'm going to the fields to get my things."
Where's the engineer from?
Tehran or Hamadan?
"Get up, you've slept enough, you layabouts."
"Get up, I've brought fresh apples."
This is for Ali and this one for Keyvan.
- Hello.
"- Hello, are you well?"
I have some fresh bread for you.
- What is it?
- Bread.
We have fresh bread.
What more can you want?
You won't have another chance like this.
This is for me.
The big apple is for uncle Jahan.
How about that!
This isn't Jahan's apple.
I think it's yours.
"Yes, yes, it's coming."
Here.
All right.
- Have you had your share?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
To school.
- To school?
- Yes.
Do you have time to show us the village?
"No, I have exams."
I'll go with you to school.
All right.
John.
I want you to be happy.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
Yes.
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?

Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
I killed them for you.
You did it for yourself.
"Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you.
And you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
I promise.
JESS:
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
Are you ready?

Do you remember the coat?
- No.
- You do so!
You used to keep it spotless except for your dandruff.
- I didn't have dandruff.
- You did so!
"After you bought it, you stopped trying... to get me to go into the fields with you."
"It was the best contraceptive... ever invented, that coat."
It's in the attic.
How are ya?
"How are ya, Sharon?"
I'm pregnant.
Did I tell yous?
Ha ha ha!
"Yeah, well, I am."
She's bleedin' serious!

"Yeah, Sharon."
Congrats.
"Thanks, Mary."
"Well done, Sharon, ya thick bitch, ya."
"Jesus, though, Sharon."
I know.
"It's terrible, really."
"- How long you gone, Sharon?"
- Sixteen weeks.
You don't look it.
I do.
I won't argue.
You're the expert.
I'm only messin'.
I never left you.
I could have lived with you.
And him.
Love cannot be wrong.
"But I will leave him, if it means losing you."
I give my life to you.
Tilo!
Tilo!
- Are you OK?

Are you OK?

The spices know you will never leave them.
"Doug, I'm not leaving."
You're staying with me.

This is my home.

Sure.
You know I do.
"Don't worry about anything, okay?"
Don't tell me that.
Evening.

She's beautiful.
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?
-Just today.
-Had to be.
What was that?
-There's a damn cat up there.
"-Oh, yeah."
"Hey, they sound a lot like babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?"
"Yes, they do."
"Well, I expect I ought to get back to work."
"Yeah, well, we all got to sometime, that's for sure."
That's for sure.
Take care now.
"Yeah, I'll do that."
"Frank, get over here!"
"Oh, my God!"
What happened to the light?
I hit him!
I hit him!
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!
Get on the phone.
Call an ambulance.

You try it.
"Come on, Michael, it don't hurt."
Give me your hand.
Mete Tu mano right there.
"Watch that, the water."
"Yeah, just like..."
Hold it right there.
"Wait for him, wait for him."
Ah!
You see that?
Yeah.
Bites.
Told you.
"Hey, um..."
"And thank you too, for sending me those pictures..."
While I was up north.
I don't know if I thanked you for that.
You're welcome.
Stop.
Just make sure you don't ride the clutch too much.
"You want to give her a break every once in a while,"
So she can last.
You pay for all this.
Otherwise you'll be back spending your money.
(Angela) Thank you.
You're welcome.
"(Hector) Manny, it's okay, papa, I'll close her out."
You sure?
"Yeah, esta bien."
(Radio playing music)
(Dance music on television)
There you go.
"This beautiful, exquisite, amazing..."
Uh...!
What?
What?
Um...
Did you know that you have a thing
- What?
- on... on your back?
Like a...
like a freckle?
Like a mole.
Is it gross?
"It's,uh,um..."
It's pretty big.
You need a doctor to look at this.
"Okay,yeah,um, you know what?"
"Uh,we should get out."
Come on.
You know what I want to do?
I want to go on the computer and check out one of those medical sites.
"I mean,I'm sure that it's nothing, but I'm gonna worry about it until I know for sure."
How could such an ugly mole end up on such a foxy lady?
Nature screwed up.
Come on.
Thank you for being so sweet to me.
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
Come on.
Bella?
Hey.
Don't hurt me.
Please.
Please.
Call her.
What?
Your mother.
Hello?
Mom?
Is that you?
"Are you all right, sweetheart?"
"I want to come home, Mom."
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
You will.
"You will, soon."
But first I need to explain to you why I wasn't there to protect you.
What are you talking about?
It wasn't your fault that--
Yes.
"Yes, it was."
I need to explain to you why I did the things I did.
"I have an addiction, and it kept me from being the mother I should have been for you."
An addiction?
Why are you--
"No, no, don't interrupt me, please."
You just need to listen.
Listen carefully.
I know you're brave.
I know you don't cry.
But you need to come home.
Come back to our house.
He's not gonna let me.
So how come you are here?
I just came here for dinner.
"Anyway, I saw your designs."
Lovely.
They are awesome.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You hid the secret for so long.
"Well, Vivek, I tried to show you my designs before."
But..
I couldn't show it.
"What do you mean, couldn't show it?"
I don't understand.
Shall we meet tomorrow and talk?
Few things I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
I will see you then.
- See you.
"Ma'am, hold on."
I will give it.
Take this.
"Sir, here is your lemonade and honey."
And towel.
You didn't bring today's newspaper?
"Sir, I am searching for today's newspaper since yesterday."
Shall I bring yesterday's newspaper?
Yes.
"If possible, bring a few years' old newspaper."
Bring 30-40 years' old.
- Bishop Allen.
- Tilt up.
Tilt up.
There they are.
- Those guys were great.
- I say hi and then they say hi.
- This song was stuck in my head after.
"- Yeah, I love this song."
It's a great song.
It's a great song.
- This is one of my favorite...
- Is that her?
- That was the girl in the background.
- It was?
Here's one my favorite Ari Graynor moments.
Here it comes.
What?
Can we get a ride?
"- Oh, that's..."
- That's you.
"Is that ""we""?"
Here it comes.
"Sorry, Tris, the car's full."
- It is full.
- Is she gonna hiccup or something?
Are you mad at me?
What I love about that is the gum that's...
The gum is just about to fall out of your mouth.
You look so messy.
It's like Andy Capp.
"Remember the impossible, like, cigarette dangling?"
That's like you and the gum.
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you."
Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now.
"If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions."
Come forward and answer me now.
Are you the person inside of Regan?
Who are you?
-Help me!
- Let go!
Father Karras?
Have we met?
"No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell."
That you look like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's this all about?
It's true.
You do look like a boxer.
How?
Knocked him on the head.
And who's speaking?
"Ah, Yuri Nikolayevich!"
Meet you?
All right!
"Hey, man with a mustache!"
"Maria Vasilyevna, how are you?"
"I've been watching you for a long time, by the way."
It's hard to recognize you.
Good for you!
Hi.
And what's this round thing?
This round thing.
- You bought a cake?
"- No, it's a hat."
"Right, it's time."
Soon the last ones will fall down.
- Are we waiting for someone?
"- No, nobody."
And the flowers?
For you.
What?
No way!
God forbid!
Take them away!
I'm not some young girl!
What's so bad about it?
It's interesting.
"The interesting is around the corner to the left, as my granddaughter says."
"Come on, Maria Vasilyevna!"
"Look, what's going on?"
I don't feel very well.
What the hell is that?
"Ok, I'm gonna call 911."
"Come on, pick up that goddamn phone."
I think I need something to eat.
"Please hang up, and try your call again."
"Please hang up now, this is a recording."
"Please hang up, and tr..."
Krista.
Oh no!
No!
Is he dead?
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Make it sure he stays that way.
Where will she go now?
I don't know.
- Think.
- I don't know!
They are all dead!
My entire family is... dead.
Not yet.
But the sun is coming up soon.
Let's go.
She's hanging out with a different crowd now.
Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver?
"Van Sciver Incorporated, how can I direct your call, hello?"
Hello?
Krista.
All you have to do is die.
Welcome to the family.
Family?
I suppose?
Nazi bastard.
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?
It's a red-brick wing.
St. Mike's.
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?
He's there all the time.
"He has black hair, and he's intense-looking."
Damien Karras.
That's his office behind St. Mike's.
He's our psychiatric counselor.
"Had a pretty rough knock last night, poor guy."
His mother passed away.
"She was living by herself, and I guess she was dead a couple days before they found her."
Cunting hun!
Bloody damn butchering Nazi pig!
Stop it!
I'll kill you!
Aah!
Leave him alone!
Get out!
Get out!
[Shouting]
What's the matter with you?
What's for dessert?
You sleeping?
[Drunken singing]
Whoa!
"Steady, big fella."
Ok.
Is Mrs Ransom in?
"Yes, but I'm afraid she can't see anyone at the moment."
Then I'll wait.
"Please, couldn't you come back tomorrow?"
Mumsie...
Mumsie won't be in the least surprised to see me.
- Been rather an evening.
May I?
"- Yes, of course..."
No!
- It's bad!
Gone off!
Flies!
"- All right, all right!"
- (Door opens)
- It's Mumsie.
(Dennis) Good evening.
"Well, don't look so surprised."
"You expected me earlier, or did more pressing engagements banish it from your mind?"
"No, no, no..."
Of course I expected you.
- Won't you have a drink?
"- No, thank you."
- Your daughter warned me.
- Did she?
"Ethel, come here."
Excuse me.
Certainly.
Oh.
How did he escape?
- Who?
"- Dennis, girl."
"O come, let us adore him"
Don't forget the corkscrew.
"O come, let us adore him"
And have a cigar.
Thanks.
O Come all ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant
"O come ye, O come ye"
To Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
"Here's a present for you, Joey."
Take it.
Take it.
"It's Christmas, Joey."
"""Merry Christmas to Joey, from the gang."""
Open it.
I'll open for you.
"Come on, Joey, play."
Air raid!
Air raid!
Everybody out of the barracks!
Not on Christmas Eve.
You must get out.
"For your own good, you must get out."
And put out those candles.
Come on.
Let's hit the slit trenches.
I'll bet it's a phony again.
The Pentagon will hear about this.
- I'm not really built for war.
- Get out here.
"Oh, no, you can't really do that, Billy."
- It'd be weird.
"- No, it won't be."
"- Here, give me your hands."
"- Billy, what are you..."
"Come on, just look at me."
"Come on, T, look at me."
Come on.
Look at me.
Look at me.
"You're not looking at me, T."
"Billy, please don't..."
"Come on, give me those blue circles, girl."
Come on.
That's what I'm talking about.
"I love you, T."
I...
Love... you.
Oh.
"No, it's not like that."
It's not.
It is like that.
"I love you, T."
"You're an amazing partner, but you're an even better friend."
Okay.
"- Oh, no."
- You even took a bullet for me.
"We don't really have to do this right now, okay?"
"I do, T. We all do, you know?"
"Two coffees, one with four pumps of caramel."
"Rosemary, give me your hands."
"Rosemary, you make delicious coffees."
"Jeez, not again."
Eva?
I'll have a look.
"Come on, shug?"
Hi.
Hello.
Hot.
Yeah.
"Um, dad's inside."
Mum too.
Ok.
But I'm glad to catch you.
Better get these iceblocks inside.
This won't take long.
Had us all quite worried that day you disappeared.
I told mum I was sorry.
Where'd you go?
Streets around Uncle Malcolm's.
I spoke to a bus driver.
Apparently a girl who looked a lot like you caught a bus out here that afternoon.
So?
So it wasn't you?
No.
I really gotta go.
Your father was quite desperate to find you.
He thought ms murnane may have harmed you.
She killed thom.
"He broke in, which was wrong, searching her house for you."
We found the jacket there.
I saw the news.
"Before he went over, I was talking to him on the phone."
So?
"-Goodbye, Amadeo."
-To you I do not salute to you.
He is amiable...
The cut practiced and the blood has been horrible.
I say to you that it is not possible...
"Boys, you watch."
"Is not the dandy, that of there?"
The dandy?
It seems a closet.
That enormous one?
He comes towards here.
"But, who is?"
We hope that he does not see us.
I already am in charge to flee.
Calm and caradura.
"No, calm and swollen face?"
you do not see as it is?
"Hello, Paulino."
Dr. Sughirini...
Ceggirini...?
-Dr.
Cichhirini?
-Yes.
He is there.
He is.
He is.
With permission.
"When they act thus, it would give a beating them."
It remembers that today we must go to gather the new car...
-Dr.
Cicchirini?
-Yes?
You were lucky.
But if you go out.
you'll die like a dog.
Where is she?
She's in a place where you can never find her.
Never.
Where?
Outside your apartment.
"Hello, you've reached Nathalie Thomas who's not here for now, or only in this bi-dimensional, digital and pixelised version..."
Hello.
Mom.
You're calling me?
- Yes.
It's the first time.
No.
I've called you before.
No.
Really.
It's the first time in eight years.
I would have called.
But...
I would have come to the hospital.
but they had already brought you home and said you had to rest.
What got into you.
Thomas?
I was worried.
At least.
You're OK.
That's what's important.
How are you feeling?
You look good.
- I'm fine.
This is a gift offriendship.
Good luck!
"Jenny, take cover!"
Don't move!
Jenny!
Jenny!
Dumbo!
- Give me a gun!
- Here!
How good a shot are you?
I'm a cop.
I have to be good!
"We've been through so much, and I don't even know your name."
Is it important?
"Whether we win or lose, you won't be around."
I'd like to have a name to rememberyou by.
Would you rather see me dead or set free?
"Neither, iffate spares us."
You're a hell ofa good friend.
Just remember me as Mickey Mouse.
Why not?
Leave her alone!
She's innocent!
Drop your gun!
"You heard me, hurry up!"
Jeffrey!
"Where are you,Jeffrey?"
"Don't be afraid,Jenny."
I'm in front ofyou.
Drop your gun!
"Jenny, don't move an inch!"
Don't hurt her.
It's heavy.
- More?
- Much more.
This man hasn't had a bath since the last time he fell off the boat.
Change of plans.
Going straight from Uncle Frank's Mayday to wounded Johnnie fixing the propeller.
"Hurry up, Rex."
We need you over here.
"Yes, sir."
Corning.
Quick as I can.
"Right, what can I do for you, sir?"
"Right, be careful."
Careful.
"And watch out for that-- Watch the wires, please."
- I thought you'd be at the office.
- Don't lean against it.
I was.
I read your ending.
You bagged it.
- You were almost there.
- Nowhere near.
I've been useless for weeks.
"I read your other stuff, too."
Oh?
- What did you think?
- Hmm.
Bit inconclusive.
I wasn't really sure where it was going next.
No.
"I wasn't too sure of that, either."
Crumbs.
Good God.
Er...
Lucy's the little one?
Yes.
- And her husband did that to her?
- It happens.
Does this have something to do with the other day?
Yes.
- But you don't want to talk to me about it?
- I can't.
All right.
I...
I understand.
- You do?
- She's your friend.
"Whatever you were trying to do for her, get her away from him, to..."
"Barking, whatever..."
Even if it didn't work that...was a good thing for a friend to do.
- Timothy...
"- No, no, I understand."
I didn't before.
But...
I do now.
Thank you.
- I was hoping to see her at the end of the day.
"- Yes, well, you must."
- You will be back in time for this...
"- Yes, of course."
- He was in the rubble for three days?
"- With her body, yes."
Jesus!
- Who was the psychiatrist they sent him to?
- Yes?
- I wanna give you something.
- No.
"Yes, please."
I recently became ordained.
Weird story.
"Um, and I wanna be the one to marry you guys."
- Wait.
What?
!
"- Yeah, what?"
Yeah.
I think this is why I became a minister.
"No, you became a minister to piss off that dude at the restaurant."
"[Laughs] Oh, my Sweet Lord thundering Jesus!"
"Yeah, before you start crying there, Rob, we don't have time for a wedding."
All I have to do is sign a piece of paper.
W-would you have time for a little ceremony?
"God, no."
It would mean the world to my little lady.
Ew!
"Please, we'd be hitched by noon, I swear."
- Okay.
I'd be...
I'd be honored to.
- [Laughing]
"Oh, my lord!"
Oh!
Mwah!
Mwah!
Oh!
"- Yeah, just... uh, no, no."
"Hiya, Red."
Here?
Bring him in.
Bring him down.
"I think you'll unbutton your lip now, Joe."
Maybe you'll talk to your son.
My what?
Here.
"Hiya, sonny boy!"
"Had a long trip today, huh?"
"Oh, sort of confused."
"Well, your old man's confused, too."
My father?
Is my father here?
Where?
"Right here, the great Joe Krozac."
"He's been pining for you, sonny boy."
Father?
That's not my father.
Sure it is.
Ain't he pretty?
Are you all crazy?
"Y- you're kidding, ain't you?"
How do I know this is my-my-
This ought to make it sink home.
See?
That's my father.
That's dads and mother.
"You're just kidnappers, aren't you?"
I see what you're heading for.
"No use trying anything with this kid, see?"
Because that ain't a picture of that dame.
- I know.
And your leopard pants.
- Too much fun.
Too much fun.
- And my shorts.
Totally.
- They're so nice.
"- Mom, can we just please go home?"
- You are no fun.
This is why you're the designated driver.
You're the responsible one.
"That's funny, honey."
That's really funny.
- Unlike us.
You are so not responsible.
- I'm responsible sometimes.
Where are you girls gonna go to school?
"Where are you gonna apply to college, huh?"
- CalArts.
Yeah.
- Ohh.
- Great.
- UCSB.
- Yeah.
- You see?
"Both of them, local."
"Oh, my God."
"This one, she wants to apply someplace like the University of Lithuania."
Ha-ha-ha!
I don't even know where I want to apply yet.
- Lithuania.
"- I mean, it's like the East Coast, right?"
Watch yourself.
Watch yourself.
There's glass.
What happened?
"I told her I wasn't thirsty, and she kept sticking that goddamn straw in my face."
[Sighs] Fuck.
"If you keep running off all these nurses, there's gonna be no one left, dad."
It's a simple job.
You water me and feed me.
I'm a fucking plant.
But that goddamn woman...
She's trying to do the Tijuana waterboard on me!
"Okay, dad, you can't say that shit."
Come on.
[Chuckles]
"But, hey."
I lied.
I am thirsty.
[Pill bottles clacking]
I want you to get me a drink.
A real one.
You sure you're...
Allowed to do that?
Does it really matter?
"- Yeah, that's a good point."
- Thank you.
"Now, let's be a couple of outlaws and get me a fucking drink."
[Chuckling] Okay.
Okay.
[Exhales sharply]
"Yeah, why not?"
[Music playing]
"Paolo took me to a residence,... where the practice was to swap partners."
"-Yes, who is it?"
-Roberto.
Oscar sent me.
"Well, we have arrived."
-Are you coming in?
-One moment.
-Good evening and welcome friends.
-Good evening.
Have you got something for the cloakroom?
Perhaps you don't need your handbag.
Do you know the local?
"No, but others of the same style."
"The ones that pay for drinks, will know."
They'll see.
Let's go.
What would you like?
-What would you like to drink dear?
-Nothing.
"To watch, we must consume something."
-A whisky on the rocks.
-One with Coca-Cola. for me.
-Here you are.
-Thanks.
Here we go.
Have another?
-How much is it?
"-100,000."
-Thanks.
-Thanking you.
Take it.
"Come, we find someplace to sit."
The sign says 'Booneville. '
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Which way is 44th?
- That way.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I got asked directions.
- I saw.
He took me for a native.
That's so cool.
That's very impressive.
44th is the other way.
- No.
- It's all right.
"Man, I should go find him."
He'll figure it out when he sees the numbers getting smaller.
He still thought I was a native.
That's cool.
I'm your witness.
"- Well, I should go."
- Okay.
I got to go to my mom's graduation.
- And give her Belinda.
- And give her Belinda.
Go on.
I'll check on the guy.
I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44th.
Why did you come here?
- What?
"- I said, why did you come here?"
You ditched school and everything.
"Come on, I'm messing with you."
"It's nothing, really."
I'm ok.
This isn't your fault.
"Actually, it is."
You're a team leader.
You made a tactical decision.
And you got hurt.
Again.
You did what you thought was right.
And that's all you can do.
"The rest of it, that's not up to us."
That's the job.
"This is nothing, really."
"I mean, the thing with Doyle, that..."
I'm kidding!
I'm...
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
MARIA'S TIGHTROPE
Maria.
"Come on, sweetie."
"Maria, my child."
Come on and bring your bag.
"Let's get going or we'll be late, sweetie."
- See you later.
- Bye.
"Maria, say bye."
"Gosh, I hope we didn't miss the bus."
My stomach is killing me.
"Foguinho, you can't handle fire eating anymore."
But I'm not sure about my magic yet.
Better!
[Groans]
"Okay, Lance."
Here you go.
Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.
"Oh, you be sure to say hi."
Such a nice lady.
"Please, Mrs. Forman, there's no need to keep up the charade."
Fine.
She's cold.
Get out.
I just want you to know that I don't need these fries.
I choose to eat them because I desire their salty taste.
"Please, just take the fries."
"You need me to take them, don't you?"
Needy bastard.
"Hi, Fez."
Can I talk to you?
"Oh, you need permission, do you?"
I think I was a little too hasty breaking up with you.
- Really?
- Yes.
I like the new Fez.
- What about the old Fez?
- Not so much.
"You know what, Nina?"
There's only one Fez... and that is a Fez with needs.
"And if you don't like that, then we shouldn't be together."
"- But, Fez, I-"
- Shh!
"Sorry, baby."
"Relax, okay?"
Scanning.
- Video link confirmed.
- Up.
This next part might hurt.
Maybe quite a lot.
"But it won't last long, I promise."
Almost there.
Welder.
You can do it.
"Wonderful, Henry."
Squeeze.
Harder.
"Cool, right?"
Integument?
Please don't move your hand.
You probably don't recall.
You were never a big fan of my work.
Maybe this will change your mind.
Right?
Memory's a funny thing.
I'm an expert and I don't know if you'll ever get yours back.
"You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry?"
My name is Estelle.
You and I were... we still are... husband and wife.
"I love you, Henry."
I can't wait to hear you say it.
Henry.
His memories are still catching up with him.
"Oh, Jesus."
- I'm Robbie.
- The sorcerer of sound.
Roger and out.
"Savoy 6, this is Bulldog."
"Go ahead, Bulldog."
We have the Mike Force in position.
Let us know when you're ready.
"Roger, Bulldog."
Savoy 6.
We'll use the air strike to keep Charlie's head down.
Execute plan 3 in 2 minutes.
Do you roger?
Roger.
Out.
"Two minutes, pass the word."
SOLDIER:
"Fall back, damn it!"
Fall back to the commo bunker!
Everybody!
MacDANIEL:
Let go with the phoogas!
SOLDIER:
Let's go!
Keep down.
Take a platoon down and reinforce Evans.
I'm going to the tower.
KIRBY:
What's the situation?
We can't even hold this place with that air strike.
KIRBY:
Provo!
Dig that .30 in and give support to the .50 caliber.
PROVO:
"Give me that, I can handle it."
No!
- Teddy...
"- Oh, damn."
Damn.
Oh.
- What?
"- What happened, Ted?"
- I did what you asked for.
- I'm tired.
- I've been fighting you for so long.
- You don't have to fight any more.
"He's a liar, Ted."
I said it all ends today.
These agents.
It all ends today.
- What does that mean?
- It means he's decided on an endgame.
He's going to kill himself and the hostages.
"Ted, no one on this train is an agent but me."
No one else.
I'm the only one.
You can let everybody else go.
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
Who's going to help me?
The Higher Authorities can help you.
They're not what you think.
They're not the enemy.
"Yes, Cedric."
- Ethel will find you a taxi.
- Taxi?
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Before I dropped off, didn't you have a moustache, Sergeant?"
"Yes, Cedric."
"That dropped off, too."
Away with you.
"Well, good luck to your endeavours."
Thank you.
We'll need it.
"Oh, dear."
Oh...
"- Now, where were we?"
- My plan.
I'll polish him off but I'll need an alibi from you.
Hey!
I asked you to sit down.
Get that thing out of my face.
I've been abducted by aliens.
You think I care about your little toy trumpet?
( group gasps )
RAY:
"You sit down, hero, or I will shoot your bride-to-be."
DR PENZLER:
"Ray, I'm sure if we talk about this, we can work it out."
"Ray, listen to Dr Penzler."
It's gonna be all right.
DR PENZLER:
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
"Please, give it to her, Ray."
"Nice kicks, by the way."
Where did you get them?
Some place on Melrose.
I'm waiting for these limited-edition Japanese imports.
They've got blue and orange on the side and this red mesh on the soles.
- I had my publicist put me on the list.
- They sound great.
"I could ask her to put you on it too, if you want."
If you don't mind matching.
- No.
Sure.
- Right on.
"I'll need your info, though."
I'm so sorry.
"You're Dr. Phillip, right?"
From Tempest Bay?
- That's me.
"- I know it's completely hicksville,"
- but would you sign my gym bag?
- Sure.
No problem.
Thanks.
"Oh, my God."
My mom's gonna flip out.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"- Too bad it's always moms, right?"
- Yeah.
Bummer.
- He was hitting on me.
- You are so full of yourself.
*
"Man, them sorry ass cats can't play no ball."
You catch the game last night?
"Nah, just the lowlights."
"Yeah, you didn't miss much."
(Toilet flushing)
I don't want that shit.
Slap that bitch right there.
Everything going all right?
Everything is everything.
You got pay stubs for me?
Yeah.
"Hey, what's up?"
Any police contact?
Hey.
Any police contact?
"Nah, nah."
All right.
Everything's looking on the up and up.
Stay away from the bullshit.
You're doing all right.
I'll see you next week.
All right.
(Women giggling)
(Angela) Enrique?
"Yeah, in the bathroom, ma."
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Isn't tonight Michael's school thing?
"Yeah, but I didn't think you were going."
Now you got a hot date.
It's not that big a deal.
Out of my sight!
Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.
Are you done?
Against the wall!
I've to search you!
Don't go too far!
Why?
I suspect you're an illegal immigrant!
You're Lisa's boyfriend?
"I meant ex-boyfriend, Michael?"
Michael!
You've suspended?
Why are you here?
Let go!
Do I need to escort you out personally?
"How are you, David?"
"Mr. Lin, welcome back."
"Just give me the keys, I'll follow."
Thanks.
"Anything else you need, Mr. Lin?"
You're great.
No wonder my brother praised you.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
"Lisa, is there a Lo Keung amongst my brother's friends?"
"No, why do you ask?"
Just wondering.
You suspect a friend killed him?
It doesn't seem like a robbery.
I'm not convinced.
My brother values his life.
- Hi.
"- No, thanks."
Why not?
"If I let you, it'll cost me more."
"All right, all right, fair enough."
"How about if I can get you to say the word ""seventeen""?"
"I bet I can get you to say ""seventeen,"" and if I do, you have to join us."
- You're on.
- All right.
- What's two plus two?
- Four.
- Four plus four?
- Eight.
- Eight plus eight?
- Sixteen.
"See, I told you I could get you to say ""sixteen."""
"- No, you said ""sevente""..."
- See?
What?
You walked right into that one.
"Okay, I'm impressed."
"All right, you can buy me a drink now."
- All right.
- What's going on here?
Mr. Heller.
"Gary, you... know this one?"
Ms. Keyes works for me.
Really?
Give your HR person a bonus.
"All right, all right."
What are you doing here?
I live right around the corner.
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?
At the power station.
-Hogarth was there the other night.
-really?
"See anything unusual, Hogarth?"
Nothing...
"... unusual,really."
Gotta use the bathroom.
Strange he's tightIipped.
The other night he couldn't stop talking.
"I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot."
A hundred-foot robot?
That's nutty!
What else did he say?
"No, wait, stop!"
Excuse me.
What is going on in there?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
"You know, this sort of thing is why it's so important..."
... toreallychewyourfood .
A little privacy?
!
Sorry.
Sorry.
He's been acting strange lately.
That hurt.
"Thank you again, Annie."
"Good night, Hogarth."
I'm sure we'II see each other again real soon.
If you're gonna stay here...
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.
"I've looked everywhere, Max."
Where could she be?
"Well, look at what the catfish dragged in."
[Laughs] Look at ya.
Look at ya.
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.
I got it.
"It's your hairdo, right?"
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?
No?
"No, huh?"
"Well, let me see."
New seashells?
No new seashells.
I gotta admit I can't put my foot on it right now.
If I stand here long enough...
"She's got legs, you idiot!"
She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs.
"Geez, man!"
I knew that.
Ariel's been turned into a human.
"She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta kiss her."
[Sebastian] And she's only got three days!
Just look at her!
On legs!
On human legs!
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!
What would her father say?
They're up there!
Goddamn!
We've lost the package.
Secure the exits.
- Which Way's this go?
- West Wing.
"Run, Mr. President!"
Move!
Move!
This leads to the basement.
"- We 're in the stairwell, coming your way."
- Shit.
We gotta go!
"Elevator's here, let's go!"
Shit!
God!
They're in the elevator heading up!
- Cut them off in the Central Hall!
- What are you doing?
Get him!
Take care of Bobby.
"- Killick, stop them at the elevator."
- I'm on it.
He's in the residence!
Cut him off at the residence!
Son of a bitch!
"You screwed us, Walker."
You've got one of your guys running around.
- Not one of my guys.
- Then who is he?
"I don't know, probably some schmuck from one of the tours."
Your tourist killed one of my best men!
Here.
It's a sore.
How long has she been treating you?
Half a year.
Wow that's a long time.
Doctor Imm's patients never get better.
Stop bitching you chink.
"Chinky, stop chatting in Line."
Focus on me a little?
Here for you.
Doctor Imm.
"Tell him if he has to stay awake, do not stay awake for more than 1 day."
Take the bedtime pills.
And get some rest.
I feel the chemistry inside my body is changing.
But I don't know what it is.
Oh!
"Tell him, do not scratch."
Doc....
I....
"Hey, you're just supposed to read it."
Can I please just reply her?
Doc.
I am sorry about last month.
Read.
Can I just read her reply?
Happy New Year.
Get some rest.
Turn off your computer and go to the beach.
See the sunrise or something.
Same to you...
That's enough.
"Yeah, how do we know we're not asking a ballerina, or a lawyer, or a math teacher to take off her clothes?"
We just got to go for it.
"Frank, I think I need to see the money."
"Excuse me, miss, do you have a minute?"
"Uh, ma'am?"
Get out of my way.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Are you a prostitute?
What?
Will you take your clothes off for $103.62?
"Thanks, Kevin."
What?
What'd I do?
-You all right?
-No.
"Psst, psst, psst."
Guys...
You guys need some help?
Are you talking to us?
Yeah.
We want to see a naked lady.
"Ooh, how much money you got?"
$103.62.
Really?
That'll do it.
Come on.
Right through here.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Where?
There are naked women in here?
"Guys, you got to trust me."
He got married when he was 21.
There's no evidence he ever cheated on his wife.
Too bad we're not running in France.
We could really nail him on that one.
When do you have your lunch with him?
With Shelly Runyon?
I'm not having lunch with him.
"Friday, 1:00."
It's scheduled tomorrow.
It's automatic.
He's committee chairman.
It was set up.
S.O.P.
- Laine.
- Shelly.
I'm sorry I started.
You were late.
"- I'm not too late, I hope."
- A minute or two.
- Were you tied up with anything?
"- No, sorry."
I'm just late.
"- Hi, Clem."
You too.
"- Senator, nice to see you."
- I ordered you the porterhouse.
"- No, I don't eat meat."
- I'll have the penne.
- You should really...
Mmm.
- Try the steak.
Ask Hugo to burn it on the outside.
- Bye.
Who is it?
- It's me.
Why did you come here?
Did anyone see you?
I took the backside stairs.
None saw me.
An important matter.
So...
"Whatever it is, you should have just called me."
Varun is here.
In Erode.
- Varun?
The chef from Chennai.
So what?
He might have come for some official work.
No.
He has come searching for you.
They have seen you at the hotel with Vikram.
I heard the girl with him address you as 'Vasundhara.'
Then they followed you in a car.
I diverted them.
I think they know everything.
They come targeting us.
We shouldn't take further risks.
Drop Vikram.
Let's go.
What?
Listen to me.
Let's leave this right here and go.
"This won't work anymore, Vasundhara."
You always talk negatively!
Now I'll make a call.
- Zoravar.
- Yes.
Were you waiting on the pole?
Yes.
Contract canceled advance returned.
Very fast.
Darling Ankita.
Go inside.
Ankita hold on.
Did you have to interfere?
Hello.
I'll come straight to the point.
Do you love Shiv?
I...
Hey.
Move aside.
Your brother wants to get you married to that moron.
- Moron?
- Look at his face.
Do you love Shiv?
Yes.
Do you want to marry him?
Yes.
Yes!
Don't be mad.
He has an entire army with him.
The Boss announces a contract... to get Shiv and Ankita married.
But Boss how can you start the contract... without advance money?
This is against your system.
- You're right.
- Yes.
"""No!"
Get the fuck off of her!
"""Get the fuck off of her!"
"""She's coming home with us!"
She's coming home with us!
"""Get the fuck--get-- Get off of her!"
"""Stop it!"
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
"""Stop it, bitch!"
Stop it!
Ha!
"""Stop it!"
Stop it!
"No, let me talk to her."
"""Karen, look at me, Karen."
"""Sweetie, you're drunk, okay?"
"""If he wants to take you out, he's gonna wait"
"""till the freakin' sun comes up and take you out"
"""on a respectable date like an adult."
"""We came together."
We're leaving together.
"""Fuck you, Tyrone!"
We came together.
"We're leaving together."""
"And then the girlfriend-- Then the girlfriend, she's all fucking like this."
"She's like, ""I don't know, Karen."""
Her name's Karen too.
"""I don't know, Karen."
"""I mean, he's still nice."
"""I really can't stand up straight right now,"
"And if we're going to survive it, we can't turn on each other."
We're all we have.
I know.
I'll never do anything like that again.
Do you think you can ever forgive me?
"Yeah, I forgive you."
(engine starting)
(tires squealing)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
(crying)
We broke up.
WOMAN:
Hello?
SHUTTER CLICKS
"What do you want, pig?"
Can I trust you to pass this on?
What have you got?
"Sorry, are you married?"
I live alone.
Oh.
Liz Fletcher.
"Do you ever go in the loft, Mr Moss?"
I rarely venture beyond the ground floor.
Peggy?
Where the hell are you?
"You shouldn't really be here, Len, You know that, right?"
You're retired.
Argh!
SQUEAKING
KNOCKING
"Come on, she's out."
"- Yes, fine, thanks."
Hello.
"Oh, hello!"
Your first night with no phone wasn't too hard?
It was.
But I made an effort...
"Sorry, I must have seemed ridiculous yesterday, right?"
No.
Sometimes people blow it.
I saw you had a car.
Are you going back to Bordeaux?
Yes!
"Oh, yes!"
I'm leaving...
Oh dear!
In 5 minutes.
Could you handle a stowaway?
"I've a son, Louis, who lives abroad."
The rebel of the family.
"At 18, with a culinary arts diploma, he went off to Asia."
He's in Vietnam now.
I tried to stop him.
Well... in my own way.
"Now he's opened a restaurant, and is doing well."
His taste for adventure doesn't come from me.
- Is Vietnam nice?
- I've never been there.
Even to see him.
I'm a disgrace.
"Stupid, isn't it?"
Am I boring you?
Yes.
The End.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
Ha.
"It worked, didn't it?"
Hmm.
Who's next in our little contest?
Oh.
Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
- Ha.
- Okay.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
Pff.
"Yeah, whatever."
Whoop.
"Pshh, pshh, pshh."
You had your chance.
"Now, then..."
Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street... in this house.
A man had come as a last resort.
Because... no one else would go near the place.
Gah!
I hear you've been expecting me.
- You are the...
- That's right.
I am... the babysitter.
"Yes, sir, yes, thank goodness you've come."
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've-a never seen anything like it.
"Trust me, buddy."
I've got three little ogres at home.
I don't have to.
"""Linden""?"
"Linden, that's from the ad agency."
What the hell's goin' on here?
I have nothing to say.
Crocker!
"You hold her down here, and you call the bomb squad!"
- [Ticking] - [Pounding]
[Pounding Continues] [Kojak] Karla Elliot?
Yes!
"Miss Elliot, open up!"
It's a police emergency!
Open the door!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Let me get my coat!
"Nothing personal, kid."
Come on.
[Crocker] Easy now!
Easy!
[Sirens Wailing In Distance]
All right!
Stand back!
"Now, look."
"If there's anyone in town that you wanna spend the night with, that officer over there will be very happy to take you."
What are you doing here?
- I knew.
- You what?
"Alex, is he all right?"
He wasn't even here.
He was out looking for you to help.
- Thank you for my life.
I wrote the cite but...
Fritz called Caltrans and he stayed to clean things up.
So maybe he remembers.
"All right, I'll call Fritz."
You two guys get back to Central.
"But you sent us home, remember?"
"Yeah, but I want you where I can reach you."
Henry getting hungry?
"Oh, yes."
"How's it going, Henry?"
"Oh, that's a boy, it's okay, Henry."
Hang on.
We're almost at the campgrounds.
You all set...?
Hi.
- Hi.
- It's kind of hot.
I thought you might like some.
Thank you.
You live here?
Yeah.
"No, not really."
But my partner does.
I kind of hang around here a lot.
It's nice to know your neighbors.
Especially when they're police officers.
"Yeah, I think so."
Well I gotta run.
You can return the glass anytime.
Sure.
Thank you.
"Hey, old buddy, did you set me up, huh?"
"I sleep here, eat here."
I am here... got that?
I'll go with you.
The way I look they'll never believe I am gay.
Make me a Zenne.
Some cream?
"Oh, you speak German?"
My ex-husband was from Bavaria.
I lived in Munich formany years.
How did you like Bavaria?
I don't know.
I didn't really feel at home.
"The people... but now, I miss it very much."
Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
We'll check the lists.
Come here.
What are you waiting for?
I have to check your behind.
Turn over!
I don't think I can.
Wiggle a bit.
"Where are you from, son?"
Urfa.
"Wow, Urfa."
Not a traitor but a taker.
What do you do forliving?
"I am a Zenne, sir."
Would a real man shake his hips forliving?
Run for your life!
Oh!
Keep away!
- Take it!
- Keep away!
- Take all of it!
- The monster took my shoe!
Candy!
Yay.
Treats.
I love treats.
- Felicia.
"- Hi, daddy!"
That was a nice grip you had on that big fat kid.
"Farkle, excellent work with your teeth."
"- Fergus, my lad..."
"- Daddy, daddy, daddy."
You're gonna have to work on your timing.
"All in all, not bad for your first Halloween."
They're growing up so fast.
And look who got her first clump of hair!
"Oh, did you see?"
Farkle got him in the ankle.
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.
"Oh, that's all right, sweetie."
Mommy didn't get a scare this year either.
"Fear not, my love."
The night is still young.
Hold the phone.
Who left the door open?
You don't think... someone's inside?
My God.
What...
You wouldn't want to be listening to that fella.
I only told you 'cause...
"I don't know why I told you, really."
You were right.
It's pathetic.
A grown man talking like that.
Exactly.
Just 'cause she's up the pole.
Exactly.
It's stupid.
Yeah.
You wouldn't want to be getting... worked up about it.
"Still, though..."
It's just...
I heard something.
I thought I should warn you.
- Warn me?
"- Yeah, warn you."
"You know your man, George Burgess?"
What about Mr. Burgess?
He was saying things.
Not to me face.
It was Lester who told me.
He was saying things... about you being pregnant.
What was he saying?
He said... he said you were a great little ride.
"So Lester says, anyway."
"Lester wouldn't make a thing up like that, would he?"
"Jesus, no."
Not Lester.
I'm gonna drag that murdering sack of dirt back to Texas...
... andhe'sgonna tell the jury the truth.
"I don't know, Vin."
The truth and Eli Joe don't seem a likely mix.
I've lived with Kiowas and Comanches.
I know a thing or two about getting the truth out of people.
I look forward to seeing that.
Too bad we gotta keep him alive.
"Since we do, we'd best get us some help."
Come on.
J.D. :
"Hey, Buck."
Josiah.
We gotta ride.
Split them up.
Everybody takes a man.
Feller in the serape's mine.
"All right, boys, like we planned."
vin:
Hold it right there.
[MEN grunting ]
MAN:
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
vin:
"You're finished, Eli."
Yates?
Where is he?
Where is he?
I got no problem killing you.
Won't change the fact he's gone.
Took off early.
Call 9-1-1.
No.
We can't call the cops.
"Dude, you are on your third strike."
I'm on my fourth.
He's right.
You can't go back.
"You guys, we have to, we have to worry about getting out of here alive first."
Stupid phone.
"I should have upgraded this piece of shit, but no, I had to save money for boobs."
I have one bar.
911 Sheriff's Department.
Hello.
Sheriff's Department.
I'm in a house at the very end of Sange Road.
"There's, there's four of us."
We're being held against our-

I'm a white person!
Shit.
I don't know if it went through.
Let's go upstairs.
Okay.
Stay together.
Go upstairs.
"Yeah, I like that idea."
Hello.
Is someone there?
My name is Vivian Thorpe.
I have been a prisoner in here for weeks now.
Wait.
We have to get a signal first.
"We're here, sweetie."
It's a party!
Ring it.
Come here.
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.
Barbuda loves you.
"Barbuda, honey."
"Darling, I've missed you!"
It's Quico's party.
He's staying with me for a while.
Do you remember Quico?
Why didn't you tell me she'd be arriving today?
We thought it'd be better to wait a while.
You could've told me.
"Mrs. Maria Cecilia, the circus is on the road."
We didn't know exactly when it would stop nearby.
Nearby!
We walked almost for two hours.
- You live pretty far away!
"- Fine, I see."
"What really matters is that you're here, my doll."
Let me look at you.
You didn't grow much in these past fewyears.
Let me see your face.
Come on.
You look so much like -
Mrs. Maria Cecilia.
Here are her things.
- Is this all?
"- Yes, ma'am."
"Come on, Maria."
- You're?
- Wu-tang!
Then you're my uncle!
"Chao Fung, you know the sentence for killing your master."
- He had no choice.
"- Yan-ling, keep calm."
You're?
Cheung Ching Tse!
I'm willing to receive any punishment.
Please punish me!
He didn't kill his master.
Who are you?
Yan-ling of the Shaolin!
Shaolin?
Uncle!
This is our internal affair.
Yan-ling!
Uncle!
"Uncle, she just came to save me."
"Alright, let's go back and have our senior be the judge."
- Don't go!
- No.
Be careful!
Yan-ling!
We came here today to catch the traitor Chao Fung.
We've no quarrel with anyone else.
"Chao Fung, you have nothing to do with her anymore."
Leave her.
"Uncle, he didn't intend to kill his master."
- But he did kill his master!
- Uncle!
Yan-ling!
Stop before I blush.
Actually I need your help.
I want to break up with my Thai boyfriend.
Ok and then?
He can't speak English and I can't speak Thai.
You guys can't even talk to each other and how did you get together?
You know S-E-X?
It's all about SEX.
Because sex is my life.
Okay enough.
I got it.
Thank you Tutor Pleng.
For what?
For agreeing to help me breaking up with him.
Oh no!
I didn't say I would.
But...
I got you this Louis Vuitton bag for you.
Oh yeah
Breaking up with the guy is so easy.
Don't worry.
Thank you
I grabbed it already.
You have good taste.
One original mocha ice blended please.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You have a problem?
What are you looking at?
Do I look like your husband?
Gym?
Kaya's boyfriend?
Interesting.
Sammy OK.
Bring the family.
- Please.
Please.
Leave my family.
"- You stole from us, Sammy."
"- No, I did not steal."
"- Chan, caught our malımızla."
Chan works for you.
Now the whole damn family will die.
- I did not do it!
- We do not have to do this.
Do you know Mike?
You're right.
You Sammy'yi shoot and I'll leave her family.
- Please.
- What happened?
Tekledin?
You fucking prick!
"Sammy'yi shoot, or I'll kill her child with her husband."
- Shoot him.
- Will not do it.
- Shoot them!
- Vurmayacağım them!
- The death of his wife he want children?
!
"- Will not do it, vurmayacağım them."
Has no meaning.
- Fuck!
Shoot them all!
- No!
"She can't recognise anyone, she can't speak."
What did the doctor say?
That there's no hope.
- The doctor said that?
- Yes.
Who's watching her?
"My mother, the neighbours, the family, my young uncle."
Your young uncle?
He's called in three times.
His holidays are over.
My grandmother's better.
How old is she?
100... 150... 100 or 150?
100.
Special rate?
Yes.
"After one hundred, the rest doesn't matter."
Do you know that or not?
I don't know.
"We grow old, you know."
"I have to go, I have exams."
I'll be back.
Come back quickly.
Don't forget.
"Hello, Tajdolat."
"Hello, are you well?"
Are you looking for something?
My camera.
We left it here and it's gone.
You didn't lock the car.
"One night has passed, you expect it to be there?"
"Hello, good luck."
Eat.
O-Waka-chan!
Matsuki-chan!
O-ume you are not quite good.
Right?
I'll go see.
Sada-don!
Sadakichi-don!
Yes.
Where's the fire?
There's anyone on the rooftop?
I'm on my way.
It's in the Honjo district.
You know?
Also the wind comes from the northwest.
Don't worry.
Matsuki-san?
The son of the neighbor!
Isn't he?
!
The love of Matsuki-san for fire will give him trouble.
Right?
Matsuki!
Where did he go?
Told you to keep an eye on him if the fire bell was heard.
Where did the keeper go?
Send people to the fire chief place.
Tell him I said not to let him in to the place of fire.
It took a lot of dealing.
You heard it?
"Dear, will you talk about that again?"
It's because Naritaya-san has a reputation of being meticulous.
I thought I heard you...
I th... forget it.
Did you wanna talk about something?
We can talk later.
Let's talk now.
"Lydia, come on!"
Ly... wait!
Why are you asking Lydia about Jackson's real parents?
Why are you bringing out the claws on camera?
That's right.
You wanna play catwoman?
I'll be your Batman.
"If you're wondering about Jackson's real parents, they're about half a mile from here."
In beacon hills cemetery.
I...
I have to get to cl...
"oh, no, no, you don't."
"No, you have perfect grades."
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
Wu-tang!
"Good morning, Master Law!"
Jun-kit...
Our students used to learn kung-fu as Shaolin monks.
Any better now?
"Yes, Master!"
Fung-wu!
Do all our students understand the mystery of the sword?
"Yes, Master!"
They all understand!
"Good morning, Master Law!"
Let's get together tonight at the old place.
I'll be the host.
"No, I should be the host!"
I will be the host!
I'll be the host!
I've told you I'll be the host!
I'll be the host!
Don't argue!
No...
I will!
Don't argue!
"I'll be the host, do you hear?"
Fung-wu...
What's happened to you?
There's nothing to argue about!
Don't snatch!
Who's the host really?
I am!
I am!
"Fung-wu, try to use our sword skills!"
"Jun-kit, attack him with the Shaolin fist!"
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
- Hey...
So what's up?
- Together forever.
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever!
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty!"
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Aah!
Why don't we just sit down... and discuss this?
Then... they ate me!
"Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!"
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I...
I gotta go.
They're my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they ate you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Um...
"You made it up, didn't ya?"
"I... hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Aah!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night!
Hey... what the...
Come in.
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.
- If this is about today...
"- No, it's not."
I got a message.
I have to go home.
I have to be there noon on Friday.
"John, do you realize what's happening to you?"
I have to go.
"Hey, it's me."
- Connie?
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
"I tried to get you on the one to Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
"Buzz, the monkeys aren't working!"
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!
"Oh, where could he be?"
-Can I help pump the gas?
-Sure!
I'll even let you drive.
-Yeah?
"-Yeah, when you're 1 6."
"Funny, Mom."
Great.
How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
Buzz!
Buzz!
Ha!
You're alive!
This is great!
"Oh, I'm saved!"
I'm saved.
"Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake."
Huh?
Right?
Buddy?
"I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet."
-Oh.
"Well, that's good."
"-But we're not on my planet, are we?"
No.
"Okay, come on!"
You want a piece of me?
"Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear to the rescue."
-Next stop.
- Get access.
We need to sedate him.
- Get a 7.5 ET tube.
- You won't be able to use it.
- Break open lap pads and a crike tray.
"- Gallant, hold down his arm."
- Seven sterile...
- Gallant.
- ... and an 11 blade.
Drape his neck.
"- All right, fent's in."
Get some O-2 in him. 100% by mask.
I'm pushing meds.
- Gallant.
Gallant.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
He's settling down.
Betadine.
-20 of etomidate.
"- Wait, are we tubing him or criking him?"
- Criking.
Look at his face.
- Just taking a peek.
"- All right, bradying down."
"- Yeah, he aspirated too much blood."
- Open the crash cart.
"- Gallant, unroof his jaw and hold it out of the way."
I need to see the epiglottis.
- Mg of atropine.
"- Susan, hook your finger under his tongue."
- I can't do it.
- Don't move.
"You know, even when they're all grown-up,"
"people say to their kids,"
"""You were always my little boy."""
You really were.
Maybe we... we were blessed that...
Please don't go.
Please don't leave me.
I can't do this on my own.
"Dad, I'm scared."
What's gonna happen?
I don't know.
"Oh, God, Adam."
I don't know.
Dad?
Nina!
Nina!
"- It's OK, it's OK."
"All right, all right."
- What does he need?
"I'm sorry, Adam."
I think he knew it was gonna happen.
That's why he came back to Wales.
He wanted to die here.
- This is it.
I'm on my own.
"- Oh, no, you're not."
You and Nina are just dealing with a problem.
That's all I am to you.
"Look, I can't pretend to know how you're feeling, cos personally I haven't been through it."
I know.
You're just a kid.
"Yeah, but, whatever you're feeling... you can tell me, I'll listen."
Gone.
They've gone.
Where'd they go?
To the mountains.
(dramatic music)
Allow me.
(laughing)
(whimpering)
"It's okay, Xiao-Mei."
"Spare me, I beg you!"
"Mr. Cheng, let me go!"
Let you go?
"You killed so many people, I'm putting you in jail!"
(triumphant Western music)
"Brother Jeng, you're going."
You will come back?
Just as soon as I can.
Really?
"Of course, and then I'll take you to see a doctor."
Take care.
Let's go.
See you!
See you.
Hello?
- 120 over 80.
"- Okay, Bob."
That oughta do it.
Good.
How's everything look?
"Everything seems fine: solids, liquids, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, E.K.G."
"Actually, it is one of the most boring physicals I have ever given."
-In the back.
Gimme a bromo for my friend here.
"I'll take a small steak, two eggs on top some fries, juice, and a side order of toast...."
"Yes, sure."
Right away.
"Look out for that stomach, huh?"
Here we fix you up one second.
You'll feel much better.
Okay.
"See you, huh?"
We'll have your steak ready in a minute.
Where's my buddy?
"Oh, he left."
He left?
-What are you talkin' about?
"-Hey, what's a matter?"
You okay?
The guy drove off on me.
How are you gonna figure that?
"Oh, I think your steak's ready."
Thank you.
"Oh, no!"
-What?
-He took my wallet.
I left the raincoat in the car and....
I can't even pay you for this.
"Tell me, where you goin' anyway?"
-Down to L.A.
-Why?
I was goin' down for a job.
The whole thing's in the wallet.
-What kind of job?
"- So let's sit down, and we'll..."
"- Nope, stay on up here."
Really?
Do one more scenario.
"Maggie, you're at your car."
You're fumbling for your keys.
- Okay.
"- Emma, attack."
"Uh, okay, um, Mags, let's just take it easy..."
- [grunts]
- Ah!
- [grunting and yelling]
- You're dead!
She's still alive!
"Keep it moving, keep it moving."
"- No, no!"
"- I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!"
Why are you still talking?
"Yeah, that's right."
Dead men tell no tales.
- [yells]
"- Oh, God!"
You're dead.
And that's self defense... [softly] For moms.

I think you snapped my solar plexus.
What?
French is $15.
"And anything special will cost you $25, okay?"
"Yeah, baby."
"Handcuffs, that'll be $35, okay?"
"Uh, they're for you, baby."
"I'm a cop, and you're under arrest."
"Oh, shit, what kinda shit is this, man?"
"You know this is entrapment, man."
"Aw, my man is the man, holy shit."
What the fu...
Who the fuck are you now?
"Uh, what-what's um..."
Where am I now?
"What, uh... who..."
What's this room?
I don't understand.
I never seen this place before.
Nobody ever did anything.
[Indistinct mumbling]
"Uh, is this... is..."
Where's everybody else?
What do you want?
I want the person who killed the ghouls.
I don't know nothin' about that.
I can't tell you...
I don't know nothin' about that.
I can't...
I can't tell you what I don't...
Wha...
Those are my things.
"Um, do... are you..."
Are you new?
Is anything wrong?
I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's wrong.
A feeling like I had when Bobby...died.
Stan?
Stan?
Stan is here.
My brother is here.
And he's dead.
My brother is dead.
It could be Bobby.
No.
"No, it's Stan."
Pull yourself together.
He's dead.
And dead is dead.
I have to sit down.
Stan?
That's not living.
Okay.
- Call me when you get home safe?
- Mm-hm.
Okay.
"- Bye, Stefan."
- Goodbye.
Don't look at me like that.
- Are you crazy?
"- Save the lecture, look..."
Damn it.
I remember them.
From 1864.
They were in the tomb.
Yeah.
About that.
Matt.
- Matt.
"- I don't wanna hear it, Mom."
"Matty, please."
"Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom?"
I was having fun.
Trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day.
Just enjoy a night with my friends.
"And then, there you are."
"Wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way to pay the bills that you don't pay."
And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?
Hooking up with some guy half your age.
"I'm the kid, Mom."
You're supposed to be responsible for me.
"I know, Matt."
How was your night?
"- Ha ha, idiot."
This person must be mute.
"Saa, who knows."
I'm just too ignorant.
"Hey, you guys are noisy."
Na?
What did you say chibi?
The one you were talking about just now was the Eastern grip.
Eastern grip?
It's really common just for people like you.
Did you said something wrong?
How old are you?
- Junior High student?
- Middle School student?
Looks like you know a lot.
Get off the next stop.
Mada mada da ne.
Who's that?
Good afternoon!
Thanks for the hard work!
Oi chibi.
We are not recruiting.
Wait chibi.
What is your name?
I'm asking you for your name.
Could it be you are that transfer student named Echi something?
Answer me.
Echizen Ryoma.
So it is.
The prodigy from America.
Show me what you've got.
And you are?
I can fly?
"-Erik, please."
-The boy seeks the larger truth.
"If you want, must desire."
"If you wish, all you want is yours."
"Now, go."
Bye!
Bye!
Son.
Erik.
"You know, when everything goes wrong running away is not the solution."
Okay.
Need to find itself a way to solve.
-Right.
-All right.
And we are all different part of life to know who is and what their gifts.
You can not dance or fly but when you discover is all yours.
Got it?
"Yes, that's okay."
Great.
"-Will, what is this?"
It's the wave of change.
"The world is changing, Bill."
We have to get in on.
"My god, can not be."
Something somewhere gave the greatest hustle.
Something hit the land of the emperors.
"Come on, children."
Let's push the pace.
"-It's our time, Bill."
-Right.
"Swimming-and-death, my friend."
An error ..
"Lord, you mistake."
I was in the bathroom.
There I got the message.
What message?
"""Do not let your life."""
He said that he killed if it does not do what it says.
I can not afford it.
I can not let that happen.
I just what to do.
He killed my mother.
I killed them all.
All dead.
To Alice.
Please!
"If you fly, many will die and more innocent people."
People die every day but not my family.
"Please, this is crazy."
God knows what we can do.
What about him?
I'm sorry.
"Addons Ten minutes before impact, Mr. Calahan."
Do not.
Please.
Addons One listen to one of the poisoning helping our friend?
Or go back to the cabin Addons
- I keep my wife and kids?
Do not listen.
Addons
- Please.
- Who wants to die first?
Addons - wife or child.
Go sightseeing?
If it's a nice day?
"-Yeah, let's do that."
-Okay.
"And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie."
Okay?
"Oh, I love you."
"I love you, Rags."
"We'll have a good day, yeah?"
"You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like."
Mr. Dennings?
"Well, you know, it's okay."
"Well, thank you very much but why on earth would I wanna bring Burke on your birthday?"
"Well, you like him."
"Yeah, I like him."
Don't you like him?
"Hey, what's going on?"
What is this?
"-You're gonna marry him, aren't you?"
"-Oh, my God."
Are you kidding?
-What?
-Me marry Burke Dennings?
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Of course I like him.
"I like pizzas too, but I'm not gonna marry one."
You don't like him like Daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
Why don't you go and have a look?
I can't...!
I 'm kidding!
You gigaton fool!
I can't stand it!
Hold it!
You can't go in there!
"Hold it, I said!"
Oww...!
I-I'm sorry...!
Hey!
Yes?
What's that?
The new pilot suit.
New... what?
It was developed using the data collected from you all.
Special magnets sewn on the inside stimulate the nerve endings of the wearer activating and improving the efficiency of your battles.
W-Wha...?
Please put on your suit too.
Pictures of you in the suit will be sent as file footage to the Development Division.
Penalty!
Penalty!
Penalty!
Penalty!
Penalty!
Do whatever...!
I don't care anymore!
No!
Calm down!
Of all times...!
What's wrong?
The enemy?
"Bro, I don't know what to say, man."
"I mean, I hear you, bro, I hear you."
"But the fuck, bro?"
"What if that's his life, man, that's him."
That's his life?
That's my life...
"That's my boy, you understand?"
"You know, he took that from me."
He took that shit from me.
"Yes, Mr. Rodriguez?"
Can I use the bathroom?
"Come on, Michael, just go."
You don't have to interrupt.
"Oye, papa, ven!"
What's up?
Damn.
"What happened, huh?"
Damn!
Rodriguez?
"Does this look like a beet salad, hmm?"
This just came back.
My best salad just came back looking like that.
"Yo, I don't know..."
This is unacceptable.
Fix me a new one...
now.
Is there a problem?
"All right, where do you think you're going..."
Come on...
*
"You know, it doesn't look that bad."
I actually think it looks kind of cute.
"Hey there, scout."
Kent MansIey.
I work for the government.
"Hey, there."
Kent MansIey.
Work for the government.
Your parents home?
We're eating.
"Who's there, honey?"
hello there.
Do you have a telephone I couId use?
-In the kitchen.
-Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Here.
Pretend you're a gangster.
-You call me at home for this?
-You don 't understand.
-It ate my car.
-And you saw this happen?
"No, I didn't actually see it."
It went off into the woods.
So you don 't have any evidence?
But I've got an eyewitness!
An eyewitness with a concussion.
This thing is a menace.
It tore up the power station.
It caused a train wreck!
What did?
"tell me again, MansIey, and this time..."
...listen to yourself.
A giant metal monster.
- Push him on the floor.
- Talk to me.
Do it now.
Push him on the floor.
"- You, kick him like a football!"
- My feet are tied.
"Ernie, talk to me!"
"Talk to me, Ernie."
"Hey, pal."
"Come on, talk to me."
Talk to me.
I come in here after I saw you in the station house.
"I tell Chicky, ""Hey, there's no hard feelings."""
"You know, it's worth a thousand to get my wheelchair back."
She gets me in touch with her friends.
SlPOWlCZ:
I don't care what happens to them.
"But if they're hurt, you'll wind up either dead or in jail."
- So what?
"- So your room is bad, jail's worse."
"- Well, that leaves dead."
"- No, I don't want that."
I've seen too many good men go down.
Do you want a drink?
It's on the house.
"I can't, Ernie."
I'm a drunk.
"Everybody's got their battles, Ernie."
ERNIE:
Push him on the floor.
- Ernie.
Tell him you're going to punt him!
It's quite a nice old place.
At least the roof doesn't leak.
"To your health, my lord."
And your delightful family.
(Lord Meldrum) Thank you.
Do we eat this or is just for ornamentation?
"Give it to Foster, he'll crawl up it."
(Clears throat)
"Er, well, how have you all been keeping?"
"Fine, fine."
(High-pitched) Fine.
Good.
Good.
"My nephew's, er, had the chickenpox."
"Oh, poor little chap."
How old is he?
27.
"Dinner is served, m'lord."
"Come on, you're sitting next to me."
- Mr Foster.
- Oh.
Thank you very much.
"- I'm honoured, my lady."
"- Please, call me Cissy."
"Come along, Teddy."
Show Mr Barnes where he's sitting.
Oh.
"Yes, of course."
Erm... been in any good pubs lately?
"You see, my Olive doesn't like me coming home breathing beer fumes."
"You can't blame her, can you?"
That's the soup gone up.
You see what time it is?
What you got that shit on your head for?
Take it off.
Take what off?
"I said, take that shit off!"
"Pa, papi, stop!"
Take it off!
"(Angela) Enrique, no!"
My hair!
No!
What?
Pa...
"Angie, this shit ends now."
Stop it...
"Enrique, no!"
"Leave it alone, he's not hurting anybody!"
"Papi, no, stop, I'm sorry!"
You don't disrespect this house.
"Sit the fuck down, right now."
"Don't do this, he's not hurting anybody."
Put your fucking hands down.
"You're a fucking man, Michael, You're not a woman!"
"No, no!"
Get your fucking hands...
Why you doing this?
"Why are you defending this shit, huh?"
Don't you understand...
this can't happen.
"You're supposed to have my back, Angie."
Kike...
Kike!
Stop it...
- I don't know her.
"We wanted to ask if you once made a film, a movie with Isabelle Moretti."
I didn't make anything.
And now I'll ask you not to disturb me.
If Mom were alive I'd strangle her.
Are you sure his face...
- I've never seen him.
- He has an Arab accent.
- Cut it out.
- Why are you pushing?
I'm fed up!
"Mom had an Arab accent, too."
"She came from Algeria, not some kibbutz in Sweden."
So what?
So she's an Arab and he's an Arab and so are you.
- Are you cursing me?
- Yes.
"And I'm an Arab and he's an Arab and we're all Arabs, okay?"
Now lay off.
"Get down, he's coming out."
"- We lost him, damn it."
- Where are we?
- Where to?
- I don't know.
Sir?
Sir?
I'm calling an ambulance.
I'm starving.
Where are your sandwiches when we need them?
Maybe that's the doctor.
About time.
It's not the doctor.
He was a foreigner too... a Frenchman.
She welcomed the kindness he showed her.
"But later, she was fired."
He lost touch with her.
End of story.
"Anna Rachevsky, right."
- Coming back?
- Yes.
Thou hast sent him gifts?
No.
You have offered him flowers?
You've written him a poem?
I ...
"Even zero, it remains a proof of love."
"If you had him said""I love you"", maybe you would go to the church instead of Aymeric."
You think?
Yes!
Move over.
How it happens in all the stories?
The girl will marry the wrong person.
Here arises the true love and expresses.
"Damn, you're right."
Looks
Titanic.
Yes.
But  Titanic  He died at the end.
Exactly.
That's a great proof of love.
"And you, champ?"
What is proof of your great love?
"It is you, florist Melanie."
Jessica is there?
Come in.
Take a look around.
It's fine.
-No. I couldn't.
-You can.
Let me get you something.
All I have is water and OJ. I hope that's all right.
What about the champagne?
"I mean, if you want to."
Sure. I guess a little champagne between colleagues never hurt.
"You know, Pacey Witter, you are such a doll."
I have so much respect for you having the strength not to act on this thing.
-And what thing would that be?
-You know the thing.
This heat.
I felt it tonight when you hugged me.
I felt it that time when we kissed.
"-Oh, gee!"
"-Shut the door, Pacey."
It'll keep the heat in.
Audrey.
Audrey!
"Audrey, stop."
Let me explain.
I don't wanna hear your explanations.
-lt's clear to me.
-She just dropped by.
And you were trying so hard to get her to leave.
-lt is not what it looks like.
-Go back!
-Nothing happened!
-You kissed her!
"I better try it, shouldn't I?"
"Oh, yeah!"
This is a bed.
This is a real bed.
What's that up there?
- Is there a picture of Uncle?
"- Yeah, here."
And here.
This is Grandpa.
Very young.
Forty-five years ago.
This picture was taken the same year... he died.
Those large letters...
What do they mean?
"""Let us all meet again to join in the beyond. """
A sea bream ascending a waterfall.
That's not right.
It's carp.
A carp ascending a waterfall.
Darn it!
I made a mistake.
Clark-san!
What's this?
Clark's father...
Suzujiro-san passed away.
It's Clark-san.
Clark-san is gone.
He took a different plane.
We're home.
Clark sincerely regretted it.
Saying that it's almost unbearable having to leave like that.
Big Brother...
"Sabrina, that dress is fantastic."
Really?
You don't think it makes me look too hippy?
¶ ¶
My eyes are acting weird.
"Oh, I saw something about that on 20/20."
The best thing to do is keep them closed.
"Hey, could you take my picture?"
Sure.
Smile.
"Oh, no!"
Harvey!
"Sorry, your eyes always come out red."
Oh!
Got him.
"No, that's a real roach."
(shrieks)
Wait a minute.
I know exactly what we need.
HILDA:
A roach motel?
"Zelda, this guy is a captain of industry."
There's no way he'd stay at a motel.
"Okay, fine."
The roach Carlton.
Nice.
"Except for the faint smell of boric acid,"
I'd give it four stars.
Never seen a camera like this before.
"Just push the button, Avedon."
Picture?
!
- Oh!
- Lucy... and Robert!
"Yes, they..."
They were married a week ago and are now on their way to Plymouth.
(LAUGHTER)
"I am a joke to you, and an offence to her."
- I had no right to come.
"- Oh, Edward!"
- Where are you going?
- Far enough not to cause her more pain.
Pain?
Oh!
"Go to her, Edward."
"She is just out of her wits, that's all."
(LAUGHS) And so are you.
Go on.
Lucy took him for his money.
My mother's settlement cannot be revoked.
- And a fitting pair they make.
- I was a free man.
"I rode down here to marry you, and marched in upon you like a clumsy brute."
No.
Even now that I am asking for your hand...
- Are you?
- Yes.
And blundering again.
- I love you.
"- Oh, Elinor."
But you will have to ask my mother's consent more gracefully.
"Oh, yes."
Colonel.
"Oh, I am so happy to welcome you."
- Carry on!
"Italy, Mr. Scott-Padget."
"- Hello, I brought biscuits."
- Thank you.
- How long's it been?
- Day and a half.
- Scott-Padget's going soft.
- Wasn't him.
It was Ponsonby.
"- Oh, why?"
"- Pardoe, a ship!"
"Deck, there!"
Sail-ho!
Starboard beam.
"A frigate and a merchantman, both French, on the starboard beam!"
Beat to quarters!
"Mr. Scott-Padget, set all sails."
Give her every stitch.
I'll not have an officer carrying a rope's end.
- All right there!
Overhaul the gear!
"- Very good, sir."
Set the gallants and flying jib!
- One gun ready!
- Two!
- Three ready!
- Four!
- Five!
- Cast loose!
- Forward your guns!
- Heave!
- Ship ready and cleared for action!
- He's all I can look at right now.
- Look at those eyes.
"- Oh, yeah."
- There we go.
I love how my head is 800 times the size of your head.
- That's a beautiful shot.
- This is love.
Love happening.
- It is.
- Look at those eyes.
"- Thank you, Tom Richmond."
"- Thank you, Tom."
- Was that the blond girl?
- She just walked by.
"Oh, man, I missed her."
We go to the same dentist together.
- Zac Booth is also very handsome.
- Yeah.
- It's true.
- Everybody's handsome.
- All the guys are handsome.
- Good-looking group.
- Zac Booth has incredible hair.
"- Yeah, he does."
"- I mean, a great guy too."
- Look at that.
It's kind of...
"See, there's no Rafi, because they knew that if you were on-screen, it'd be distracting."
Look at your punim.
"- Oh, squeeze it."
- Stop it.
I wanna mention that Rafi tried to do a mean thing to me in Toronto.
We're just sitting here.
Let's go there tonight.
Let's make them pay for this.
"Sure, sure now we're doing drive bys."
Just like a fucking street gang.
Then what are we going to do?
I don't know?
I don't know?
"You know if you put your gun away, it will help you bury your cousin."
Italian
"wow, wow."
What did you call me?
"All right, all right."
Enough.
Enough.
What did you call me?
"Dino, dino."
"Dino let him up, dino!"
Are you listening to me?
Are you trying to kill him?
Shut up Vic.
"Yes, I'm trying to kill him."
I will kill him.
God damn it.
"Rudy just give the man what he wants, huh?"
Did I hear you say you were sorry?
Tell him?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Jesus Christ.
"Did I hear you say you're sorry, huh?"
I'm sorry.
Flemings are a bit more...
perhaps...
Creative and innovative.
It looks like the old stereotype between northern and southern Europe.
Like Germany and Greece.
"- He's right, Mr. Lloyd."
Belgium is like a button holding a shirt together.
"Please, sire, come back."
Be reasonable.
"Here, the king of the Belgians, naked like a fish."
Is not it too cold?
"- No, it's perfect."
Happy hear all 'if'.
"Come in, Ludovic."
Is fantastic.
A king whose kingdom collapsed...
A king who wanted to go home...
In his country...
In search of the right words.
I hear.
I feel the tastes.
I smell the smells.
I see.
All my senses are amplified.
I feel reborn.
Good morning!
We arrived!
Here we are.
Good morning!
Do we have a good coffee?
Good morning.
I am thirsty.
No mention of intellectual property.
The will says nothing about these things.
Janet Cramer's been lying to us.
(lntercom buzzes)
Yes?
Someone to see you.
Have you seen our PayPal account?
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
You!
You're Kingdom?
Er?
You are what kind of an idiot?
You come along and all is ruined!
You cheap arse-bastard!
- Fantastic!
- Correct.
Have you been studying?
No.
I'm just not spending a night in a basement with a gentleman.
I'm so nervous.
"You know, in the convent, flirting was frowned upon."
"Actually, frowning was frowned upon."
Poor Jill.
"Poor, poor Jill."
Where are our drinks?
I'll go check.
Hello.
Can I buy you a drink?
What the... oh!
"Oh, God!"
It's filthy.
Tommy!
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.
Can you believe that?
This little Guinea bastard.
He's getting made.
We'll work for this guy one day.
He's gonna be a boss.
I can't believe it.
I'm really happy for you.
That's great.
Congratulations.
"Motherfuckers, we got them now."
"Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you, baby."
"Jimmy, can I talk to you for a second?"
"I mastermind the Goddamned thing, I'm left with dick."
They'd be up a creek without a paddle if not for me.
Fuck him!
I want my money.
"Henry, I want my fuckin' money!"
I've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacking Mick.
"-No, fuck him!"
I want my money!
-Good.
Go tell him.
"Are you gonna keep your mouth shut, or what?"
Huh?
"Morrie, you're gonna get your money."
You just got to stop busting balls.
Look at me.
You hear me?
"I'm a scum, not caring for the table manner."
True.
F U
F U too
"F U 3 F U 4 5,76,11"
"7,11."
Sit down.
"I've been waiting long time, kids."
How's the investigation?
Found the Scorpion Yong?
"If he didn't attack us, we wouldn't have lost to him."
I find it strange.
Like someone is leading us in circle.
Does that tattoo guy really exist?
"That message from Lo Keung, is it real?"
What good is it to Lo?
He got us to meet Scorpion Yong.
To have him kill us.
Okay.
Someone's pulling the strings to do it to us.
Good partners.
"I'm hungry, let's eat first."
Waiter!
"Michael, how did you piss off Scorpion Yong?"
What?
He's bringing his men come to you.
How does he know I am here?
"You can pay me, so can he."
How do you know where I am?
Your Lamborghini is hard to miss.
This is my favour to you.
Run now.
They're not me anymore.
I couldn't say why.
Here it is.
The guard dropped charges.
I forgot about him.
Good for Jean-Pierre.
"For you too, right?"
Stay as long as you want.
Leslie's friends are away till June.
They teach at Brown.
Can you shut off the engine?
They're filming.
What movie?
I heard it's Maigret.
Is Jean Richard here?
Make sure there's hot tea in Jean's trailer tomorrow.
Don't worry.
He said you forgot.
"Graciously, but he said it."
Don't worry.
Here's the transparency.
This is nice.
"Okay, we keep it."
"And ""No More Brain"", third."
With slogans like this...
Victory for the people's struggle!
You could have waited.
I couldn't.
I had to be here for the end of the show.
Our comrades think the theater owner is cheating them.
So you count the spectaros?
To catch him.
But where do I put it?
The pupil's gone.
Your eye just looks like a ping-pong ball.
I think it rolled up into my head.
"Look, just... just do the other one."
(screaming)
You look like one of those blind jazz guys.
Where are you?
I can't see anything.
(screaming)
I don't like this.
Just wear your stupid glasses.
"Chris, I'm blind."
"I'm sorry, Meg."
(crying)
What the hell is all this?
"This is history, Brian."
A key moment in the history of happiness.
Have a seat.
(sighs)
(piano plays gently)
♪ I cried a tear
♪ You wiped it dry
♪ I was confused

It's OK.
I am still worried about you.
More than ever.
"Sorry, mom is calling."
"Mom, I'm in Istanbul..."
it's been six months.
I don't know.
"Mom, I'll try to."
"Sure, I am doing fine."
Coffee?
What coffee?
"Oh, I see dad wants some coffee."
"Mom, I have to go now."
Clients...
Bye mom.
"Watch out, God damn it!"
How many have you broken so far.
Enough with your morning tempers.
"Get away from me, you asshole!"
"Auntie, what do you find in that animal?"
That's exactly what I like in him:
The animal in my bed.
Take down those pictures.
I'm sure they drive him crazy.
"Well, he hates me anyway."
He can fuck off...
I'll kick him out soon.
Is this forthe rent?
It's been 9 months and I still don't have a job...
Cavit still asks about you...
"Oh, he is disgusting!"
I wish our motel was still open.
Yes!
I'm nuts.
Something's going on!
"-Stop with that, already."
Enough!
Stop with that!
-No!
"I'm telling you, I look in your face and I know that you're lying!"
-Get out!
Get out!
-Shut up!
Out of my life!
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.
-You're a lousy bastard!
-You got a problem.
Go ahead.
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all that you're good for!
Get out of my life!
I can't stand you!
"Spider, what's your rush?"
"Thank you, Spider."
"Spider, that fuckin' bandage on your foot is bigger than your fuckin' head."
Next thing you know he's gonna be comin' in in one of these fucking walkers.
But you can still dance.
"Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider."
"You fucking bullshitter, you."
Tell the truth.
"You llokin' for sympathy, is that it sweetie?"
.
"Go fuck yourself, Tommy."
- What kind do you want?
- Mink.
You'll take rabbit and like it.
And that's no...
Am I aggrieved.
"Well, better luck next time."
Mm.
What lovely weather we're having.
"Excuse me, I've gotta see a patient."
- Taxi?
- Uh...
"No, no, uh..."
That dame just dropped this purse.
"- Well, I'll see that she gets it."
"- Uh-uh, uh-uh."
Ha-ha.
"No, I think she'd like me to have it."
[BUZZES]
What is it?
"Yeah, you're the doll."
You dropped this in the Randolph Hotel.
"- I tried to catch you, but you were too fast."
"- Oh, thank you."
I didn't miss it until I got home.
I wondered where I lost it.
"Won't you, uh, come in a minute?"
[CHUCKLES]
Who could say no?
"Oh, it's all there."
All I wanted was the card.
I didn't mean it that way.
"I was looking for a reward for you, but I'm afraid I haven't got enough."
- You've reached the voice mail...
"- Em, pick up the phone."
Can't tell where it's coming from.
I have no visual on him.
Ten-four.
Still have them on...?
No.
- Clear!
- Clear!
"Negative, negative."
Snipers on the roof.
Do not approach Castle.
"Repeat, do not approach Castle."
Do not advance.
Do not advance.
Say what?
"Welcome to the White House, Mr. Tyler."
I love what you've done with the place.
Bullet holes add to the decor.
Did you see that shit Conrad pulled off at the Capitol?
Goddamn!
Let's keep it tight.
Get to work.
Where are my goddamn hostages?
- Dad?
"-Oh, thank God."
"- Emily, are you okay?"
- Dad--
"Look, it's gonna be okay, baby, I promise you."
- Where are you?
- Where are you at?
I'll come get you.
"Well, where'd you come up with that creepy old guy?"
To get back at you!
Sorry.
"Oh, fuck!"
I'm so high!
You're so beautiful.
You don't know what it feels like to be outside of everything.
I think you're scared.
"Duh, under it all, you're boring, like everyone else."
"Sophie's phone, leave a message."
What are you doing?
My job.
What are you doing here?
"My daughter, she's inside."
What's happening?
Why am I not informed?
I have a warrant.
We're seizing the Clios collection.
Sold to the gentleman in the back for 2 hundred thousand Euros.
Thank you all very much nd goodnight.
Thank you.
Christos!
"Christos, stop it!"
Stop it!
Fuck!
"There's water, there's water under the bed."
Would you fucking get it!
Please!
Please!
Neck!
Just find a vein!
Just fucking do it!
"Quiet with those hands, If you are better than I,"
"Eh, is passing something here."
We are going to see.
"It quiets about that purse,"
"I have not made anything, Help,"
Sight as it beats.
Has done me one trap?
you do not understand it?
Help.
"You wanted to deceive to me, eh?"
displeased!
"They see here, pig."
For already with that purse.
"Wretches, you are not going to help me?"
And you also.
And you.
Displeased.
Antonio!
-Antonio?
Who is Antonio?
"-Damn it is, has called to the dandy."
-It quiets.
It quiets.
-Larguémonos.
They see here.
"-It starts, that comes the dandy."
"Damn bastard, children of puta."
Children of grandísima puta.
I am going to kill them.
-You have seen what they have done to me?
-What have they done to you?
You know them?
So much for true love!
[Screams]
[All moan]
[Murmuring]
"She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?"
Mmm.
"Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty, children got to be free to lead their own lives."
You always say that?
[Chuckles]
[Sighs] Then I guess there's just one problem left.
"And what's that, Your Majesty?"
How much I'm going to miss her.
[Cheering]
[Chef] Ah-ha!
[Chef shouts]
[Laughs] Yes!
Thank you.
Thank you.
"[Whispers] I love you, Daddy."

"Oh, yes?"
"And what time do we call this, then, eh?"
I don't want to get you out of bed.
[ Chuckles ]
Here.
No good leaving all this stuff for 56B.
They're on holiday.
That's the way out.
"Now you're here, and she's going to to deal with it."
"I must implement corporate review, but it ends here."
-Everything okay?
I think I took from the car.
It goes well.
How are you doing?
That's him.
-Who?
"The Chinese investor, it's him."
Aksel Nilsen.
-Oh well.
I shook his hand.
Damn ...
"It goes well, it."
Come now.
That's OK.
"Helen, now comes the Chinese soon."
It does not appear here.
Tonje.
-Put away the report now.
-They must get the latest version.
It's not what's important now.
Now you just go in and smile and buttoning his coat outright.
Let me.
It is not here.
Then we buttoning his coat together.
You and I. Right?
So remember to smile.
We have made major investments in buildings and machinery.
-per-Olav?
"-Blitt Big shot now, yes."
"What are you doin', what are you doin'?"
I'm lookin' for some friends of yours.
One of them's a little guy.
"Wears a beret, has a beard."
"The other one's a big, stocky guy."
"Ugly, looks like an animal..."
You know who I'm talking about?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
- No?
"- No, uh-uh."
Huh... huh?
"Early this morning, a friend of mine got mugged."
I think they did it.
"A black man, this morning?"
You know anything about that?
"No, I don't know anything about it."
"Wait, no, wait... no, no!"
Uh...
now.
Tell me where they are right now.
"Uh, we got a..."
"We got a clubhouse over on barton and throop, on the... on the second floor, okay?"
That's it.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
No...
"If you're lyin', I'll be back."
"No, I'm not lying to you."
[Panting]
I'm not lyin' to you!
[Music playing]
[Group chatter]
But that didn't mean she had to like him.
Franko!
As I live and breathe.
(CHUCKLES)
Franko!
As I live and breathe.

You don't look a day older.
You don't look a day older.
"I'd give you a big kiss, George,"
"I'd give you a big kiss, George, but these good Richmond folks might get the wrong idea, uh?"
"but these good Richmond folks might get the wrong idea, uh?"
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
So...
"So... ..how's the gun shop business, uh?"
"..how's the gun shop business, uh?"
Having copper mates never hurts.
Having copper mates never hurts.
A beer?
Or do you want a woggy wine?
Give me a beer.
A beer?
Or do you want a woggy wine?
Give me a beer.
Sure.
Sure.
"What can I do for you, Franko?"
"What can I do for you, Franko?"
You heard I'm looking for someone?
You heard I'm looking for someone?
Thought you might know the right man.
- No!
"- I don't need to go to a doctor, no."
"- Meemaw, Meemaw..."
"- No, no, no."
"- Meemaw, I promised..."
"I promised my mom that I would take you to the doctor, okay?"
Okay.
Then I'm gonna drive.
"You're not gonna drive, Meemaw."
- I'm gonna drive.
- No.
Too many DUls.
"Hey, scoot over, four eyes."
- Oh...
"- Come on, come on."
"- Martha, just..."
- But you're not...
You're not on my insurance policy.
"Oh, we won't tell anybody."
"Well, legally, I have to call the police if you drive."
"Legal, schmegal."
"Move over, honey."
Wow.
Ten years I haven't driven.
"Chip, what's new?"
What's happening at the Arby's?
"Uh, I don't work there anymore."
I'm a professional clown.
Oh.
"So, that means you're the breadwinner, Martha, darling?"
What do you mean?
"A man shouldn't rely on his wife for money, Chip."
- Do you guys remember?
- He did.
That was uncomfortable.
- Yeah.
On-stage.
"- But I stopped it, didn't I?"
- There we go.
"- Yeah, he was trying to get me back..."
"Oh, my gosh."
"- But, Mike, I averted your..."
"- Yeah, you did."
We were on stage doing a QA in Toronto and Rafi said:
"""Mike, sing that song that you always sang to me on set."""
And he was getting me back because of this prank we had played on him in Toronto.
He was getting you back for the $20 prank?
"Yes, exactly."
"Oh, I felt..."
I was really...
That was not a good moment.
"And he looked at me, like, the most sadistic look."
"Well, and then he got his, like, Rafi little-kid thing of like:"
"""Mike, you did it to me."""
Hilarious.
"And then I played, like, mom."
I was mom there.
"I was like, ""No."
"Michael does not do it."""
"- Yeah, that was nice."
- Here we go.
Bishop Allen.
"Oh, Mike."
"Oh, yeah, here we go."
Stupid?
I was gonna say sophisticated.
"That's no sophisticated, that's British."
Don't be confused.
Right.
What's he doing in Vegas?
Losing a bet.
Huh?
I bet him I could bring in more money than him in the next 24 hours.
Loser leaves Vegas for good.
"Oh, Sam, are you sure that's wise?"
The guy is a legend.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You know what I mean.
"I'm the number one casino host in Las Vegas, no matter who my competition is."
Right.
"Anyway, I have an ace up my sleeve, so I can't lose."
An ace?
Mm-hmm.
Mr. Wu.
He plays at least a million a visit.
That sounds like an ace.
Mm-hmm.
"Mr. Wu, hi."
Let's get you to a table.
"I don't think so, Sam."
"Uh, is there a problem?"
I'll say.
You have a ghost?
"Oh, the ghost."
[Chuckles]
That's absurd.
"Brother Foon, he's the one!"
"- Mousy, you have a go!"
- I can't do it!
My legs go weak when I see him.
Brother Foon is a really good fighter.
I'd be happy if I was half as good as him.
Does it hurt?
I forbid you to scream!
"You've got to smile, too!"
Smile like you mean it!
Mousy.
"Next time you see Mousy, I want you to smile like you mean it."
- Brother Mousy...
- Don't you know what to do?
Scram!
"Brother Foon, you're brilliant."
"When you meet people like that, you've got to behave like a bully."
I can't act fierce.
"Brother Foon, you're my idol."
Everything will be OK if Sifu Wong agrees to take me on.
"OK, I'll put in a good word for you."
We're done for the day.
I've got to dash.
What are you doing?
"Excuse me, please."
Stop clowning around!
Let me pass!
Help!
Help!
This actor is trying to kill me!
Make way!
"Make way, please!"
Feel with your fingertips
I can't reach it.
- Don't kill him!
"- Can't just let him live, can I?"
- Please!
"- Weakness, Luke!"
Weakness!
"Gem... come on, you can do it."
Reach.
Tell you what... three bullets left.
50-50 chance of getting a live round.
If he lives...
I'll let him go.
- You want me to sh-shoot him?
"- Wake up, Luke!"
"I'm giving you the chance to save him, or you can point the gun at me, but you'll only get one chance, and if there's no bullet... well... it's all over for you."
"- Please, please don't shoot me."
Please.
"- It's not up to me, sunshine."
"Decision time, Luke."
Me or the fag?
"Either way, it's 50-50."
Time to pick a side.
Five seconds...
Four...
- No!
- Three...
Two...
- One.
"- Please don't, please, Luke, Luke..."
"- No, Gem, Gem, run, run."
- But what about you and Paul?
Down...
Down..
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, Rene?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, Rene."
"I like you, Rene, very much."
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
"We meet again, Fraulein."
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now... what shall we talk about?
All right... take it up!
Easy!
You're as stubborn as that girl.
"You like her too much, I think."
Your methods of archaeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a...
China cup.
- Shut up!
"So, I'm killing all these girls..."
He's riding next to me wondering who's doing it.
We're investigating the crimes.
Me and my partner.
"You've been a very bad boy, fucking your new partner."
"Did you get fucked, honey?"
"Well, Tommy has made a career out of fucking his partners."
- Let the girl go.
- Shut up or I'll kill you.
"- Bye-bye, Tommy."
- Jimmy!
I like this game.
"Everybody dies, and they all die with Tommy's gun."
Now we've got us a game.
"- Say goodbye to her, Tommy."
"- Jimmy, don't do it!"
"- Jimmy, no!"
- Say goodbye to her.
Jimmy!
"Put the gun down, son."
Please.
Listen to Daddy.
- Put the gun down.
"- What fun would that be, Dad?"
"It's all over, son."
Put the gun down.
- It's just starting.
- Please!
I think Tommy has some questions for you.
Tommy?
Comments?
- The driver probably ran out of coal.
- Probably forgot his ration book.
"Now remember, Billy, you've just to point him out to me."
"Don't you worry, sir."
I could recognise Faber in a stocking mask.
Blackout.
Pull your blinds down.
Thank you.
Blackout.
Pull your blinds down.
Blackout.
"Come on, give us a bit of room, pal."
Someone take him away.
Come on.
Blimey.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Be still or I'll kill you.
Why are you looking for me?
- I'm not.
- Don't lie.
"Has the army changed its uniforms, Billy?"
What's the plan?
Where's the trap?
Glasgow.
They're waiting for you at Glasgow.
"So they finally let you in the army, did they, Billy?"
Congratulations.
"Oh, my God!"
Thank you.
You've been terribly kind.
You won't change your mind and have a spot of lunch?
Get over agin that wall!
And you're the guy that's been riding me to the nut house!
Stop him!
"Somebody, stop him!"
He's crazy!
Get him away!
Get the warden!
And you're the dirty screw that killed my pal!
[YELLING]
[MEN YELLING]
MEULLER:
That's for all the guys you beat up and put in the Hole!
And that!
And that!
And this is for Lassiter!
[MEN SILENCE]
[MEN MURMURING]
We're crashing out!
Who's coming with us?
[CHEERING]
Come on!
"I don't know what he's wanted for, but I was told to bring him along by Stacey."
"Come on, get going."
[MEN YELLING]
"Come on, Ross."
We need ya.
"You're all crazy, men."
Don't try it!
They'll blast you before you get to the gate!
Don't be suckers.
Stay out of it!
"If I didn't know you were stir-nuts, I'd blast ya!"
- How on earth did you find me?
Your beloved boss.
"Fuck you, Cavit!"
Can?
"It's OKauntie, he's a friend..."
"C'mon girl, I need to go shopping!"
I've nothing left to wear.
Nothing?
As if you ever had anything...
I can buy your entire day.
"It's my photo shoot day, with that German."
Why don't you meet him later?
Then you'll get paid twice!
What's going on?
I can't go out during daylight.
Do I need to talk to yourmom?
Fuck you.
My ass is freezing'...
Swimming in November?
!
No whole wheat?
I called yourmom when you left your phone at the bar...
Why is that?
She was one mean woman.
You idiot!
What did you say?
Don't shout!
"All I said was ""Ahmet"", and she was already yelling..."
Sorry...
My mom is a little bit weird.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Hellooo!
- You don't want what he's having.
"- Just pour it, Tony."
"- Come on, Tony."
Come on.
"- Okay, okay."
I thought you were turning over a new leaf.
"Yeah, I nearly died today, Rabbit."
And you saved my life.
"I guess, um... we're even."
Is that you want to be?
Even?
All accounts closed.
Everything tied up.
Nothing complicated.
I...
I... don't know.
"Yeah, neither do I."
Thank you.
Tony.
Previously on rescue me...
What if you never see him again?
And I also started drinking again.
But let me explain.
- And that is so stupid.
- It's--it's not stupid.
I got--I figured it out.
I have a system.I can control it.
Hook a brother up with a long island iced tea.
- Who's gonna know?
- I will.
"Besides, I told your mom I'm watching out for you."
I'll see you later.
"Okay, bye."
- Bye.
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?
- You're the one I wanna be...
- Don't touch me!
You will never touch me again.
"Dino, thanks again for letting me pay over the phone."
I assure you this late-payment thing will never happen again.
"Yep, just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life."

"Oh, that's my other line."
"Okay, bye."
- Hello?
BILL:
"Hi, Gigi?"
This is Bill.
- Bill?
- Alex's friend.
We were supposed to meet up but Alex told me the wrong day.
"Bill, so you do exist."
I do.
And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're still game.
Yes.
"Sure, why not?"
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hey.
"Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming."
Hi.
- Life changed.
It got...
- Boring?
It doesn't need to be.
Come on.
"Oh, my God..."
"You know Candace, in catering?"
- My first wife.
- I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Candy Kanaskie.
No wonder she left me.
Omelettes.
"Sure, a bachelor's standby."
"Oh, I'm married."
"Oh yeah, you said first wife."
I assumed that meant there was a second.
And third.
I was talking about me.
Omelettes are my standby.
Sausage?
Kielbasa!
"So what, after the lawyer who went gay, you figure, what, one then done?"
"Well, the job, the kids, it got hard to find a serious..."
- No cheese?
- No.
"No, no, no."
"So it's not a classic, then."
Kanaskie classic.
"Yeah, my exes, they blamed the job too."
"No kids, though, unless you count the ones I supervise here."
"It's a lot, but they just didn't understand what it takes."
Then her shoes disappear in the light of the lamp.
"It blinds me, so I close my eyes"
and her face is gone.
Thanks for the flowers.
Did you bring me some licorice?
I forgot.
"Daddy, I'm sorry."
Get up and do your exercises.
Yes.
The mice have a picnic on a mountain.
"They lay down a tablecloth, a tray."
Can I have some?
- No.
"It's not for you, it's for the mice."
"Everyone gets some cake, except for the baby, because it's too hard for her."
She only drinks.
Gonki.
"My Gonki, my Gonki."
"It went by fast, huh?"
What am I talking about?
It's over.
I have to put it behind me.
"It's easy for us to say, but for you?"
It's over.
Where's Ora?
Having some tests done.
She couldn't cancel them.
She didn't tell me about any tests.
She said the swelling went down a few weeks ago.
Hello.
"Hello, Daddy."
- Hello.
No one is there.
Hey why are you peeking and scaring my girlfriend?
I'm not scaring her.
Look at my back.
Hey why me?
Brother for god sake look at my back.
Hey I'm not like that.
Neither am I.
I've been shot!
Look at my back.
Stop the car.
I'll count to 3.
You can't die.
Shall I shoot.
This diamond is gone.
And the other diamond...
Fake diamond.
Papa will be shocked once he sees it.
This is the 20 crores diamond.
Do you know?
Why do I've myself called Papa?
Why Papa?
Because Demelo only knows about having.
Pa Pa...
Papa.
And you came back and left the diamond.
You know that electricity only comes for 2 hours a day.
And you let it go to waste.
Tell me...
Where is the diamond?
Like every time electricity went this time too.
Now it'll be back Tommorow.
You're a performing bear!
Are the countess and Monsieur Liszt at home?
"I will see, madame."

I just saw the new baby.
She's adorable.
Was it a difficult labour?
Very.
What brings you to Paris?

He's very well.
Have you seen the charming Chopin?
No.

- Marie...
I've tried so hard to put him out of my mind.
You want him very badly.
"For a few heavenly minutes I thought I had him, too."
"In Angers, remember, I wore that dress."
Our eyes met...
You won't get him with a dress.
"On the contrary, my dear."
I know the man.

Strictly small potatoes.
"You sure can pick 'em, Doyle."
Still wearing your gun on your ankle?
"Someone told me the reason why you do that is... ..when you meet a chick and you rub up against her,... ..she can't tell you're a cop."
I said it's bullshit.
It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick or somethin'.
"Bill, why don't you knock it off, huh?"
He's gettin' too far ahead.
You're gonna lose him.
"For Christ's sake, move the car!"
What the hell is goin' on here?
"Klein, this is Cloudy."
Do you read me?
"Klein, this is Cloudy."
Do you read me?
!
"Come in, for Christ's sakes!"
This is Cloudy.
Got any dough?
Something better.

You don't like me?
"Endo, endocrinology, whas it mean?"
How should I know?
"Hurry up, is hurting worse!"
"And ""oto-rhino-laryngology?"""
I'm not a dictionary.
Any doctor's OK.
All I know is I'm pissing blood.
He's hurt!
You fix him up or I'll smash your head in.
Get it?
Abrasion of the left testicle.
It took 3 stitches.
The bullet missed the artery...
He sure was lucky.
We're always lucky.
Incredibly lucky.
The golden touch.
Glad to hear it.
I was worried about you.
"Don't worry, just hand over your dough."
I don't have any on me I have to go to the bank.
No kidding?
I just used my last check.
You're not putting me on?
Just a thought...
You can take a look.
"No, thanks."
- Skip the captain.
Where is he?
"He's been holed up at my place, until two days ago. I ain't seen him since."
- Who else has he seen here?

There was something about him I didn't like.
"Maybe his calling me ""friend."""
"Evening, Mrs. Chandler."
A Ramos gin fizz?
Nobody can make them the way you can.
Thank you very much.
"- Ricky, my husband."
Ricky.
- Is he Italian?
"- No, it's just a nickname."
I gave it to him a longtime ago.
Any kids?
You're still young.
What are you looking for?
Our father.
And who is that?
What did you want from me?
Are you Algerian?
- Not any more.
- Jewish?
No.
Muslim?
Christian?
Why is it so important?
Because we need to know why they separated you from our mother.
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Dorona, what do you want from me?"
This is your mother and this is you.
"Very beautiful woman, your mother."
She's obviously very brave.
How did she die?
An operation.
"Are you angry with her, Dorona?"
Don't be angry with her.
Don't cry my love.
I'm going back soon.
I moved my flight up.
Why did you come?
What is it?
The Ark.
If it is there at Tanis...
Then it is something men was not meant to disturb.
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
Do we need the monkey?
"I'm surprised at you Jones, Talking that way about our baby."
He's got your looks too.
And your brain...
"I noticed it, she's a smart little thing, smart!"

Who says I haven't?
"Ha, ha!"
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
"- No, ma'am, i'm not here to take anything."
I'm here to bring something back.
Just sign right here and i'll bring it in.
I don't have any money.

"Well, bring it on."
"All right, fellas, move it in."

"Marcus, you did this."
"Baby, thank you."
"Sorry, babe, i wish i could take the credit,"

"And when you're 15,"
I'll teach you how to roll your own.

"Cleveland, you've worked enough to go on the cruise."
(goofy grunting)
Now it's time to put those pills away and get some rest.
Nuh-uh!
There's still days before this cruise.
"I can keep working and have weeks, maybe even months off!"
Months!
Do you know how long a month is?
"I'm asking you a question, Donna!"
"Ah, forget it!"
The pills will tell me.
(crazy laughter)
That man's a mess.
"Howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy!"
Let's see.
Hmm.
How many Mega Energy Pills can I get for... this?
(grunts)
"This says: ""Happy birthday, Rallo, from Grandma."""
(grunts)
"And this is a Post-it note that says: ""One hundred dollars."""
Is it hot?
It's hot in here.
Are you hot?
I'm hot.
"Guy back there taking a long time with them pills, huh?"

"Sorry, sir."

- Thank God they've gone!
"""Shouldn't he wear a vest""!"
Huh!

"- Vests are out, man."
-
- Yours is.
I can see it from here.
-
- Let me handle this.
-
"- I wish you would, Granville."
Hi!
"Something we can do for you, man?"
Don't listen to the golden oldie here.
"He's, like, from yesterday."
"You and me, we know where it's at, right?"
"By the way, love the open shirt."
"That's very me, the open shirt."
Soon as I get out of this clobber I'm straight into the open shirt.
- He's awake.
I'll go get him.
- That's okay.
I have to talk to you.
Is something wrong?
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
Did we get the money?
- Jacob?
"- Yes, I think so."
Then what's the problem?
"I'm not coming back, Mrs. Shaw."
"Hi, sweetheart."
- Are you managing?
- I'm okay.
He's been calling all morning.
- I don't ever want to talk to him.
- No.
- Would you like some breakfast?
- No thanks.
- I need some breakfast.
"- Yes, you do."
- Want anything?
- A glass of juice maybe.
What a little asshole.
What a stupid little boy.
- Thank you for coming.

I'll get a room though so I don't have to commute.
"I brought my teddy bear pajamas, some cookies and a glass of water   sloshing about in my bag."
I haven't been in Copenhagen this often since university.
I delivered papers.
I feel proud of you.
"I might be your father, but you were born for the people!"
Previously on Kyle XY...
Kyle?
"Be careful, even in our backyard."
We have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.
Jessi starts back at school today.
I sort of levitated.
Show me how.
I will.
She's the one who attacked me.
I know Lori will never forgive me.
You have to earn forgiveness.
"""She Could Be You. "" What?"
The two of you used to play that song all the time.
D4.
It's not there.
It's a Latnok ring.
All the members received rings.
It was a way of identifying one another.
And you're Latnok?
Yes.
I got accepted into a music program in New York.
I leave in two days.
Two days?
I miss this.
I miss you.
I didn't want to go back to how I was before.
How were you before?
Invisible.
I'll call...
Please don't make a scene.
Where's the restroom?
"Yes, I called him."
When?
Why?
Because.
Want something to eat?
The cafeteria's closed.
He's sleeping.
"It went well, but took a long time."
"We will wake him up soon, to see he's all right."
"Good thing he came in, it was almost too late."
There's a problem with his papers.
- If you don't mind...
- I'll take care of it.
"We almost killed him, and for what?"
My battery's run out.
I need to make a call.
I need to talk to Raziya.
This whole costume is for her sake.
All because I love her.
What's the sense in hiding all this from her?
You know what she calls Him?
Daddy.
"She calls God ""Daddy"" and me she calls ""Honey""."
Do you need help?
No.
What's your name?
Dorona.
- And your brothers?
"- Natanel, and the little one is Shai."
- There's another one.
"Ith that's it, thank you."
-You're welcome.
And a coke.
-Yeah sure.

Your mom would be real proud of you.
Proud of a reject Juvie kid?
Close your mouth when you eat.
Very nice.
-Hyder.
So?
How is school boys?
-I hate school.
It's fine.
This whole thing's a joke.
Dad of the fuckin year over here.
Not here.
-Why not uh?
Everyone knows CPS took your kid.
Whole town knows.
Shut your mouth now.
-They don't know about Galveston.
That's enough.
-He fucking left us.
Stop.
-Don't tell me what to do.
It wasn't my responsibility to take care of everything.
Take care of Wes while you boozed up down there.
"Alright, come on."
"3 weeks dad, 3 whole weeks you were gone."
"Admit it, you wanna drink yourself to death."
"Cause when Duncan found you, you were gonna leave us for good, weren't you?"
"It's the Sunland Arms, apartment 12B."
You'd better hurry.
There's no time to lose.
Her scalp must be in very bad shape.
It is.
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
"(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Oh, uh, hello, I am Wilbert."
Your husband sent me here to make the scalp happy.
"Oh, come in."
It is not easy to come through this little hole.
"Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you out there in that cold hall, honey."
"But, you know, a nice girl can't be too careful."
(COUGHS)
Why don't you take your coat off?
"Oh, no, this is fine, thank you."
"All right, here is the coat."
(COUGHS)
I must find the place to plug in the equipment.
Over there.
"Oh, merci."
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
(WHIRRING)
"Well, I am now ready to begin."
So am I.
You know something?
What?
You're cute.
Do you know something?
Whisper it in my ear.
The scalp is dry.
Come with me.
Where?
I got a car.
Them wheels are yours?
Come on.
"What do you mean, come on?"
What's your name?
"Miko's the name, pedalling's the game."
How can I help?
- You know the Greenbergs?
- Yeah.
"Just yesterday, they takin' tourists..."
"I mean, doin' business."
You know what I mean?
"And today, pau'ana."
- They say anything about taking a vacation?
- Saul take a vacation?
- You gotta be kidding.
- I know what you mean.
Tom?
This guy says that Saul and Lena closed the place early last night.
"This morning, the place was for sale."
There was no answer from them this morning.
- Does this kid know anything?
- He's as surprised as we are.
- Let's run by their house.
"- You find anything, let me know."
- I like them old haoles.
"- Mahalo, brah."
"Thanks, brah."
Saul said they were taking a vacation.
- We're meddling.
- We're not.
- We are so.
"Well, I had the baby."
Really?
Yeah.
"You guys took so long,"
I'm already pregnant with another one.
Here's your ice water.
Thank you.
"Anything else I can get for you, dirty stranger?"
Dr. Roland!
"Oh, my God."
I'm so glad to see you.
Yeah.
I didn't need to see the Rolling Stones tonight.
Where's Zack?
Jail.
Boom!
Just won the office pool.
Okay.
"Let's take a gander at the old money maker, huh?"
"Oh, six centimeters."
Shouldn't be long now.
But Zack's not here.
"Olivia, help."
Don't worry about it.
I know people at every precinct in this town:
"If they don't let him go, they're going to read about it in tomorrow's front page."
"Yeah, she's gonna get arrested, too."
Hey.
I slept with her.
I don't care.
I can't believe that
Zack's not going to make it.
And he's one of your best friends.
Mm-hmm.
Why don't you pursue him?
I always liked him.
I'm just not good at pursuing a guy.
"HALLIE, I'm sorry if I made you feel..."
jealous.
"I mean, I never, never meant to."
I never even knew I did.
"I guess I just feel the way you felt with J.P., you know?"
Yeah.
I understand that.
The next morning as soon as she woke up
Jill took a cab straight home to face the music.
Not knowing if that music...
would be a wedding march.
Drew.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
I really do love you.
"Me, too."
Smell my hair.
Does it still smell like cigarettes?
No.
It smells like Jill.
Ugh.
Wow.
Look at this.
"Party at our place, and it's only 9am."
"Last night, she was wearing the ugliest pair of cotton granny panties"
I've ever seen in my entire life.
Akan!
"Akan, open this fucking door, do you hear me?"
I got her all dolled up in the back of my truck downstairs.
I'm gonna rip your fucking lungs out!
"You'll go far, Henry, unlike this piece of shit."
"Hey, Henry."
Put your gun down.
It's all good.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Peaceful, peaceful."
Chill out.
Calm down.
Now I've shared something with you.
I need you to share something with me.
Where's Akan going?
Now that is my ego talking to yours.
"What do you want... higher self, ego?"
"Higher self, ego?"
- Higher self!
- Higher self.
Yeah.
Okay.
Akan's convoy are taking the girl to his base.
"Oh, shit."
Let me handle this.
Let me handle this.
"I'm sorry you're upset, okay?"
- Henry and I are gonna go deal with Akan.
- Henry?
Who is Henry?
You wanna go on the bike?
You can go on the bike.
"- Got your own John Dillinger, huh?"
"- Yeah, and, like, Capone too."
Be it ever so humble.
"Yeah, where is Miss Sexy Feet?"
She's in that nest over there.
"Oh, well, you go on."
I'll wait here and observe.
Not like this.
This has to be done right.
Come on.
"Well, I see you've cleaned this up."
"Oh, yeah."
"Here, why don't you have a seat over here, Jon?"
"- No, thanks."
- You want a cold drink?
- Yeah.
What do you got?
- Let me see.
Got a little apple juice and a piece of watermelon left over from the Fourth.
July Fourth?
"- Well, this is almost..."
"- Yeah, I know."
It's a little dried out.
I'll pass.
"You know, I could do it like in the movies."
I could walk over and borrow a cup of sugar or flour.
"Yeah, if you could find a cup."
Are you kidding?
I know where everything is in here.
Lucky it was that pole and not my leg.
"Now, what do you think?"
Sugar or flour?
It is.
Mainly it is heartaches.
You mean real heartaches?
"Deep down, world looking empty?"
"-- ""Need a shoulder to lean on"" heartaches?"
-
"- Yes, they're the ones."
"Yes, that's them."
I get 'em sometimes.
I know what they're like.
-
- They're terrible.
-
- Terrible!
I used to get 'em a lot.
Used to think life was really bad.
Then me husband left me.
I've felt heaps better since!
"You see, when you least expect it, something turns up."
What's wrong with Granville?
"Oh, you poor love!"
"There, Mrs Featherstone, your change."
F--f--f--f--four...
F--f--f--four...
That's just right.
"It's a very funny sensation, getting entangled at my age with an errand boy."
(COMMOTION OUTSIDE)

We will definitely get those orders.
I will prepare an excellent sample..
..which no one will have in the market!
Oh brother!
Thats really great!
Huh!
The quality is excellent.
-well thanks.
But this order is worth 80 lakhs.
And yourfactory is too small.
Can you handle such a Iarge order?
"Yeah, why not!"
Why not!
"We will deIiverthe goods within the time, Mr.."
Mr. Airport!
Airport?

You can call me Mr. Adda if you want!
Oh Adda!
Oh Mr. Adda!

"Mr. Adda, at Ieast give us one chance!"
Oh I Iike your sincerity!
Just a minute.
"Sir, both of the partners of Naina Garments are over here!"
"What, sir?"
How do they look?
well they are quite handsome!
"Granville, far be it for me to try to influence a h--hunchback."
Come on.
"There she goes, the grocer's delight!"
-
"- Granville, have you got that mike fixed up?"
-
- Just a minute.
The nurse is there.
I want to catch her before she goes in.
I've got an idea.
-
- Come on.
-
- Here you are.
"Thank you, Igor, my faithful servant."
This is what I'm going to say.
"""Hello, sh--sh..."
"Hello, sh--sh..."
"Hello, folks!"
"""This is Ark--Ark--Ark..."
This is Ark...
"This is Ark--Ark..."""
"I don't think I'd b--better do this, Granville."
Did you notice a little s--stammer?
"Nothing worth talking about, no."
"But you'd better let me do it, just in case."
You look more like a duck's jockey.
Disc jockey!
Disc jockey!
"In my case, a slipped disc jockey!"
Don't worry.
"Listen, don't start it off till I give you the signal."
"You'll get your ID card, then you can tell your lovely Harald all."
He will make you forget everything.
Forget?
What can he make me forget?
I have nothing but hate left for him.
"But I won't let him forget, I'll show him"
He's in for a shock when he sees what he's done to me.
Hold on for a minute!
What is it?
Get dressed and hurry away!
My brother-in-law.
Damn!
Is there nobody here?
"You're sleeping in broad daylight, right?"
"But not in my underwear, Karl!"
"Also, still cheeky!"
I drove through the night.
And you've arrived 3 days too late.
Father John!
What?
- I said:
Father John!
Are you crazy?
Told you:
Not in my underwear!
In what hospital is she then?
Hospital?
The birth took place here.
Karl!
Mommy!
"You have a son, Mr John!"
Why is he in such a hurry?
"Fi, we need to get the biggest armed response we can get at that place."
How big?
Very big.
Jabbar's guys are armed to the teeth
And aren't gonna go down without a fight.
I think I have an idea.
Remember that burner phone we gave your mom?
Hello?
"Mom, I don't have a lot of time."
"I need you to say, in a loud, clear voice,"
"""1212 Bayshore Avenue."
"Yes, Michael, I can be there."""
Are you sure?
I don't know if anybody's told you --
I know Riley bugged the house.
It's what I'm counting on.
I need to get the CIA to show up someplace fast.
Can you do that for me?
"Yes, Michael."
1212 Bayshore Avenue.
I can be there.
"Thanks, Mom."
I'll be in touch when I can.
M-Michael --
"We lost his pulse, Sam!"
What?
I can't find a pulse!
"There's nothing, man."
Nothing.
Nothing.
Do it!
Do it!
"No, this was never closed like this."
"Oh, there's a lock here."

- Hello?
Is it open?
"Oh, hooray."
Thank you.
"- Hi, I'm sorry about the holdup."
- Thank you.
- Let me get out of your way.
- Thank you very much.
Do you... do you know Anne Tyng?
- No.
"Hi, Rob Frey."
"- Hi, nice to meet you."
- An honor to meet you.
- Anne was the... the architect with Lou on the project.
- Unbelievable.
- Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Okay.
If it's okay if we just want to look around?
"Oh, absolutely."
Gosh.
"- It's painted now, huh?"
- Terrible.
"I mean, it's just such a shame."
"""Dearest Annie,"
"""I must build one of the great buildings of the time."
"""You must help me build this particular building."
"""I doubt if I can do it without you."
"""Just think how low architecture has gotten down."
Put a fun spin on it.
"You're a pervert, Sid."
You need to get help.
I know.
"Right, we have a big case to solve, something you're not going to have to worry about now, eh?"
No.
Big cases and police work.
"Sleet, don't say that."
I'm really bad at breaking bad news.
"Yeah, yeah, no fucking joke!"
That's why I thought I'd get you to do it.
"Yeah, really fucking funny!"
"OK, I, I'm sorry, Sid."
"Be careful, yeah?"
Are we going now?
"Yeah, we go."
Come on.
"We'll just leave him here, he'll be fine."
Good luck.
Thanks.
"Bye, Sid."
Sorry.
Don't steal anything while you're here.
"I got a call from Bomb Squad, they'd found Cowell."
The only way to deactivate the bomb was typing in the name of the kidnapper.
"Miley, Jessie or Sugar."
Time for a hero!
Dermot O'Leary's here!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
"O'Leary, this is it."
Yeah.
"Good morning, Miss Simpson."
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fantastic.
"In English, please, Nadine."
You're not going to ask me about Gary?
Yes.
Your Internet romance.
How's it going?
- Yesterday he said he loves me.
- What?
Really?
"He signed off, "" Love, Gary."""
"Nadine, you mustn't read too much into that."
"Americans use the word ""love"" very casually."
"We say ""I love you"" like you say ""Good-bye."""
""" Hi."
You must be Gary.
I'm Nadine.
"I came all the way from Brazil to see you only."""
Just to see you.
- Okay.
Just to see you.
- Right.
"""I know that I don't know you very much."""
- Very well.
- Thank you.
No.
I don't know you very well.
"- "" But you don't know me either."""
- Ei-ther.
""" But I am sure, deep inside my heart... that you are the person of my life."""
"You know, you don't say ""person of my life."""
Blow!
You too!
"Oh, turn the lights out before you go, Stoker!"
"You made a mistake, Stoker!"
A bad mistake!
I don't mean about Nelson!
"Three, four wins and nobody will remember what happened!"
"But I paid for something tonight, and I didn't get it!"
"I don't like that, Stoker!"
I didn't know anything!
Tiny didn't say anything!
He know he was to go in the third!
I give Tiny the dough an hour ago!
- Fifty bucks!
- I didn't get any...
- I bet you didn't!
- Hold it!
You get dressed!
We'll talk about this later!
- Anything else?
- A couple of cans of soup!
- What kind?
- Vegetable!
"Oh, and two bottles of beer!"
That'll be $ 1 !
13 with three cents to the governor!
That's $ 1 !
16!
One-sixteen!
You ought to throw in a floorshow!
There he is!
"All right, Stoker, we'll talk!"
- Hello?
"- Hi, this is Gigi."
- Gigi?
- Gigi Phillips.
- Huh?
"- I, um had the dentist pen."
Right.
Hey.
How you doing?
- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.
You had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.
"Okay, look, now I need to be harsh with you."
"Conor's never gonna be interested in you, Geege."
"No, I know."
This is about Jarrad.
Jarrad.
So we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming...
"Hey, give me two seconds, okay?"
"Two seconds, hold on."
Let me guess.
He said:
"""The only thing happy about this hour is you."""
He might have used some derivative of that.
[CHUCKLES]
"So he says he's going to call, but then he gives me his card and he says..."
"Oh, he's not interested."
- You don't even know if he's called.
"- Oh, did he?"
No.
- But I honestly think he's expect...
- Okay.
What about us?
"It's always Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, all the time."
"You can't change things now, Anna."
Hello?
Why are you sitting here?
Sweetheart!
It's lovely to see you.
- I can't stand it when we fight.
- Me neither.
But we need to talk about this properly.
- Yes.
- Like grown ups.
"- Of course, sweetie."
- So stop calling me sweetie.
- What can I call you then?
- You could call me Anna.
Okay.
Did you marry Jorgen for my sake?
So that I had a father?
No.
I love Jorgen.
Do you?
A lot.
So everything with Jacob was a mistake?
- No.
- What was it then?
"I was very in love with Jacob, but I was also very unhappy."
About what?
About being in love with him.
We just hurt each other all the time.
When you told me Jorgen wasn't my father   why didn't you say Jacob was?
Maybe because...
"Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here."
To where?
We would never get it far enough away.
Maybe the Waverider can.
"Rip, we need..."
Rip?
Rip!
What are you doing?
"I'm flying the Waverider into the sun,"
- with the meteor on board.
- And you on it.
I guess this is good-bye.
"It's been a pleasure, Captain."
"Likewise, Dr. Palmer."
"But you brought us all into this, man."
"Which is why I'm doing this alone, Mr. Jackson."
I'll have no one else die for my choices.
This isn't going to bring Snart back.
I don't want to lose another friend.
"I appreciate that, Mr. Rory."
"I must say, it's been an honor to serve as your cap..."
Rip.
Daddy?
Miranda.
I...
Where...
"I'm still here, Captain."
"I know you are, Gideon."
May I share something with you?
I'm not ready to die.
Me neither.
Which reminds me...
Is everything all right?
"Lynn, are you all right?"
You look strange.
Is anything wrong?
I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's wrong.
A feeling like I had when Bobby... died.
Stan?
Stan?
Stan is here.
My brother is here.
And he's dead.
My brother is dead.
It could be Bobby.
No.
"No, it's Stan."
Pull yourself together.
He's dead.
Wait here.
Hello.
"Good evening, boys."
- Have you got the stuff?
- What stuff?
- The Mickey Finns.
- What do you want 'em for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
"- I'm afraid it's our duty, madam."
- We're police officers.
Come along.
- (Sighs)
(Footsteps)
My dear Lord Mayley!
This is an unexpected pleasure.
"Laden with good news, I trust?"
- Yes... and no.
- Ah...
Hmm...
I'm willing to pay but the point is this - my wife's rich father is on his last legs.
- So?
- He won't last a year.
"She'll get the lot, I shall be able to extract."
A year?
"I gave you two weeks, remember?"
"- Yes but £10,000..."
- You're an insurance chief.
- You earn a lot.
- My wife spends a lot.
"- If there's any left, I spend it."
- Too bad.
"I don't know where I'm going to get £10,000."
The hell with it.
The hell with you.
"Uh, you know, about the other night."
I don't want there to be--
"Don't even worry about it, man."
Myjaw's not made out of glass.
"Yeah, well, you know, blood's thicker than blonds, right ?"
"So, you got my back on Saturday ?"
Derek...
"I ain't got nobody else, man."
- You got Lip.
- Lip ?
"Man, that fool will get a nigger killed quick, man."
"No, I need you there."
"47th Street, under the El."
"I'll call you, man."
Are you down ?
"- Yeah, I'm down."
"- All right, man."
"Let me get to class, get some education like you."
All right.
Uh... I don't wanna bug you. I just came in here to say good luck.
"So, tomorrow's the big day, huh ?"
Yeah.
- You scared ?
- Shitless.
You got a minute foryour old man ?
I wanna show you something.
Sure.
Be careful.
"That wall, it's, uh, still wet."
"That'syourmother when she was 19, when I fiirst met her."
Hold on.
Hold on.
"Sam, hang it up."
Hang it up.
[Typing]
[Beeping]
Why don't I just run a search on his credit card?
Mmm.
Smart.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- James W. Harpel?
- Mm-hmm.
Looks like he opened up a tab at Pure about an hour ago.
Thank you.
That reverse psychology stuff?
"That's cheating, Sam."
Uh-huh.
"If you ain't cheating', you ain't tryin', Mike."
Damn.
Hey.
You guys see this?
"""Mancuso menaces Montecito."
"Ghost of former owner haunts hotel."" What the hell is this?"
I don't know.
Maybe that guy Taylor went to the press.
"What, because we made him pay what he owed?"
"Well, if he thought the story was gonna hurt us, he was wrong."
Bookings are way up.
Haunted hotels...
quite popular apparently.
Quite popular apparently?
What's the matter?
Sorry.
I...
That's haven't been honest with you about a couple things.
Okay.
I lied to you about babysitting my brother the other night.
That guy at church was Tim Riggins.
Mmm-hmm.
We have kind of a history together.
"Okay, what kind of history?"
"Get the door, Brian."
Hey.
"Hey, I just came by to say that I'm sorry."
Come in.
"Hey, Noannie."
Didn't Mom ban her?
"Noannie, please."
"Just watch your show and be easy, all right?"
I just feel so bad about everything.
I really cannot believe you had to apologize like that.
I wish we could erase that whole day.
It's gonna be okay.
This whole thing gonna blow over.
I was really worried about you.
Smash always lands on his feet.
Hello?
Who is that?
No.
"No, I don't."
Who is this?
"Noannie, give me the phone."
You guys are jerks.
Did you have to put me with the massage ads?
"Well, it was either that or the page with the personals, so..."
This page gets a lot of action.
"Yeah, I guess you're right."
"Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"All right, Mary, I'll talk to you soon."
Thank you.
Bye.
PAIGE:
What I'm trying to show you is that there's a difference.
There is a difference.
BETH:
"Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?"
PAIGE:
She wanted to do it.
LAURA:
Really?
She told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.
- Is that not right?
PAIGE:
"No, she didn't."
LAURA:
No?
BETH:
What's the...?
Why the big rush to get married?
PAIGE:
Because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter and I am not waiting till spring.
You are so pregnant.
PAIGE:
- My phone fell into the water
Can't you pick the phone?
Don't shout without knowing what happened.
- What happened?
Did someone die?
- Worse than that!
- What?
I'm using the phone that fell into a commode.
Alphonse...
- Look how he is responding...
He is screaming at me.
- Ignore him.
Did you trace their location?
- Shall we leave?
Okay.
AKG service apartment is Vikram's location.
Vasundhara's phone shows the same location.
They must be together.
Let's go.
Panju.
Panju.
407.
- Sir.
You seem to be very clear about what you need.
I'm the confused one running after you repeatedly.
Driver.
Start.
Go...
Hey!
She has swept his account clean.
Thank you.
"She did see us, right?"
"- Ari, look at us becoming BFF's."
- I know.
- I love that it's capsulated on film.
- It's on film for...
- That's an attractive looking face.
- You're drunk.
- Good look.
- You're beautiful.
"Ari, when you..."
- Okay.
- I love this.
Have you been looking at me?
"""I've been looking at you guys."
"Have you been looking at me?"""
A lot of good practice.
Flirting in college.
It really helped a lot.
And look at Jonny's bone structure.
- Yeah.
- Jonny has the greatest face.
- Look at that.
"- Oh, mama."
He's creepy.
People keep asking me if Jonny's related to Josh Hartnett.
"- Oh, my gosh."
- Really?
"I don't even really know the answer to that, I assume not."
"I don't think he is, but I can see why they're asking."
- Just because they look...?
- What is that?
"Yeah, they have similar bone structure."
- came all this way to see me.
- Freddy!
"[ Ray ] You see, Officer, in Garrison... when the car you're gonna tag has got a P.D.A. sticker..."
"I'd advise you to think to yourself, """"Hey, that's one of the good guys."
"I think I'll go catch me a bad guy."""
"If we didn't pull over P.D., there wouldn't be any violations in this town."
The problem in this town ain't the people that live here.
It's the element that visits.
"Is this a new car, Ray?"
It's nice.
We didn't recognize it.
"Come on, Freddy, I wanna go home."
Tell this cupcake to heel.
"- Okay, that's not necessary."
- Cindy.
"- Well, listen, take care, guys."
See you later.
- [ Ray ] Hey.!
"- What happened to you, Freddy?"
- [ Chuckles ] Fender benders.
She's kinda cute.
[ Phone Ringing ]
- [ Ringing ]
- Dispatch.
Hi!
Can I call you back?
bye.
- You okay?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I got it.
[ Phone Ringing ]
Dispatch.
"No, no."
"Whoever she is, she's not worth the bother."
I think David's mixed up in something.
That girl they found in the Kingsmead...
"Jack, it's me, Jane."
Just checking in on the latest on the Bentleys.
"Apparently, they're gonna rob a bank."
- There's something going out between those brothers.
We have movement at the Pembridge.
Do you know what kind of man Clifford Bentley is?
What's that for?
"You a superstitious man, Silas?"
He's losing his grip on this job.
"There's a matching necklace, part of a set."
My God.
"- Jane, there's something..."
- Yes?
I saw you both earlier.
You should speak to him.
If you're serious.
About what?
- Sarge?
- What the hell was that?
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Golf Hotel to all units.
I need a report.
Someone tell me what the hell's going on!
I want two of you on doors!
[Screams]
[Audience booing]
"[Normal voice] No, no, no, no, he's okay!"
I need you to talk for two minutes.
About what?
Anything.
All right.
"[Scratchy voice] These cats are more than just pets, sir."
Excuse me.
Where's the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets."
[Cheers and applause]
[Laughs]
Uh-oh.
Look at shorty.
This honky grandma be trippin'!
[Laughter and applause]
"What's up, America?"
!
I'm coming into your house live!
"Let me hear you say, ""We love you, Tracy!"""
ALL:
"We love you, Tracy!"
I am the third heat!
[Laughter]
[Cheers and applause]
He's brilliant.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
Then you should fight.
With everything you have.
- What do you want?
- I want you to stop being so afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
- I'm want us to stop being so careful.
- I'm just-
- I wanna marry you!
What?
I wish the sun would rise already.
This graveyard shift's going forever.
You okay?
"I love you too, Carter, but it's over."
I'm gonna ask her tonight.
You're going to propose?
"Actually, I already did, but badly."
- She said no?
- She didn't say anything.
But this time I'm gonna do it right.
That is a nice rock.
That was my great-grandmother's.
Great-grandfather gave it to her the day he left for the Army.
I don't think she'll mind that it's secondhand.
Hey.
You guys want something from Magoo's?
My treat.
"- No, thanks."
"- No, I'm all right."
"- Hey, Luka."
- Hey.
You dispo Mr. Lindsey?
- They took him up to Cards.
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
Down...
Down...
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, René?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, René."
I have you.
They're wonderful.
You must let me try one on.
It is good to be working at my trade again.
It's just a pity you have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
(CHAINS RATTLING)
(THUNDER CRASHING)
Hatter.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
"I'm frightened, Alice."
I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.
Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so.
You're entirely bonkers.
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.
Here.
That's better.
You look yourself again.
RED QUEEN:
Hat man!
Where are my hats?
I'm not a patient monarch!
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal sword hidden in the castle.
The rabbit will help you.
"Find it, Alice."
Take it to the White Queen.
We'll go to the White Queen together.
Why is it you're always too small or too tall?
As to the connection between dreams
And the subconscious mind.
(andreas:)professor fox?
Yes?
Gareth watson.
I was expecting someone a little older.
Uh...
You must be nigel.
Bailey.
Shall we head inside?
I'd like to throw you a bit
"Of a curve, I'm afraid."
I have a contact who called me
To come and meet him.
But we just got here.
He offered to show me a map
To the druid astronomicons.
So I'd like to make the same offer to you.
Don't tell me
You're not interested.
In the keys to stonehenge?
Sure.
I'm sorry to be so last-minute.
My contact just called me himself.
Shall we?
Yeah.
A map to the astronomicons...
They've been lost for 2000 years.
[âª]
Excuse me.
"Gareth watson is signing books here,"
Today?
What did he say?
Precisely what he's been asked to say.
"Sir, your mail."
Turn it around.
Your flight for Mumbai leaves in two hours.
Our associate will get in touch with you.
He will brief you about the rest.
Is this what you really want?
Neil?
"Yes, I want this."
Mumbai?
"In this business enemies are aplenty, Ranbir."
But there is only one Maya.
This is a risk I cannot take.
Hello
"Hello, could you please send somebody to room 607 to collect the bag?"
"Yeah, thank you."
It's open.
You shouldn't leave your door open like this.
Never know who could enter.
Put your hands up.
Put them up!
Don't be dramatic.
Sit.
We need to talk.
Talk about what?
The truth.
It's weighing on me like a ton.
Is that so?
Shall we start?
Bangkok...
O.P. Ramsay?
So?
"So, like, our first time shouldn't be in a car."
Don't worry about me.
I don't need the whole candles and roses thing if you don't.
- I don't.
- Great.
"So, come here and kiss me."
- Could you...
less tongue?
"- Sure, sure."
Slower.
"Ok, switch."
- Kiss my neck.
- You know what?
It's almost time for my curfew.
We better...
I better get home.
Ok?

Just some band some kids at school started.
I miss hearing music pouring from your room.
"It's always been one of my favorite things, even when you were little, and you weren't very good."
"Yeah, well..."
"You know, for what it's worth,"
I should go
"Please, just relax"
What is it?
Camille is here
What?
She says she loves you
And she misses you
"She misses Léna, too"
What happened wasn't your fault
Tell her I love her
She has gone
Present day
Where am I?
In hospital
You were in a coma I can't feel my legs
Don't worry.
That will come back
Can you remember your name?
Yes I think so
Well?

Do you recall what happened?
No

What are you doing?
It's over.
The plant is flooded
You can't just leave
They've got a gym...
"Come on, Mom."
Please.
This is ridiculous.
It's what I chose to do.
I'm going to find a place soon.
- And you really think you can start over?
- You mean at my age?
"- Yes, yes I do."
"- I'm still breathing, aren't I?"
I'm still here.
It's a long time ago.
Daddy'll understand.
"No, that's..."
That's not the point of this.
You've been together since college.
Yup.
And do you know how miserable I've been almost the whole time?
- I don't think that's true.
"- Well, I've just kept it from you."
"Yeah, trust me, Mom, you're not that good at hiding your emotions."
Really?
I'm sorry.
You make this difficult because you want it that way.
Men are easy.
"And you've been with Michael, what,"
"- three years, right?"
- Yeah.
And it took me less than half an hour to figure him out.
- Wow.
"Oh, you're lucky."
Jeez.
- What?
- Yeah.
Positive now?
You're only nineteen.
- I'm twenty.
- You're only twenty.
I know what age I am.
Don't start getting snotty with me.
I should be getting snotty with you.
Sorry.
"It's shocking, that is."
What do you think?
- I don't know.
- That the best you can do?
"Well, what do you think?"
I don't know.
"I should give out, I suppose... or throw a wobbler or something... but what's the point?"
"I mean, if she was..."
You should have come to us earlier.
"Before, you know, when... said you were gonna get pregnant... then we could've done something about it."
My God.
"You're positive, now?"
Absolutely certain?
Shh.
"Molly, my Irish Molly"
Good girl.
What's that on your face?
Shaving foam.
Oh.
"Well, fair enough."
"My Irish Molly, when you are near"
Who was it?
"Uh, is everything okay today?"
Why wouldn't it be?
No reason.
"So, what do you want to lay down today?"
"Uh, no."
No bets.
I'm just going to cool it today.
Thanks.
So why did you call me?
"Uh, shit."
"I got to go, Ivan."
I'll talk to you later.
So what does that mean?
"It means we wait 10 hours, figure out what the hell's happening."
"Babe, can we talk?"

It's probably 'cause I called you like a paranoid fucking idiot.
(HITS WALL)
"Hey, Ivan."
What a surprise.
What are you doing?
He's going to be here soon.
You can't leave me alone.
"Well, I'm not in the picture, so, send me a text message when it's done?"
"Well, I-"
"I'm not in the photo either, so... maybe I should leave too?"
I always get these things right!
No thanks.
"Yeah, no thanks."
"But, I really can tell the future!"
"Right, Saho?"
!
"You smell nice, Saho-san."
Ah!
That smell is incense.
I love it.
"The smell is great, and it is interesting to watch the smoke rise."
It makes me feel really relaxed.
Yeah!
I have been getting into incense lately myself!
Incense is great!
Okay!
Okay!
"Oh man, Fumi!"
You really are doing whatever your teacher does!
Of course I am!
"By the way, Hibara-san."
Hm?
"Actually, I have a favor to ask you."
Smoke?
I heard about your grandfather.
I heard that he deals with things from the other side.
Fumi-chan!
Sorry!
Saho-san was looking up things like that!
There are... a lot of things that I want to know.
Is it possible for me to talk to him?
Sorry for visiting you at such a busy time.
I cast that cat myself.
"And sir, while they are my-- Ow!"
Aaugh!
"No, no, no, no, no."
He's okay.
I need you to talk for two minutes.
About what?
Anything.
All right.
"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
"Why, just this morning--"
Excuse me!
Where is the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets."
Uh-oh.
Look at Shorty.

"What's up, America?"

"Lemme hear you say ""We love you, Tracy."""
"We love you, Tracy!"

He's brilliant.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"Yeah, yeah."
"It's not so fun being ""hands on"" with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
Could we talk about this on Monday?
No.
(Mrs Drayton) I'm always saying the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
(Jo) Not in the least.
"Dr McKenna, do you -"
"Why don't all of you sort of turn around here, or something."
It's kind of - kind of hard on the neck.
(Mr Drayton) It's in one of our English counties.
It's not what you'd call a farm.
It's more of a small holding.
Here we are.
- 0h.
- lsn't that fascinating?
Yes.
- There we are.
- Uhh.
"- Hey, they look good."
- Surprise.
"0h, they look wonderful."
"Ah, looks like bread."
"- We're not going to eat all that, are we?"
- No.

"Yes, just break it, just like this."
"It won't break. 0h, no."
"Well, I'm gonna"
- There.
- ls that the way you do it?

That was a tough one.
Does it chew any better than it tears?
- ls it fattening?
- l imagine it must be.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it really is."
No.
Mom...
"Squirt, where the heck's your mom?"
I know I asked you to be my stepdad.
Do you mind being my friend instead?
"So Julie's had enough of the old Bullit, eh?"
We can still play ping-pong together.
Come on.
"You know, I let you win."
"No, you don't."
"Yes, I do."
In your dreams.
You ever see that movie Casablanca?
No.
It goes like this:
"Peanut, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"Come on, luck be a lady, luck be a lady."
Oh!
"I can't believe this, I didn't win."
Shocking.
"Well, if it's any consolation, though, this soft serv is outstanding."
Would anyone like seconds?
"Yeah, I would."
"Yeah, me, too."
Thank you.
Sorry things didn't work out with you and Julie.
Hey...
I'm sitting here sharing ice cream with my kid.
It's been a long time since I've done that.
Tell me that's her.
Where are they?
- You can't just barge in here!
- Where are they?
I ain't seen them.
They're not here.
Bollocks.
- Don't lie to us.
"- 'Ere, I know you."
Have a heart and tell me.
What happened to my son John?
She doesn't know.
Right.
"Well, John's dead."
Where are the other two?
A man we identified as John Bentley was killed in an explosion at the British Savings Bank...
- All right.
Now she knows.
"- Daniel Mitcham... and our colleague, Detective Inspector Leonard Bradfield."
We need to know where Clifford and David are.
I ain't seen 'em.
There's no-one here.
Right.
I'm sick of this.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
- Who told you about John?
- What?
It was on the wireless.
"We haven't released that information yet, so who told you John didn't get away?"
Nobody.
A Bentley till the bitter end?
Deal with her.
Men without bikes.
"Oh, boy."
"Waltzer, Waltzer, look, don't worry."
"Your cut's waiting for you, that's right."
Relax.
Relax.
"Look, I tell you what..."
-Ow!
-Right.
"Look, if you don't get all of your dough, feel free to kill me."
"What do I look like, huh?"
A Laundromat?
A slot machine?
'Cause I am not a slot machine.
You are a slot machine.
"Step right up here, folks, there's a winner every minute."
Sorry.
"Oh, what, l-I hurt your feelings?"
No.
"No, and you want to know why?"
'Cause you don't got no feelings.
"Yes, I do."
"I'm a person, and I have feelings."
"Oh, ho, you're a person now."
"Hey, she's not a person, is she, Betty?"
"Yeah, she sort of is."
Nobody's talking to you.
"You know what the test is, baby?"
"If you were a person, you could do whatever you want..."
Ow.
"and you can't, 'cause you do whatever I tell you to do, isn't that right, Betty?"
Y eah.
"And we don't want it opened up again, do we, Basil?"
"No, you don't, dear."
No.
"The great warning-off of May 8th, yes."
"Good old Saint George, eh, Major?"

She want speak to you.
Is problem.
"Ever see my wife making toast, Polly?"
"Why... why'd he kill it anyway, Fawlty?"
"I don't know, Major."
Better than marrying it.
Marrying it?
"But he didn't have to kill it, though, did he?"
"I mean, he could've, uh, just not turned up at the church."
"Good morning, Madam."
Can I help you?
- Are you the manager?
"- I am the owner, Madam."

I want to speak to the manager.

It may have gone down to the bank.
I've got to have it back.
Why?
It's just as good a check as Mrs. Ryan's.

"Hey, Animal."
Animal.
I've been crazy about you for years.

"I'd just sit there, watching you."

No.
No-one has a right to know anything till I know who killed Mr Newcastle.
"We work for the dead, not the living."
Off you go.
Are you sure she can manage it?
She's never done it before.
Only one way to learn.
Are you ready?
"Is this your husband, Mrs Parker?"
"I-I-I mean, yes."
"It's Scott all right, but... just the shell of what he was."
What he used to be.
"(I'm sorry, Scottie.)"
~ All right.
~ Where did you find him?
"I, er..."
I don't have any details.
How did... he do it?
Do what?
Kill himself.
I'm afraid I don't know anything about his death.
"Don't know much for a copper, do you?"
Are you the tea lady?
When did you last see Scott?
Night before last.
Me birthday party.
Happy birthday.

What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
Alright.
Alright.
Stop.
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff.
He got chucked off a couple of months ago.
- Why?
- I don't know.
"It's OK, I've got my badges."
Why?
"Look, all's I know is that..."
is that there was a girl between them.
Some stripper who worked in Soho.
Freddie Lau stole her from Grey and Grey went mental.

Ya got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over.
A dinglehopper.
- What about that one?
- Ah!
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!

A second verse.
"""Among the pines you flow."""
Pine Street.
It matches.
Broke the lock and put a new one on.
"Yeah, and the kicker is, it looks like he broke it from the inside."
"He broke out, not in?"
This is where he came back.
"Well, let's find out."
Looks like somebody was painting.
There's paint over here too.
"Doc, give me a hand with this."
Okay.
You're right.
Eveyone used to call her her as Meena with love
Did you call her that too?
- No.
In college I was a shyster.
I was scared to talk to girls.
But this girl was vey...
"An_ay, forget it."
What use digging up the past?
Exactly.
No use.
Was she beautiful?
"Yes, she was nice."
Roundish face.
Large eyes.
Long tresses.
"Now that you mention her, I think she was quite exotic."
And so you fell for her?
"- Who, me?"
Forget it.
At the beginning I never used to look at her.
"But one day something strange happened, and..."
Forget it.
Why dig up the past?
- Right.
No use.
So you were saying...
what happened that day?
"What day... yes, that day ...it so happened..."
"ARer college, I find only Meenakshi standing at the bus-stop."
I didn't mind her.
Like me she must've come to catch a bus.
There was a silence.
- So let's try the other.
- That's where it has to be.
- Are you getting tired?
- No.
- All right.
[Rachel] I'm gonna start to scream soon.
I'm gonna go out and throw myself under a car.
That's the only thing I can do.
He was waiting for the doctor's call when I left.
What kind of a mother am I?
What kind of a mother am I?
I don't know where he is.
He might even be in a hospital.
I don't know.
I'm gonna start to scream at the top of my voice.
I don't care if they put me in jail.
I have to find my Freddy!
I want my Freddy!
Fred Baker.
My only child.
I'm gonna break everything.
I
- If I can't find him...
I will break everything here.
Everything.
"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?
Where are you?
"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?
[Ida] It was hanging up from the ceiling.
"He must be one of those there, on the wall."
Oh.
"So, who's first?"
Uh...
[Chuckles]
Um... tell you what.
"Uh, why don't you let me tie you up first?"
Then how am I gonna be able to do all the terrible things that I've got planned for you?
"[Laughs] Oh, I'm sure you'll figure something out."
"[Chuckling] Isn't that right, Kendall?"
Kendall...
Kendall?
Damn it.
She's gonna miss all the fun.
[Grunts]
You've been had.
That dirty little...
[Chuckles]
I'm getting tired of chasing you.
"Well, there's no rule against taking a short break."
[Laughs]
[Alarm blaring]
What the hell?
"Hey, where's your friend?"
Huh?
Castle:
Thought we had a deal.
No more double-crosses.
"Sorry, Ricky, but I am going to be the one to take those trophies in."
Castle:
"Well, good luck with that, because I'm looking for a murder weapon."
"It's a unique blade, but I guess you wouldn't know that."
- You're lying.
You'll call her first thing?
Thanks.
Bye.
- Walter can't represent me on this.
- Why not?
Because it's criminal.
I don't understand why they want to talk to you.
"I told you, I don't know why."
"- Rick, I'm not the enemy."
- l'm sorry.
It's just I don't know what's happening and I suspect that Karen does.
- Karen is behind this?
- She wouldn't tell me.
Maybe she wasn't allowed to.
Miles?
"It's Rick, again."
"Uh, call me as soon as you get this."
It doesn't matter what time.
"Rick, it's okay."
"Rick, come here."
Please?
I know this is going to be okay.
I know who you are.
I know how you conduct yourself.
"Whatever these people may have done, it doesn't concern you."
"Hello, Rick?"
Hi.
Stephanie Arlyn.
I'm sorry.
We were wrapping up a deposition.
That's okay.
"- This is my associate, James Davis."
Here!
Maybe it's a black hole.
Stop it.
It keeps you in school.
Came out of nowhere.
Swallows everything in its path.
For something that does not exist is quite impressive!
It's beautiful!
"Uncle, Ramon?"
"Children, take me home."
So this is all we are.
Food.
And we think that a lifetime without knowing the truth.
Criel Goodbye world!
Erik.
Boadicea.
Aticcus.
Ramon.
You see!
It is the main event of the females.
I'm about being thrown to the ground and crushed for thousands of Ticas.
"Rejoice Ticas, the emperor has returned!"
Ignored by thousands.
The emperor returned!
I have so much love overflows.
"-Ramon, live!"
How long!
I thought I had not left.
Ramon has twins?
There are only three.
"Children, friends."
"Friends, children."
Damn it!
Goddamned it!
I don't want to!
"I don't want to die, Helene."
Why?
"Praise be to God, our Lord Jesus Christ   who by his great mercy has granted us hope   in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
Jorgen Lennart Hansson   we commit your body to the ground.
Ashes to ashes   dust to dust.
And to dust thou shalt return.
"Good-bye, Dad."
- Mr. Jacob!
- Pramod!
"Pramod, come here."
I missed you.
"Oh, I missed you."
- Have you been fine?
"- Yes, everything is very good."
What is this?
You're so tall.
Let me have a look at you.
Let me see.
"Oh no, Pramod."
You're taller than me.
What is this?
And you got new goals and everything.
- Are you happy with that?
- Yes.
- Did you miss me?
- Much.
I want to ask you about something.
"You don't have to answer right away, because I'm staying all week."
"How would you like to come and live with me, in Denmark?"
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed on the left-hand side.
"No, no."
"No, no."
Go get someone else.
Don't bother the father.
Go to your bed.
Go to your bed.
"No, no."
"No, no."
The father will be back to see you.
It's all right.
Mama.
"It's Dimmy, Mama."
Dimmy.
"Why you did this to me, Dimmy?"
Why?
"Come on, I'm gonna take you out of here, Mama."
I'm gonna take you home.
"I'll get you out of here tonight, Mama."
"Mama, everything's gonna be all right."
"Mama, I'm gonna take you home."
"Mama, I'm gonna take you home."
-Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
-Like what?
Private hospital?
"Who got the money for that, Dimmy?"
You?
There seems to be an alien pubic hair in my drink.
-I beg your pardon?
-Never seen it before in my life.
Have you?
We're pretty comfortable up there compared to the Gemini and Mercury programs.
- And you mention there wasn't an excuse for it?
-Jaelen!
-Please stop it.
Stop it!
-I don't know any of it.
Just please...
-Where is he?
Where?
- I'm special agent John Walker here on government business.
May I borrow a pen and a piece of paper?
-Sure.
-Thank you.
The gentleman in room 15 is under my protective custody.
There are people looking for him.
"If anyone should come inquiring, I'd appreciate if you'd give me a call."
"It's a mater of national security, you see?"
-Okay.
-Thank you.
Are you feeling better?
You gonna tell me what happened?
-Not now.
-Okay.
-What time is it?
-It's... uh... half past three.
- We need to go.
- Where?
- We're meeting someone.
- Who?
-A friend.
- You mentioned that there were six of you.
Where are the others?
-Gone.
How's she doing?
We couldn't revive her.
She's...
"I know she looked bad, but you guys usually..."
Stephanie's injuries were overwhelming.
We did everything we could.
"He'll be OK, it's, um, just rough."
I'm sorry.
"- OK, Doc, time's up."
- Stay away from me.
"- Come on, get up."
- I'm not finished treating.
... She died!
An officer's dead and we need to interview.
"Just back up, right now."
Throw some bandages on him.
This piece of crap needs to get charged!
Come on!
"Come on, get up!"
"Come on, get up!"
"OK, OK!"
We gotta get him to division before his lawyer gets here.
"- OK, calm down."
- I am calm!
"Call the divisional detective, tell her what happened"
"- so she can call homicide, OK?"
- What about Pike?
Dr. Connor isn't going to let him walk out of here.
"- Are you, Dr. Connor?"
"- No, I'm not."
Stephanie was 34 years old.
What a waste.
"- He's like this genius, super secretive."
- Okay.
"And apparently, they're working on this new project."
Big money involved.
Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.
"Well, maybe if I play my cards right I can get you an exclusive with Shou."
Hmm?
Fo Shou?
Yeah?
You should take a photo.
"Seriously, if you get a photo of anything that they're working on, that's a fuckload more money than four pound signs."
Cool.
"Well, where is this place?"
Mr. Copper.
"Oh, hi."
Um...
Just Cooper.
"Mr. Cooper, I apologize."
Just Cooper is fine.
"Then, in that case, I'm just Katie."
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Follow me.
"- Oh, yeah."
- I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.
"Oh, Rav will take care of that."
"Okay, great."
That's good.
I don't wanna carry it anyway.
Rav kind of reminds me of like an end-of-level boss.
Here lessor company was here for 6 years.
Computer cleaned.
There is nothing here.
- John?
Did you hear what I say?
- Yes.
TS ...
"Good job, make the brother."
"- Hey, you."
Should not be in bed.
- I could not sleep.
- Do Yorulmadın?
"- No, just can not sleep."
"OK, so how can you explain a story?"
How is this?
- Up the stairs.
"- Up the stairs, okay."
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
"A long, long time ago ..."
Very distant land ...
But so far ...
There is a little angel sleeping there ...
"I have done for yourself, John."
"Not for me, not for our daughter."
Have you done for yourself.
"Do not lie to yourself, even for a moment."
"- Hi, John."
"- Hey, Rache."
Ah ...
I made lasagna last night.
"Many, many more remained in my hand."
"If you open up, can I bring some of that."
What am I gonna do with you?
You need to warn His Holiness.
Casey!
Henry?
"Sweetie, what is it?"
"Angela, is there something you need to tell me?"
I'm sorry.
I've been very selfish lately.
"I haven't really let you in, have I?"
"Henry, if you won't talk to me, if you won't tell me what's troubling you, how am I supposed...?"
You need to confess.

Hello?
St. Anthony.
He was the patron saint of...
Uh...
lost things.
I thought that was St. Jude.
"No, St. Jude is lost causes."
So how can you tell when something stops being lost and starts being a lost cause?
We're going to find Casey.
People don't just disappear.
Well...
"That's the problem, isn't it?"
She was disappearing... before she was ever lost.
Henry's illness...
"I'm trying, Anna."
"Do something about it, Harry."
For all of us.
WOMAN:
Mr and Mrs Clayton?
OK?
WOMAN:
Mr Clayton?
There's someone to see you.
I'm sorry about your daughter.
Is she OK?
Yes.
How did you know?
How long have you been following me?
Awhile.
I haven't got much time to explain.
- It's not safe for me here.
- What?
- Or you.
- What are you talking about?
"I was meant to give it to someone else, and he knows you have it, Harry."
- You're talking about the bracelet?
"- I know you're a good man, which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you."
- Who'll come after me?
- The man it was promised to.
What is this?
Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck.
"- Well, that's shite."
- (WOMAN LAUGHS)
"You're already starting to feel it, though, aren't you?"
No.
"Wait, wait, wait."
"As far as I'm concerned, they're all dangerous jokes."
Do me a favor and don't write them off just yet.
I said they were dangerous.
Wonder what Vinnie's doing in a place like this?
Wonder what we're doing in a place like this.
-This is it.
-Where's our boy?
-l don't know.
-Think Vinnie had a change of heart?
"If he's a Zapatti, he has no heart."
-Let's go.
-Don't turn around.
"Marybeth, right?"
Who's this?
The deputy mayor.
Deputy mayor?
What do I need you for then?
Don't get smart.
I'm the only chance you got.
All right.
Let's go.
This a Searider?
"What, you know boats?"
I worked on a Shrimper like this.
This ain't no Searider.
It's a piece of shit.
They call it a Surfrider.
"I wanted a Searider, but my uncle wouldn't pop for it."
Your uncle like boats?
Who?
Paulie?
Paulie wouldn't know a cleaver from a fucking cleat.
Cut it out!
"What are you, his mom?"
Have a good weekend.
I brought you a CD forthe trip.
- Where's Mattia?
- He's been firing for an hour.
See you Monday.
- They're very different from us.
- That's for sure.
You can't understand them.
Chicco's sleeping!
- It's like being in Africa.
- Were you threatened?
- I'd rathernot say.
- What happened?
You have to tell me everything.
"If you show them you've got balls, they run."
"Don't be yourusuaI dare-deviI self,"
I don't want to be the widow of a hero.
And they eat anything at any time.
They drink gallons of coffee and make you drink too.
"You can't, you'II have a stroke, you can refuse."
"No, you can't."
If you refuse...
Darling!
"Daddy, don't go."
And don't be a hero!
In 300 meters turn left and take the SaIerno-Reggio CaIabria.
Fuck tha-t!
Overhere!
Come join us?
"No, thank you, an old injury..."
...96 64 09.
"No, 9."
Fuck.

- Hello?
"- Marco, is that you?"
"- Yes, Benigno."
- It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinic.
Dr.Vega told me everything.
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey, man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll try to find out.
You've got it.
Oh.
Goddamn right I have it!
Here!
"We're leaving, and we will never drink your overpriced ""Runaway Root Beers"" again."
But here's a nice tip because you gave us very good service.
Where did that money come from?
- Just be glad I had it.
- Thank you.
It's okay.
We're a team.
What the hell are we gonna do?
I know one thing.
We're gonna put on a brave face.
It's best that the kids don't know how bad things are right now.
We... are... fucked.
"Ooh, it's colder in here than it is outside."
"Okay, Kevin, I'm coming in now!"
I'm not doing anything!
One new message.
"Frank, it's Bob Pogo."
We used to work together at Mohican...
Airways.
It's an airline... down at the airport.
"Aw, shit, you know who I am!"
Here's the thing...
- Is somebody there?
"- Jesus, Dolores, hang up the extension!"
You don't have to bite my head off.
"I'm sorry, dear."
Don't cry.
"- So, Frank..."
- It's nothing.
- It didn't look like nothing.
Matty tells me you broke his heart.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb underneath the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"27 vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
"- Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
Are you hungry?
Do you want a little?
No.
"Thank you, Miss Givens."
Why don't you lay down for a while and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Givens?"
"Of course, I am."
I'm fine.

"I put my name in for seven songs, so I'll be back up here again."
"- Uh, yes."
- Wow.
- Instant classic.
- Wow.
- That was really scary.
"- Yeah, yeah."
I was very scared there for a minute.
"Honestly, you're like a crazy person."
"Okay, I'm not crazy."
"It's just been a crazy week, Anders."
Okay?
Okay.
Brent Hoffman died.
Who's Brent Hoffman?
He was my favorite cat.
"You... you had to put him down, huh?"
"Uh, no, no."
He was eaten by two of my other cats.
Really hard to watch.
"Hey, I really appreciate you guys coming to one of my sing-alongs finally."
- Yeah.
- It's fun.
"And as a ""thank you,"""
I've got some extra tickets to the Rihanna concert this weekend.
Do you guys wanna go?
- Yeah.
- That sounds fun.
"Who is that, though?"
"Yeah, I'm excited, though."
"What do you mean, ""who is that""?"
"she's light-skinned, with the butt."
- Really?
Wow!
I didn't know that.
All right then.
"Okay, let's celebrate."
"Yeah, because the new number i have in mind is about half a mil."

"Come here, Russ."
- I rather not.
"- Russ, come sit down."
"- No, no."
"- Russ, sit the fuck down!"
Okay.
"Unfortunately, Russell, we have a new wrinkle in the situation."
"Oh, really?"
What's the wrinkle?
Basically I had to play pinata with Jerry the bookie's skull.
- That ups the invoice a little.
- Is he okay?
"- No, he's dead."
- Oh!
"Oh, God."
"You know, okay."
I'm really uncomfortable with this kind of conversation.
"You know, not to mention,"
I broke my 1986 World Series commemorative bat.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- It was a gift from my mother.
"She's gettin' a little old, and she's not feeling good these days."
- Hasn't left the house in 6 weeks.
"- Okay, just give me -"

"All right, Tom."
"Step out of the truck for me, please."
Sure.
"- Open up the back for me, please."
- Sure.
All right.

We're SEALs.
We're supposed to know how to use a firearm.
If you had taught him how to load that thing... there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge.
The guy nearly blew my foot off.
It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun.
"No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these contras."
- We talked for an hour.
- Oh.
Oh.
Ah!
You've no memory of this.
- He was really drunk.
- Oh God.
I'm such an idiot.
I'm an idiot.
- Meredith was right about you
- No.
"- About me, about the whole thing."
- No.
Meredith was not right.
"It doesn't matter that I don't remember the specifics of what I said, because I was drunk when I said them and, you know..."
- In Vino Veritas.
- In Vino Veritas
"I mean, we know Vino Veritas is Latin for a reason."
It's just that you said some really beautiful things.
- You did.
- That's when I cried.
"I meant those things that I said, every word."
"Yeah, ok."
"Alright, we should get going."
You need to get your stuff.
It's like an hour to Sudbury or something.
You're gonna drive us?
- You asked me to.
- You asked her to.
Right.
Right.
"Hey, can we stop at a mall or something?"
I brought you the best seafood.
It was the Mano-there he is.
Hi.
He asked me.
-It is my language.
I'm sorry.
If direction is not the feeling satisfied.
Can I get more.
"No Sven, I bet you have others more hungry than me."
I understand.
See you at dinner?
I'm kinda busy.
Kinda busy.
Even more!
She is beautiful.
"Honey, are you okay?"
Are you sure he no relation to Ramon?
You Ingracia!
"Should not scoff at someone, just because it's different."
Even someone who is having more a lot of work to save us.
-You are right.
When Sven- teach them all to fly.
It will be a rising up.
"-Erik, not ..."
-Get out of here.
-You will see.
Who dropped the fish?
"Guys, what's happening with the fish?"
Fish friends what's the problem?
The birds eat.
"Sven, you must fly on the wings of hope and ask them to help brothers emperors."
I'd love to know but ...
You're a...
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
"You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity."

"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, good riddance, ya loony!"

"-Hey, gas dude!"
-You talkin' to me?
"-Yeah, man."
Can you help me?
-Pizza Planet?
Andy!
Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
"Oh, no!"
I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
-Buzz!
"Buzz, come back!"
-Go away!
No!
"Buzz, you gotta come back!"
I...
I found a spaceship!
"It's a spaceship, Buzz!"
"Come on, man, hurry up!"
"Like, the pizzas are getting cold here!"
"-Cutting Boulevard, huh?"
"-Yeah, yeah."
Which way?
"Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?"
"And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home."
"- No, I want to help you."
"Mr MacGregor, if I mentioned the name Dennis, and that I know that you're being ""B""-ed..."
"- ""B""-ed?"
"- Well, blackmailed."
"- Look, may I come in?"
- Wee Sonny MacGregor blackmailed?
- I think you're mistaken.
- You're wondering why I'm here.
"I know why you're here, friend."
"You're being ""B""-ed, too."
"- No, I'm a complete outsider."
- I wouldn't say that.
"Please, let me explain."
A young lady came to see me...
You're a lucky fellow.
"Good luck to you, sir, and good day."
- Mr MacGregor?
- Go away.
You'll regret this.
- How did he find out?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you let him talk?
He obviously wanted an ally.
The more friends we have now...
Make an ally of that idiot?
"No, thank you."
I'll rely on my bomb.
And now... for the gunpowder.

And it was on early.
How early?
Mike?
"wakey, wakey."
"But then, everything changed."
Hey.
Hey.
See my show?
"Oh, I meant to watch it."
"I just got so busy with the whole ""being sound asleep"" thing."
"It took all night, eight hours down the drain."
"Oh, it's fine."
But get this:
After the broadcast...
Hi.
Are you Robin?
Yeah.
"I'm Don, your new co-host."
"Don was Don Frank, seasoned veteran of no fewer than 39 local morning news teams from all over the country."
But that leaves us one short to Mick Jagger's.

"But, I wonder if Saho can knows this place."
Ah.
Maybe the fog isn't a good thing if you are waiting to meet someone.
Nice to meet you all.
My name is Katsuragi Saho.
She's really pretty.
I met Saho-san at her high school's culture festival.
Fumi-chan came to see us about how my club uses tarot cards.
Yeah!
She is like my teacher!
Saho-san knows so much!
I even learned how to use tarot cards!
Look!
I have my cards!
Does anyone want me to tell the future?

There's only one way to find out.
- What the hell am I doing here?
- Look at it as a field trip!
(Travis):
"Look, I've cooperated with you clowns."
"If you think I know anything else,"
- you're wasting your time!
- Pa?
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
"- I've just had enough of you, you lowlife piece of..."
Ah!
(Fen grunting)
(screaming and grunting)
Get off!
Get off!
(Travis):
My property and lay off!
(man):
"You can't do that, she's a human!"
- (Fen grunting)
- Don't lay your hands on her!
(stabbing sound)
(man screaming)
Come on!
Get off!
Get off!
Shh!
Shh!
- Shhh!
It's alright.
Shh-shh!
"- Are you alright, sir?"
She died when Dirk was 13.
Cancer.
"I was working three jobs, so it fell to Dirk to take care of her."
And he was a great kid.
He made sure Jane got her medicine.
"He helped her, cleaned up after her."
"But, you know, you watch somebody die, slow."
Waste away to nothing.
It does things to a person.
Horrible things.
I didn't know about his mother.
He-
- He wouldn't talk about her not even to me.
Lot of anger in that boy.
I'm sorry.
"We'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. MacGregor."
"Um, do you mind telling us where Dirk is buried?"
"Oh, he wasn't."
I had him cremated.
All of him?
"Well, I kept a lock of his hair."
"Oh, that's-"
- That's nice.
Where do you keep that?
"On my bus, in my Bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you wanna ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.
[TIRES BURST]
What the hell was that?
[TIRES SQUEAL]
"Finally, a letter from Naples!"
"Vito, how do you like my little angel?"
Isn't she beautiful?
She's very beautiful.
"To you, she's beautiful."
"For me, there's only my wife and son."
Our dear mother - ...is dead!
We'll go backstage later and take her to eat.
"Sit down, you bum!"
"Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci."
We'll go see her backstage.
Who was that?
The Black Hand.
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Tomorrow!
Always tomorrow!
You'll pay me today!
Let's go.
Not my daughter!
Let her go!
"Here, take all my money!"
"Vito, come on."
I know what you're thinking.
But you don't know how things are.
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.
"Even my father, in the grocery store."
If he's Italian why does he bother other Italians?
He knows they have nobody to protect them.
Forget that.
Did you like my angel?
"And tell Mrs. Manicotti that I'll stop up there later, okay?"
All right.
Should I take the rest of the dog food along?
No.
I won't have to feed him till tomorrow morning
-when I get him back.
"-Oh, I see."
Okay.
"- Don't drop him now, Trix."
"-No, I won't."
"- Oh, he's a good fella."
Bye.
-Thank you.
"- I'll see you later, Alice."
"-All right, bye-bye."
(clears throat)
"Hiya, sweetheart."
"Hiya, Ralph."
I'll have your supper ready for you in a minute.
"Oh, don't go to any trouble."
I'm not gonna eat here.
I'll eat over at the lodge.
I got just enough time to wash up and get over there.
We got another emergency meeting.
Again?
!
"Ralph, you had an emergency meeting last night."
-So?
-So?
Do you realize you Racoons have more emergency meetings than the U.N.?
Just so happens that the Racoons have more emergencies than the U.N.
(Alice sighs)
Mmm.
It's almost as if Trina has become our very own Lady Di.
"Oh, and I corrected your spelling mistakes."
Thanks.
"Shall we dance, my dear?"
We shall.
Are they?
They live together.
Didn't you know?
No.
Mm-hm.
Wow!
"Wow, indeed."

(MUSIC HEARD FROM INSIDE)
"Well, I have to say, as far as wakes go, this one was pretty good."
Mum's was better.
"Well, Mum's didn't have nearly as much dancing."
But it did have uncle Terry standing on the balcony shouting at the neighbours like there was no God.
"My brother, the life and soul of every wake."
Wait!
You forgot me!
We thought you were...
Going home... ..where you belong.
No way.
"I mean, Dad's OK today, but tomorrow he'll be bad again."
Which one?
"No, no, no, no."
You were in your best suit.
Was I?
"Oh, yes, of course!"
"I went to the theater, of course!"
"- No, no..."
"- Yes, yes, with Winnie Atwell, yes."
Winnie Atwell?
"Well, Marjorie Atwell then, Marjorie."
I always call her Winnie because...
"well, because she looks like Winnie."
She's not black.
Black?
Churchill wasn't black.
"Look, look, look,"
I gave you £75.
You put it in there.
What do you mean by telling me you called the police?
You've done no such thing.
Your wife's just told me you're still searching the rooms.
"Well, I thought she'd called them."
You lying hound!
- Mrs. Richards...
"- Go and call them now, immediately."
"Mrs. Richards, we will, the moment we've searched..."
Right.
I shall call them myself then.
Couldn't we just wait until...
I've never seen such a place!
"All right, Mrs. Richards."
Would you like to use the office phone?
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?
Joking.
I...
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
"Oh, yes."
- Mayhew.
Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.
My real name is McGill.
The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys.
"They all want a pipe-hitting member of the tribe, so to speak."
I digress.
Good things are happening.
"Fact is, your nephew is gonna get out in no time."
"That's wonderful, yeah."
"There's still a few details to be ironed out but now that the DEA is involved I think he's looking at time served, then probation."
Where are you going this late?
To the West.
"- What, on foot in the Zone?"
- Can I see your papers?
"Well, did you have a nice New Year's?"
Your name?
"Well, what's your name, Miss?"
Karka!
Pauline Karka.
But it is... bloody.
What do you have there?
My child.
May I see it?
"Now come inside and get warm, young lady."
The Rats
- Based on the play by:
Adapted for the screen by:
- What's it about?
- Go to the police!
"Room 12, the police inspector said."
"For that you drag my child out in the freezing cold, risking it dying?"
"- Well, whatever, Mrs John."
- Don't shout at my daughter like that!
"What has happened, Miss Pauline?"
"The inspector didn't say, Mr Hassenreuter,"
- only that they are to id..idi..
Pauline...
- Identify...
"- ...her, yes."
- Pauline?
I've never heard that name.
- What am I to do there?
You like doing that.
"Yours, Corporal Dawes."
"You, Evans."
Gordon.
"Come on, Stubbins."
Each man check his release box.
Easy now.
Nothing worse than blokes hitting their boxes at the same time.
It sounds like the Salvation Army on a Sunday afternoon.
"You've nothing to worry about, they're smashing parachutes."
They ought to be at £60 a piece.
"Morning, Bill."
Morning.
"All right, you gentleman aloft."
We're ready.
We are ready.
He's ready.
So are we.
"Gentleman, I don't like your colour."
You look a little green.
What colour would you like?
Suppose you surprise me.
"0K, Number 0ne, a good parachuting position."
Action station Number One.
Jump when I touch you on the shoulder.
Are you ready?
Go!
There goes my first one.
Reach up high on your front left webs.
Pull down steadily now.
"Your head well forward, feet together."
"OK, hold it."
The Boss is being over-enthusiastic... but I'm going to use my brains.
By playing the right card at the right moment.
Daddy.
By the time he plays his cards...
Shiv and Ankita will already have their honeymoon.
I'm moron.
Hold on.
Jabbar bhai.
Dad call Jabbar bhai right now.
On the spot finish his entire family right now.
- Father's here.
- So what?
- Father's here.
- Shiv?
I told you we'll be visiting the saint's tomb one day.
And return to Benaras after that.
We'll visit the shrine today.
It's a good day today.
I'm pleased that you've been released.
And even happier... that you didn't need that goon's help for it.
Brother...
Brother come in.
No actually I couldn't do the job.
So I'm here to return Mr. Satyakant's money.
Brother come... come in.
- I'll leave.
- Please.
Please.
Brother come...
I'm going to the shrine.
Are you coming?
Yes father.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
We're gonna crown us a new champion!
"Checkered flag, here I come!"
No!
McQueen's blown a tire!
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?
You fool!
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!
"Go, go, go!"
He's lost another tire!
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!
Come on.
"I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!"
Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
The King and Chick rounding turn four.
Down the stretch they come!
"And it's, and it's..."
- It's too close to call!
Too close!
- I don't believe it!
Lightning!
"- The most spectacular, amazing..."
- I don't believe it!
"...unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world!"
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?
"Hey, no cameras!"
- I don't know.
- Grunge band out of Kentucky.
Two albums plus a double 'A' side single.
Disbanded in '94.
Thanks.
- My God.
- What?
- Look.
- The Go-Go's.
- You must have that one.
- No.
For my mom.
This was her favorite group when she was my age.
It's signed by Belinda.
This would be the perfect graduation present.
"I've been looking all week long, and I couldn't find anything."
- Now I have Belinda.
- Graduation?
From college.
From business classes.
I'm surprised she has time for anything... except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture.
"It's not a lot of time, but..."
- Go on.
Get it.
She'll like it.
- Thank you so much for bringing me here.
- This was fate.
- I think it was.
"And in return, I just might show you my withering stare."
I'm a lucky man.
- I think this one's mine.
- Yep.
"In the Paratroopers, I mean."
I don't know.
I guess I wanted to get knocked off or something.
But as soon as I got away from my mother... I suddenly realized how wonderful life really was!
And then I fought like a tiger to stay alive!
I was running away from problems.
You know what I mean.
"Yeah, I know."
"Something's bothering you, isn't it?"
Yeah...
Can I help?
"No, you can't."
Better not to talk about it.
All right.
"-Hey, have you had dinner?"
-No.
-Would you like dinner with me?
-Okay!
All right.
Doc Swain?
"Evening, Selena."
I'll be right with you.
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.
"Ah, watch your feet."
Are you going to tell them about me?
"-I'll have to, Selena."
-Nobody in town must ever know.
"But, if I don't, you'll be risking your life."
-I know that.
"-Well, then, why?"
-Because of Ted.
Could you please tell John that I called?
Hi there...
Your mom or dad home?
Yes.
Mom!
What?
"- Sorry to bother you, Ma'am."
What's this about...?
I'm afraid there's been an incident with one of your neighbors here in the complex...
"So we're just going around, talking to people..."
see if anyone knows anything...
What kind of incident?
"Owen, why don't you go to your room...?"
"- Sorry, guys!"
- you wonder?
- what?
why do you need glasses?
so dangerous?
- Hey!
Stop!
- How's the cripple...!
?
Stop!
Hey!
"Jesus Christ, dude..."
look out...!
"Man, that kid wailed on your ass Can you still hear me, bro ?"
!
Stop!
- You going home?
"-No, we're going over to Mark's..."
Well can I borrow your keys...?
To have my picture in the papers...
Be the first in Rome...
"Damn it, Malaparte, take me to Capri."
You're laughing at me!
"I can't believe it, you're laughing at me!"
"No, no, I'm laughing at myself."
It's incredible.
"The destruction, hunger, violence..."
All that for a photo in the papers.
You ignorant son of a bitch!
"I hate your attitude, you latin snob!"
Know-it-all!
All of you!
Back!
Pervert!
Pig!
Dirty gigolos!
"Imbecile, imbecile!"
And you're laughing at me?
"You can stick your flag right between your legs, in your ass!"
One catastrophe after another.
"Get out, get out!"
It's unbelievable!
What a disgrace.
"Listen, if you take me to the airport, I'll pay."
Stop!
Stop!
I'll give you US$50 to take me to the airport.
Get in.
What's happening?
What's this?
The Vesuvius.
I'm sorry.
l-l don't even like Nikki.
I was trippin' off Kenny.
"You can't help who you love, Derek."
You're not supposed to.
"When you love somebody, you love them."
Look at me.
At least you found somebody who loves you back.
I gotta go.
Where you going ?
"Stay out of my business, Chenille."
I know what Malakai wants you to do.
"Why are you trippin' off him, Derek ?"
All you're trying to do is get the hell up out of here.
Ain't no shame or blame in that.
It's getting cold out here.
Take that baby inside.
Hey.
Hey.
"Kai, I've been trying to catch up with you."
I gotta talk to you.
- Ready to roll ?
- l gotta talk to you.
- Wassup ?
"- Look, man. I ain't going with you."
What you mean you're not going ?
-You know what I mean.
-Did you come here to waste my time?
"This shit is nonsense, Kai."
It's dangerous nonsense.
"Just back up off it, man."
Come on.
What the hell are you thinking?
"It's war, Jomar."
We can get rid of the heavy water once and for all.
- We don't have a choice!
- I don't believe that.
What do we really know about the Germans?
Do we know how far they have come?
I will try to find out.
Do that!
"- Lise, are you looking forward to the concert?"
- Yes.
To hear Beethoven?
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Concert on Saturday.
- Thank you!
There's a concert on Saturday.
Here you go.
Good afternoon.
Ellen Henriksen.
I'm arranging the concert.
- Arvid Fladmoe.
- Kristoffer Kleive.
I hope you had a nice trip.
"8 kg in the hull, close to the engines."
Approximately 45 minutes after departure.
Friday is the worst day.
The ferry is always completely full on that day.
Did you hear what I said?
I'm not the one making the decisions.
Excuse me...
"Yes, what is it?"
"When your real pa died, you and Selena and Joey had to have a father."
Lucas tries hard to be a good man.
"- Goodbye, Ma."
- Paul.
"Selena, don't you ask me to stay."
My babysitting money.
I wish there was more.
Paul.
"Paul, I'll do extra work."
I'll find a job and get the money back.
Don't leave.
I'm sorry we got into a fight.
It won't happen again.
I give you my word.
"Paul, Paul!"
He'll come back.
"You wait and see, he'll come back."
Nellie I'm going to try hard not to drink anymore.
Selena I'm gonna try harder than I ever tried anything.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
"May I have fried eggs and a cup of coffee, please?"
- All right.
- Do you have a washroom where I can clean up?
- First door.
"Oh, yeah."
Thank you.
- What you selling?
- Nothing.
"Sorry, I thought you might be a traveling man."
"No, I came here to get a job."
I should have known.
He was killed with a knife shaped exactly like that one.
Hey!
Drop it!
Help me!
"- Let her go, Jordan."
- Stand back!
You got no where to go.
Drop the scissors.
"Listen, fellas, I'm a writer, so trust me when I say if the villain surrenders, oh, it's just so unsatisfying!"
That's why they always go out in style.
"Just relax, Jordan."
Don't do anything stupid.
Stupid?
Me?
How can you say that when we've outsmarted you for years?
"Who's ""we""?"
Who's your partner in L.A.?
A genius.
He believed in me.
"Took my visions, made them real."
"Give us a name, Jordan."
You'll never find him.
Ah!
[Gunshots fire]
[Sobbing]
Okay.
"No, I understand."
Thank you.
Hey. [Door closes]
That was Ryan and Esposito.
They had to kill Jordan Keegan.
But they sent us digital copies of Jordan's computer.
Look around you...
"new fallen snow, you're with your family."
I just know this is going to be a great day.
Sue?
Sue Murphy?
"Oh, fuck me!"
"Hi, Ginny!"
"Oh, hi, Frank."
"How's the job hunt going, you poor thing?"
Any nibbles?
I should've died in Korea.
"Go play with Maureen, that's fun!"
Sorry about Frank.
He hasn't been himself lately.
That's all right.
Failure can break down even the strongest man.
How are you?
"Must have been a difficult Christmas after, you know,"
Greg abandoned you and the kids.
"Oh, no, we're back together!"
Greg took a Catholic cruise with Father Pat and came back a different man.
We're going at it like newlyweds!
"Well, that's a dirty mouth."
"Mister, I'm gonna shut you up."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, hi, stud!"
"Dear Lord, give me strength."
"Vagina, vagina, vagina!"
"Hey, baby!"
Looking attractive!
"Christ, I hate it here."
Bunch of kids.
"Hi there, Billy, how ya doing?"
Glad to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
"Oh, here."
"I'll take it, it's my mom's."
Okay.
"Well, uh, how was your trip?"
Fine.
"Uh, did ya sit by the window?"
Yeah.
"Billy, tell Mike what you saw."
"I don't know, a bunch of clouds."
"Billy, come on, you saw the Grand Canyon."
"Hey, hey, you saw the Grand Canyon?"
"We're going to see the Grand Canyon from the ground, up close."
"Really, it's one of the most spectacular sights in the whole world."
So is Central Park.
Are we going to spend our whole vacation here?
"No, I'm with you, come on."
Wait 'til you see the trip I got planned for us.
- You're going to love it.
- I hope so.
"Listen to me, I'm telling you this city has grown a whole lot since you've left here."
"- I can tell, it's amazing."
"- Oh, yeah."
"I sell some lots, you know."
I sold some parcels out here.
I've contributed to its growth.
- Really?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Big, big lots?"
"- Oh, yeah, oh, huge."
Good luck with that.
Yeah I know.
Well it's not that big a deal.
It's not like Hannah Montana hasn't complicated your life before.
Yeah.
And I dealt with it then and I'll deal with it now.
-Hey there you are.
-Jesse!
"Whoa, whoa, dude!"
You're that guy dating Hannah Montana.
Did you know that?
Yeah I saw it on Leno.
[Laughs] Me too!
Up top bro!
Yeah.
Jesse what are you doing here?
Casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
-Nice.
-Your dad told me you were at the pier.
I just had some great news I had to tell you.
I can't wait aforementioned casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
Overkill.
My dad's coming home from overseas.
My gosh Jesse that's great.
Miley.
Dang it.
Hey it's okay.
I don't think anybody noticed.
One at a time bro.
"Oh, Hannah Montana's new boyfriend, Jesse,"
Apparently caught cheating today.
Ooh!
- We don't know yet.
"I'm so sorry, Nick."
You think you can figure out what this is?
I'm going to do my best.
"First, I have to test the cat's claws, but if I can't get it from the cat,"
I'm going to have to go see Juliette.
"Okay, are you good here for now?"
- Not really.
- Yes.
"Hey, where you going?"
I'm going to find Adalind.
[Cat yowling]
[Cage rattles]
[Cat yowls]
Maybe it just doesn't like me.
Blutbaden and house pets don't really mix.
"Except, you know, as the occasional between-meal treat."
I'm going to start with some valeriana officinalis.
[Cat hisses]
[Cat screeches] All right.
[Suspenseful music]
[Footsteps approach]
"No, no, no."
Don't shoot.
"Hey, come on."
Put it down.
Who were you shooting at?
Adalind!
Adalind!
[Cell phone ringing]
Yeah?
"He was here at my house, Nick."
I'd meet the children of the woman I portrayed...
Do you know where he is?
Maurice?
Why?
Do you want to tell him that Jonah's dead?
It'd kill him.
If he's still alive he's probably in Marseille.
The last time I saw him was in Marseille years ago.
"In a restaurant, of course."
"I actually remember the restaurant. ""Beirut""."
"Lebanese food, nice restaurant."
But that was long ago.
Do you have a picture of him?
"No, I threw it away."
Or tore it up.
You know how a broken heart is.
You do all sorts of things that you regret later-.
Be a little like me.
How?
I don't even know who you are.
Just tell Ricky the truth.
"Get rid of the cigarette, there's no smoking here-."
You talk to me about truth...
Now you're a movie star.
Te-bell Hi-bick-i-by the-be tru-buth. (Tell Ricky the Truth)
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
"If you're all too scared to put on big boy pants and go in,"
I'll just claim my winnings and be on my way.
Wait a minute!
We can last in there just as long as you can.
Fine.
Come on then.
"Hold up, Shrek."
"You can't just go barging in some creepy, spooky joint like you own the place."
And why not?
It's not like there's anyone here to stop us.
"I still don't know about this, man."
You know...
Whole creepy house-of-wax vibe goin' on in here.

- No!
"You know, just go help Dr. Kovac with the rapid infuser, all right?"
No problem.
What do you need?
"Central line, supraumbilical DPL, rapid infuser and a t-pod."
What's a t-pod?
"Fine, I'll get it... again."
- What do you want me to do first?
- Find the O-neg.
Everything okay in there?
For the time being.
Call for four units of type specific.
Soon as I get this up.
Hypotensive pelvic fracture.
He needs the works.
Those are his kids out there.
"Hey, Frank, can you bring those guys to the Family Room?"
Sure.
"Come on, kids."
This way.
- I'll be right in.
- Great.
- Guide wire?
- I'm getting an error signal.
There's not enough water in the warmer.
- Thanks.
- Cordis inducer.
Stitch.
Where's Dori with the T-pod?
T-pods are on the bottom shelf.
Update his vitals?
"- Okay, infuser's on."
- Looks good.
"Doctor Gilbert Venin, I presume?"
"Shit Livingstone, asshole?"
Your finger's on the pulse.
Mickey the Arab wants a word with you.
I'm very expensive.
"- Playing for keeps, or you got the creeps?"
- Don't you worry.
We're in a pest controlled area.
What's on Mickey's agenda?
Disneyland!
- That's gonna be tough.
"- No, a straight split."
"Tomorrow, midnight, where you want, ladies as witnesses, face to face, all holds barred."
It's high time.
"You shit flies, keep buzzing around Mickey."

Do you have an aspirin?
Your lovely brothers.

Forget it.
Edgar. 5 am.
Blow deal.
Rue Lenine.
In Charenteuil.
That's our turf.
Sure you've got no aspirin?
Second one's almost there.
- Cool.
- And this device I invented... will monitor the vibrations of the audience.
- That's great.
- Just keep the music coming... from the baddest jazz trio in D.C.!
And I got some women lined up for you.
"Michael, I told you."
I don't want to meet anybody.
"Come on, Jeff."
You got to get over Stacy.
It's been four months since you broke up.
"You got to move on, experience life."
- You're right.
"- Anyway, first show..."
Debra's bringing her cousin Denise.
"She's kind of fat, but she's got a cute face."
"Cool, cool."
"Second, Anita's bringing her girl."
Says she's a ten.
- A ten?
- Uh-huh.
"Without a weave, she's a six."
That's cool.
I got to go.
Warden.
Just appease her.
"With this baby here, you won't be here much longer."
"Move over, Wynton Marsalis."
Cool.
"Aren't you going to say excuse me, Dre?"
Excuse me.
"Thanks again for calling, Mr. Reed."
This was an inside job.
"So I'm gonna get to see you sometime this week,aren't I?"
I don't know.
[giggling]
I guess that's a yes?
[laughs]
Get your hands up.
Don't--don't shoot us!
Give me the bag!
Now!
"Okay, okay."
Give it to him.
Give it to him!
The purse.
Give it to me.
He's gone.
It's okay.
It's okay.
(Leo) The receptionist's alibi checks out.
She was outta here by 10:45 last night.
Same with Marla's assistant.
Her roommate said that she was home all night.
That leaves only two people.
Marla and Gus.
Can you think of any reason that an artist would want to steal his own art?
Publicity.
There are more reasons for a gallery owner to do it.
Insurance.
Selling the work without having to give Gus a cut.
Maybe you should talk to Ms. Saffer some more.
You can't actually believe I took Gus's work.
What would you believe if you were me?
For coming.
"Honey, we discussed this."
Just come tomorrow and help with lunch.
I keep my nose out of Dorona's business.
I'm afraid she'll hit me.
It's time to go.
"Come on, honey."
I'll drive you home and come back.
I don't want to leave them alone-They'll fall apart on me-.
"It's ok, I'll close the door."
- Were you smoking?
- No.
Liar.
Give me one.
- Where's the pack from?
- They're Mom's.
"Once a week, Saturday morning, with a shot of arak."
- Mom smoked on Sabbath?
- Where did you come from?
She promised not to smoke on Saturdays.
- It's cold.
- Did you take them home?
Kobi has an ear infection.
They don't need to be here.
- Where's your pervert friend?
"- Stop it, Natanel."
On the way to Frankfurt.
- Really?
Is he a flight attendant?
"- No, he's a lawyer."
Why?
I thought you were all flight attendants.
Split!
Where to?
Come here!
Don't stand and watch!
Get her!
"Bravo, aunt!"
That was wonderful!
Maa!
Remember your Maa now?
"Always remember her, before you touch another woman."
You can even remember me.
"Sure, Mom!"
"Call me ""aunt""...not Mom!"
"You were great, young lady!"
"Thank you, Laxmi."
What for?
This is my duty.
Not for the juice.
You did me a great favour yesterday.
You have protected my children like a member of the family.
"They're dear to me, too."
"Anything could have happened, if you were not there."
The worthless doctor just fled!
And I was thinking of getting him married to Janki.
I've changed my mind!
The doctor does not deserve Janki!
Have you asked Janki too?
Why ask her?
She has no sense either.
Maybe she loves him.
She was in love with that idiot of a film-man too!
But what happened?
"He can do anything, Zone, South Beach, Atkins."
He's fantastic.
And he's cheap.
- How much?
"- Oh, I don't know."
[LAUGHING]
"Oh, shoot, I didn't bring enough double-stick tape."
Could you run down to the storage room and grab me some more?
Me?
"Yeah, I'd go myself, but I have nice shoes on."
"Oh, nice shoes."
"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that."
I get all my shoes at the car wash.
She works at a car wash?
- Yeah.
- Mm.
[GRO ANS]
"God, my shoes are nice."
I spent $40 on these shoes.
"- Oh, God, I hate those women."
- Which women?
All women.
"I mean, it's enough with them already, right?"
You wouldn't happen to be talking about those meanie moms?
"I'm sorry, I can't afford a personal chef."
I don't have time to take a three-hour yoga class.
I work.
Women are allowed to work.
It doesn't make them bad people or bad mothers.
Exactly.
I work.
"Oh, my God."
Why can't you compromise on something?
Anything?
Because then I'd be you.
A real Hollywood agent.
"I want to look like that French girl in ""Last Tango in Paris."" Oh."
Where are my heels?
"She had that hat, remember?"
It's black with the flower?
Clothes are not what I remember about that movie.
What?
You're nervous.
[scoffs] [laughs] It's cute.
You're cute.
Just cleaning my boots.
[sighs] [brush swiping]
"Do you love me, Nick?"
[laughs softly]
I wouldn't want to be on this ride with anyone else.

I can't wait until our trip to Merced this weekend.
"J. D. , come on !"
"Go call an ambulance, man."
Go call a fucking ambulance!
I told him not to move.
Hurry up!
SANTANA:
Thought I knew it all.
Ended up in juvie hall.
And the shit got even deeper.
COP:
To the right.
Open up your mouth.
"Okay, pick your clothes up."
Take it on down to the property room to exchange your clothing.
"(whispering) Don't fucking move, you fuck!"
Don't make a fucking sound.
Hear me?
(groaning)
(GRUNTlNG)
Does it feel good?
"Fuck, yeah."
"You say one word about this,"
"(panting) there'll be shit on my knife, not on my dick!"
Fucker.
(GRUNTS)
"Damn you, you fucking asshole!"
Kill him !
Kill him.
(groaning)
SANTANA:
killing that first night got me the worst that juvie had to offer.
An extended sentence with a guaranteed bus ride to the big time as soon as I turned 1 8.
"Hello sis, how are you?"
"I'll go to your house later, okay?"
.
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
They really are close to each other.
Who?
Migs and Bela.
I'm not used to seeing them like that.
"Sis, be strong."
Fight for Migs.
"You know, show Migs why he fell in love with you."
I just find it so hard every time he sees me but he doesn't remember me.
But I can't make it obvious.
I have to hide it.
-It hurts so bad.
"-Sis, you can do that."
I have to carry on.
I'll show him why he loved me.
Take a bath.
"You know, this is where we had our second date."
And you always take something home for Raya and Mrs. Robles.
That's why Raya loves you so much because you always bring her food.
-It's because you keep bribing her.
-Is that so?
.
-Who were you talking to?
-It's Ara.
Later...
"I'll go to our house, I'll just get something."
-Do you want me to go with you?
.
-It was New York.
-Johnny Sack?
What was it?
The fat joke?
I'm sure that didn't help.
Carmine.
"This HUD thing we're into, they wanted a piece of it."
I think they confronted Ralph...
-things went sour.
"-What'd he say, John?"
Wasn't what he said so much as what he didn't say.
We're talking about New York here.
Before we do anything in terms of a payback... you go to your people.
I want a full investigation.
Nobody makes a move until we know what happened.
You understand?
What the fuck?
-What's going on?
-Have a seat.
I'm Dominic.
"I know you don't know me, but...."
You're the guy who broke into Stew Leonard's that time.
You stole all those pork loins.
"Yeah, but that's not why I'm here today."
-We're here to talk about your drug problem.
-What?
"-Jesus Christ, you fucking kidding me?"
"-Sorry, baby, please."
"No, fuck this shit."
You were told once.
"Now, sit down."
Sit down.
Possible.
After my careful analysis...
Possible?
No way.
"Excellent judgement, Marshal."
I traveled far for White Tiger.
So I leave this insignificant case to you.
I'll hold you responsible for your fail this.
Responsible?
Me?
Marshal!
You've come such a long way.
How about having dinner with me tomorrow.
Please...
We weren't invited to the restaurant's opening.
Why?
They've invited Huang Fei-hung.
Huang?
It's his birthday a couple days later.
Send him a birthday suit.
He'll like my suit for sure.
Is everything ready for my birthday?
"Everything is ready, Master."
Master...
A tailor's here to make a suit for you.
What?
Your birthday suit.
Show him in.
How come it's different tailor?
Ah To's away.
Let me take your measurement.
Fine.
People page.
Names...
"Karl W. Taylor, Eric Sawyer."
- Page thirty-three.
- Society world.
It's a photo of a couple that just got married.
Centerfold.
What does she do?
"She's an actress, a model... a dancer, and a dental technician."
She enjoys cooking and hip-hop.
"She's wearing a black bikini, and she's fine."
Yes!
What's her measurements?
Thirty-eight...
"After you touch it, it only lasts for thirty seconds."
You really got superpowers!
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
"- Man, this is wild."
- Check this out.
"Jeff, you were hit by a meteor."
Think anybody else got superpowers?
Larry?
"Larry, come in here."
Something's wrong with this TV.
"What's wrong, Mary?"
The channels keep changing by themselves.
They keep what?
Fix it.
It's this thing.
It's this right here.
"Oh, see, I know what's wrong."
I know what's wrong.
- Getting ready for the theater.
Theater?
Sure.
It's Laura's opening night.
- I forgot.
- You promised to come.
"Yeah, but..."
- I couldn't stand it tonight.
- Why not?
I had my share of amateur dramatics today.
You're mean.
It's supposed to be really good this time.
Can't we lie in bed and watch TV instead?
How original.
"""A Streetcar Named Desire""..."
perhaps it's on TV tonight.
Vivian Leigh instead of Laura Kirsch.
"Marco, I have to go, and I want to."
- You can come here and watch TV.
- Yeah?
"Yes, I'll tell Laura you're ill."
Yeah?
"Yeah, see you soon."
"My God, they're full to bursting."
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella?"
Please.
Look at my figure.
"Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella?"
I weigh what I weighed...
How much do you think this exclusive casserole set costs?
Slapped you!
"You probably think I'm finished, huh?"

"No, there's another one!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!"
There's a slap for you!
"Slap, slap, slap!"

They're here!
The audition results for the school musical are in!
"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy!"
- All right!
"- All right, Wendy!"
Who's the male lead?
"No surprise there, it's Bridon!"
"- All right, Bridon!"
"- Cool, Bridon!"
I get to be a stand-in!
"Congratulations, Bridon!"
Guess we'll be working a lot together!
"Yeah, great."
Goddamn it!
That's what I just said.
"Where did he get it, right here?"
So why are we here?
Johnny Cannata and Frank Doss own this hotel.
Why would they kill a comic?
I don't think they did.
FBI has had them under surveillance.
"Price was involved with Cannata and Doss, very tight."
Silent partner?
We don't know.
Let's go nose around.
How was fishing?
Rainy.
Hi.
Someday I'm gonna be wearing threads like that.
Mrs. Noogman.
"Yeah, definitely his better half."
Where's Miami's favorite mouth?
I don't care.
I got an agent.
I'm a singer now.
I ran into Annie downstairs.
Said she saw a cocktail waitress named Dorothy Bain... head up here with Morty Price about 4:00 this morning.
What's your connection with Miss Bain?
We're acquainted.
"She's a sweet kid, Sonny."
You'd like her.
She's got a cute little boy.
Yeah.
I'd like to meet her.
You know where we can find her?
My lips are sealed.
"Well, open the door!"
Okay.
"Hi, Wilbur, how are you?"
I'm in no mood to get engaged today.
"Do you feel all right, Wilbur?"
I'm fine.
"What's on your mind, baby?"
"Well, Mrs. Brendan wanted to see you in her office right away."
Why?
She didn't say.
I'll walk back with you if you want me to.
"Okay, but no swans."
No swans.
Get my coat!
"Sure, sure."
Skeets!
Yes?
(WHISTLING)
Nothin'.
Wilbur's a very remarkable boy.
"In this day and age, it's so difficult to rear a child properly."
Yes.
I wouldn't give you 10-to-1 on a boy like Wilbur living to grow up.
"Oh, that's a little on the pessimistic side, Mr. Hoolick."
"All right, I'll make it 8-to-1."
"Oh, really."
"Here he is, Mrs. Brendan."
"Hello, Mrs. Brendan, did you want to... (STUTTERING)"
Surprised?
Of course he is.
I've had a hard time catching up with Wilbur.
Now you have him back safe and sound.
I can smell it.
"You know, somehow Dawson and Skagway and... even California seem like places I've just heard of."
Seems as if I've lived out here in this wilderness forever.
Other people and other places... never existed.
But there's one thing I do remember... and that's a very kind and wonderful man.
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.
"What are you thinking of, Buck?"
"Well, he's probably remembering more than thinking."
Remembering back to the time when he was more wolf than dog.
When there was only one law- the law we were just talking about.
"It's getting late, Jack."
Think I'll say good night.
"Not guilty, Your Honor."
Cabin!
- The tree!
- The mine!
"Oh, boy!"
"Hey, somebody pinch me."
That does it.
It's just as it was in the letter.
"My, oh, my, oh, my."
I do declare.
Hey!
"Hey, boss!"
Boss!
"Come here, quick."
Hmm.
Look at this.
"Oh, my."
Oh.
"Lookit, lookit!"
Tell me if I'm dreamin'.
"Look, what do you want?"
"Look, I'll make any kinda deal with you."
What the hell do you want?
"Hey, listen, who put you up to this, huh?"
"That-that caputo guy, huh?"
Carmine caputo?
You're not gonna get away with it.
"Do me a favor, huh?"
Listen...
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"You see the thing is, my friend needs the money you've taken out of his pocket all these years."
[Chuckling]
"Hey, hey punk, that's easy."
"Twenty, thirty thousand dollars..."
I'll give you anything you want.
"Just get me the hell down, ya hear?"
"Hey, hold it, hold it."
"Hold it, please."
Now where's your house?
"It's over in englewood, new Jersey... 26 ocean road."
How do I get in?
That's easy.
"I'll give ya key, huh?"
This one here is the front door.
The alarm system...
Be my guest.
Where's the safe?
"It's the first room, right behind the kitchen."
You can't miss it.
It's to the right.
What's the combination?
"No, wait a minute, okay."
That's very interesting.
Doesn't somebody get intelligent and realize children must grow up their own way?
The mind's nothing to do with it.
It's your feelings.
Kids get born and you just worry about them and you hope for them.
"Well, I gotta get going."
"- Good night, Nellie."
"- Good night, Allison."
Hello?
"Oh, hello, Mother."
I've been thinking it over.
You can invite anyone you want to your party.
"Oh, Mother, thank you."
Thank you very much.
I'll be home in a little while.
Bye.
"2676J, please."
"Hey, watch where you're going there, buddy, will you?"
- Thanks much.
- Thank you.
- I want it.
- You don't need any.
I want some!
"- Would you like a sandwich, Norman?"
"- No, thank you."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Betty and Rodney.
Says...
"Emily Post, I've heard."
"Well, Emily post is also a divorcée, so she would definitely be on my side."
And a delicious man like that shouldn't go to waste.
Don't you want Paul to be happy?
Of course I do.
"Yeah, he's-- he's lost his wife, and you are recently divorced, so..."
So...
you don't mind playing Cupid?
"Also, certainly, a thank you to Coach Masters for his-- his help on the field."
- Paul...
- Yeah?
"You remember Stephanie, Jacob's mom."
Of course.
Hi.
How are you?
"You may not be aware, but Stephanie is, uh-- she's recently divorced."
"Oh, well, that got to the point."
To the--
"Oh, you're setting us up."
It was my idea.
I know.
"But at some point, I thought, ""Why be coy?"""
She's right.
"I mean, you're both single, you're both smart and nice."
Smart and nice.
Wow.
"Stephanie, can I offer you a refill?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
Here you go.
"Oh, my God."
He called?
MARY:
Well...

- No.
BRUCE:

Left his calling card with your lady-in-waiting?
- He MySpaced me.
- Ouch.

My trampy little sister says MySpace is the new booty call.
"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
"I mean, things have changed."
People don't meet each other organically anymore.
"If I would like to make myself seem more attractive to the opposite sex I don't go and get a new haircut, I update my profile."
"That's just the way it is, you know?"

"Back, back, back, back."

You look yourself again.
"Yes, Miss First Lady."
It's in my pocket next to my heart.
"You know, Mary Todd gave it to Lincoln to remind him he only had so much time to do good things while he was in that chair."
- I hear you.
"Well, kiss Amber for me, okay?"
I love you ladies.
Miss you.
- I gotta go back to being president.
- I love you too.
Did you know that 1.5 million people visit the White House every year?
"No, I did not know that."
"Look, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry that I didn't make it to your talent show.
I'm not.
Seriously.
Did you know the White House used to be called the Presidential Palace?
"Look, I need you to hear me right now."
Look at me.
I really wished I was there.
"No, you don't."
All I-
- All I did was twirl a flag.
It was stupid.
"You know that you don't have to do that with me, right?"
- What?
- Have thick skin.
You're 11.
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, sir."
- How are you?
"- Fine, thank you."
Yourself?
"Thank-- Thank everybody, please."
"- Yeah, just let us know."
- Just let us-
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- If you get some more info.
- If there's an update.
- Yeah.
Um...
Guys.
"Look, this is the hard part."
Pete's gone.
"- Yeah, I know."
"- No, I mean, like, when someone is missing..."
"Hey, we've had more manpower on this than we've ever had looking for someone."
"I mean, I've got the fire department involved in looking for him and I hate firemen."
- No.
"- No, it means a lot."
- Yeah.
"- Ricky, thank you."
- No.
What Iâm trying to say is...
"You know, someone in Pete's condition?"
He didn't go anywhere.
He couldn't have gone anywhere.
He's gone.
He's in the river or something.
And it's hard when a body doesn't--
Doesn't turn up.
"Look, this isn't the first time I've had to have this talk, but... when it's people you know, it's hard."
"- What are you trying to say, Ricky?"
"- Horace, he's gone."
X-rays are up.
"-C-spine clear, mediastinum looks okay."
-Very good.
-So where are you registered?
-What?
-Definitely have to.
-Could someone get SonoSite?
"My ex-wife didn't, we ended up with clocks."
"With my sister, salad bowls."
Seven of them.
Does anybody mind if we just focus on the patient?
"Okay, then."
"Can we have that SonoSite, please?"
Neela.
Can you get away?
-We need to go get a license.
-We don't know where to get married.
-We do.
Hospital chapel.
-When did we decide that?
"-You were busy, I thought you--"
-And Jerry's gonna marry us?
"Yeah, he has some kind of minister's license, so l-- ls that really who we want?"
"What's Frank gonna be, the ring bearer?"
We don't have a lot of time.
I had to make some choices.
-Are you gonna choose the flowers too?
"-No, no."
"But you like lilies, right?"
"-Michael, we have to talk."
-About what?
-l think this is getting a little-- Dr. Gallant.
The mailman put one of your letters... in my box.
I'll give you some medication.

Miss Brody.
It's me.
It's Detective Ridgely.
"You all right, honey?"
Take this.
Miss Brody.
Don't you ever try... to sneak off on me like that again.
You understand?
It's all right.
"Hey, Barry."
"Long night, squire?"
Hospital bills.
You got a file for every nosebleed in Illinois?
If you'll just be patient...
Thank you.
But this says 3B.
Yes.
Miss Brody lives in apartment 2B.
Somebody made a mistake.
That's right.
Valerie Wheaton died in apartment 3B.
Who has access to these files?
Only hospital personnel.
I want a list.
All right.
Do you by chance recognize the handwriting on this?
This looks like Dr. Pierce's writing.
What were you doing at the El station... so late at night?
Why do you want to know?
No.

"Why is Kobi screaming, honey?"
"Then who is that, Yitzhak?"
"Why are you crying, Yarivi?"
Your father called me.
He said he might want to come too.
Suddenly everyone's interested in me- I'm a celebrity-.
"It's all kosher, dear."
"Poor Jonah, my beautiful sister."
"She was better at everything else, but I could teach you how to cook!"
"So what are you up to, Aunt Rosa?"
What can I do?
I teach Hebrew.
"Besides your leg, are you feeling better?"
Why?
- Are you better?
- What do you mean?
He's asking if you're better.
You said you were sick.
"- Me, sick?"
- Aren't you sick?
I'm as healthy as a horse.
This is in Paris.
"You came to visit, remember?"
Your mother came every year.
Do you know where in Paris?
- Do you remember?
- How?
I was only five.
Then how should I remember?
How?
I've got no place to work.
What's wrong with the country?
MaIIefiIIe is there.

I just can't stand the sight of him any more.
I tell him outright I want him to leave and he plainly refuses.
"I'm a coward, of course."
I can never simply boot my lovers down the stairs.
- Ha!
- What?
Why don't you stay here in Paris and write?
Because alfred's here.
I've got to go somewhere.
"Anywhere, I don't know."
"Maybe I should just curl up and die, yes?"
"Listen, BuIoz."
"I need 3,000 francs now."
Let me read this... and we'II talk tonight at the Baroness Laginsky's party.
I hadn't planned to attend.
alfred might be there.
I know for a fact that he won't.
AII right.
- What's that?
- marvellous.
- Her memoirs?
Am I in it?
- No!
This bit's about her childhood.
"You'II come in later, after she chews up her husband and a hundred others."
It's true.
She's a cannibal.
Judgment Day.
"Hey, everyone, Dermot O'Leary's about to defuse this bomb."
You ready?
Yeah.
Do it.
Return?
"Return, enter."
"Oh, shit!"
Jesus!
Oh!
Looks like we need a new mayor.
What in the name of Satan's arsehole is that?
!
"I told you to save him, not blow him up!"
"Sorry about that, boss."
Sorry about that?
!
Is that your fault?
"Well, it was O'Leary, sir, he, er, completely went for it."
He went rogue and started typing things into the computer...
I didn't go rogue.
"Anyway, you said you 100% trust me, I didn't go rogue."
"Oi, big boy, look at me, yes."
"Explanation now, yes!"
"OK, I thought the killer and the kidnapper was Miley Cyrus."
Did you?
Yeah.
"Right, why?"
"She had motive, there was a bypass going to go through the old people's home."
"I thought the old people loved the VHS, she knew her way around a VHS."
And the...
And the delivery of the ransom note was in VHS.
Albert.
(Camilla starts crying)
"Oh, sweetie!"
Why don't you sort things out with him?
- Because I think it's too late.
- It's never too late.
"If you like him so much, why don't you commit yourself?"
"You know, it's probably just some sort of misunderstanding."
"Oh Camilla, now you got me going too."
"(light waltz, both girls laugh and cry at the same time)"
Hey... silly me.
I can be such a wise-ass.
Didn't I realise I was talking about myself?
Apparently not.
I needed one more push.
And that push came from an unexpected place.
(knocking on door)
May I come in?
Are you all right?
- Entrez.
I'm almost done.
- Sure?
We used to be lovers.
Can you believe that?
You and Pierre?
"Yes, I know."
I thought he was the love of my life.
Are we talking about the same person?
- Yeah.
Unfortunately.
- What happened?
- L'amour rend aveugle.

Andrew's sister.
She used to tell us about that ....
Kid from the Burger Palace.
"He got his face bashed in so bad in Juvie, he couldn't talk for a month."
It's why he's got the weird scar.
Hm.
I saw the kid that stabbed a guy like two months ago.
"Well, I guess it's best you sat out there then, uh?"
Hey.
You gotta do better.
The qualification for nationals is in two weeks.
Good.
"Hey, we need the video camera [knock]"
Yeah Lance get some clothes on.

What 'you want Pam?
Like I told you:
"Hit me again, I said."
Do you remember?
Nobody knows what the girl has gone through.
But now we must speak about it.
"The truth - and nothing but the truth, so help me God."
Pauline Kraka.
"No, it's not for me."
I have only written here.
Poste restante.
Mr Harald Brennemann
I have no identity card.
- Maybe you have his forwarding address?
- Where has he moved to?
I don't know.
To the West.
"Brennemann, Brennemann..."
Brennemann...
Brennemann...
"No, but there are a bunch of letters there."
"Christ, no!"
- He never picked them up.
- He can still come by.
"- Please, I'd like to have them back."
"- No, it's not that simple, Miss."
- They are returned to sender.
"- But please, that's me."
"- Yes, by postal route, Miss."
"- But please, I no longer have an address."
They could get into the hands of strangers.
"Please, give me the letters."
- Please!
You didn't even think about it.
what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake.
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just got to get a key.
No problems?
I'll take care of it.
Tell him what you were telling me.
Too good to be true.
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.
There's a Jewish holiday Monday.
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.
What about the security?
Security?
You're looking at it.
It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.
He just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage.
It's beautiful.
Why won't these people let me do my job?
I know!
What's that stuff you're always playingwith?
"""Silly Putty""!"
It calms me down.
"'Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""?"
I love them.
- They're the best band!
"- You know ""Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""!"
"Totally! ""The Americans"" is my favorite song!"
"That's impossible, no one in the States knows them."
I saw them when they went to London last March...
- in Cambridge.
- That's insane!
I was there!
Get out of here!
You were there?
That's crazy!
I worship this poster.
Where did you get it?
"- Well, I designed that, actually."
- Do you know them?
Bob Green and I went to Eton together.
"Paul, I've been looking everywhere for you."
"Everywhere except my office, I guess."
I heard you were in the shitter.

"Pardon me, Jocelyn."
"Hey, cut it out."

What is this?
Okay.
Action.
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
To which she replies...
Ooh.
I'm Rose.
This is Nancy.
The Nancy.
To which you say...
Rose...
"Do you know, if one were 20 years younger and differently inclined, one might almost be tempted."
Cat-
- Catrin...
Catrin!
"Cat, don't make me run."
"They're always gonna be like that, aren't they?"
"Younger, in awe of you, like I was."
"Oh, come on, Cat, you had a choice."
You didn't choose me.
I'll come back in a few days and move my things.
"Oh, for God's sake, the flat's yours."
You're the one who pays the rent.
"Anyway, I'm going to Manchester tomorrow."
They decided to take the exhibition on tour.
"It's a success, then?"
It's a success.
I'm glad.
Hmm.
"You know, the first time I painted you outside the steelworks... maybe I shouldn't have shown you walking away."
Right now!
"What, what have you done to me?"
"I'm gonna tell, I'll talk about that."
Just... give me your hand.
Come on.
Come on.
Alex.
What are you doing here?
Getting you out.
Please?
Here is a... cashier's check for 4 million dollars.
It's what you need to get that property from Taylor.
- And you want in on the deal?
- No.
I only want Chase.
"Alex, you do know that relationships between Pure Bloods and non Pure Bloods is frowned upon."
To speak nothing of a... financial arrangement between Erebus ans the House of Chthon...
Trust me.
"No one knows I'm here, this is strictly between you and me."
"So... take the money, buy whatever you want, but let Chase go."
You're buying me.
I'm rescuing you.
There's a difference.
"Yes, there is."
You're right.
"Since Berlin, I'm just not the same."
"Fine, go."
Let me say goodbye properly.
"Pour us a drink, Chase."
Let's toast to our new lifes.
To endings and beginnings.

So nice to see you!
"I was dropping off some contact sheets and I figured I'd stop by... and say ""hi""."
How are you doing?
Holding up?
Barely.
I just about to transfer... the Western shoot all day.
Yee-haw!
- Do you wanna get some coffee?
- I can sneak out of here for... five minutes before I have to get back to this closet.
- Cool.
- Let me just get my coat.
"Jocelyn, I'm sorry you had to work late."
Hang in there!
Paul.
"John, Simmon, How sweetie!"
Hello there!

I can't even think about it before breakfast.

Safety is chic.
Living is chic.
Helmut Lang.
"Helmets... for motorcycles, mopeds, vespas and scooters, even."
- Hold on.
- What?
I hope this is the fever talking.
This lack of compassion and tolerance is very disappointing.
- That is not the little girl I raised.
- You guys are disgusting.
What was that?
"I told you, we should've had more Jewish friends."
[Whispers] You never told me that.
"Yeah, you suck!"
We're friends of the Jewish people!
- We don't have any.

"No, not one."

"So you still coming down to Fort Lauderdale,"
Why aren't you in uniform?
It doesn't fit me anymore!
He must be a right fucking bastard!
I know what I'd have told him.
He blushed.
You should've seen him.
"Just 'cause I said ""toilet."""
"Is he good-looking, Sharon?"
"Ah, you're joking me."
You know Roland the rat?
"Well, he looks like him, only not as nice."
"He asked me why I wasn't wearing me uniform... so I stuck out me belly... and I said, ""It doesn't fit me anymore!"""
"You were dead right, Sharon."
You should've stuck one of your tits... in his mouth as well.
You should see the state of me nipples.
Jesus.
"Frank Kinsella's a ride, isn't he?"
- It wasn't him.
- I didn't say he...
It wasn't him.
It wasn't his brother.
It wasn't my brother.
It wasn't Bart Simpson.
It wasn't anybody.
"Now get off me bleedin' back, will ya?"
I'm sick of it!
- She didn't...
"- You keep out of it, right!"
"He is a ride, though, isn't he?"
Frank Kinsella.
Bitch.
"What's that that's on, Sharon?"
"I was 20 bucks up, but with only enough time for one more pick-up before the bars closed,"
I needed to make sure I chose a wealthy client.
[ Cellphone rings ]
"""Honda Civic."""
I'll forward that to Rut.
"I wanted a bigger tip, so I held out for another car."
And I'm glad I did.
"Oh, my gosh!"
I don't even want to know that.
Woman #2:
It's crazy.
[ All talking at once ]
No!
"No, no, no."
I can't even begin to guess what they're talking about.
Yeah.
It's a package.
I'm just saying.
"Look, I don't wear toe socks around town."
I am out of my element.
He was weird because I went to his...
"While Rut was off driving a cheap Civic, my last pick-up took me to the Castro district, and I was looking for a big tipper."
Hi.
Did you guys call Zingo?
- We did call Zingo!

I called 1-800-babe.
Is that you?
"No, but thanks for asking."
- Okay.

You forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
Reminds me of biscuits.
Really?
Why's that?
"When we were just little kids, Mum and Dad used to take us to the seaside."
"Me and my sister would sit in the back, eating digestive biscuits."
"John, listen..."
I've never done what you do.
I know.
Just ask him for the time or a light or whatever.
You can do that.
I'll do the rest.
Do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tons.
I suppose I'd better save some for my mother.
You OK?
I'm just trying to deal with this shit. I didn 't ask forthis.
"What, and I did ?"
I climbed on top of myself and got pregnant ?
You want me to take him to my mother's ?
I'll take him.
Get his shit ready.
Get him ready !
"Oh, no."
You're not going now here with my son tonight.
"Not on that temper, and not with that attitude."
"Look, you know what ?"
Fine.
"Then, I won't take him. I'm outta here."
"Go ahead, leave."

"Travis, put that down."
Excuse me. I have been here for an hour and a half.
Am I gonna be able to see a doctor anytime soon ?
"I've already told you, we'll get you in as soon as we can."
My appointment was an hour ago.
I already got here early.
We are doing the best we can.
We have a lot of people.
It's the station.
Excuse me.
Wesley.
- Prentice here.
- And Hull.
- Yeah?
- We found the body.
Can you be more specific?
Sid Thomas-Haye.
Guy who escaped from the hospital.
"Found him in a Yukon XL, single shot to the head."
"Okay, nice work."
"Not so nice for him, but could be good for you."
We found his phone.
"A burner cell... clean, except for one missed call, so we ran that number."
Name came up as part of the Harris investigation.
What's the name?
Morgan Lewis.
Got any ideas why this Sid guy and Morgan might be connected?
Sid had a charge for possession.
Maybe he was Morgan's dealer.
We got probable cause.
"Morgan, you home?"
Morgan?
"Frank, I got something."
Yeah?
What do you got?
Car service receipt.
Looks like Morgan took a cab to the Larimar Hotel last night.
Maybe he got drugs and a hooker.
One last hurrah.
I know that look.
This is your night.
You've worked so hard for this.
That's not what I work for.
"-No, But still."
Sometimes it's good to take a break and enjoy the achievements.
It does not help to look back.
"Here, keep it."
You can get it.
I do not care who you were with.
Just get your ass down here now.
"But Aksel, you should have seen her."
A gorgeous blonde.
Her tits is the size of melons.
-Beina is as long as my dick.
"Fuck you, Degang."
"So, ScanBrazil?"
People all over the earth tremble enough in his pants now.
"Dispose of CDN, Genergy, Oxon and the European branch of Mintec."
Can anyone make some coffee for us?
It's going to be a long night.
Talk Pronovo and Sandelman.
Buy what you can.
"Go, go."
And I need a clean shirt!
Look here.
This is how champagne is opened.
55 million so far.
They supply them now.
I love the smell of bankruptcy in the morning.
"Quiet now, Degang."
-What Tsirk?
-There is Belarus.
"Hey, Sarge."
"Having a ball, huh?"
Did those meatballs ever figure on you coming in with six stripes?
"(laughs) Knocked them over, huh?"
"I went over big, yeah."
"I had the suit pressed and everything, all real sharp."
Yeah.
"Big, big."
"Hello, Sarge, Rocco again."
"Listen, the motor pool is in great shape, so just relax and have a ball."
"Hey, Sarge, they really flipped, huh?"
"Look, this is costing you guys a fortune."
You better hang up.
I'll be seeing you soon.

ANNOUNCER:
CBS Television presents You Are There.
Would you please just admit it?
I taught you about loyalty.
I fought tooth and nail with your mother for your custody.
Me.
Good old Dad.
And I am not the kind of man who would hurt my family.
"Now, I am disappointed in you for even thinking it."
"L""m hurting."
"Oh, my God."
"Daddy, you""re lying."
Lying right to my face!
"Oh, my God!"
- Keep your voice down.
"- How could you cheat, Daddy?"
How could you cheat on Clara?
Get out of my house.
"Clara, honey, patients are waiting."
"You know, Lisa hasn""t shown up in four days."
I guess whatever she has is contagious.
"- How""s David?"
- Fine.
- Are you okay?
"- Why wouldn""t I be?"
I fixed the scratch.
"The Mercedes the other day, I fixed the scratch... but now there""s a rattle."
"Driving to work this morning, it was rattle, rattle, rattle."
"L""m sorry."
"It""s all my fault."
"Of course it is, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, do you love her?"
- Do you love me?
- I want to come home.
- Huh?
You must have gotten somebody else.
Nobody hates the army more than Klinger.
He's spent his entire career trying to get season tickets to Section Eight.
"Gee, I don't know."
"This Klinger... dark, hairy guy, big beak."
Let me see that.
"[Chuckles] When I saw him in the ""O"" Club... crying in his beer over some skirt named Laverne..."
[Fingers Snap] It was all over but the signing.
"Vickers, you're a vulture."
"Doctor, you operate your way."
I'll operate mine.
[Clicks Heels]
See ya.
"- ##[Jukebox. ""Harbor Lights""]"
"- Klinger, come on."
Get up.
- Huh?
- Get up.
The maid wants to put fresh linen on the bar.
"Oh, please."
"Didn't you read the ""Do Not Disturb The Dead"" sign?"
- This is no time to let a sleeping drunk lie.
- ## [Stops]
Oh!
Don't!
All I have left of Laverne is that song.
"Klinger, do you have any idea what you did last night?"
- Last night?
"- Last night, yeah."
- Last night.
- Last night.
But those days are done.
- Oh.
- Mm.
Huh.
"Well, I guess I'm not in control of everything, am I?"
"Funny, isn't it?"
"You can try and try, but in the blink of an eye..."
You can lose everything that matters to you.
"Dad, are you okay?"
Don't you all see what's going on here?
Dad really wanted that milk.
I almost lost you guys today...
All of you.
- Aw.
- Just like that.
"Aw, daddy."
"Oh, honey."
"You spent the whole day trying to control everything, and I spent the entire day trying not to, and neither way worked, did it?"
Nope.
"I may fight you on this, but I'm gonna need you to make me get rid of Jolene two."
- She's a biter.
- I know.
As soon as we're done with this hug.
"Hey, whatever this is, I need to get in on it."
I almost died today.
- Grandpa.
- Daddy.
"- Aw, dad."
- Hey.
Come here.
- Aww.
"- Come here, you."
- I'm gonna get a palliative-care specialist...
- There must be something else you can do.
- To come down here and discuss your options.
- I will try anything... anything.
"I will try an experimental drug, uh, uh, more surgery."
"Uh, anything!"
I-I-I have to spend more time with my family.
I am not ready for this!
You...
"I'm sorry, Arthur."
You're sorry?
!
You're s-sorry.
"Mr. Janson, you need to wait in your room."
- Dr. Black will be with you.
"- I'm, uh..."
I'm trying to get to the elevator.
I heard there's a lobster truck outside.
I'm from Maine.
I-I can't pass up lobster.
"Oh, I-I can take him."
Hello.
I'm Jacob.
I'm a fellow traveler here.
"Uh, Larry..."
Larry Janson.
Do you like lobster?
"Well, my... my religion forbids shellfish, but I-I-I'd be happy to take you."
You just wait right here.
I'm just gonna get my coat.
God bless you.
And you.
"Mother, go now."
And remember...
"If anyone give you food, don't eat."
"Those crimnals, they mix something in the food."
And then they steal all the stuff.
Don't tell your name to anyone.
"Keep that in mind and wait... 25000, you might need it."
"Enough mother, stop crying."
"You have the gun, Right?"
Yes mother.
"You have the ammo, Right?"
Yes mother.
My son going to murder for the first time.
Mother don't you worry.
Stop crying.
Buying for the kid.
I don't have 100000 in the bag.
Which one is going to Pondi?
"The one, which is leaving..."
What are you looking at?
"This, Paharganj's peace."
It's Karolbagh's.
"It's can't be Karolbagh's, It's Paharganj's."
Khurana's stuff.
This not Khurana's stuff.
This is my wife.
"I'm not talking about your wife, I'm talking about her bra."
It's Khurana's stuff.
He sells this cheap stuff.
Why the police?
Stand in line everyone.
Open your bags.
I was always different.
My mom is an angry woman.
Life was neverthe same.
When I moved to Istanbul for university... she hired Zindan.
"Even so, she destroys my clothes... if she doesn't like them."
Why can't you be honest and tell the truth to yourparents?
Honesty is the easiest.
You don't understand.
Honesty will kill me.
"No, I can't understand."
What could possibly happen?
They are your parents.
They love you.
My mom is obsessed with cleaning.
I am not clean.
"What ever happens, happens."
We can change it.
We're going to the police.
"Tomorrow, OK?"
"Sir, we need to ask you a few questions."
Yourson Ahmet filed a complaint.
These youngsters...
You know how my wife can get...
Nevermind.
"Hello, you're still sleeping?"
Don't shout.
I need a driver.
"Can, have you gone nuts?"
Yourfoolish aunt didn't tell me...
"Thanks to Ahmet, she doesn't know."
Come in...
Come in.
"Are you all right, Sharon?"
"Are you all right, Sharon?"
- Now?
- Yeah.
"Aw, God almighty."
"Jesus, Sharon."
"You'll soon be the same shape as me, what?"
Thanks very much.
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
He's coming!
He's coming!
If you received my letter
We should have met him at the airport.
Not at all.
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me
If
You still want me
"Well, tie a yellow ribbon"
'Round the old oak tree
It's been three long years
Do you still want me?
Still want me
If I don't see a ribbon
'Round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
"Craig, love."
Sharon's having a baby.
Is that right?
"That's right, yeah."
Carl.
Carl?
Carl.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, no."
Someone's taken Carl's brain!
That is what I've been trying to tell you.
Really?
"Well, you haven't been very specific about it!"
I know I haven't.
"Because they says if I tell anyone,"
I'm gonna lose my job dancing in front of the car wash.
"Well, I'll tell you what, we're gonna do something about it right now."
"Look here, we can keep this cool, between us 'cause, look, this the third job I lost this week."
Come on y'all.
We're gonna go get us a car wash.
Are you outta your mind?
They take your brain out!
I know that!
They take your brain out over there.
"Here, I got a coupon."
"That's okay, Carl."
I got the employee discount.
Free triple foam polish with UV protectorant.
"Come on, Shake."
I'm trying to create a show here.
I'm a show.
What time the show come on?
Brain:
"Brain Slave, report to Brain Quarters."
"Brain Slave, kindly report to Brain Quarters."
Brain Slave!
"Hey, Allie, my girl."
"Oh, how are you, sweetie?"
"Daddy, this is Luke."
"- Hi, Luke."
"- So nice to meet you, sir."
- I've heard a lot about you.
- You too.
And this is my sister.
I'm Lucy.
Hi.
Is anybody hungry?
Is anybody hungry?
"Luke, something wrong with your dinner?"
"No, no, no."
"No, everything's great."
I will guard the bathroom.
Just eat.
So the doors are off because...?
"Long story short, a few years ago, I locked Allie in her room and tried to strangle her with a nightgown."
I totally get it.
"Uh, my brothers and I used to fight all the time."
- It's not like your brothers.
- You don't know my brothers.
"Ha, ha."
"So your sister tried to kill you, why?"
The smoke detectors told me to.
Why they didn't just tell you to bake muffins is anybody's guess.
Did the smoke detectors talk to you?
"Yeah, mostly, back then."
Ahem.
"Luke, did Allie even tell you that she had a sister?"
"Yeah, yeah, but just that you were in law school."
The new Brain Slave refuses to report!
Ain't nothing but a brain.
"As are we, Son."
And we do our job!
"You right, Daddy."
You right!
"Go on and fetch this Brain Slave, and kindly ask him to be on bug removal!"
Permanently!
"Customer, Daddy!"
Get my blue fright wig at once!
"Greet them with a smile, Son."
A hard plastic smile.
"We got a free dashboard cleaning, get the lint balls off your car, free tire shine!"
You'll get all that with a free brain removal.
Carl Brain:
"Moron, don't tell them!"
I meant to say car wash.
Now gas them!
Quickly!
"Look, I just came by to tell you that I've told the police about your little brain operation here."
"Yeah, and they didn't believe us."
"No, they didn't."
Then we shall call them and show them pictures!
"That's a good idea, Daddy."
It is a very good idea.
Where's Carl's brain?
I am Carl Brain.
"No, Carl's Brain."
I am Carl Brain.
"No, no, no."
"Different carl, okay?"
I am Carl Brain.
I will take this further if you wish.
"- It's over, as far as I'm concerned."
"- Are you sure, Mrs. Coyne?"
"Yes, Captain Dreyfuss, I'm sure."
"Oh, excuse me."
You didn't come back.
"The shore, The Far Rock."
I walk there every day.
"That's how I know, but... you must feel free to walk there."
"The lough, this place, it's for everyone."
"You have a young fella out there, Michael, you might want to..."
You're not welcome here.
Surely to God you know that.
"I just got posted, sir, all right?"
I'm due to depart for England real soon.
I just wanted one last drink with my pal here.
"Michael, let him in."
The lad's off to do his duty.
Go on.
One!
Noches!
"Hey, Noches!"
"Give me a hand to redd up, will you, Barney?"
Noches!
He went home a while ago.
- Mr. Coyne.
- Lieutenant.
"I'm, er, you know, I'm, er,"
"I'm really sorry for what happened, sir."
I-I didn't mean any harm.
"Go home while you're still ahead, son."
Good luck to you.
I just want to see what's going on with him.
You catch a vibe?
I've seen him at two different fire scenes.
"Chief, if we got a firebug here, you know it's next to impossible to prove anything."
Can you just spend some time with him?
See what we find out.
"Yo, Ernie."
Don't let Mills here make you do all the work.
He's what we call a candidate.
You know how there's all those rungs on the ladder?
He's the bottom one.
- Oh.
"- Come on, I'll give you a tour."
"Hey, heads up."
"Hey, what are you doing here on Thanksgiving?"
Reinforcements.
"[Alarm beeps, buzzes] Truck 81, ambulance 61."
Multiple gunshot wounds.
1542 Elmwood Park.
"Hey, would you put the turkey in?"
- Sure.
- Thank you.
This meal is very important.
"- Kid, you should stay--"
- Forget that.
Come on.
- Chief.
"- Yeah, I got him."
"Ernie, stand here."
"Let's go, let's go!"

"Hello, this is Kim Na Na."
What... me?
I'm qualified?
"Yes, thank you!"
"First of all, welcome to Cheong Wa Dae (Blue House)."
But...
"Don't assume that by coming into Cheong Wa Dae, (Note:"
Cheong Wa Dae
- Blue House) you can afford to slack off and relax.
You must give 100 percent and do your best.
Who are you?
How can a security officer be late on his first day of work?
Why are you dressed up like that?
I'm not a bodyguard.
"Then, who are you?"
They told me to come here.
Dr. Lee!
You're here.
This shameless person has a doctorate?
The National group of communication network is not here.
You have to go to the next building.
"Oh, it's the guy with a doctorate from MIT!"
MIT?
You are... 10 000 Won?
I'm right?
"So, you are a Blue House security guard."
No wonder you're so strong!
Do you know each other?
- Yes.
- No.
He has come a long way... he got his phd from MIT.
He has achieved a lot and he is only 28 years old!
He's in a hospital in Miami.
"He had a stroke, but recovered okay."
Your bodyguard is dead.
I asked about Fredo.
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.
All right.
I want you to get in touch with him.
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.
Tell him I know Roth misled him.
That he didn't know they would try to kill me.
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.
What?
What?
Come on.
Kay had a miscarriage.
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?
I really don't know.
"Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia."
"Young man, I hear you and your friends are stealing goods."
But you don't even send a dress to my house.
No respect!
You know I've got three daughters.
This is my neighborhood.
You and your friends should show me some respect.
You should let me wet my beak a little.
I hear you and your friends cleared $600 each.
No cameras.
It's the perfect spot.
"See if you can track down Lily-Anne Lau, his daughter and heir. (WHISTLES)"
"Harry, wait."
I need more.
I just crossed a pretty scary line for you.
You owe me a proper explanation.
I owed Freddie Lau money.
Gambling debts from his casino.
But this has got nothing to do with me.
"I don't care how you get your kicks, Harry."
"But if I'm going to have your back,"
I need to know it's coming from the right place.
(BUZZER)
It's Harry.
(BUZZER)
"- Hello, Josie, is he in?"
- Mmm.
Harry's here.
JOSIE:
Napoleonic.
Used by a marshal in the 1806 war against Prussia.
Me and your brother fired them on the heath last night.
Half-brother.
Is this official or unofficial?
You better come in.
70 grand.
I need you to um... look after it for a while.
"Who does it belong to, Harry?"
- It was in transition.
- From you to...
A man who died this morning.
"Me, when I go to the movies, it's just for the music."
And I'm in love with the prettiest babe in the world.
"Me, I've never been in love."
I've only been sick.
What's the difference?
Me...
I was locked up in a mental hospital.
"I was yelling in the streets, because my father, see, was put in jail."
- Did they bang him up?
- Five years times two!
- As for my father:
One times even equals seven!
- My name's Léo!
"You're kidding, that's my name too!"
But my father was top dog... a King!
- Mine was only a Prince!
- Mine was old school:
"Poet, Jew, writer!"
Me not...
"Hi, my name is Mickey!"
Delighted.
My brothers:
"François, how French can you get,"
"- Antoine, even worse..."
- Don't push it too far.

She craves warmth.

"I was there, gawking like the rest."
It's simple.
"This is our home, and this is my grandmother."
How do you do?
-You're all right?
Need a doctor?
"-No, thank you, I feel fine."
All right.
"Then, go home!"
"In a minute, Grandma, as soon as he's had his coffee."
How does it look?
What would Marco say?
Mark would say he should go home as soon as he's had his coffee.
I'm sorry.
-Who's Mark?
-My fella.
He's coming home from Europe tomorrow.
"I mean, today."
"Rosa, why did you do this?"
Why did you bring me here?
What was your first idea on it?
That I thought you were pretty?
It looked as if they were gonna turn you into tomorrow's headlines.
I thought it might be messy for your wife.
It was awfully nice of you.
Shame on you!
It's 4:00 in the morning.
4:00!
I have to attend a meeting at 10:00.
"I'm supposed to be as sharp as a tack, and as clear as a bell."
But you're not worried about what Mrs. Bourne will say.
-Mrs.
Bourne will be very understanding.
The day you die is just like every other day.
You wake and dress and eat and drink.

"And just tell them that... that you don't know me anymore, okay?"
Can you -- can you tell them that?
"I'm sorry, Elsa, but it's just not safe."
"I mean, they're gonna be all over us, so --"
"I will try and figure something out, okay?"

In his room...
I couldn't find him.
I asked around the village.
I checked with those who knew him.
But nobody had seen him.
He disappeared with the Revolution.
"In 1956, the Russians invaded the country..."
I never saw him again.
I remember...
Once he was very sick.
He took my hand.
He looked at me as if he was begging for something...
"He called me ""SeIma""."
I didn't understand.
"But now, that I know more about his life..."
I realize that he never saw who I really was.
Something like that...
Tell him to come up.
I want to see him in the lobby.
Just list them for me.
That's all.
Let me get back to you.
We're missing the best part.
You know it by heart.
I saw you lip-synching.
"Well, lucky l do."
I couldn't hear all the words.
I don't know if it's my old ears or the subway underneath.
-Did you like the Billy Bigelow?
-He's good.
Good voice.
What'd you think of the Julie Jordan?
"Good act, no voice."
My Nettie could sing better.
"We met 25 years ago, Westbury-- l heard about that."
"Speaking of performances, Frank."
I don't wanna hear about another one like this morning.
Your boy embarrassed me.
You'll have to live with it.
-Why?
-Because he's my boy.
There's oil...
"... underthatvacantlot ,Frank."
Jobs.
You don't need to politick me.
I run Kings County.
Jobs for people of this city.
"Not leases for Lenny, Murray and all your greedy pals."
Just because this kid thinks he can elect you President...
"She's been hiding something very important from you, you know."
Her family was murdered by a Methuselah.
Her family... was murdered?
Ah.
"I guess you really didn't know, tovaras."
That... can't be...
How odd that she never told you about something so important...
"Who knows, maybe she harbors a grudge against you, too."
Or perhaps-
He got away!
Your Lordship!
Are you all right?
!
Watch Esther!
She's in the backroom of the building on that hill!
Understood!
"Are you all right, Count?"
You've been seriously wounded...
This is nothing at all.
It will quickly heal.
But how did you find me?
An odd message was thrown my way as I returned from the palace.
Thrown?
By whom?
No idea.
What's wrong?
They... and Radu...
plan to kill Her Majesty!
What?
!
Esther-san!
Esther-san!
Motherfucking mutt!
You fucking piece of shit!
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Come on, come on!"
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!
You bought your fucking button!
-Don't get nervous.
-You motherfucker!
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!
Keep him here!
"Come on, you fuckin' feel strong?"
I'm sorry.
Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.
"He don't mean any disrespect, Henry?"
Are you nuts?
Teach this kid a little fuckin' manners!
"Hey Jimmy, what's right is right."
-You understand what I'm talkin' about?
-lt's alright.
"The kids over here, we're hugging and kissing over here and then 2 minutes later he's acting like a fucking jerk."
"No, no, no, nah."
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order yourself.
-l didn't.
-You insulted him a little.
-l didn't insult nobody.
Give us a drink.
-Okay.
"Come on, let's have some drinks, alright?"
Books?
Butterfly knife?
"Yeah, Dean."
- You okay?
- Sure.
Sammy...
"I mean, look, this is the third school we've been to this year, and it's only November."
I'm just sick of always being the new kid.
You'll be fine.
"If anyone gives you any trouble, you let me know."
Relax.
"Dad said this hunt will take him two weeks, tops."
"As soon as he gets back, we're out of here."
To another school.
Awesome.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please say hello to Sam Winchester."
"Hi, Sam."
"Class, say hello to our new student, Dean Winchester."
"Dean, is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?"
"Not really, sweetheart."
Take your seat.
Is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?
Not really.
Okay.
"Uh, grab a seat."
"Whoa, that's yours?"
Awesome!
"Dean, where are your books?"
"Don't need 'em, sugar."
Not gonna be here long enough anyway.
"All right, gang."
Essay assignment.
!
I'll get you some.
"Do you want plain ones, or ones with our address on it?"
Address on it?
!
How many sheets?
"Well, how many are you going to use?"
Manager!
Just enough for one?
Tell me.
Manager!
Manager!
Yes?
Testing...
testing...
There you are.
I've never met such insolence in my life!
"I come down here to get some lavatory paper, and she starts asking me the most insulting, personal things I've ever heard in my life!"
I thought she wanted writing paper.
"- I'm talking to you, Watt!"
- Watt?
Are you deaf?
I said I'm talking to you.
I've never met such insolence in my life.
She said people use it in the lounge.
"- Yes, she thought..."
- Then she starts asking me...
"- No, please listen..."
- Appalling questions about...
I can explain.
"No, you see, she thought you wanted to write."
Wanted a fight?
Jim.
"Come on, kids."
Time to go now.
BRlCE:
"I'm sorry, Lutie."
I shouldn't have come back.
I've brought everything to life again.
"And the children, Brice, they don't know me."
I'm not sure they even liked me.
They were just waiting for the time to go home.
They don't need me.
They don't need anything from me.
"Listen to me, Lutie, you and I, we could get Brock."
He's ours.
Let Brewton have Sarah Beth.
We could take Brock away.
He belongs with you and me.
We'd get as far away from here as trains could carry us.
"This is our last chance, Lutie."
The last chance for the three of us.
"I can't go away with you, Brice."
"I can't have Brock and I can't have Sarah Beth so I'm gonna go, but I'll go alone."
And you've got nothing for me;
"Not enough, Brice."
Not enough for that.
Come on in.
Doc.
"Glad Mac got you here, Jim."
Haven't been seeing very much of you lately.
-l haven't been looking for you.
-So I noticed.
I used to love you like the son I never had.
"- You know this is my block,"
- right?
"- No, what're you doing?"
- [screaming]
- I give you this space.
I help you set it up.
You want me to open a clinic?
Want Gavros to come back?
The Green Zone scout?
- I can't win.
- Of course you can.
- What's this?
- That's insurance.
[yells]
- [screams]
- Stop it!
"- Shh, sweet boy, let me help."
- [whimpering]
It's a little gift for a good night's work.
Your plan is to take birth control behind your wife's back?
Forget about Elena.
Have some kids.
- Sell some cookies.
- [grunts]
I'm beginning to think it was an inside job.
- [groans]
"- With your permission,"
I'd like to use Everclear on the entire department.
Everything I'm doing is for Elena.
Only one person benefits from all of this.
Elizabeth's son-in-law.
They're gonna use Everclear on me.
"All right, here he is."
"Bull, the Battling Bailiff."
Ta-da.
Well?
What do you think?
"Spiffy, real spiffy."
It's the first time I ever bought off the rack.
"Bull, it's almost time."
"Boy. is this great or is this great, huh, Bull?"
"Center ring, 20,000 screaming fans."
This has to be the greatest night of your life.
Where's Selma?
"Oh, traffic out there is so bad and--"
"She's not coming, is she?"
"No, Bull, she isn't."
"Bruiser, you're on."
-How do you feel?
-Like I'm gonna throw up.
lGAGS]
All the great ones do.
Bull I believe it was the Apostle Paul who said that:
"""Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen."""
"Now, go out there and rip his lips off."
MAC:
"Go get them, Bull."
-You can do it.
Whoo.
Did you see that arena out there?
Twenty thousand drooling maniacs at 12 bucks a head.
-We're going to be rolling in it.
-We?
"Yeah, I dumped that whole condo scam, I put all of my money into Bull."
And he got 'em all!
- You want another one?
- Not another banana joke.
Can I take one of you?
"- So, you pull the thing back?"
"- Oh, it looks nice, yeah."
- Did it click?
- Yeah.
Smile a little.
I don't feel like smiling.
- Focus up there.
You all right?
- I'm getting addicted to this.
"It's gonna be a bit fuzzy, I have a feeling."
- There you go.
"Turn that thing, don't be shy."
- They're art house.
That sun.

I made him confess to the police.
That's all?
"Yeah, that's all."
"In fact, I wasn't even with him when he killed himself."

Only the police know about this.

I had no choice.
I was right.
"You've been bought, haven't you?"
For God's sake!
"Look, it's not what you think, Sia."
This horrible creature you have in front of you is...

Deep undercover in the Turkish drug cartel.
Major Arjun Singhania?
"And he outranks you, so please be nice."
"And now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to my work."
You're a police officer?
Even I hate surprises.
Okay.
"So, what do I call you?"
- I'm seeing Cartoon Head again.
"- Oh, you're not?"
Yeah.
I...
I kept thinking about him.
Wondering what might've happened if we'd stayed together.
What might've happened?

He's a paranoid hit man who knocked you about.
- How many more clues d'you need?
- There's another side to him.
- Is it worse?
- He's like a little boy.

"That is a giant no, Mother."

"Dale, I think you owe me."

"Yeah, yeah, okay, for sure."
"Meemaw has a doctor's appointment tomorrow, there's a reminder on the fridge."
Can you do that for me?
"So, does that mean that you're not mad at me anymore?"

And I had a little look around Janet Cramer's rooms.
Simon!
"Just, you know, to see if I could cut the Gordian knot."
By breaking and entering?
!
"Oh, that's what we do now, is it?"
"Not breaking and entering, more easing and entering."
That's not the point.
"The missing research wasn't there, but this was."
Mary Goodyear's will.
"Don't worry, it's a photocopy."
Cramer won't know.
"That is so far from being my objection to what you've done here, Simon."
There's no mention of research.
That wasn`t funny!
A noise like that could impair the kids` hearing.
It was real!
"It looked real, didn`t it?"
I thought it was real gun.
Didn`t it look real when I fell down?
What?
Didn`t it look real?
What?
"Are you happy now, clark?"
She`s deaf.
What`s the difference?
It was fun anyway.
Let`s have a drink.
"Pardon me, sir?"
Catherine said we just stay on 50.
I was thinking of shooting over to 54 and zipping down to liberal.

The House of Mud.
What`s that?
The largest freestanding mud dwelling ever built!
"The pioneers didn`t have bricks, so they used mud."
"They didn`t use mud, they used sod!"
"Right, Audrey."
"When they ran out of sod, they used mud!"
Let`s skip The House of Mud.
Dodge City was enough for one day.
Catherine and Eddie are expecting us.
It`s living history.
"But, if you`d rather see your cousins it`s okay by me."
"personally, I`d rather see a pile of mud than Eddie."
Knock it off!
It beat colouring books.
"Don't worry, she has a fabulous memory"

"Where I'm concerned, I mean;"

"Honey, it's pretty hard to say."
He just never mentions your name one way or the other.
Thank you.
"All right, Mrs. Smith."
"Doc, they don't know me."
They're very young.
"It's been two years, Lutie."
You can't expect it.
"No, I don't expect it."
I only hoped.

I did not remember what I wanted unfortunately.
- Something is other entirely.

This is the trouble!
The start is very plain though.
"It would be necessary to think of it only, how you did the boxes before me arriving here."
"Ágika cut the cardboards, I folded."
And kind Tót what did he do?
- I got some air.
- Oh see!

"I cut the cardboards alone though now, you though three people you make the folding,"
three against one.

"You saw it, mom?"

Can't you tell me?
It doesn't matter.
"Okay, I'll recite a poem to you."
It will occupy us while you milk.

Right.

Slava Silkis.
He was a very political broadcaster in Leningrad.
"I think they're afraid of taking the risk, so..."
You're not even listening.
I'm listening.
"Slava Silkis, was a very political broadcaster."
"Now I want the lemon, please."
Cut her some lemon.
I'm doing the rice.
"Anyway, Slava Silkis said to tell you he saw the show."
"He hardly understands Hebrew, but enjoyed it immensely."
Let them wait.
Yes.
But I said I was coming.
Bye.
So you spoke with Slava Silkis about the show.
I'm not talking about that anymore.
But you said he saw the show.
- It doesn't matter now.
"Okay, it doesn't matter."
"Goni, the salad."
You have to mix it well after you add the lemon.
It's been mixed enough.
No!
- Goni.

Is someone after Saul?
"Lena, you can trust me."
You wouldn't believe me.
Of course I'll believe you.
- You'll think I'm crazy.
"- Just try me, OK?"
Nazis.
Nazis are after my Saul.
"You see, I told you you wouldn't believe it."
Wait. it's not that. it's just...
- Nazis?
Are you sure?
- Yes.
"I mean, how do you know?"
"Lena, of course I believe you, but... you just don't hear this kind of stuff in Hawaii."
Why would Nazis be after Saul?
Saul was a member of something called the Masada Team.
- Saul was an Israeli agent?
"- Tom, you know of the Masada Team?"
Yeah. it's a secret Israeli unit that locates and captures war criminals.
They got Eichmann and only they know how many others.
- I was in naval intelligence.
"- Oh, yes."
I forgot.
"If the Nazis were gonna murder Saul, why would they bother..."
- I'm sorry.
"- No, no."

Are you trying to get publicity for your compound?
Is that why you scared Sally away?
Forget about them.
How do we get Sally back?
It's very simple.
"So it's either B-ball with tall, dark and uptight here, or nothing."
- I got all the time.
- What do you get if we lose?
I get the pleasure of beating a cop's ass in front of the whole yard.
"Oh, yeah, play basketball, it's not like we have a killer to catch."
The clock's ticking.
He's our best lead.
"All right, game's to 21."
- Ten.
Man's in a hurry.
"Okay, since, uh, you're a guest in my house, you take it in."
I got a tip.
"So you know, the other guy putting the ball in the hoop is bad."
"Danno, shut up."
"Please, don't call me Danno, huh?"
"- Yo, How long you two been married?"
"- Come on, play ball."
"Okay, all right."
Time out.
Time out.
"All right, time."
"Ahem, you, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"- No, I've played once or twice."
- Yeah?
I could see that.
"It looked like I was watching LeBron, maybe he's just this much better:"
"- Football was my sport, okay?"
- Now you tell me that?
- Ready to quit?
- Yes.
- No.
- Which one is it?
I can do that?
Why not?
I'm Executive Producer.
"Yes, you are."
[funk music playing]
Mmm.
"Oh, yeah!"
"So I said to him, I said, uh, ""So what's your angle?"""
"Talking 'bout, ""Why I gotta have an angle?"""

"You paid for my entire haul of liquor, plus money owed."
"Cards on the table, Barton, I'm not that good a fuck."
Not according to your current business model.
What do you want?
"I want what you need, a business partner."
Hm.
"I saw this, uh, nature documentary."
It's about buzzards.
They can smell their next meal from a mile a way.
- Hm.
- A mile.
"But from ""Niggerville"" all the way up to Sunset Boulevard?"
[laughs]
"If you don't want to add being poor to that, don't provoke me!"
I'm very sensitive.
"In Yoon Jae's hospital, wearing Yoon Jae's clothes, and laying down on Yoon Jae's bed..."
You really seem like Yoon Jae.
-Well...
Ummm.
-Don't say anything.
Give me your hand.
"I knew it, it's not warm."
Your temperature is different.
Since you're not Yoon Jae...
You're not as warm as Yoon Jae.
That's a relief.
Since I want to be cool.
Let's go now.
I...
I...
I... grabbed his hand!
What?
In the water...
I thought I was going to die...
But Seo Yoon Jae reached out his hand towards me.
If I were to live...
I thought I should go towards him...
So I grabbed onto his hand.
I wonder...
If that's why I came in this body?
If the switch happened because you and Yoon Jae grabbed hands...
"Do you think if you held hands again, you two will switch back?"
What if he doesn't wake up?
I'm sure he'll wake up!
Hurry up and grab it.
Addons
- They divert attention.
- No one cares about it.
Nothing is kept in mind.
Asshole.
No one will know of this incident.
"Addons Eli and me again, Jo."
This has created Addons The best video game.
"Addons Of course, all about my identity, will be removed."

It's okay?
Addons I'm afraid not.
Addons That's very nice and interesting.

Addons like you.
Addons I am very busy.
"Addons Busy, with wild animals."

"With a father like you, it's no wonder."
Addons 6 minutes into the deadly crash.
"Addons Goodbye, Jo."
Sure.
"Uh, I can't."
I'm actually going to a book signing with Ezra.

I thought you hated Addams.
I liked his early stuff.
- Rain check?
"- Yeah, rain check."
Toby?
Can I talk to you a second?
I can't talk.
Something's up with the DA.
The lawyer's driving me over to Dad's office.
"Tell me, was that supposed to be a joke?"
Were you trying to get back at me?
- Lf you were...
- I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about what I found in my book.
- The braille you wanted me to have.
- That was no joke.
Bad?
"The message was ""bad."" What does that mean?"
Am I supposed to buy a Michael Jackson album?
You're reading it wrong.
I can't do this now.
Come back Saturday in the morning.
Jenna's out at her flute lesson.
I think you're taking a big chance with this guy.
"Okay, I am a very good judge of character."
Is that why you fixed Aria up with Noel Kahn?
Noel Kahn had everyone fooled.
It trusts me.
But you're going to put it in a cage.
It's cold.

"You fight dirty, Harper."
"So do you, sir."

Good morning.
"Morning, Lieutenant."
"Morning, Miss."
Hope you slept well.
I slept safely.
Thank you.
"Now, there's a woman worth fighting dirty for, sir."

I smell French cavalry.
Horse sweat and saddle rot.

"So, just for fun, what would happen if I wasn't here on Monday?"
EMERSON:
Has there been a horrible train accident?
No.
Train's here. I'm just not on it.
It wouldn't be fun.
"Come on, what would happen?"
I'd have to make a phone call.
You'd have to make a phone call?
I would make a phone call.
-No fun.
-Company man.

Hi.
-How you doing?
-Good.

"When I didn't get off the train right away, you looked like you were about to have a heart attack."
-How was your weekend?
-Good.
"I had a great weekend, thanks for asking."
So you got that text?
Confirming the...
What I already knew.
"Yeah, I got it."
Did you get mine?
"I was trying to make a joke about the White House Correspondents' dinner, but my phone spell-checked it into whorehouse correspondents' dinner."
"Come, we're going in."
There.
"So, please come."
Come along.
Good girl!
Always keep this finger straight.
"At most like this, always away."
Why?
To avoid the trigger.
People always have their finger on it.
It goes off and someone's dead.
There was just another incident in the army.
Some guy shot another in the neck.
"""Weapon malfunction,"" it says in the paper."
Malfunction?
He had his finger there and pressed.
And it fired.
"All shooters, 99% of them."
Hunters too.
always have their finger in there.
It happens so fast.
Your finger's the no. 1 danger.
"He picks up his gun, finger in there, and it goes off."
"You take it like this, with your finger out."
The animals hanging behind me...
This one here's an oryx.

"When he got home, she was waiting."
"Boy, you never heard nothing like that."
"What's the matter, honey?"

This is EIysian fields.

"I'm looking for my sister, stella DuBois."
"I mean, Mrs. stanley KowaIski."
"Yeah, that's the party, all right."
"You just did miss her, though."
Yes?
-Can this be her home?
-She got the downstairs here.
I got the up.
"Oh, she's out?"
You notice that bowling alley up the street?
-I'm not sure I did.
"-well, that's where she's at, honey."
She's watching her husband bowl.
BIanche!
"BIanche, honey!"
It's the same shirt.
That was Haskell DeBray.
He was already dead.
Who was?
Don't let Serena out of your sight.
Hey.
Look up.
- What?
- Look up.
What are you doing here?
Brother wasn't the shooter.
That was a decoy.
The brother was somewhere else.
It's worse than that.
DeBray was killed five days before
"Serena disappeared the first time, in a hitandrun."
I saw the footage.
"It was him, Nico."
DeBray isn't the one who's going to kill my baby.
The real killer is still out there.
It's not over.
"You can just get into traffic cameras, just like that?"
- Public access to public security.
- Mmhmm.
That was the guy we're tracking?
"- Yeah, backwards, from the police station."
- Okay.
Shooting happened a couple minutes before 12:00.
Go for something on...
Broadway and Van Ness.
Hey.
"Mimi's vitals are Aokay, getting Aokay'er."
Let's get some vacation time telling them you need to rest since the accident.
"That's that, but what about the wedding?"
Do I have to do that too?
!
I'm sure he'll be back by then!
He will!
"Even if not, I have no intention of doing that."
Should we do a little cleaning while we wait for Se Young?
"I've washed Yoon Jae's body for him, now I have to do that to his house too?"
Forget it.
"When you see Se Young, greet her with manners."
Don't stare at her with lusty eyes.
I'll look at her with innocent eyes.
Where is the vacuum...
Here it is...
It's heavy.
I guess the bag isn't empty.
Yoon Jae's packed his suitcase...?
I wonder where he was planning on going?
He's never mentioned anything...
Where was Yoon Jae planning on going without me?
Yoon Jae...!
Hi.
I've been so worried!
"If something like that happened, I should've been the first to know!"
Hey!
What are you doing?
!
Yoon Jae...
I love you.
Yoon Jae...!
"Seo Yoon Jae, you son of a bitch..."
I need to talk to you.
It's important.
"So, I got offered a job, a couple days ago in Houston."
And I've been giving it a lot of thought.
And I'm gonna take it.
You remember how much we all wanted to get out of here when we were kids?
ANd you guys always had Galveston.
So Wes' lawyer told me that you missed counseling.
So what she's advising me about is....
In Wes' best interest.
That he come with me to Houston.
Get out' my house.
Get out!
Get out!
"Wait, Hollis."
"Jacob's gonna end up in Juvie and you know it, and then what?"
Wes too?
"Next time you come back over here, you'll be bringing him home."
I just want what's best for him.
Travis left 'cause you didn't want kids.
"You never wanted kids, Pam."
Why the hell 'you tryin'a take mine?

"""Hi you reached Pam -and Wes- leave us a message"""
"Hey Wes, this is Jacob."
Just call me back okay?
[Roaring engines]
Look at this jackass.
"And, like, after he hurt his knee, he won all 24 again?"
- Yeah.
"- He's like an American hero, you know?"
"I mean, who doesn't respect that guy?"
- Wes...
Bookstore's closing soon.
- I got to go.
- Wes?
- What?
"- I'm gonna make it right, okay?"
- Okay.
- Who's that?
- Jacob.
"- All right, kid, come on."
"- You know, Ricky just has the drive to win."
He wasn't afraid of the work.
He always trained harder than anyone else.
- He's a role model to young ones.
"He shows them that, you know, you get out of life whatever you put into it."
"- I mean, ten titles in a motocross class... that's crazy."
"- Every time he goes out there, he's thinking about nothing else but crossing that finish line first, and he does."
- The big difference between Ricky and all...
"- Yeah, Jacob!"
- Awesome!
"- Whoa, nice little jump."
- Yeah.
- Whoo.
"- Dude, this is gonna be awesome."
"- Hell, yeah."

- Here he goes.
- Yeah!
"Gambling is illegal, to be sure but the city is aware of it and approves."
"My house encourages tourists, pays large tax es...."
Coming out of it was like after being tapped on the button.
"Everything foggy, an anchor on my head and ringing in my ears."
"Rip, this is Coral, Dusty."
What happened?
I don't know.
Don't you know?
I just woke up in my garage.
That's a great place to wake up.
Mr. Martinelli is a fine....
Remind me to put him to sleep sometime.
My head's splitting.
Look in your bag.
See if you've got your money.
Just a minute.
- Murder.
- What'd you say?
I said murder. I just sat up.
"- The money's all here, Rip."
- lt is?
Then I can't understand why he slugged us both.
"- What's your phone number, Dusty?"
- Surf 3181.
I'll call you back.
I've got company.
It was Louis.
His neck was broken.
My brain began to unscramble.
"Louis, Johnny's letter."
That was the joker.
Then Martinelli was tied to Johnny's death.
Great.
I've got your assignments.
"Briefing room, five minutes."
Is everything okay with Kayla?
When was the last time you saw your roommate?
- Last night around 6:00.
- She didn't come home all night?
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.
Any idea where she might have gone?
There's two million single men in L.A. Take your pick.
"We found her car in the garage, but not her purse or keys."
Is there someone close?
Somewhere she might have walked to?
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?
We have every reason to believe that she's still alive.
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch... but our rent's due next week.
- Vic.
I got great news.
- What?
Just be glad you hired me and not the brain-dead idiot your wife did.
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?
"Corrine's P.I., they're making nonsecure calls from his cell phone."
I caught one.
Found where she's at.
- Beauty.
You got the address?
"- Yeah, sure."
"- Oh, geez."
- Corrine...
"She looked at me, but didn't see me."
"- But, tonight..."
- Tonight?
"Hey, I buy her!"
- What's going on?
- What do you think?
"Passports, tickets, cha cha cha!"
Duvigny.

"I just started my shift, detective."
We're just chatting with a friend from Budapest.
"We're in first class, coach 15."
Hungarian.
Thank you.
Can you show me your luggage?
"of course, enthusiastically sir!"
To be enthusiastic means to be inhabited by God!
Brilliant.
Hey...
"If cops freak you out, how will you ever make it with women?"
Brothers with different names...
and I'm not a friend from Buda.
"Hey, Dumbo!"
Look!
Isn't it grand?
"You will meet her, you will see her, but you will never believe what you see!"
Isn't Paris more rich than your Buda-shit?
- Nobody picking you up?
"Yeah, I do, too, but don't cling to it."
It'll make you lazy and angry.
- Your work will suffer.
- I'll keep that in mind.
And I don't believe you need to exacerbate these instincts in yourself more than you already do.
You got it.

I thought so.

Hello?
Are you that kid?
"You're the caretaker, Melanie?"
Dad mentioned you might be here.
"So, this comes as no surprise."
"Not to me, no."
"""Dad""?"
Beautiful sunset.
- Productive day?
- Not particularly.
I'm glad that he's replaced himself with a younger surrogate to handle the forlorn moping.
I'm glad it pleases you.
He'll be back in a few days.

"Truth or Dare, Mr. Gimp?"
"Truth, probably."

"So, Felix... tell me... if you had a golden ticket... and you could pick any girl... or any guy... to take upstairs for a very quick, no strings attached, no questions asked shag... who would it be?"
"In fact, here... it is."
"Your ""free shag"" ticket."
"Who's the lucky girl, Felix?"
"Who is it, Felix?"
"Who's the lucky girl, Felix?"
I'm sorry.
"I want to play, I want to play, come on."
"Come on, let's play, Truth or Dare, bitch?"
You and me.
"Put your knob away, Chris, we're just mucking about."
- Truth.
Do I look like a muck to you?
- No.
- So why're you pissing on my patch?
- I was just...
"- Ahem, I was just playing..."
"- ""I was just-just..."""
- just playing the game.
"- Oh, just playing..."
"- You fancy your chances, do you?"
- No.
No?
"Well, we better find out what's on offer, then."
- I think Gem should know.
I was thinking...
I only smoke when I'm with you... wonder why.
I can't thank you enough...
for the other day... for tonight.
You're such an inspiration.
The way you've changed.
"""Evolved"", I guess, is a..."
"better word, into this beautiful... smart... very sexy..."
I think I must have loved you all along...
I just... didn't know it.
What an idiot.
Ha...
"Hannah, this is... this is ridiculous."
"Gregory, I really can't talk now."
"She can't not talk to me forever, I..."
I've got...
"Gregory,whatareyou doing?"
There're certain things I have to explain to her.
"I think it's a little late for that, Gregory, don't you think?"
What!
?
"I said, ""I think it's a little late for that, Gregory""."
"No, I don't think so."
What Rose and I have goes far beyond what normal people...
What's all that noise?
"What are you trying to say, Gregory?"
"Gregory, what is going on?"
Could you just...
Gregory!
Hannah!
What!
?
"302, 00:23:34,330 -- 00:23:35,286 Okay."
You guys need anything ?
"No, we're good."
So how long have you two been friends?
"306, 00:24:06,820 -- 00:24:10,689 I'm not suppose really to talk to you any more, so ..."
Oh wait !
I think you got a phone message.
But that's all I'm saying.
Now I got to zip.
You have one new message.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
"313, 00:24:43,023 -- 00:24:45,515 I don't..."
I threw out the flowers.
"314, 00:24:45,734 -- 00:24:47,942 You can't fix it!"
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone ...
Um... me and Vi have been friends for a pretty long time...
Maybe three years.
What?
You asked how long we have been friends a minute ago.
Oh yes .
Right.
We met in the hospital.
In a hospital ?
Yea.
"326, 00:25:36,910 -- 00:25:40,620 It was that dull hospital over at Lexington."
Know it?
No.

"No, Tommy."
- You smell gorgeous.
- I said no.
You know you love it.

"It doesn't work anymore, Tom."

Why me?
- 'Cause you're different.
- OK.

You're welcome.
I am so glad you arrived.
You spoke so strangely on the phone.
--I must inform you in advance...
--No need.
"See, Sasha speaks of you in not so flattering terms."
"Oh, yes."
Of course.
How could I forget!
You looked very handsome that night.
And I remember thinking: wow... my new stepmother's about 10 minutes older than me!
"Whatever's going on, whatever trouble he's left us with,"
I'm here.
Is it that obvious?
"You're not alone, you know."
It's all so confusing.
You smell like him.
I feel like him.
"No, Adam!"
"Well, hello!"
Hi!
"Sophie, you came!"
Yeah.
"Sophia, if you see your brothers, send them my way."
"Yes, Mother."
So nice to see you.

Yeah.

"Melvin, why were you contradicting Mr. Truesdale?"
"Well, it seems like the girl meant a lot more to his son than he wanted to let on."
The man was embarrassed.
Of what?
Of Greg's weak stomach.
"Melvin, if it wasn't for Mr. Truesdale, you wouldn't be coroner."
I'd remember that.
[ Woman ] That was her mother's.
It's the only thing she had left of her family.

Her father in North Africa... and her mother and her brothers in the firebombing of Dresden.
"Oh, Hillie."
Why?
After surviving all of that?
Why?
She was my friend.
I should have known.
I should have... stopped her.
Friends always feel that way when someone close to them dies.
Those are Hillie's.
I have to get them cleaned.
"No, no."
It's okay.
"No, I have to."

Clara is right.
Mum's used to speak badly of you.
But I always defend you.
Don't do it.
It's useless.
-But it upsets me.
"If I'd say bad things about mom, would you defend her as well?"
I've never heard you dissing her.
Well I can do it.
Mom is so selfish.
She just wants everybody saying good things to her.
Everybody like that.
"Yeah, but maybe there's someone thinking different."
Clara demands everything and she's right.
Mom says you're a looser.
To whom?
I heard.
She said that so you'd listen to it.
-No.
But I'm sure she knew I was listening.
With whom were she talking to?
Could you guess?
I met a woman once...
-Aren't you interested in what mom said anymore?
"Once, I met a woman who told me to write down 7 numbers."
-And she told you each number slowly without failing.
And all the numbers were odds.
"Well then, with whom were she talking to?"
To Juan.

So...you were...

"We were having an affair -- for years, actually."
"I don't mean to be rude, uh..."
But how is it that Wayne McNut is your type?
"I mean, you're married to a man who's barely a buck -- wet."
What can I say?
Sometimes it's nice to feel a little give.
Oh.
"Yeah, I get that -- a little extra cushion for the, uh..."
Help me understand something.
"If you loved Wayne, why did you put a curse on him?"
It wasn't a curse.
Putsi bags are also used for blessings.
I wanted Wayne to win.

"So you're thinking that it's more, um, physiological rather than psychological?"
"Yeah, but I went through everything."
"Uh, I was here all night, went through everything."
"Head C.T., tox screen..."
"Yeah, they're both negative, and the psych eval isn't conclusive."
Did you notice if her pupils were dilated when she got angry?
"Yeah, yeah."
It was like...

"Or you've seemed sad lately, and I c... it's none of my business, but..."

You finally can see that she didn't do it?
Hilla and I are both orphans.
We gotta stick together.
Now-
- Let's see-- Let's see if Ziggy's got anything new here.
"- He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith."
"- Let him out, I said."
- What's his name?
- We call him Buck.
"I don't like to take the responsibility, Mr. Smith."
That's why you'll never amount to much.
What are you asking for him?
"Uh, 250 bucks."
Sold.
Let him out.
"So your name's Buck, eh?"
"You're tough, huh?"
"Hey, wait a minute."
That dog cost me a lot of money.
"- I pay for my pleasure, Mr. Groggins."
- Wait a minute.
"I'm his syndicate, 25 percent off the top."
-Does he know that?
"-No, Delman and I made a deal."
"Look, what the hairless wonder doesn't know can't hurt me."
-You wanna look at the carnage?
-Yeah.
"-No, I am not going out there again."
-You can watch it right here on TV.
What?
"Great, great."
Keep an eye on my investment without having to sit with the riffraff.
Ha. ha.

Nice to see you.
"Adam, nice to meet you."
All right.
"I'm here to get you home safe, my friend."
[ Laughs ] Good.
Good.

Thank you very much.
Which way's your car?
My car is right over there.
"Oh, the poor thing."
We'll have you feeling better in no time.

"Well, you must have at least heard about this girl."
- No'
- Gertrude says--
When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?
"- I mean, really."
"- Madam, please--"
This girl shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea ofa princess.
"If Eric's looking for a girl, I know a couple of... highly available ones right here."
"Oh, Eric, be reasonable."
"Nice young ladiesjust don't swim around rescuing people... in the middle ofthe ocean, and then flitter off into oblivion like some--"

"- This better be good, Conner."
- I have a heart failure patient.
"- You've seen my face, right?"
- I'm sorry?
Beauty rest.
"It's the only shot I got, Conner."
She had a loss and she...
She just collapsed.
"Short of breath, complaining of pain in her chest."
"STAT echocardiogram suggests acute heart failure, ejection fraction is 20 per cent."
"Oh, and I got your email about Dallas."
"- They sucked you in, did they?"
- Looks like it.
"- This patient, she's..."
"- Yeah, look:"
"you and Peter Cutler, you're doomed, Conner."
And then where will you be?
"You'll be in Dallas, surrounded by strange,"
Dallas-like people who don't understand you.
"Sir, the patient is an EMT and her wife died"
- and now I think she's had a heart attack.
- An EMT?
- Nicole Foster.
- Book an angiogram.
I'll be right there.
"Mel, we need to talk."
Are we OK?
"Actually, I'm not so sure."
It's Dad's receipt books.
You found Dad's stinginess collection.
I thought Morn threw out that crap.
Aren't you starving?
Are you telling me he wrote down all his expenses?
It's from when he used to wake us up with a whistle.

I'm glad you've calmed down.
You had me worried with your freak-out-.
What?
You look nice in those undies.
Surprising.
Did you think I sleep in a suit?
You have a cute ass.
- God help you with that sinful talk...
- Why sinful?
Maybe we don't have the same father?
"Who knows, maybe we have a different mother."
Maybe you came out of thin air like Jesus.
"But if I had to choose, I prefer you."
"You're sexier than him, too bad you're gay."

I teach school.
School teacher?
What was it like out in Indian territory?
Lonely as hell.
- What did you do out in the West?
- Cowboy.
What do you do for Mr. Coble?
Cowboy.
"Joe, I think we've found our man."
Not anything in Brown's Hole I couldn't take care of.
"Well, I think Horn's reputation... might be as effective as his Winchester is here."
I have quite a good reputation myself.
It always seems to precede me.
"I know that, Joe, but... your political ambitions are gonna fit right in with our future plans."
"Now, we don't wanna forget that, do we?"
"And, besides... there won't be no chocolate cake for Horn up there at Brown's Hole."
- Where are you from originally?
- Hawaii.
Hawaii?
"Yeah, Hawaii."
Did you live in one of those grass huts?
In a hotel.

There is nothing I can do.
She left all her stuff behind.

- Ah whatever.
She's right.
I'm not good enough for her.
- Suddenly.
- Yes.

"- Let's go make our vision real, dude."
"- Yeah, no, my vision."
"- Yeah, I know, but we're sharing it."
"- Yeah, no."
We're not.
"Get out of here, man."
"Do you even know what friendship is, dude?"
"Does it have anything to do with taking all my money, my drugs, and apparently trying to share my girlfriend?"
- She's not your girlfriend.
- Go.
Get out of here.
"- Go, go."
Get out of here!
"- 'Til next time, Conner."
You need help.
Hey.
"Griff, get out of here!"
Griff!
"- Griff, what..."
"- Natasha, listen to me."
One of the greatest regrets of my life is that you and I...
- No!
"- Natasha, I have so much to tell you."
"- Griff, my boyfriend's upstairs."
- So leave him up there.
- You're high!
- I have important news.
I am no longer clean.
- Listen to me...
"- Griff, I haven't used in months."
You're taking out the recycling in the middle of the night in your pyjamas.
"I mean, what happened?"
I left my pancakes at the buffet.
"Well, have some of mine."
"Oh, thank..."
Mmm.
Thank you.
"Can I have a bite, Daddy?"
"Do you want some more, Princess?"
"- No, I'm good."
"- No, thank you."
Oh.
I think he was talking to me.
"Actually, he's called me Princess since I was a baby."
My dad called me Frizz.
"- Hey, Mom."
"- Hi, sweetie."
"Uh, can I go show my art project to Papa Jeff?"
"Ritchie, don't call him that."
It makes your mom feel preposterous.
"No, it doesn't."
I'm completely fine.
"Yes, Ritchie, go show your project to Pa..."
Papa Jeff.
"Okay, Ritchie, but we better stop by the nurse's office and have your hearing checked."
I think you got something in your ear... oh!
Awesome!
Did you...?
What is it about grandpas that they can always find change in kids' ears?
"I know you're really enjoying yourself, Richard, but I just want you to know, it doesn't bother me at all."
- It doesn't?
- No.

I said it doesn't bother me.

"It's empty, right?"
"Yes, empty... just one bullet."
"Stop, stop!"
What if somebody had gotten shot?

"Thanks for the scrap, Floyd."
Sorry I can't pay you more.
"But it, it's got this,"

- I told you what.
"- Oh, yeah."

Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.
Yeah.
They're sending someone to take care of the whole thing.
"Jeez, Earl."
You really are crazy.
"I mean, who in the hell would the government send?"
"Kent Mansley, United States Government, Unexplained Phenomena Department."
- Marv Loach.
I'm the foreman here.
- What happened here?
Not sure.
"Sometimes the line'll snap if the weather is bad, sure."
"But for a whole tower to get twisted up like that, whoa!"
It's got me beat.
It's almost like it was bitten off by some enormous beast.

"Uh, what department is that again?"
Monica Howard.
You're the first one who's given me a full name.
"Well, the 12 steps are anonymous and talking to the police is not part of the program."
"Yeah, right, right."
"So, uh..."
How well did you know Skip Holling?
I was his sponsor.
"He was, um..."
a really nice guy.
"You know, he was doing really well with his recovery."
"Did he have any, uh... friends, enemies, any relationships?"
Probably all three.
"You know, I don't think I'm much help."
"We just talked about booze, that's it."
Right.
"Thanks, thanks, uh..."
If I have any more questions?
"Yeah, you can--you can reach me here, Detective..."
"Schanke, Don Schanke."

"All right, you then."
"- Uh, Wendy?"
"- Hi, Stan."
"Look, I just want you to know."
"If you want to, you know, be with that Briden kid, then you should."
What?
"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
"- Stan, that's ridiculous."
- It is?
I would never leave you for Briden.
- Really?
"- No way, that'd be stupid."
I wouldn't have chance with Briden he could have any girl he wants.
"There you go, feel better, p-p-pal?"
What am I supposed to do?
I can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.
"I mean, Wendy says she'll never leave me for him."
But what if she just doesnt wanna hurt my feelings.
"She said he could get any girl he wants and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl."
This is all so crazy.
"I mean, really, how could my day get any worse?"
No-no.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
"No, fuck off, I'm not doing it."
"Oh, geez, you're no fun."

I'm the manager!
- What?
- I'm the manager!
"Yes, I know."
You've just told me.
What's the matter with you?
"Now, listen to me."
I booked a room with a bath.
"When I book a room with a bath, I expect to get a bath."
You've got a bath.
"I'm not paying £7.20p per night, plus V.A.T., for a room without a bath!"
Here is your bath.
You call that a bath?
It's not big enough to drown a mouse.
It's disgraceful!
I wish you were a mouse.
I'd show you.
And another thing.
I asked for a room with a view.
"Deaf, mad, and blind."
"This is the view as far as I can remember, madam."
"Yes, yes, this is it."
"When I pay for a view,"
I expect something more interesting than that.
"That is Torquay, madam."
That is not good enough.
"Well, may I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window?"
"Sydney Opera House, perhaps?"
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon?
Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically...
Don't be silly.

"Yeah, it's also a wand."
With a hologram?
Nice!
"Hey, do you see this?"
"I'm in the matrix, Leonard;"
I see everything.
You got to be kidding me.
You friended Stuart on Facebook?
I thought you didn't like Facebook anymore.
Don't be silly.
I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Please.
You're looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
Really?

You're so full of it.
You are free to believe whatever you like.

-They have me in captivity.
And Robert... they killed Chayton.
There was nothing I could do.
I'm inside the base.

I think they're crap.
Why do you Iike One Direction?
They're perfect.

I don't know why you even like One Direction!
They're crap!

"[Carlos] Yeah, a man like you understands."
"Oh, you understand that this santa sangre could keep culebras from preying on innocents."
You understand what that means?
"Less exposure for us, and more peace for you."
I'm starting to think peace is overrated.

I still don't feel right about this.
"You will, once you have the plans."
"Okay, remember, you just need to distract him while I switch out the cases."
I've got it.
"Okay, Richard?"
Relax.
[Eddie] So what is all this?

I say go for Geography.

So what do we do?
Do we confront her?
"Oh God, no."
"Geez, I don't want to know if it's true."
What sort of attitude are we supposed to have?
Are we suppose to have an attitude?
I already have an attitude.
But it may be my mother's attitude.
I don't want to get hysterical about this.
Why shouldn't I be hysterical?
She's fifteen. I should be hysterical.
"Danlelle, lf you have on my sweats I'm going to kill you,"
Do you understand me?
- Can I taste whatever it is?
- Sure.
"- Cilantro, I love that."
- Very good.
I thought with the tomato it would sharpen it a bit-- l think it's great.

Honey?
Who's Jordan?
No one.
- You mean Jordan Catalano?
- ls that his last name?
I don't know.
You brought it up.
I met Rayanne's mom tonight...
"and she was all excited about your new boyfriend, Jordan."
Boyfriend?
That's a laugh.
"Honey, our friend is asking for our help."
"She's 20 years old, for God's sake."
"She's probably with a bunch of dudes, like, sweating, drinking and dancing it out of her system."
What's the problem?
Let her spend the night on Hump Island!
"I promise, she's gonna come back here first thing in the morning!"
"Dave, firstly..."
I don't want her to spend a night on Hump Island.
"No, I..."
I'm just trying to say it's not like she's kidnapped or something.
"Now she's dead, Dave?"
Huh?
Now she's dead?
"She's dead, now?"
She's not dead.
She's dead on Hump Island!
I'm just trying to put it in perspective for you!
You know what?
"I don't even know why I'm blowing up at you, because it..."
It's...

This is a Shane thing.
I've been dealing with this all my life.

"We're gonna find her, okay?"
I got a plan.
I know how to get there.
You do?
"Yeah, I do."
"I just can't tell you now ""cause we got Mr. Belvedere clocking us."
Now everybody take it real casual.
Just drink your drinks and smile.
"When it comes to eating, you're always first."

You even have to try the mussels 'mpepata.

We've mixed you up.

"It's not hard to talk like us, just take off the Iast vowel."

"- Sofa becomes ""so-f""."
- Then it's easy.
"plate becomes ""pIa-t"", this would be ""for-k"","
"""kni-f""."
"- male, ""ma-I""."
- You wiped us out!
But these letters don't get lost.
- We neverthrow anything out.
- We recycle.
A simple vowel becomes a word.
"An ""E"" becomes affirmative."
"An ""O"" is a warning."
A guy says...
"An ""I"" means go away."
"And a ""U""?"
"The ""U"" and ""A"" are together, it's amazement."

You strike it lucky?

I traded him a Montagnard crossbow a number one address on Chu Do Street and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals.
And where did you get a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals?
I made them.
I work hard.
I've gone to church.
I was a Boy Scout.
I was an Eagle Scout!
He's funny!
How did you get in here?
Where do you sleep?
Where's...?
Anywhere.
"All right, come here."
JAMISON:
Colonel Kirby?
KIRBY:
Affirmative!
"Lt. Jamison, 91 st Navy Seabee detachment out of Cho Min."
This is Captain MacDaniel.
"We'd have come sooner, but the Marines wanted a strip up north."
"It's going to get a little hairy around here, Lieutenant so we're glad to see you, late or not."
The rest of my outfit will be coming with the heavy equipment.
They set it down right where the work is.
"- How's that, sir?"
- Could you move that jungle back for us?
"Just say the word, and I'll move it to China."
We don't need that much.
Just a clear killing zone.
"- Will do, sir."
- Watson!
Arrange pads.
How many men?
Call 911!
911!
Mary was so right about you Ben!
What's going on?
"Ben's been telling me the funniest story, about the bus, and the girl, and the.."
Call 911!
You've heard this one before!
"I'm telling you, Ben's heart stopping temporarily was the best thing that ever happened to me."
"He's getting some much-needed bed rest, and I'm emceeing the fundraiser tomorrow night."
How did you manage that?
I promised Dr. Albright I'd stick to Ben's script.
Are you gonna?
- No.
"All right, next up on open- mike night, very funny man, put your hands together for Dick Solomon."
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thanks a lot!
Thank you so much!
"Now,"
I'm gonna tell you some jokes.
Joke one:
I went fishing last week.
My permit said I could only catch five.
"Oh, I caught five, all right, as in 35."
Was that funny?
"- No, no, no, no, no, no."
But you know..
"pot-stickers, what are they all about?"
Haa-haa!
"Okay, joke number two:"
Some termites..
"I mean, huge termites.."
"Ah, lookie here."
Dr. Dapper in the men's room with the carbon fiber knife.
Happy Thanksgiving.
"How we doing, McGee?"
"Good, boss."
Bishop and Jake made their flight.
And I actually got a text from Tony.
"Apparently, Senior... missed his flight from London and neglected to tell him."
So Tony didn't have to be there?
Nope.
But he's gonna go back tomorrow.
Senior-- he never disappoints.
"And as for our giving thanks, would anyone care to join me for a celebratory cocktail?"
"On me, of course."
"Oh, then I'm in."
"Me, too."
Me three!
Me three!
Gibbs?
"No, wait."
Before that...
I have a better idea.
Snow angels.
I'll give you one.

"That's good advice for life, too."
"So, Professor Mosby, is this Maggie someone special?"
No.
I...
"She's just this girl I've been into for a really long time, and, well, tonight could be the one chance I have to go out with her, so..."
- Is she a hottie?
"- Yes, Jamie."
She's very attractive.
And if we can just end class right now...
- Betty?
"- Maggie may finally be available, but what about you, Professor Mosby?"
Are you ready for a serious relationship?
Totally.
"I mean, I think so."
Maybe.
I don't know.
What do you guys think?
"- Oh, my gosh."
I totally forgot about this.

I'd like to bring your attention... to the next item on our menu.
Fish cooked in mayonaisse.
We owe Coronel Eliot our gratitude for this repast... and the good Colonel tells us that this dish is called...
Siren.
"- Do you know it, Captain?"
"- Yes, I know it very well."
"Siren, the mermaid of Naples."
Extremely rare.
But I've seen it several times...
- Where?
- At the aquarium.
"You can't be referring to Siren, the seductress in Homer's Odyssey."
Wretches.
It's just an ordinary fish.
Mermaids don't exist.
"My god, it's a baby!"
A cooked baby!
We have to bury it!
Cover her up!

"I swear, it's an edible fish, General."
"It's a fish, Mr. General..."

- Fantasy of the Opera?
The Magic Flute?
- No.
The charity ball.
You promised you'd go.
- That's tonight?
- Yeah.
The tickets cost my company 300 bucks.
"- Here's your costume, Don Giovanni."
"- No, no, no...."
- That's tights.
I'll just wear a tux.
- No.
Pick me up at 7.
That'll give you an hour to change.
"Yeah, well...."
- What are you going as?
- Carmen.
- Don't be late.
- Yeah.
I think you're gonna need this.

"It's our 25th episode, and to celebrate, they've given me control of the show."
"Now, okay, admittedly, started out with a bang with the crash, but now you're driving around San Francisco on a pink scooter."
What's up with that?
"It's not a pink scooter, and what could be better?"
You get to drive around in these amazing cars and get paid for it.
Amazing cars?
You're in a beetle.
At least Adam got to drive a Bentley.

Have you ever heard your name in that Muraaki's heart?
"Muraakis only have courage, they don't have a heart."
Jilaan is a Muraaki.
He has as many wives as the wars he has won.
He must have done this hundreds of times.
He must be having hundred more Saibas.
- I have only one.
- Jilaan loves only me.
Is Saiba happy?
Then I shall learn to live.

"All right, but I know what I'm talking about."

Don't you hate it when you leave one black sock at one fiancee's house and the other one at the other's house?
One pair of blue jeans.
And one blacmesh t-shirt.
Do women really like these?
Depends on who's wearing it.
- So if I... - no.
Not much to go on.
Only one place left to check.
Tony just put his hand in ather man's pocket and it made him very happy.
I found a pre-paid calling card.

No engagement rings?
"You want those,too?"
I'll go to siri's and get the ring and any other gifts finn might've given her.
"Mcgee,you've got rebecca."
How uid they have been so clueless?
"Well,he's dead,so maybe they weren'T."
"I think treating her like a person, the kid's in love."
"You know, maybe she's in love with the possibility of something solid."
"I'm what she aspires to, a role model or something."

"Yeah. I hear you, lieutenant."

A query.

Has Katy mentioned anything about me not talking to her?
- Can confirm.
- Major league.
- It's working.
- What's working?
"By not talking to her, she will form the conclusion that I'm upset with her and eventually ask me why."
"Why you so butt-hurt, Stewart?"
"- Well, she acts like..."
- Just kidding.
I don't give a fuck.

Wait.
"So, you're upsets with her, and you wanna communicate that by not communicatings?"

This is textbook racial profiling... and I'd be more than happy to call the ACLU or the government--

My Adela said it was good luck.
I have something to show you.
Did you notice anything strange before she left?
- My granddaughter was very sad when Quini left her.
- Quini?
"Quini, from Villa-Franco."
The good-looking one.
She didn't say where she was going?
To find work.
She said she'd come back for us after.
These books are hers.
She was going to night school to get her diploma.
- Can we take these?
- Please don't lose them.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Who are you?
What the fuck do you want?
"Okay, okay!"
"You, stay put."
- Did you know Carmen and Estrella?
- Everyone did.
What was your relationship?
You already know.
I dated Carmen for a couple months.

- Do I look like a photographer?
Want me to hit you again?
Where were you the night they disappeared?
"September 17th, six days ago."

"What, Junior?"
My real kid?
"Good, man."
I can't wait.
"Save my money, soon as I get my 60 Gs, getting the fuck outta here."
"Go back to the D.R., live with him and Carmen."
I'm gonna open me a bike shop.
"Stay with my tío in Baitoa, just till I get hooked up."

"The first time I was introduced to all of them at once, it was crazy."
Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews.
Almost all of them were named Peter or Paul.
It was unbelievable.
"Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew."
And this is Petey.
There must have been two dozen Peters and Pauls at the wedding...
This is Marie.
"...plus, they were all married to girls named Marie."
She looks Italian.
And they named all their daughters Marie.
And this is Pete.
"No, I mean Paulie."
I get confused myself.
"By the time I had met everybody, I thought I was drunk."
"Paulie, you shouldn't have."
Welcome to the family.
Sunday dinner?
So beautiful. I want to cry.
"Karen, here's something to help you get started, huh?"
-The bag.
The bag.
-What bag?
"The bag with the envelopes in it, all the money."
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.
He didn't call?
-He's with his friends.
-What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown-up.
He doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was such a grown-up why doesn't he get you two an apartment.

"But, uh, do you need all this stuff on the surface?"
"Well, um, no, actually."

It seems kind of slapped on.
"You know, not as thought-out as this other piece."

"Now, pack up."
I'll expect you back in Washington to clear out your office.

"Yes, sir."
Hmm.
I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.
"You mean, you know about that?"
(LAUGHS) Aw.
Now I do.

"Bye, Kent, and all that that implies."
But she was still there.
"""I took a bus from Uncle Malcolm's,"
"I got the jacket, and I waited."""
Eva?
"After that, I waited in my cubby."
"When I got back home, dad wasn't there."
Dad?
"You know, you should have listened to dad when he said he didn't do it."
Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?
I'm sorry..
None of this would have happened if I just got thom to the river.
"Mrs gundelach, this is your copy for you to sign, as guardian."
"It's alright, mum."
Everything's gonna be alright.
"No, it's not."
It's not...
"Eva abigail gundelach,"
I'm arresting you for the murder of thom murnane.
"You'll be taken to the watch house, charged, and arrangements will be made immediately."
You'll report before the children's court.

Becca and Hallie are my two best girlfriends.
They're always game to listen to my problems and dispense useful commentary.
Toe suckers freak me out.
I heard that he photographed Charlize is that true?
I mean I love her she's like one of my favorite.
Top five for sure.
Maybe I'm just being jealous?
Ok how do you spell his last name?
Becca what are... tell me you're not looking him up on the internet?
I personally think your dog is your biggest issue in your dating life.
What?
"Question, where does Bowie sleep?"
He sleeps in my bed.
Ok but if a guy...
sleeps over where does Bowie go?
"Um, I guess he just stays in my bed."
Wait what about fleas?
More importantly what about sniffing?
Don't dogs sniff?
Bowie stop it.
Bowie...
"Ok, Ok you have a point."

Uh oh...

We'll manage it somehow.
"- Good evening, Mr. Weller."
"- Good evening, Dr. Jekyll."
A touch of autumn in the air.
Very seasonable.
"- Wonderful, Mr. Weller, wonderful."
- Listen here.
Remember that comet I was telling you about?
The blooming thing didn't hit us after all.
- You know why?
- No.
Why?
"Because it knew at this moment, across the park Sir Emery is going to announce the marriage of his daughter to the very man you're talking to."
- Dr. Jekyll!
And my best wishes to the Mrs. Jekyll as is to be.
Thank you.
You don't mind if I hurry?
"- Godspeed, Dr. Jekyll."
"- Thank you, Mr. Weller!"
Oh.
Here's hoping that Hyde rots wherever he is.
Burn slow when the time comes.
Here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll thinks of his lvy as I know he'd like to.
As his lvy thinks of him.
Because he's an angel.
Here's to my angel.
Surprised?
Couldn't be that you didn't expect to see me?
No.
I've been...
I've been waiting for you.
But you've been celebrating.
Though your dreams be tossed
And blown
"Walk on, walk on"
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone

I'll call you when we can talk at length.
Anselmo just killed himself.
And this is the original probation report.
The one we were looking for.
They found it in Anselmo's car.
The police commissioner gave it to me.
He didn't want it ending up as tomorrow's headline.
"""""Tino Zapatti."

Walter Stern and Frank Anselmo.
Don't see them in the same room.
"Something's still wrong, you know?"
I know.

"Afternoon, Mr. Calhoun."
"-Sorry, the judge left for the day."
Sylvia coming over?
You're not going to believe what happened. I gotta tell you that.
-What are you laughing at?
-Problem with the apartment?
That's an attitude I don't appreciate.
"As it turns out, I got an-- l do have a problem at my apartment."
-A gas leak.
-l didn't say anything.
But what's that?
What's that goofy grin for?
"What, you think I'd destroy my own gas installation?"
It's gonna get repaired.
It may take a few days...

"Hey, the point is, is that I'm ready for her to come over."
Good. I'm glad to hear it.
Good for you.
Yeah.
"Great, the Amazing Hulk."
"Detective, I owe you an apology."
I shouldn't have gotten in your face.
I was out of line.
-No problem.
-Bygones be bygones?
Yeah.
I was thinking maybe you'd put in a good word for me with Janice Licalsi.
"If she knows we're cool, she might let me up."
-She put in to ride with someone else.
-l think you need to talk to her about that.
Mm-hm.
"Okay, no problem."
"Give me 20 minutes a day, I could get you tightened up in a month."
That poor woman.
Father?
Yes?
I have to confess that my feelings were very hurt last year at the flower show.
"Ah, yes."
I am extremely sorry about that.
No.
"No, not just by you."
"When I looked at Edie's flower arrangement,"
I realised mine would never be as good.
And I think I've been punishing her for that ever since.
That was very brave of you to say so.
"And God, I am sure, will forgive you."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Father."
"Now, I'll see you back at St Mary's."
I just pray to God we're not too late.
"Me too, George."
Father?
"Good Afternoon, Lady Felicia!"
"Good work, Sid!"
George!
Father.
"How are you, Henry?"
"Mr Lee, the good news is we've got your man."
"Well, woman."
It turns out Iris Lightman did this to you.
Popped into your shed first thing yesterday and slipped hemlock in your teacup.
The one thing I don't understand is why she's tried to fit up George here.
"I've never met the woman, Henry."
"Don't have any thoughts on it, do you?"
I saw her at the shed... ..this morning.
"I'm sad, too."
It's okay to grieve.

"You're looking awfully serious, L.B."
I guess.
Are you feeling all right?
"Uncle Steven, is Krystle mad at Grandpa?"
No.
"Krystle loves Grandpa a whole lot, you know that."
But I saw-
"There you are, L.B."
I've been looking everywhere for you.
"Hello, Steven."
"Hi, Krystle."
Mrs. Gunnerson just made you a big chocolate milkshake.
So you wanna come downstairs with me right now.
"Krystle, is there anything wrong between you and L.B.?"
"Well, of course not."
"Well, it's just that L.B.'s taken on a new habit, Steven."
He's begun to lie and tell little fibs.
"Oh, I know it's only because he misses Jeff."
I only hope it's just a phase he's going through.

It's probably best for us just to ignore it.

"""if only I knew that you were running into the second tower"" bullshit."
"I only ran in because-- well, because it was the next goddamn job."
"But you, i can't figure it out."
What were you waiting for?

"Did you, Figgs?"
No.
Monica said she was going over to her friend's house to watch some pay-per-view.
The thing was on a timer.
"I didn't know she was gonna be here, Freddy."
It's all bullshit.
"You, Figgs, are the bullshit!"

You even turned your back on Tunney when he needed your help!
Figgs!

"Figure of speech, Prius."
"Okay, so here's my business idea."
"You're in your 20s, early 30s."
- I love it!
"- That was a hypothetical, but I like your energy."
[ Chuckles ]
You and your friends are going out for a wild night.
- What do you do for a ride?
- Call Tom.
"Okay, we're having some problems with hypotheticals."
I'll move on.
You call a cab.
"But cabs are boring, and you and your gang want a memorable night, so instead of calling a lame cab, you call The Mystery Machine from ""Scooby-Doo""!"
"- Travis, this is great!"
"- Oh, The Mystery Machine!"
I always wanted to hang around in that van-- maybe try my luck with Old Velma.
- You mean Daphne?
- I know what I like.
"Okay, well, Tom loves it too, and he's a brain surgeon."
"Travis, you're a genius."
I think I can have this thing up and running in three months.
"What are you, crazy?"
Everything's fine.
Sally Seidelman told me you were retiring.
"Yes, at the end of this year."
"Well, I just wanted to say... ."
"I don't know, I just... ."
I just wanted to say... .
- I don't know.
- Are you sure everything's all right?
- Tell her where you are.
- Donna?
I'm in the Oval Office with the President of the United States and it's because of you.
- Mrs. Morello?
- What a thing to say.
"- We're all very proud of you, Donna."
- She didn't do anything.
- Was that...?
"- It's Jed Bartlet, Mrs. Morello."
I've got a couple of questions.
"When you taught Beowulf, did you make the kids read it in the original Middle English or did you use a translation?"
"- We used a translation, Mr. President."
- Okay.
- We'll call that the James Bond version.
"- Yes, sir."
What are you doing with your retirement?
- My husband and I were gonna travel.
- That's great.
"I'd stay away from the Elk Horn, Idaho area for a little while."

This was imported. lt came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?
"-Nice, huh?"
-Come here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?
"Yeah, I talked to him..."
He's looking into everything.
"This'll make the Air France hold up look like Goddamned peanuts, man."
Come on.
-It's ok...
"He's gonna do it, right?"
-l told you.
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens.
No promises.
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.
And I've been bleeding for this. I've been cultivating this son of a bitch for two years.
He owes me 20 grand.
Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit.
My dream comes true.
Morrie Let's get a drink.
And these are the guys Jimmy put together for what turned out to be the biggest heist in American history.
The Lufthansa heist.
Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab the outside guard and make him get us in the front door.
Frenchy and Joe Buddha had to round up the workers.
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them all tied up and away from the alarms.
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.
He used hang around the Lounge and play guitar.
"Calm, we will put an unforgettable injection to him."
"That is, dont move..."
Quiet...
"Good, the analyses, are not of the best ones."
-Dame the x-ray.
"-Immediately, Professor."
This one is not a wonder either.
"It is clear, tomorrow we will make a small intervention and we will fix to him definitively."

"Cicchirini, take care of the preparations."
"It neglects, Professor."
"-Oh, Professor."
"-You let me pass, young lady?"

"It seems like it's a lot of work, and you are pregnant."

"No, you're right, it's a terrible time."

Lqbal Chand Malhotra?
Kabir Malhotra's brother... who was disowned by their father.
But why?
I guess he must've been the black sheep.
And it's possible that...
"Kabir didn't help him out, so he must be very upset."
What are you looking for?
Any idea how this red paper and these chemicals are connected?

Five years.

Has he ever left this place in the past five years?

Not a jail.
Patients are free to move in and out.
"But, as far as I know, Mr. Malhotra never left this place."

--There are.
--I need a room.
What must I do?
--Give me your passport
--And put a $10 note in the passport?
"--$ No need for the $10 in your passport, citizen."
Then is it $15?
Maybe $20?

"Deep down, I can tell he's genuinely upset."
I'm just genuinely happy right now.
"Ugh, this salad bar stinks."
"No, wait."
That's me again.
"Oh, my God, Max!"
The diner people put money in our PayPal account!
"They say it's from Chestnut, but he's not allowed on the Internet when we're not home."

"So, what are we talking about?"
"I wanna tell how I came to know Mr. Catchings, the man I killed."
I wanna tell this so my son will know.
Mr. Catchings was the overseer on the cotton plantation in Georgia...
... wherel slaved with my wife and children...
... 1 9 yearsago.
I don't need to say how bad life was to a slave.
We worked from sunup to dark.
We got whip.
We got sold.
We ain't had no hope.
But this is what I need my son to know about what I did.
When our little boy was 7 year old...
... hismama...
... wasforcedintocarnalrelations with Mr. Catchings.
What Mr. Catchings told her was that if she didn't...
... he'dselltheboy awayfrom us.
Seven years old.
He'd sell him away from his mama and daddy.
My wife...
... couldn'tbearthethoughtofthat.
So she went to his bed.
When she found out she was in a family way...
... shewasso afraid it would be that man's baby.
She lost her mind.
Walked into the river.
Drowned herself.
I would have killed Mr. Catchings then.
But me and the children was loaded on wagon in chains...
"... thatsameday,soldtoAlabama."
It took a lot of spirit out of me.
And I hope my son understands why now.
So you see...
"Geez, man'"

Mickey:
You know the tournament?
You know the bowling tournament in Vegas?
Not that again.
It's an investment.
No.
"It's not an investment, it's a $5,000 vacation."
It's for the tournament.
"It costs 3,000 to enter,"
I've got to have some money to fly out there-- for food and a hotel.
It's not like on five Gs I'm gonna be able to get fancy.
"You know, this bowling thing of yours... it's making you look like a sucker."
What kills me is... there's no one even trying to talk you into it.
It's just you.
"Excuse me, excuse me."
"Look, here."
Somebody take your boy-- take your son and gone.
- Take your father and him gone.
- Carlos:
What?
!
- What happened?
- Some boys took your father-- and I don't know where he went.
Coño!
"Tito, take care of the register, I'll be right back."
It's not my fault.
I don't know where he is.
"""Santa María, Madre de Dios... ruega por nosotros, pecadores..."""

I swear you think about Mom more now than when she was alive.
She understands.

Candlelight.
And a promise that you will try to get to second base.
Done.
"You're meeting with Carol Finnerty, deputy special agent in charge of the president's Secret Service."
- I need a favour.
- This is a favour.
I need another favour.
I need a pass for my daughter.
- John--
- You don't understand.
"She's a freak for this kind of stuff, so if I get her in, I'm Dad of the Year."
I will owe you so much more than just candlelight dinner.
- I'll make a call.
- Perfect.
Thank you.
You're the best.
--A truly historic handshake.
What President Sawyer is proposing to Iranian president Al-Sharif is withdrawing all American troops across the entire Middle East and for that he'll ask his G8 partners for help.
"It's all about money, and who won't like this deal are American companies who do business with the American military."
Wanna grab the door?
Em.
I'll get it.
- Hey.
- You're late.
- She thought you weren't coming.
- Why wouldn't I be coming?
"Hey, you, little face."
"Come on, get your stuff."
"Let's go, baby."
"- Bye, Mommy."
I love you.
Correct.
"Rosslare,"
"Republic of Ireland,"
"Fishguard in Wales, very well done."

That was so easy for you!

"Kissinger, Nixon..."
Can you see Clinton and Albright?
Clinton and Albright?
Clinton...
"Actually, no, have we got two Ls to get it?"
Is Albright there?
Yes.
"Very good, for three points, your answers?"
Albright and Clinton.
Let's see if you're right.
"Wow, Albright and Clinton."
"Marianne, you were right on that."
I was hoping it was going to be that before it came up.
I don't know why.
Those were the first two that came into your mind?
So obviously Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright was his Secretary of State in his second term.
Do you know what she famously said about women who don't help other women?
"""There are is a special place in hell for women who don't help"
"""other women."""
What a gal!

"And I was ready to get, to move on out."
"Yeah, but, Bridger here argued to stay."
"He argued to stay so he could at least build a cross or something to put on top of Glass's grave, and that's what he did."
That's what we did.
"I'm glad you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger."
"He more than pulled his weight, Captain."
"This man here, he was my partner."

"Good afternoon, ma'am."
Will you be voting?
-You're running in the 6th District?
-l am.
"Well, 6th District is my district."
I'm very interested in who'll represent me.
I'm interested that you're interested.
"As Huey Long once said, and I quote:"
"""""lf you got a friend, you got a vote. """""
-Did he say that?
-He sure did.
He told me to move to the 6th District.
He said the people are special.
-So do I have your vote?
-You can count on it.
That's one.
No.
"More than one, actually."
I hear Elaine Santos is ready to stand up for you.
Sounds like a groundswell.
I wish I could tell you I won but I got thrashed by a Dominican from 104th Street.
"I got branded an outsider, and I was never in it."
"But I'll be back in 2 years, and I'll win."
You know why?
I'm willing to be lucky.
And if you're willing to be lucky New York will give you a chance.

So many things have been said about it  but there's only one I really like.
"""New York  it can destroy you or fulfill you, depending a good deal on luck. """
No one should come here unless he's willing to be lucky.
I see.
-He asked who frequented my house.
-What did you say?
There are different visitors.
"-You, folks, are among them."
- He knows about that anyway.
"I did not tell him any names,God forbid!"
"I'm a Russian,Vanya."
That's how it is.
That's what I thought.
Welcome to the table.
-Everything this house can offer.
-You are welcome.
I'm Markel Andronov.
I was born in the Tambov region.
In 1920 I served in the Tukhachevsky army and was taken as a prisoner under Byalostok.
Herfathertook me from the camp to work for him.
"We made love with her here, in the haystack."
"Oh, Virgin Mary, do not mention it."
"And when she got pregnant, I had to become a Catholic and marry her."
"When her parents died, I became the master ofthe farm."
Now I'm Pan Marek.
-Have you evertold this to anyone else?
"- No, just to you only."
"Listen, if Shulgin finds that out, he'll get you from underthe ground!"
He's got me already.
"Listen, Vanya, may be I should go to him myself, shouldn't I?"
Should I confess sicerely until it is not too late?
-The powerwill be yours now.
- Everything looks that way.
I will not come empty-handed.
I can bring a barrel of vodka.
He will shoot himself.
"Shut up, You don't talk much."
"I will kill you first, Come over here."
"No, No, It's Ok, I am normal than you."
Go and buy the famous battery from Bhaiya's Shop.
"I don't have change, Change..."
"Take it from me, but bring it quick."
Pintos!
"Why you're doing all day Pintos, Mintos, Lintos?"
"You just add S,"
You add S on every single word and English word.
"People have one father in this world and I have 550,000 Fathers."
Right!
"Papa, you don't have to do like this, What else?"
Hey!
I will give you a slap.
"My Papa add S, It's not your concern,"
"I'll beat you here, Pintos!"
"I bring you from street, from orphanage."
"I gave him clothes,"
"Did I gave you application, that bring me up."
"Father died in darkness, and son is power house."
Here's your clothes.
"You dramatic, you hits me this clothes in publicly, anywhere."
"Hits me anywhere, Pintos!"
"Listen to me, Yes!"
Did you buy it from Pahar Ganj?
Yes.
"It's Khurana's stuff, How do you know?"
"Khurana sold this useless stuff,"
"I know,"
"To call Calvin Klein, he dress me up Khurana's stuff,"
Brother.
Grandma isn't there!
These...
They're Grandpa's clothes.
But why spread them out like this?
The clock in Grandma's head is running in reverse.
"So now, she is slipping back to the time of Grandpa."
Hello!
Yes?
"Just a little while ago, your Grandma came to my place."
Then... she saw the clouds and took off in a hurry.
She was headed for Nagasaki.
Today's clouds... look exactly like they did on that day.
Maybe she remembered what happened on that day.
"No, I mean, she thinks she's reliving that day."
Grandma!
Grandma!
And the boy a rose did see
A rose standing in the field
Blossoming in innocence
Awed by the color it did yield
A never-ending fascination
For the crimson color
Of the rose standing in the field

"That's good, ese."
Got a little favor to ask you.
All right?
Simón.
"You know that dude, El Chucko?"
"I want you to handle that for us, all right?"
"I'll take care of it, ese."
"Was I talking to you, ese?"
Santana?
Let me do it.
"Mi carnalito, that's not his thing."
"He's not no punk or nothing, but..."
He's not talking to you.
"There's something I want you to understand, Little Puppet."
"What happened to Pie Face, I didn't like it, but it was necessary."
Especially right now.
"Take a look over there, ese."
"El Chucko and La Nuestra Familia's making their play to get respect, ese."
La eme took a long time earning their respect in this place.
"And if we want to keep it, we gotta show some class."
SANTANA:
"Now I know Pie Face wasn't weak, ese."
"And you know he wasn't weak, either."
But how about other people?
"How about El Chucko, what'd he think, ese?"
'Cause that's what it's about.
It's not just about being weak that we can't accept.
It's about other people even beginning to think we're showing weakness.

I'm still Andy's favourite toy.
I was on top of the world livin' high

I was livin' the life
Things were just the way they should be
When from out of the sky like a bomb
Comes some little punk in a rocket
Now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to me

"Suddenly, all homosex, we must be friendly to?"
That's not the point.
This particular homosex is one of us.
- Ain't one of me.
- We don't even have gay in India.
"Look, he's like a working stiff, juste like us guys, you know?"
"And I got to know this guy, and I kinda like him, regardless of his private... weener business."
All right?
"So we don't do that, we don't burn a guy like this, a nice guy, that's..."
That's just not the Knights of Prosperity way.
"Are you with me, Louis?"
"I'm sorry, what?"
Wait a second...
"Hold on a second, yeah!"

"So I get her back to my place, right?"

"As of today, Frank Cortland is no longer with Burton Security."
"- Oh, yeah?"
- Carnucci?
I want you to take his place.
"- Yes, sir."
- Good.
"Uh, this Ellsberg, wasn't he a student ofyours at Harvard?"
"I mean, he's your idea, Henry."
So why are you running for cover?
"[Kissinger] Well, yes, we taught a class togetherat Harvard, butyou knowthese back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals."
"- No, I don't, Henry."
I don't.
- Prosecute the New York Times.
"Yeah, but it's not, bottom line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John."
The question is how do we screw Ellsberg so bad... it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
The other issue is how do we stop these leaks once and for all?
"Now, someone is talking to the press."
We gotta stop these leaks at any cost.
You hearme?
Then we can go forthe big pic...
"China, Russia."
"- [Colson] Sir, if I might?"
"- Go, Chuck."
We can do this ourselves.
The C.I.A. And the F.B.I. Aren't doing the job.
"Now, we can create our own intelligence unit right here inside the White House."
"Well, why not?"
- Our own intelligence to plug the leaks?
- [Colson] Yeah.
- Like plumbers.
- Plumbers.
I like it.
I like the idea.
"Yeah, but, uh, is it legal?"
Has itever been done before?
"Oh, sure."

"-We can still drink here, right?"
"-Hello, boys."
-Mary.
"-Ezra, may I speak to you for a moment?"
-Of course.
I just got this wire from a certain Preston Wingo.
He owns the Cattle Baron Hotel over in Snellville.
It concerns your mother.
"Oh, Mother?"
Are you familiar with a gentleman by the name of Preston Wingo?
I know a fat little weasel called Preston Wingo.
-What about him?
"-Well, this Wingo has slandered you."
Mary just received a telegraph...
... claimingthatyouabsconded with a pair of diamond cuff links.
He's demanding you be jailed until he arrives.
Jailed?
I'm no thief.
"Yes, of course not..."
"... butunfortunately, the burden of proof is on you."
"Now, I would suggest that Mary search your bag..."
... justsoyoumightacquityourself of these ridiculous charges.
MARY:
"Sorry, Maude."
This is so tiresome.
My own son.
Looks like Mr. Wingo was wrong.
Fantastic.
Thank you.
Yeah.
"So, it's almost 3:00."
Are you still going to give that lecture on emergency C-Sections?
"Oh gosh, no."
I have a date with Riley.
Could you cover for me?
Really?
Do you think I'm qualified to?
"Sara, I think you show great promise as an obstetrician."
"Oh, my God."
Thank you so much.

"A PFC, huh?"
"Hey, wait till they see you with all them stripes."

"Oh, boy, they'll really flip."
Who ever thought I'd wind up with more stripes than hair?
(all laugh)
"Oh, what a bunch of characters."
"Look, this guy right here."
Oh...
look at the end... the end...
Meathead.
He used to be a truck driver before the war.
"To get him to move, I had to honk a horn."
This is a beauty right here.
Goof-off Gunther was his name.
He was a busboy before the war.
Used to open K ration boxes looking for tips...
"This is a real beauty, a hillbilly--"
"Zeke ""Ozark"" Rutlege-- the only man in the Army wore suspenders."
"Oh, they were beautiful."
"How did those meatballs ever get along in civilian life without you to watch over 'em, Sarge?"
"Oh, I shudder to think about it."
"Ah, those poor jerks-- probably going in hock to get to that reunion in New York."
"Hey, Ernie, the reunion's tomorrow night."
You'd better start packing.
-Packing...
-Got an idea.
What are they going to ask us to do next?
Somebody's really gonna get hurt.
Maybe they should've just shut down the terminal.
And miss catching Professor Plum red-handed in the conservatory with the wrench?
Don't tell me you're enjoying this.
"You know the NSA, sweetheart-- we don't get out much."
"London, Brussels, Athens..."

Why screen us twice?
It's not like any of us have gone anywhere.
"I know, but it only took a minute."
"Miss, can I give you a hand?"
Thank you for helping me.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"You got something, Abbs?"
The London flight.
Two Colombian federal agents and an unnamed third party.
"Scheduled to deplane at Dulles, and then connect on a later flight to Bogotá."

"These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business."
- Agreed.
- We knowwhatyou tried to do for Cuba.
"Lfyou had been elected in '60, Castro would be dead now."
"Gentlemen, I tried."
I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.
He heard me and he made his decision.
I appreciate yoursentiments.
I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots.
But it's nothing I can do anything about.
"It's a long drive to Dallas, and Trini and I have a plane to catch tomorrow."
- So...
"- Dick, these boys wantyou to run."
- Absolutely.
- [Man] That's right.
"Now, they're serious."
They can deliver the South and putTexas in your column.
Only if Kennedy dumpsJohnson.
That'll never happen.
I don'tthink you know howmuch people hate Kennedy down here.

Father Brown.
From the party.
Did you see Henry?
I didn't get to see him.
The police stopped me.
But you knew he'd been poisoned?
Two policemen woke me up this morning asking me if I'd been near his shed.
You must have been very angry with Henry last night.
Why on earth would I want to poison him?
"He can't help me clear Thomas if he's dead, can he?"
No.
You mentioned being in prison?
"On the morning they hanged Thomas, I attacked a policeman."
Oh.
"No, well,"
I wouldn't have expected someone like you to understand.
"Look, all I know about Henry Lee, all I care about, is that he was the last person to look into my son's eyes."

You didn't know that your friend Max was Vera Blanchett's killer until Iris told you last night.
You came home and threw away his gift in disgust.
"Henry, I am only trying to get to the bottom of this."
Max was a senior judge...
..at the Crown Court where Vera Blanchett was a secretary.
He took his own life... ..not long after I hanged Thomas.
Now I know why.
'What Laxminarayan one and Jia got..
..With that they bought their share of restaurant from Munde.'
'Today too Laxmi's mother wants her son to be a shooter.'
'And she tells the same thing to every goon.'
"If this time he fails, he is not his father's son."
Let me tell you.
'Laxminarayan two bought some shares of virus autos..
..With his share and today he is the board of director in that company.'
'And his boss Pipat..'
Pipat.
"- Yes, sir!"
I think we need to talk.
"- Yes, sir."
Sit.
"Sir, on the chair or the sofa?"

'Laxminarayan three sells underwear..
..And vest in a bus and not in a car.'
'And Laila is his brand ambassador!

No mistake was made.
Why?
"Well, it's a long and rather involved story, sir."
"You see, earlier today, Batman activated the Batcomputer via his remote control Batcomputer oscillator."
Remote control?
"I took the liberty of getting some information from the, uh, Batcomputer myself."
"Batman activated the computer from, uh, ""411 Larva Drive."""
-411 Larva Drive.
-Larva Drive.

"Oh, Batman, you were out of this world."
"And, of course, I was adorable as baby Boy Wonder."
Robin's pretty good as a Boy Wonder too.
"You bet I am, Batman."

What about Nina?
"If she wasn´t killed by the bomb, I´m sure her buyers took care of her once they found out she didn´t deliver the virus."
"Either way, she´s out of the picture."
I hope so.
She can point to both of us.

I'm gonna work on the locations.
You're gonna work on finding Petty.
Petty was a combat engineer in the Korean War.
Something bad happened in Wonju... schoolchildren killed by U.S. land mines.
Petty was the prime suspect.
Is that what sent him into Alcatraz?
No.
Court-martialed.
They reassigned him to the Presidio graveyard detail while they did the investigation.
Eventually he was tried and convicted.
"After five years in military prison, he came back to the city and started doing this."
All right!
Everybody down!
"Oh, my God."
"On March 21, 1963,"
Alcatraz officially closed.
All the prisoners were transferred off the island...
Only that's not what happened.
Not at all.

"and then I went out on another date with her, and it's gotten a little serious, which is why I never called you."
"But I wanted to come up her e and tell you that personally, first of all 'cause I thought it was the menschy thing to do, and second of all because I r eally did like you when I met you in the elevator."

Impossible to recover any of the killer's DNA from her body.

You think we're looking for the same killer?
I'm just pointing out similarities in their deaths.

HARRY:

HARRY:

Big-shot gold bullion dealer called Vincent Lermontov.
Jumped off his penthouse balcony.
Not much left of him.
It's going to take at least another 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Lau's body processed.

Kaleem intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed.
"- Kaleem, owner of the Pleasure Palace?"
- Yeah.
Kayleigh Fenchurch's boss.
He hinted that someone new was trying to muscle out Freddie
- but Freddie wasn't listening.
- Maybe the two murders are connected.
"Yeah, but Kayleigh Fenchurch's murder was so precise."
"You know, no DNA, they drop her in the Thames."
"Freddie Lau, his body's just dumped in an alleyway."

"The man, codename: the Needle."
Also known as Henry Faber.
"He was born on May 26, 1900, at a village called Öln in West Prussia."
At the age of 13 he went to the Karlsruhe cadet school in Baden.
"Two years later, he was transferred to the more prestigious Groß-Lichterfelde near Berlin."
"He already spoke fluent English because his father, Baron von Müller-Guder, had worked in Washington as a military attaché, and had sent his son to private school there."
"But back in Germany, the boy rebelled constantly and was often flogged for it."
He passed his final exams with extremely high marks.
"In the '20s, the Needle was a cadet at the war school in Metz, and Wilhelm Canaris befriended him."
"In '31, Hitler visited the family estate and met him."
"In '33, Hitler came to power."
The Needle was made a captain and sent to Berlin for unspecified duties.
He had an affair with a German actress.
He never married.
He made no close friends.
"And in '38, the Needle disappeared."
God.
Clever bastards.

Yes.

You could have fun with that.

My teacher Master Mie Jiue decided with wu Dong's Priest Chang that I should marry wu Dong's Yan Lei Hang
I knew he liked me a lot
Not long after I took a trip for some business and met a person in a white outfit we quarrelled and fought and on that day that person and I had a daughter
He was in fact Yang Siu of the Ming Cult
For this I was ashamed to return to Er Mei and hide in a cottage
Little expected that after 1 8 years my sister Ding Man Juan found me
I fought her off and escaped injured with Bu Huei
I know I can't escape but hope you would save her
"No, mom, I'll go wherever you go"
You needn't go anywhere just stay with me
"If anyone wants to kill you, he'll have to kill me"
"And me, wang Nan Gou first"
Is that true?
Abbess Mie Jiue
I guessed you would come here because this evil cult consorts with you closely
Teacher
Shut up
"Doctor wu, I'd like to borrow this place to take care of some of Er Mei's internal business"

"Gene's first big break came on Broadway, starring in Pal Joey."
MGM soon grabbed him and started him off as Judy Garland's leading man in For Me and My Gal.
Ballin' the Jack
"Gene had a style all his own charming and athletic, with boundless energy."
"In Summer Stock, he created a classic number using only a squeaky floor and a newspaper as dance partners."
"As a choreographer Gene staged this exciting and bittersweet ballet to Richard Rodgers' ""Slaughter on Tenth Avenue"" from Words and Music."
His partner:
The wonderful Vera-Ellen.
Gene's inventiveness seemed inexhaustible.
In An American in Paris he even danced into a Toulouse-Lautrec painting to find Leslie Caron and the incomparable music of George Gershwin.
The film won six Oscars plus a special award to Gene for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography on film.
Fit as a fiddle and ready For love I can jump over the moon up above
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
Gene teamed with Donald O'Connor to perform this marvelously comic vaudeville routine for Singin' in the Rain.
Soon all the church bells Will be ringing and I'll march with Ma and Pa
How the church bells will be ringing
With a hey naughty-knotty And a hotcha-cha
"Hi, diddle-diddle, my baby's OK"
"Ask me a riddle, I'm waiting to say"
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
It was my pleasure to dance with Gene in several films but I think this one is my favorite.
"""The Heather on the Hill"" from Brigadoon."
You are my lucky star
Gene inspired a whole new generation of stars.
One of the brightest was a young California girl named Debbie Reynolds.
Here's Debbie in a rare outtake from Singin' in the Rain.

He secretly loved a woman for 3 years.
And I couldn't even tell anyone... ...because I thought my mom would worry...
-Why the hell are you here?
- Come here now!
- Do you have no shame?
The neighbors!
-What's the big deal?
It's not our neighborhood.
- Come on.
- Okay!
Did he say something?
Forget it.
"Okay, you handle these customers, I'll go to the counter."
What if anyone steals something.
What do you want?
- TV and Video.
I bought this clock from you.
It came with a guarantee of one year.
Then come after one year.
None of its needles move.
What?
- None of its needles move.
I'll repair it for you in a jiffy.
Key.
Here's the key.
The parts of this car are no good.
"- This was not a car, it was a clock."
Clock?
Shouldn't you have told me before?
And why did you bring a clock here?
You should have taken it to a clock shop.
Strange man.
You bought so many things?
- Yes.
Just a minute.
"Okay, I'll make the bill, you make the payment."
Bill?
- Yes.
Pay him money.
"- Here, take."
What are you doing?
Tell me.
- No.
"Kanji, what are you doing?"
Why are you scared?
Take the gun.
"Get down now, come on."
The phone's ringing again.
Forget it.
You switched of your mobile.. ..that's why they're calling on the landline now.
Tell them I am not at home.
They say if we don't arrange for the money.. ..we'll have to vacate the house in a month.
I had so many dreams.
I wanted to make Jigna a pilot.
And my son a cricketer.
But soon I'll even lose this house.
Everything's lost.
Everything will be fine.
What will be fine?
All I have is the shop property.
"I'll sell that and repay the mortgage. "" Om Jai Jagdish Hare. """
""" Swami.. """
Yes.
"Yes, he's here."
It's Nimish.
- Who?
Who Nimish bhai?
- The estate agent.
Oh yes.
"Yes, Nimish."
Go ahead.
Did you find a buyer for that property?
What are you saying?
What's that for?
It's my granddad's cross.
It'll keep trouble away.
I'm off.
Go ahead.
You abandoned her!
You hear?
You got cold feet.
Say something!
Tell him he's a coward!
Shut up.
"You mean, everyone run for your life?"
- Yashka couldn't have helped.
- You would've abandoned her too?
What's the use?
He'd have got caught himself and not saved Ksanka.
For shame...
Wait for me here.
"If I'm not back by evening, you come..."
Valerka.
Who's there?
"It's me, Father Mokei."
Danka?
Thank God...
I thought you'd followed your father.
I'm still alive.
Everybody's gone mad.
They threw the bell-ringer from the belfry for spite.
The bell's not been rung since Christmas.
- What are you here for?
- Looking for my sister.
She's at the inn - a waitress.
- Don't hurt her.
- I'm not going to.
We have to get out of here.
They won't take me.
They won't take me.
Not again.
No!
No!
Manuel!
No!
No!
Manuel!
Hello?
"Pablo, where are you?"
"Malena, listen."
The son-of-a-bitch who's behind this is connected with the military.
Where did you find the diary?
What the fuck does that matter?
"- In the car, right?"
- So what?
"Pablo, do me a favor and just for once try and think with your head."
Who could have written that diary?
Think about it.
"No, not that, Malena."
Dad was a son-of-a-bitch.
"He may have been a son-of-a-bitch to you, but not to me."
I was thinking...
"Imagine he had the diary, but he found it and it wasn't his."
Whose was it otherwise?
Some other doctor's.
How should I know?
Give him a break.
I have.
Why?
Then today is tomorrow!
Today cannot be tomorrow.
"Tomorrow will be in the future, and we are in the real time."
And the future is not real?
It...
It is make-believe?
"The future is real, but..."
But?
"But, but, but?"
It will come later.
When?
Soon.
And I think it has already come.
"What do you mean, it has come?"
When?
"What do you mean, it has come?"
"What has come, my friends?"
The future.
Where?
Everywhere.
Today's morning it is already tomorrow.
Really?
It can't be that today is tomorrow.
Yes?
"You mean, today is yesterday?"
Yesterday is over.
"When yesterday ends, starts tomorrow."
Then the day after tomorrow.
Then two days after tomorrow.
Then...
Let's call it even if I go to bed with you.
500 bucks?
"You're not telling me that it'll cost $4,500 to get laid with you?"
What do you think you are?
Julia Roberts?
Let me get it straight.
I nerver paid for getting laid.
Come on!
There's no one it the house except us.
Relax!
I won't hurt you.
Answer me.
What color is your panty?
Guess.
Black and white.
Show me.
What's that?
This is no panty.
What the best!
Let's get on with it.
Why are you laughing?
Something funny going on here?
"Must be your mom, isn't it?"
She wants to put me into jail?
"You only listen to your mom, don't you?"
You'll regret this: it's my first time.
Your first time?
Are you pulling my leg?
Every girl I've fucked told me it's her first time.
You think this is the Middle Ages?
First time my foot!
"It's my first time, too -- I mean for today."
I served four years instead of one.
I won't let you bully this boy.
It's not like everyone will experience what you did.
Right?
Don't talk!
Don't talk!
"Okay, stop it guys."
Don't stir up trouble.
"No need to make it a big deal, brother."
We're just joking around.
"It's okay, abi."
It isn't that important.
Don't be in bad terms with anybody because of me.
- You here for how long?
- One and a half year.
- Why?
- Homicide.
"A matter of honor, abi."
I killed the guy I saw with the girl I love.
May God save you.
"- Shall I enter, abi?"
Shall I?
"- Okay, come in."
"Okay goes, keep it up."
Where are you?
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Canım...
Welcome.
We have two hours before the meeting.
Come let's get away for a while.
- Burak was here.
"- What, why did he come?"
"You don't know, but I do."
I'd string up his dead body if I had my way.
"He was a bastard, that pa of yours."
"Here, drink."
Danka's a long time in coming.
Don't worry about him.
Valerka!
Valerka!
"Wait, Valerka!"
- Hear that shooting in the village?
- So what?
Could anything have happened to Danka?
"You're no psychologist, Yashka."
"They're shooting wild, without any aim."
Just to keep their spirits up.
"What kept you so long, Danka?"
What's wrong?
I hurt my back.
The Whites are in Zbruyevka.
- Many of them?
- Lots.
- Come for long?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you find out?
I couldn't stay there.
Lyuty recognized me.
- What do we do now?
- Go scouting.
I'll go.
There're 40 houses in Zbruyevka and not a single man or boy left.
"Some have joined the Reds, some the Whites."
If one of us boys went they'd quickly spy us.
- That's not right.
I'll cook the food and serve you too.
Now go and take a bath first.
You all look like goons.
"We're goons, we'll look like goons."
- What?
He means that we've taken up a disguise of goons.
So we must look like one.
- Oh!
That's fine.
But I didn't ask your names. - your?
- Santo!
Santo!
- Raghu!
- Gani!
- Mohit.
Santo!
Raghu!
Gani!
Mohit!
It means Sa... re... ga... ma... wow!
Tuneless police officer have their names in tune.
Sa... - Re... - Ga... - Ma... - Tunes of one instrument.
Santo!
What are you doing there?
Come out!
Of this instrument.
"- C'mon, hero is calling us."
"Whatever you say, but she's so charming."
Remember one thing.
We should not forget our objective for this girl.
This girl will not stay here for 18 days.
- I got stuff to do.
Did you go back to that night club?
The place where you did pole dancing.
No...
I would really like to watch you.
You lost your chance.
What if I insist...
What if I gave you presents?
Wouldn't you dance for me?
Just once?
Doesn't your wife wait for you at home?
Cemre left home.
We are divorcing.
"Besides, all her roads go to north (Kuzey)."
- Where are we going?
- To my house.
Okay...
"Hüseyin Bey, sorry for the trouble."
"I could come and get it, you didn't have to Huseyin Amca."
I was kinda worried about you.
Since I didn't see you at the shop today.
- Hoped you didn't get sick or something.
"- No, no."
Not sick or anything.
I just didn't feel like going to work.
So I took a day off.
Why don't you come in?
Let me offer you a coffee.
"Thank you but, I shouldn't."
Zeynep will be home soon.
She works too much these days.
She gets tired.
"And now, I will alone shut down all his shops.. ..or my name isn't Kanji Lalji Mehta."
And this isn't my concern for you.
It's a direct warning.
Yes.
"You're safe here, it's a government property."
But how will you escape them?
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Sir.
The case has been accepted.
I'm worried about Sushila and the children.
"I'll take a cab, you go."
But how can I leave you alone.
"I'm going to the police station, for protection."
Drop her home as well.
Go.
"Be careful, dear."
"Go, go, go."
Are the boys ready?
Remember.
Kanji shouldn't get to see daylight.
That's it.
There he is.
"Catch him, beat him."
Don't let him go.
"Wait, where are you running to?"
He's hiding there.
"Not for your complexion, but you stink."
Go quickly!
Prepare my breakfast.
- I am.
"Lado, get my shampoo."
"If I give him the whole bottle, he'll finish the whole bottle."
He will keep shampooing himself.
"Whatever he does, his complexion won't change."
Get the shampoo.
- Coming !
"The cat is troubling me here, and the husband troubling me there."
Everyone troubles me.
What all do I manage?
"The water has gone cold, get the shampoo!"
Coming.
Take.
- Coming.
Why do you give me the shampoo in a bowl everyday?
Am I a beggar?
"Take a bath, but not in excess."
- Damn !
What shampoo is this?
It stinks!
"Was this shampoo, or egg?"
I'll benefit only if I serve him.
"Lado, my body is stinking of egg."
Smell me.
An egg shampoo will smell of egg.
Now eat.
Okay.
Will you eat?
Is it good?
"- Yes, sir. keep my luggage inside."
"Daddy, I am so sorry I am late."
You are always late!
"Have a seat, dear!"
"Mr. Rajesh, meet my daughter seema."
I have already met her in a pleasurable way.
l..
I am still ashamed for that.
You are embarrassing me by saying this.
Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
Great!
Have this.
- Thank you!
Not so much!
Enough!
- Have some more!
You too have some.
My plate is already full.
I will take.
But you are not eating at all.
I am eating it.
"Enough, seema!"
- Please!
Thank you!
You too have some!
"- No. lt""s okay."
"Look, don""t feel shy. otherwise I will think that you are still angry with me."
You are giving me so much food.
I will have to go to the hospital from here.
"lf such a situation arises, then I will be your nurse."
You can surely kill me.
Sing it with me.
You know the words.
"No, thanks, man."
You've been singin' that shit all week.
"If you try that at M.S.U. this Saturday, I'll kick your ass."
Our last game is this Saturday.
[ Snickers ]
"Yeah, well, shit."
I've got this lacrosse game.
It's really important.
It's our last game.
"Central almost beat us last time, so this time I really wanna kick their ass."
"But it's gonna be cool, because the game's at State, which means afterwards I'll be able to stop by."
So you can't sing at the competition.
[ Sighing ]
"Heather, I'm sorry."
I totally blew it.
It's okay.
You should... do what makes you happy.
All right.
"Listen, thanks for understanding."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I guess I'll see you later ?"
Mm-hmm.
[ Whistling ]
"Hey, Kevin."
- You seen shit-brick lately ?
- Why ?
What did you do to him ?
Me ?
Nothing.
"See, I'm the one whose ass he kicked."
"Yep, and now they'll do speeches."
"""When he was a little boy..."""
"- When I was a little boy... ...he, of course, ""also had a grandma."" - ...I also had a grandma."
"And in his whole life ""he couldn't, and I could."""
"- But in my whole life, I could not manage to disappoint her to death."
But he could!
"And thus, Kostya Inochkin began his clandestine life."
"- Hey, Nelya."
Do you know how to dance Charleston?
- All girls here can.
- Can you show me?
- All right.
- Can you teach me?
"I can teach you something, too."
- Want me to teach you telepathy?
- What now?
"- You know, make people do stuff with your mind."
"- Kosmos, Kosmos!"
Come here!
- Try to make him do stuff.
- Easy.
Like what?
"- I don't know, something."
- Hang on.
- Dolt.
"- I swear, that wasn't me."
He did that on his own.
- There's something in there!

Or a badger.
- Have you ever smelled a badger?
- A hundred times!
- So that you won't have to see them again.- I will come.
I'm not scare of seeing them.
I will come and look into their eyes.
Deep into their eyes...
It's time.Let's go.

"- Has Mustafa come?- He must have, yes."
"- Does he know I am here?- No, are you scared of him?"
Don't be scared.He can't harm you as I'm here.
I am in İzmir.I came here for some business.
Sent by the companyto control a shipment.
How are you?
How is dad?
I may visit you once my work is done.
"I won't come thereif you don't want me, mom."
"Okay, okay."
I'm busy.
Let us not talk about it right now.
I'll call you later.
"Okay, see you later."
Which flight did you say?
Don't you have a sooner flight?
"Okay, book that ticket for me please."
"For 10 minutes, please.I'm on my way to the airport."
Help me out.

"I'm on my way to the airport.Yes, yes."
I'm trying to catch that flight.
"Okay, okay thanks."
- Fatmagül.- It's okay.
I'm fine.
"- Come, Kerim."
"Hey, Gypsy, you can't hold anything but a guitar."
Going to take it into battle with you?
His horse will wield the sword for him.
Ajugful of vodka for me!
"Come on, son."
"Here, hold my hands, guys."
"Hold his hands, come on."
I'll not have you breaking my cups!
"Away, you anti-Christ!"
Vodka!
Quick!
Give me another one!
"Come here, Ksanka."
"Good day to you, Uncle Sidor."
- Do the men bother you?
"- Oh, not at all."
Poor orphan.
I've brought you a present.
- You like it?
- It's lovely.
"- Wear it, if you like it."
- Thanks very much.
Go now.
- Anybody been to see her?
- Not a soul.
- Did she go out?
- No.
"If anything happens, I'll skin you alive."
She makes out to be innocent.
But I know she's connected with them.
They'll show up any day now.
"You see anything suspicious, let me know."
- What are you guys doing here?
- Get lost!
Go on!
"- All right, all right!"
"- Dima, let's lure it out."
- One moment.
Stand back.
"Kosmos, get him!"
- He's done for.

"- All right, hold the latch."
Now!
- What did you do that for?
- Kostya?
- Attention!
Listen to this information.
Tomorrow is Parents' Day.
"Tomorrow, my friends, we need to aim for record heights."
Yes.
In being disciplined...
In being orderly...
In being talented.
- Who's missing?
- Inochkin.
- Fill the gap.
"- So, what about talents?"
- I've got three.
- From the entire troop?
"Don't tell me there are no talents among you, my friends."
"Sorry, I don't believe that for a moment."
"- Half a meatball, everyone."
"- And if you can't sing or dance, you can recite a poem."
"I am Baek Sung Jo, Baek Sung Jo."
"At a time when she's not even thinking, when she bites her tongue..."
That's when it's easy to get them to fall for you!
When she bites her tongue.
"Hey, Hey!"
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Why are you doing this?
This is practice.
Practice?
The timing is important.
Look at this.
If the girl says
"""What is this?"
"What are you doing?!"" then you put your hands like this"
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" and just go in for the kiss."
Hey!
"You have talent, it's very real."
- Really?
"- Wow, so if the girls say ""What are you doing?"""
"Then, slam..."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me"""
Wait!
"Here, the timing is important."
When the girl lifts her head like this...
"Then,"
When she lifts her head...
"""Why?"
"What are you doing?"""
"Slam.  "" Try to forget me if you can."""
That's right.
That's it!
Anthony Gonsalves.
Did I really make this?
I don't believe it.
I can't believe that I made this?
The way it has landed I am completely sure you've made it.
What did you say?
- That's why professor.. ..only you can tell me how I can go back.
But why did you come here?
You mean to say.. ..you came here to make your parents fall in love.
What a rotten idea.
It's a stupid idea.
- You gave me.
"Professor, can you lend me some money?"
How much do you want?
"Professor, you're a rich man, whatever you can spare."
For Tanya.
- For Tanya.
Give me tea and bread.
"""Julie.."
"Brother Kundan."""
"""I love you."""
"""Julie.."
"Brother Kundan."""
"Brother Kundan, do you want to stay unmarried all your life?"
"Have you ever thought about love, marriage, girls.. ..or will I have to do that for you as well."
I did.
I also did.

Thrice.

"'I love you, Kamla.'"
'I want to marry you.'
Connor:
We need to find an elevator to get back to the surface.
Matt:
"Yeah, if James knows where they are..."
James:
"Look, if we follow the tunnels we'll get out."
Kate:
But... what about the people down there?
They could still be alive couldn't they?
Connor:
"Even if they are, there's nothing we can do for them."
Connor:
The best we can do is get out and try and get help.
Kate:
But if the radiation did that to them... then...
James:
No - we're safe now the machine's off.
James:
It's just the ring itself that's radioactive.
We're safe here.
Amy:
"Oh my god, all those people..."
Amy:
How could this happen?
James:
It couldn't have happened.
You can't turn the machine on when there are people down there.
James:
There are interlock systems everywhere.
Matt:
"Well somebody fucked up, and it wasn't me!"
Connor:
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
I feel suffocation over here.
I feel I'm jailed.
"Neither I can move about freely, nor can I sing."
And you've got no idea about music.
And you...
"Don't worry, baby."
We're with you.
It's just a matter of few days.
Moment the risk of goons is reduced we'll drop you home.
You'd never feel that.
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?

Perhaps I could come by your house afterwards ?
I could change clothes at your place.
Oh.
Uh... yeah.
I suppose that would be okay.
Sure.
- [ Engine Off ]
- Nice car !
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it ?
"No, I like the car."
"By the way, though, about prom ?"
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.
- What are you talkin' about ?
- Please.
I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.
But you are just a jock.
"No, wait."
You're a jerk.
Wait !
I don't understand.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
"Heather, I wasn't makin' fun of you."
Gimme a break.
You're so full of it.
Fuck me !

How are things with your boyfriend?
Your boyfriend...
Is it going well?
Did you propose to my sister?
You argued with your boyfriend?
You aren't speaking?
What a dunce.
Did you... propose to my sister?
"Don't worry, don't worry."
I'll find a better boyfriend for you.
You want to...
You want to make up with him...?
"Ah, you need some money?"
I'll give you some.
He really is thick-headed.

"I think you got it backwards there, buddy."
The duck is the thing you love.
The rabbit is the thing you hate.
What?
"Yeah, I got to agree."
"Ducks up, rabbits down."
Definitely.
Ducks are better than rabbits.
"I, I get, ducks are, ducks are..."
Rabbits are adorable.
"Ducks are, they're, have you ever been in a fight with a duck?"
"I mean, ducks are jerks."
(offscreen voice) This led to one of the most intense arguments our group has ever had.
Duck is delicious.
Rabbit is all gamey.
"We're not talking about flavor, Ted."
Flavor counts.
Who carries around a duck's foot for good luck?
Anyone?
You wrap yourself in comforter stuffed with rabbit hair.
I'll wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers.
Who's cozier?
Oh...
No no no no no no.
But who's cozier?
Hold on.
I have to get another book.
I concede!
You win.
"Honestly, I didn't care."
"This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena."
"Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want."
- Damn it!
- Hey!
Everything all right out here?
Hey.
"Jamie, go back inside, ok?"
Please.
Trust me.
It's better off for you there.
I don't think so.
I'd listen to her.
"Get back upstairs, man."
I said I don't think so.
"Get back upstairs before I tear your damn throat out, do you understand me?"
I don't think you realize how bad you've gotten!
"This is the way it has to be, Elena."
"Oh, yeah, right."
Out-villain the villain.
I get it.
You're not supposed to be here.
"Jamie, what are you doing?"
What I was told.
He's not supposed to be here.
"Elena, he's compelled."
What was that?!
What are you doing here?
"Ah, looking for a bunny."
You're good.
For now.
You still obsessed with Meredith?
A great sage from Dwarka set out for a journey on foot.. ..and that afternoon the sun was really scorching.. ..l gave him a jug of water to drink.
He was so pleased.
And gave me this idol.
And this idol turned my luck around.
"I bought this, once a rented shop.. ..and a three room house in Bhooleshwar."
With terrace.
With terrace.
Amazing!
"Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me."
I am in big trouble.
I'll rot in hell if I even think of selling my Lord.
Sell the God?
Look at what he's saying.
Mischievous...
Lord.
Listen carefully.
- Yes.
You can hear His flute.
It's time for him to play His flute.
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.
"Listen, you can hear the echo of Mathura."
"Rajastan, Om Sai Ram."
Heard it?
Can you hear?
"- Yes, yes."
Now leave.
- Sell this idol to me.
"Please, Mr. Kanji."
I'll let this idol out of my sight.. ..only when that special person arrives.
The chosen one.
Who is that?
I finally got a chance...
I should've brought a plain white t-shirt.
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
Let's start!
I want to hurry up and make something.
My mind and body aren't working together.
I can do this in my head.
None
"I was good a long time ago, really, a long time ago."
I drew very well a long time ago
When I followed friends around tagging graffiti walls
I thought I was pretty good.
I'm not used to this so I keep messing up.
A simple line should be easy to draw. but I can't even do that.
- I'm screwed.
- I'm screwed too.
I tried and tried to fix it.
But I messed up.
Where's yours?
- What picture is this?
- It's supposed to be...
- It should have a meaning.
- This is just a pattern.
The color wore off today.
So I tried another color...
None
I have a dream.
Never give up.
"Neat, huh?"
I'm finished.
My shoes.
We will see him together.
Okay have your seats.
He will be here soon.
Thank you.
"I see you put on a ring, Sami Bey."
"Yes, we did."
- Hayırlı olsun.
"- Amin, to all of us."
It's not much until 13 February.
"Yes, we're almost there."
- Excited?
- I'm too old to get excited like that.
Why do you say that?
You are still young.
You will have many great years together with Sami Amca.
"But still, you shouldn't listen to Cemre's marriage advices."
- Why?
"- I am getting divorced, that's why she's saying that."
"But Zeynepciğim, not even you can break my spirit today."
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
"I mean, I am getting rid of my hunchback."
I filed my petition.
Soon it will be over.
- I wish you the best.
"- By the way, no one had forced Cemre to marry..."
I made a big mistake.
Everything is for the humans.
Hello Can Bey.
"Yes, yes, we had sent them to the factory."
"Okay, I'll be there in half an hour."
See you.
Shame on you!
Hello!
I wanted to surprise you.
I went through here and I had to stop by.
- How is your new job and....
- Serdar...
Live me alone.
What?
Look around you.
Everybody is looking at us... me...
Do you know what is being widow here?
"Narin, what are you talking about?"
"I, with my family and child, will have a new life."
Stay away from me.
Don't come anymore.
"When you see me somewhere, go to other side."
"Forget me,"
"So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle?"
Minus or plus?
There it is this little pink plus sign is so unholy.
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch.
"This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet."
Just tell them.
I'm pregnant.
Who's the father?
It's Paulie Bleeker.
Paulie Bleeker?
I didn't know he had it in him!
"I know, right?"
Did you see that coming?
Yeah.
But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
I don't want to hear anything.
You will have to promise that you will not tell Suraj anything.
Why are you silent?
Promise me that you will not tell Suraj anything.
"All right, Vandana."
I'll do as you say.
I've got it!
This!
What did you get?
Did you find some treasure?
He is screaming as though he has found a treasure.
You'll dance forjoy when you hear the news.
My name and my picture will be in the papers tomorrow.
At least tell us about it.
What is the matter?
"Aunty, read this out to them."
Yes.
With your blessings.
Let me also see it.
- Wait!
"Oh, all right!"
Let her also read it.
"Congratulations, Suraj!"
I am delighted.
My friends have thrown a party and I'd like to take Renu along.
"Yes, of course. ..."
"Go and get ready, my child."
"Go and get ready, my child!"
Which is your favourite colour?
- What!
I mean.
Which colour sari should I wear?
Okay.
"All right, all right !"
"- Good hustle, guys."
- Good hustle.
But you can still lose.
You all saw what happened to Oz out there.
I don't want to ever see any of you thinking you're gonna score.
You don't score until you score.
- Until you score.
"- That's right, baby !"
[ Coach ]
It all boils down to today.
"For you seniors, this marks the culmination..."
- of the past four years.
- Culmination.
[ Coach ]
I want you to think about what this means to you.
Do you guys wanna look back on your days at East... and know that you used the time you had ?
"- Hell, yeah !"
- You do !
- Ah !
"Good attitude, Ostreicher."
"- Good luck, fellas."
"Christ, I didn't tell ya to leave the game."
"I'm sorry, Coach."
"You got someplace more important to be, Ostreicher ?"
Yeah.
Ostreicher !
Oz ?
Fuckface ?
[ Coach ]
Ostreicher !
He calls himself God.
I can see him.
He can see you.
"My name's Krishna, your new neighbour."
Neighbour?
Neighbour?
The person Kanji had mortgaged his house to.. ..has sold it to me.
Here are the documents.
"And, Kanji bhai, sorry for that joke about God."
What's this?
How can he sell my house to him?
I was about to pay him on time.
I already paid him.
This isn't done.
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.
Relax.
Chill.
"When you get your compensation from God.. ..you can repay me, I will leave."
"And anyway, I always leave after my project is over."
Why buy the house when you want to leave?
Are you a agent?
I am not that low.
I've a consultancy firm.
I give advice to people.
- Advice.
Anyone who thinks of me.
Public service.
Service open to all.
A solution to every problem.
Sometimes it gets slightly delayed.
But...l always get there on time.
And from that blood I'll write a name... ...outside Shreekant's bungalow.
Radha!
"That's great, mister!"
You lost before fighting a battle?
"No, sir."
I've not defeated.
Ever since my parents have died... ...I've been fighting life since then.
Sometimes with the name Jaikishan and sometimes as Jackie.
"My names kept changing, people kept changing."
But my destiny did not.
"But Mr. Bharat, the life of Jackie... ...is much better than Jaikishan."
Jackie is a goon.
Shreekant called me a goon.
- Mr. Jackie!
He called me a goon!
- Mr. Jackie!
Mr. Jackie!
"- Yes, I'm a goon, Shreekant."
I'm a goon.
"Fine, I don't want your daughter."
What do you think?
Will I come and beg at you?
Mr. Jackie!
- So what if I'm poor and orphan... ...I've lived on my own.
I'm very strong.
- Mr. Jackie.
I'm very strong!
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
Never mind if Radha's wedding cards are distributed... ...but I don't like Jimmy's character.
"Hey, look, I know it's hard."
But Jenna's gone.
And you're allowed to move on.
"Oh, you're still alive?"
I assume that means
Klaus didn't get his coffins.
"Well, don't look so happy."
I was only able to get one of them out in time.
The locked one.
Probably a good choice.
Yeah.
"You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's mama to open it, you're screwed."
She doesn't have any powers.
Ah.
Doesn't surprise me.
It's been that kind of night.
Is Elena ok?
I take it you two had a heart to heart.
And I take it you don't want to talk about it.
Noted.
So why don't we talk about this?
What did you do?
You have your family back.
Finally.
You're going to open them?
Not quite yet.
I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
What business?
"So, Niklaus..."
Elijah?
What did I miss?

He commands us because he has money!
I will tackle him!
What will we answer those from whom we have taken gold?
"lf this continues, then we will have to shut down our business!"
And what about my money?
Yes! - shut up!
John!

"Tell Jagga to stop only gold fish""s supply today."
"Remember, Pinto!"
Boat number 40 will surely depart! kaka sir! kaka sir!
DDT has taken the gold fish!
Thank you!
Thank you!

What is this?
Will I open a fish shop here?
I had told you to bring gold and not fish!
"Papa, you can""t eat gold!"
You can eat fish!
"And Pryor, the man I really wanted was you."
That's very flattering.
Maybe.
"But unless you want him to die in your place, you better get that money."
"Well, I'll-- I'll have to think about it."
"Well, don't you take long."
I'll call back and don't you call the police.
You're being watched.
Hello?
Hello?
Did you recognize that voice?
Was that anybody you knew?
"No, I don't think so."
Was that him again?
Yes.
He's got Jordan.
Apparently I was number one on his shopping list but he made a mistake.
"Are those the pictures, Mrs. Pryor?"
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, this one."
( dramatic theme playing )
You know this guy?
No.
I don't think so.
Do you?

We searched the car and found this photograph.
I have to fill in a report now.
Come with me later to report your brother's disappearance.
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?
There's blood there.
Where?
"The car's beat up, but blood?"
Okay.
I'll take it away.
- You'll take it the way it is?
- Thanks.
Well...
Pablo!
This is the Rio Grande Police Department.
Your call will be attended to in a few moments.
Please hold the line.
Rio Grande...
Pablo!
God!
My God!
God?.
"You communists spend half your lives trying to prove God doesn't exist and when things go wrong, you call his name."
But he won't hear you because you're on the wrong side.
"Dad, please don't hurt me."
I'm your daughter.
What's that?
You're my daughter?
My daughter Malena is 6 years old and she's at home with my wife.
You are not my daughter.
You're just a subversive piece of shit.
We're here to educate you people.
"Yes, sir!"
"What""s your age?"
"- 32, sir!"
32?
"- Yes, sir!"
What was your age when you joined the police force?
"32, sir!"
32?
"- Yes, sir!"
How long have you been in police service?
"- 32, sir! strange!"
How did you get stuck at 32?
"Yes, sir!"
"Yes, sir!"
You must have read about Bheesma Pitama in Ramayana!
"Not in Ramayana, I had read about him in Mahabharat."
"But you read it in lndia itself. sir, his age was 275 years."
"And the secret of his long life was that.. ..he was a bachelor like me. sir, you should count a person""s real age after his marriage."
You are right!
You are an interesting man!
"Yes, sir! sir, shall I come with you?"
"No! lf you want, you can go and.."
"Yes, sir!"
Now it is too late!
Did you patch up with your beloved?
That is not a problem.
"But her unlucky papa, he interferes a lot, boss!"
"Boss, give me such an idea.. such an idea.."
That he stops interfering!
"Yes, boss!"
He should be completely defeated!
What does her father wants?
Fine!
I am dead for you!
"But don""t instigate my son!"
Who are you to separate me from my son? son?
Whose son?
"A criminal""s son?"
"A smuggler""s son?"
Take your son!
I hate him! seema!
You can hate me as much as you want!
"But don""t abuse my son."
Nobody is born evil in this world.
"People""s circumstances make them evil."
"20 years ago, destiny played a cruel joke on my family."
You know.. my father used to work in the lighthouse. stop!
Think before you do anything!
I have thought about it!
"Let""s inform the police!"
How will we reach to the police? smugglers have surrounded the lighthouse!
Have you also joined hands with them?
You may think so.
Traitors!
"Today because of people like you.. ..the country""s state is bad!"
Patriot! sheela!
You! - shekhar!
What happened to you?
- Father!
Who has done this to you?
Traitors!
Raman has joined hands with the smugglers!
Today I saw him.. and he did this to me!
"I won""t spare him!"
It's our nation.
"You crack jokes about me, maybe not in public but I'm sure you do when you go home."
[Laughter]
Okay so thank you.
"Do you mind if we don't ask your question Derrick, because we've gone over time."
"So maybe can we.. sorry, no announcements, so the announcement is - there is no announcements tonight!"
[Laughter].
"So if you've got any other questions or you'd like to discuss that matter with me afterwards sir, please come up after the talk is finished."
Look I can be a shark.
Now my whole house is great.
I can do anything good.
I like my school.

I like my dad.

I like my whole house! ♪ My whole house is great.
I can do anything good.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
I can do anything good.
"Better than anyone, better than anyone. ♪"
No.
"Look, I'm telling you the truth."
"You've gotta trust me, Pete."
"Mate, you've put me right fucking in it."
If I don't convince those boys... ...that the head of their firm was not just taken by a fucking Yank journo... ...the GSE is done.
So I'm gonna go out there... ...and I'm gonna tell them that Bov's got it wrong... ...and that you're one of us.
And I had better be fucking right.
"So, Bovver... ...is there anything else you wanna tell us?"
"Listen, Tom, please."
This is how it's gotta go down.
"You're the only one going down, little Bovver."
Grass.
Fuck.
This shit with Bovver could tear this firm apart.
"Mate, I need you."
"Stay with us, just through Millwall."
I'm not gonna help you.
"I made a promise to my wife and kids, all right?"
And I'm sticking to it.
"You know, there comes a time... ...when the best reputation you can have is the one where your family--"
- What is it?
- Get down.
Get the fuck down.
"Hello, boys."
Jesus.
Pete.
"Pete, come on, man!"
"Hello, Terry."
Fuck off!
Terry.
Terry.
Look who's back in the fucking Abbey after all these years.
"That was because I felt like you were doing the wrong thing, not because I hated you."
"We're friends, that's why I..."
I took care of Choi Chul Joo.
The girls have all been returned to their parents.
And Choi Chul Joo... paid for his crimes.
Did you do it?
That's great!
"Well done, Young Master!"
I always knew you were a good person!
You're smiling!
Look at that!
"If you do good, you'll smile automatically!"
Look at how nice you look when you smile!
That's enough.
Fine.
You're so stiff.
Why did you hug me like that just now?
"Young Master, do you...?"
Did any suspicious men come for you?
How did you know that?
- Then what happened?
- Suspicious men did come for me.
Who are you?
Are you Heo Yi Nok?
"That's right. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yi Nok, what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Send him away!
I...
I'm so full that I've laid down.
How did they...?
"My granddaughter has never been full in her life, you fools!"
That's fortunate.
I'm really lucky.
It doesn't have to fall on you.
The coffin is spelled shut.
That makes it a witch problem.
So it does fall on me.
I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later.
Sooner.
"Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina."
"Born in Mystic Falls hospital, graduated Mystic Falls High, blah, blah, blah."
A little compulsion helps to speed up the research process.
This is her.
"Yep, road trip."
I call shotgun.
"Yeah, no."
Why?
You want me to hang out in the back with you?
"You're not coming, Damon."
Why?
I'm the one who found her.
"Ok, Damon, look,"
Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years.
We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.
What's going on with you two?
We kissed.
Now it's weird.
Have a great trip.
What are you doing here?
I came to apologize.
Apologize?
You bit me.
I could have died.
"I think we're way past apologies, Tyler."
That's the problem.
Feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
He released me from a curse that was ruining my life.
I owe him for that.
I need you to bite your girlfriend.
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
Consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you.
Ahhh.
Oh!
"Oh, no."
Did you just...Bite me?!
Caroline!
Get away from me!
I figured out how to open it.
Can you?
Let me out!
Please!
"Oh, my God, oh, my God."
Hey!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I've been having these dreams for days now.
It's like the witches are trying to send me a message.
I just can't believe you guys have kept this from me this whole time.
"Stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were,"
Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you.
So these are the rest of his family?
"Yeah, Elijah and two others."
Now this one...
Is the one we can't open.
"Jackie is injured, sir."
He can't go much far.
He must be somewhere nearby.
D'souza!
Wherever he's...
I can't return home until I find him.
You... sir?!
"- Yes, I..."
Now I'll bring Jackie dead.

"Mustafa, this girl is very beautiful, too."
But...
There is pain in her eyes.
Have you burned this girl?
She burned you?
"No, I don't believe that..."
"These eyes have learned to get burned,  they don't know how to burn."
"These looks are not the ones that burn,  they are the ones that get burned."
Narin?!
I'm here...
"Narin, where are you?"
"This is my fate, Yasar..."

"I won't be able to be beside him until I die, but..."
I will always look at my husband from a distance...
Like this...
I will always look at my husband.
You haven't been eating...
They said so...
You should eat...
Think of your child...
Narin...
Where have you been?
"Where have you been, Narin?"
"I have been in the hell that you put me, Mustafa... (Singing in Kurdish)"
You are a rose
A spring rose
You are the light of my soul
You are a rose
Open up
"Sister, you keep watch."
See where you're hiding
"Sister, come in and help me find him"
Learn it now
Have you seen my brother-in-law going out?
No
ln the toilet.
Go and find him
Open up， open up quickly
Come out quickly to get punished
Open up.
Come out and you'll see it

You can kill any human trampling this way
Maybe you're seeing things.

Don't!
"Gil Dong, the soldiers are coming!"
"Run, quickly!"
I told you not to look for me!
There's no time!
"I'll try to divert the soldiers, so you run that way!"
You!
Are you going to die in my stead?
Why would I die?
Do you know how fast I am? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm faster than you and faster than arrows!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
So run away!
How can you be faster than arrows? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stupid girl.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I don't hear anything now.
Do you think they're far from here?
I can't see.
Move your hand...!
Who are you?
Do you know me?
Hey!
Hey!
Chungyi ran away!
I know.
She's safe.
But we have a problem.
Why are you running away?
Hey!
That's... that's Doe Eyes!
We can't be seen by her.
We have to go!
Where did he go?
Hey! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Are you in here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Why did you just leave like that?
Who are you? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Why did you help me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- She wasn't that bad.
- What?
Telling the only cool boy in Eastbourne I have flatulence issues is okay?
I don't think he took any notice.
"And, anyway, he was well into you before your mum came in."
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.
You were great asking him about his band and stuff.
"- And he likes cats, like me."
- Yep.
Did you see the way Tom held onto my hand a little too much
- when he gave me the onions?
- He didn't!
He is so gorgeous!
They're both beyond the Valley of the Gorgeous.
"Oh, are you sure my mum hasn't ruined it?"
"Oh, GG, it was really fab."
- Fabbity fab?
- With knobs on.
And Robbie will understand.
All parents say stupid things.
He'll probably like you more 'cause he'll feel bad you've got a mum that's beyond bonkerdom.
You're right.
"God, Robbie's just so muscley and dreamy and..."
"- Tom said, ""See you later."""
- I know.
So did Robbie.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
Do you think Tom says that to everyone
"like a sort of ""See you later"" sort of thing?"
No.
Wait!
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Aw, Mike!"
"Michael, we love you."
"Okay, everybody."
That's a wrap.
- Good day.
- Where are we from?
From Galanta.
"My name is Katka Szabová, I'm from Galanta,"
I'm 26 years old.
Are you nervous?
- Of course.
- Can we help you anyhow?
"- Sorry, but you will sing?"
- Me.
"(Ja - German word for ""yes"")"
- Ich verstehe.
"- Also gut dann, na ja."
Do you think you can sing?
"Of course, I also think I can sing."
"All right, we will finish this discussion after the performance."
We should not dig into it any further.
Here you go!
"No art, no skill, just a feeling, but for me it belongs to those who perform or entertain, they can't do much, only create an atmosphere, but here she took too much."
She did not.
- That's the kind of people.
- She did.
"Katka, I want to say, that Paľo pushed this."
I just want the good for you.
Let me ask: would anybody of you pay for this?
We're not here in some singing school.
"I beg your pardon, but when is today?"
I don't care about today!
It's boring!
Every day - it is today.
How do we cope with that?
Can it be that one day Time will stop and we will say:
Yesterday is every morning.
Life is awfully boring.
"Life is awfully boring, Yesterday is every morning."
"Let tomorrow come today, It is where we hurry."
"Let the future come our way, - Then we wouldn't worry."
Don't you see that everything around belongs tomorrow?
Don't you feel the future has already come?
"lf the future had come, now it would have been... the New Year!"
The New Year?
The New Year?
Let it be the New Year!
"What, what New Year?"
The New Year doesn't come just like that.
You have to see it in.
Then let's!
"Let's, let's see it in!"
Let's!
"I'd say, why don't we really see it in?"
"It is so pleasant, my friends, to see in the New Year."
Very pleasant.
How?
How?
How shall we see it in?
"To see in the New Year, we need, first of all, a Christmas tree."
"Secondly, Santa Claus."
"And, last but not least, the Snow Maiden."

"I don""t know where the gold is! sardar, you don""t know."
But kaka sir surely knows.
"Am I right, kaka sir?"
"Won""t you serve your country?"
"Mr. Diwan, I can even lay down my life for my country! kaka sir.. where is shekhar?"
"- I don""t know! kaka sir, don""t fool us!"
Where is the culprit?
"I think you don""t know that the government will reward.. ..the person who helps to seize the gold by giving 10% share. kaka sir, constable is right."
We give you 10 minutes to think.
You can think.
We are waiting for you outside.
"Let""s go, Mr. Diwan!"

Yes!
My best friend and your son-in-law!
"We are forced to doubt him, Mr. Diwan."
Mr. Rajesh.. so what if he is my son-in-law?
"Even if my child had been a culprit.. ..still I wouldn""t have been lenient."
Thanks.
This is what I expected from you.

Patriotism and business are not linked with each other!
Got it? - okay!
Where is shekhar?
"He has gone to Alibagh to meet his wife. shekhar, look at your state."
Why do you wander around like this?
"Why don""t you surrender yourself to the police?"
At least you will feel at peace.
Peace?
"That""s why l have always helped.. ..the police in the name of patriotism. seema.. now what I am doing.. ..l am doing it for peace of my mind."
That day is not far away when you will take my name with pride.
Beware!
That day will never arrive! shoot him!
"lf you want to save the child""s life.. then drop the revolver."
"lf you didn""t come out till I count 5.. ..then we will kill the child!"

"I won""t let this happen!"
"What has happened, Kishan?"
What has happened?
"Will he survive, Mr. Shashtri?"
Doctor said the next 24 hours are critical.
No!
"- Child, I'm a manager of this guest house cum temple."
I've witnessed any tough wishes getting fulfilled.
If your love is true... ...Goddess will have to favour you.
This is a true lover's oath to the Goddess... ...until my Kishan regains conscience... ...I'll not wear these bangles.
But my child. how did this happen?
He's a police officer.
Goons killed tow of our men.
And we've no clue about the rest of the four.
Wonder where they would be.
You very well know where Jackie is.
Where's Jackie?
Where's Jackie?
Tell us Jackie's whereabouts and we'll release you.
Tell us.
Tell us where's Jackie?
Radha!
Kishan!
Kishan!
"Goddess heard my prayer, Kishan!"
You are alright.
You are alright.
You are alright.
"At least now drink some water, my child."
"Thank you, Goddess."
"Sir, Jackie's two men are killed."
And four are jailed.
"Still, you couldn't bring my daughter."
"Wow, it is cold."
I heard it's supposed to be really hot here.
I always envisioned this place with the sun shining all the time...
- It rained today.
- Cool.
None
- Let's go over there.
- There's nothing here.
"Board shop, board shop!"
I like this.
None

You know Dropkick Murphys?
Dropkick Murphys!
My ideal girl looks good simply in a white top and blue jeans.
This is the perfect size.
I only bought one pair of shoes.
I'm picking out clothes now.
"I have to buy a board, a board."
All done.
Zelo is very excited right now.
Zelo!
Don't I look silly?
Can I see how I look?
My hair got short all of a sudden.
"For this album, I was going for a different look"
"With an American feel, in general."
So I cut my hair real short for a unique styling.
"lf I don't style this hair and go out,"
Then I look kind of foolish.
I've always tried to cover my ugly face with hair.
So I grew my hair out but now I can't even do that.
"Well, again, Tilda Swinton."
Thank you so much for doing this.
It's really a treat.
"We'll get into your career in a moment, but first I'd just"
like to ask you about the name Tilda.
It's Pretty unusual.
How did your parents choose that name?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"It's a funny story, really."
Most people do think it is short for Mathilda.
"Actually, it is, it is long for Ilda."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, that's counter intuitive."
So your parents just named you Ilda?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"No, no."
I chose it for myself on my second solstice.
Mommy and poppy never gave me a name.
"Not that they didn't love me, but woodland cattle can't speak."
Most people know this.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
"So tell me, Tilda, when did you know that you wanted to be an actress?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I am not an actress.
That's a pretend name for a job that does not exist.
I am a gardener of art.
I grow it.
I pluck it.
I eat it.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Then let's set aside acting for a moment.
This is the improved version of flamingo.
If you insert money here...
-How is it?
Do you want a glass?
-I'm all right.
I got rid of three lions today.
"Wow, I caught a leopard and two hippos."
"Everything you need for safari, from guns to clothes, you can borrow here."
There are different classes; Class A gets a jeep and two assistant robots.
"Class B only gets a jeep, and Class C gets one assistant robot."
This is just beyond my imagination.
"Thank you for inviting, but I'm leaving now."
"Wait, I called you because I wanted to ask you a favor."
Please come here.
Hey!
Wait!
Where are you going?
I see.
He thinks I'm his mom.
Watch out!
"One, two, three."
This was a robot as well.
Hey!
Come out now.
It's not scary anymore.
"Look, bad snakes are..."
Hold on!
I can't leave you alone since it's so dangerous around here.
"We robots are also friends with animals, as well as with humans."
All right.
"Since it's hard to call you, I'm going to name you Pura."
Pura.
You're really smart?
Are all those people with you well?
Of course!
I didn't even get a chance to greet them properly.
"Yes, we were preoccupied too because of Gil Dong...!"
Damn it!
I know Gil Dong is dead.
"Yes, we heard the news too."
- Were you alright when you heard?
- Of course.
The living must keep on living.
"That's good, Doe Eyes."
You've forgotten him already.
What are you doing?
Still peddling medicine?
"No, my grandfather sells the medicine."
I work for Yongmun.
Yongmun?
"I'm really close to the Young Master, and somehow I ended up working for them."
"By Young Master, you mean that fellow that is slightly better-looking than me?"
"That's right, the good-looking Young Master."
He must be really nice to you.
"I'm not that dumb, you know."
But I think the Young Master is in love with me.
He must have bought her another chamber pot.
"The other day, he embraced me!"
- So how did you feel?
- Me?
I...
I just...
Why are you asking me that?
Just drink.
-What's happenin' guys?
Yo!
Do people still say yo?
Can I say yo?
"Well, I'm sayin' it."
Yo!
Dawg!
Check out this awesome attempt at this assisted backflip.
"-One, two, three... [groaning]"
-Fayul!
That's my new thing.
Fayul!
That's not my new thing.
But this attempted flip was a fail.
"Now, the original video was relatively hidden, but I guess the guy submitted it to FailBlog and now it has over a million views."
But most of the comedy comes from the poor dude here who gets kicked in the head and then busts his face on the fire extinguisher.
[crash!]
Did you hear that sound?
It sounded like a f--king car wreck.
[laughter]
And then you got the friend over here who literally ROFLs.
"That ROFL would make an amazing GlF, wouldn't it?"
"-Rahahaha, rahahaha..."
"-All right, that's it."
I'm done with that video.
Yo.
"Sometimes, you know, your friend gets herself stuck in the dryer."
"And it's cool, you know, it happens to the best of us."
-Whoo!
"-Come on, get out!"
-I can't!
[laughter]
Reşat Bey has been waiting for you.
- Hello.
- Hello Turaner Bey.
"Believe me, I am terribly sorry."
We're facing a very ugly slander.
"But, we won't let it go any further."
- We took our precautions.
"- It's too late, Reşat Bey."
It will be front pages of every big newspaper in the early edition.
[Song:
Kimseye Etmem Şikayet Singer:
Şevval Sam]
Oh God!
"Is he OK, Fevzi?"
Is he wounded?
Call an ambulance.
Quick!
"OK, I am on it."
For the love of God.
Don't talk reproachfully to me.
Please.
- Do you know how bad I feel?
"- I can imagine, my dear."
But you didn't call me once today.
"You make me feel lonely, when I need to hear your voice the most."
"Don't talk as if you don't know what I've been doing, and how busy I am."
I'm working to clean up those idiots mess.
"And now we have the girl's fiancé deal with, too."
I weaved between the town and the prosecution office all day.
I didn't have time to blink an eye.
It won't be easy to cover this up.
I am so scared.
I have been waiting for this day for so long!
You always wait for bad days.
But not me!
Let me tell you!
"I won""t get seema married to him!"
Listen..
Lajwanti!
You know they are childhood friends!
They like each other!
To hell with that!
I have always been against this relationship!
And I will always be against it!
"More than me, you will regret it."
"Aunt, I have come to talk about my friend Rajesh alliance""s.. ..and not my alliance."
For sP?
"Why didn""t you tell me before?"
We accept this alliance!
Wait!
I will just bring sweets!
ls somebody there? shekhar.. what is all this?
"lt""s all about destiny, Mr. Diwan. congratulations! shekhar! shekhar, what have you done?"
ls this the reward of my love?
"No, seema."
Fate is testing me.
Friend has asked for the sacrifice of love.
"But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, shekhar!"
"What""s my fault?"
"I am helpless, seema. l have given my promise."
"Now even if God told me, still I can""t break my promise."
Who are you to take decision of my destiny?
lf you are helpless then I too am helpless!
"But I can""t kill my love like this!"
Who will treat me like a human?
"Look, don't behave like this."
Think that your baby feels whatever you feel right now.
"Ok, my baby..."
"Ok, my baby..."
I shut up...
Everything is fine.
Ok...
Narin...
"I didn't have the face to come to you, so I came to your mother."
"But, God wanted you to hear what I said."
You see...
Have you heard?
"Ok, don't forgive me and Mustafa, but..."
Please don't attribute our sins to this innocent baby.
"You have a conscience, Narin..."
Don't leave us in the dark...
Please Narin...
"The things Asiye told, are they true?"
Is Mustafa like a child?
"Yes, that's true."
"He didn't recognize me, either."
He only recognized only you from the pictures.
All of these wouldn't happen if he could forget only me.
You're right.
Don't go alone at this hour.
I will go alone.
I am not afraid.
"My lord, brighten my path and keep my heart pure..."
Please don't see me as one of your cruel servants...
Good morning Yasar...
Could you please take me to Mustafa?
I wrote a letter to him.
It's easier then speaking.
I explained everything from the beginning.
I told him you and me were too new.
Then I told him everything I feel.
"My emotion, my concerns, everything."
I poured my heart out to him.
I hope he'll understand me.
How are you?
Are you in the station?
"Yes, I am drown in paper work since I was called back to duty."
I thought that case was closed.
"I mean, the guy is caught."
It is over.
"A second Demet, please hold on a sec."
"Hello, yes Aziz?"
"Deniz Hanım, returned to the country a week after she left it."
- And she didn't leave again.
- So she's in Turkey for two and a half months.
"- Yes, abi."
"- Okay, thanks."
- Hello.
"- Hello, what's up?"
Maybe I should call you later.
There's a connection between Ferhat's daughter and the man who said he killed Ferhat.
"I need to talk to Mirza, please find a way."
"There's no way, Deniz."
If they see you with him... ... it will peril the plausibility of his statement.
Maybe he'll die even before the trial.
The last reports were very bad.
- Wish I could at least say goodbye.
- He doesn't want that.
Why can't we do that?
Speak up
Can't we not hear it?
No， she must tell me why
My mammy said a man getting intimate with a girl before marriage may desert her some day
Did your mammy tell you that?
"I was not in， sister, right?"
My daddy told me I must try it by any means
Otherwise， she may become secondhand like her
Right What?
My mammy told me like that
My daddy told me like that
What now?
Well， your daddy's right， and so's your mammy
But that bloody ghost won't give up so easily
What now?
Go down for the wedding night
Okay
Go now
"Sister, now the 1st thing is to take a bath"
Hurry up
Why are you wearing a hat?
Higher
Open up， Mimi， the groom's here
Take care

"Go home, it's going to rain."
You'll get drenched.
It's an earthquake.
Swamiji Rain?
Rain?
- Rain?
My hand's paining.
I won't be able to write my exam tomorrow.
I'll slap you.
I'll make you hold the pen in your mouth and write your paper.
You're scolding him.
But what about you?
- What did I do?
What?
The festivities were left incomplete.
You've to admit that there's God.
You spread the rumour.. ..and immediately there was an earthquake.
- Remember.
- What earthquake?
Even the utensils didn't budge.
Papa.
I think they took your announcement too seriously.
This news just came in from parts of the country.. ..that the idol of Sri Krishna's eating butter.
ls the Lord eating butter?
- No.
"Priest, offer the Lord some buttermilk."
"People are offering cheese, cottage-cheese.. ..butter, buttermilk to the idol of Krishna."
"- Oh, God!"
The rumour has spread so far.
"Please, eat it."
This is low-cholesterol cheese.
"Well, uh, let's see, something wrong with the distributor I think."
Want me to give you a hand?
Thank you.
I sure appreciate it.
"Well, it doesn't look too serious."
Good.
( dramatic theme playing )
( phone rings )
I'll get it.
Hello.
"Uh, let me talk to your mother."
"It's for you, Mom."
Hello.
Hello.
Mrs. Pryor?
Yes.
"Now, you look, I've got your husband."
What?
"If you want to get him back you're gonna have to pay me $100,000."
What are you talking about?
I guess you heard me all right.
Now you better start thinking about that money.
"For your information, my husband is right here at home."
"Believe me, I've got him and I'm not going to give him back until you pay."
"It's the first time I've done this kind of thing and I'm nervous about it, so don't kid around with me because I might hurt the man."
I don't know what kind of a sick mind you've got but I don't appreciate your sense of humor.
( dramatic theme playing )
Cheyney...
did you make the call?
"Cheyney, did you make the call?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well, what'd she say, Cheyney?"
Nobody's in it.
"Um, I think there's only one floor with any people on it."
[Anthem playing in background]
"We're in the hotel room and, um, we've been told that they're bugged."
That they're listening to us.
I don't know if whispering is going to help.
That might be where it all stems from.
Hello!
Hello!
"Come in, Come in Tokyo."
"Hello, Hello."
"Hello, Hello."
We're here.
[Woman singing on TV]
"Right after we get there, we were taken for our first meal."
"The first time you eat in North Korea, it's kind of a sign of the very weird things to come."
[Girls laughing]
[Girl speaking Korean]
Is this where we go?
Here?
The table is over here.
We're in a big banquet room.
As you can see it's huge.
There's about 20 women who are getting ready for our dinner.
"First of all, they give you about 3 or 4 courses of absolutely inedible food."
It's just matter.
It's like fried matter.
"And you're kinda going, yeah, yeah."
"But you're waiting for every one to fill in, when's this banquet happening?"
When's the banquet?
There is no banquet.
Where is everyone?
No
No one smells anything
I definitely smell a chicken
"Alright, man."
I wanna clean fight Let's get it on
Wait a minute is he gonna use those gloves
What's wrong with my gloves
"Well, won't they get in the way of all the scratching and slapping? *"
You're gonna rock his world.
Punish him.
You're the man
Good luck
Come on.
Stuart
"You're like a wild animal, aren't you"
"Well, how am i supposed to fight you if you keep running around like a sissy?"
A sissy
Yeah

How good of a friend is he?
"Actually, we're very tight, but I'm totally ok with you beating the crap out of him."
"Come on ,Dorothy"
Is that all you got? here comes one from macy's basement.
"1,2,3,4....."
Don't sweat this.
Only 14 more rounds to go. here we go!
"How are you doing, Stuart, alright."
How many fingers am I holding up?
Say two
He's fine
"Come on, Bring it"
You're not gay
We need to stand up in that complaining all the time
If I hear one more person go
Oh my god.
I am so sick of white guys dating all of our women
I will slap you (slap) (slap) (slap) (slap)
And if an Asian girl only dates white guys
Who cares?
There's billions and billions of women
Even if you are not an Asian guy
Let this be a lesson
"You tell yourself, you are the bottom"
You are usually right!
"So,,, Shut up with that negative attitudee"
Yeah...
That's all I have to say.
So..
Byeeeee (Waving)
A Day for an Affair
- Hi.
- Hi.
-What did you do today?
- I went to the school and handed out lunch.
"-On my way home, I bought a couple of fish."
-What are you wearing?
My pajamas!
-Why are you wearing a uniform?
- I have a ceremony today.
I'm buying a cell phone today.
It's been ages since my old one broke.
A cell phone?
Your phone's right there.
You said you didn't need it anymore.
It's my first time on an elevator in Las Vegas.
You haven't in the hotel?
Did you walk up to the hotel room?
We were on the 20th floor.
- We didn't film then.
- You're right.
That's why this is my first time.
"Wow, elevators in Las Vegas go up too."
Same as Korean ones.
Great work.
It feels just like Las Vegas.
Great work.
We're in Las Vegas.
We just finished shooting for the MV.
I had an all-nighter yesterday and couldn't sleep today.
I just woke up in the middle of my nap to come to the shooting.
The director expected me to look awake.
"So I was jumping around, trying to be hyper."
Thankfully the scenery was great
So I could get in a happy mood.
(Satisfied) I'm feeling pretty good now.
I'm all done filming so I'll be leaving with the photographer.
None
We played like crazy on the bus.
You can only check it out in the MV.
We'll be all done at the desert.
The desert scene is the final one.
"""We're Hurricane, We're Hurricane"""
I've gone insane.
I've been up for almost 24 hours.
We're heading to the desert now it'll take about 20-30 minutes.
"It's where the scorpions live, my favorite."
I don't wanna write all those extra essays they make you do.
"I mean, how am I supposed to know what my ""most emotionally significant moment"" was ?"
"So when my ""U"" of ""M"" acceptance came in December, I just said the hell with it."
- Onions ?
- What ?
"You, uh, want onions ?"
"Oh, no, thank you."
So what are you gonna major in ?
"State's got a good business school, and I could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team."
"Well, you've probably got it pretty figured out, then, huh ?"
"I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but... what am I gonna be, a professional lacrosse player ?"
I really have no idea.
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.
"Well, you're not."
So we're gonna be close next year.
You mean East Lansing and Ann Arbor ?
Yeah.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Stifler ]
What are you talkin' about ?
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.
[ Laughing ]
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
"I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me."
Finch.
Shit-brick.
"Oh, gosh."
I-I forgot.
[ Stammering ]
You look okay.
When are you available?
"And now, Hong has a report on today's weather."
"When you go out today, be sure to take an umbrella."
We are expecting showers today.
The rain should cool down this unseasonably early heat.
After the showers pass...
It'll rain today.
Soo-jeong
Hwi-chan!
NO ENTRY except Snow White &amp;amp;amp; 7 Dwarfs!
Help me out.
"If this keeps up, our son will be uncontrollable."
Because it keeps getting more serious!
How can you be so laid back about this?
"He's your son too, isn't he?"
All you do is accuse me of being overbearing.
"Oh, whatever!"
It's because you never seem to care about anything.
Okay.
I have an incoming call.
Let's talk at home.
"Yes, Ms. Kim."
How are you?
This is Hwi-chan's picture diary.
Take a look.
"These days especially,"
He seems to have many complaints about you.
"I'm aware that much of what he writes are lies, but..."
- I need to see my son.
"- But, he's in another class now."
"Maybe later, you should talk in a quieter environment."
Please sit down.
Ferhat's daughter.
He wanted to make the guy stay away from his daughter.
- Did the boy harm his daughter or something?
- No.
It's just jealousy.
He wanted to give him a scare.
You know.
- Hello Aziz.
- How can I help you commissary?
"Ferhat's daughter, Dennis Norton."
Check if she entered the country lately.
It can be under either Dennis Norton or Deniz Çoşkun name.
"English passport or Turkish passport, okay?"
- I'll check the last three months.
"- Okay, let me know."
"- Hello, Demet."
- I've just seen your message.
I was suffering in wonder why she didn't reply to my message.
"It said ""call me"" in your message."
What happened?
"What do you mean ""what happened""?"
We didn't see each other in days.
I want to see you.
"Even if it's for only 5 minutes, please."
"Give me some time, please."
I don't feel okay with this.
"I know, I feel uneasy too."
But I miss you.
This can't go on when Kuzey is this much opposed to it.
We can't do it without his consent.
What consent are you talking about?
"Each passing day, his barks are getting thicker."
Here it is.
That's right.
"This is the elevator at the Market Parking Garage in Roanoke, Virginia."
This elevator has been made famous right here.
Here we go.
"Here we are at six, which is burned out."
Just your basic Dover elevator.
"For all of those of you at Dover Elevators, a good brand of elevator."
Now we're gonna go back down to one.
All right.
Now it's time to go off to work.
[engine turning]
Wasn't that fun?
Gray:
You know how much strength it takes to rebel?
Ha.
"So this is a night in the life of S. Gray, man."
You know what I'm saying?
Sleeping on the coach... with nobo--
Grinding my ass off every day.
Shorties not enjoying their mother.
Man not enjoying his wife or his woman--his lady.
[baby wailing]
"Just bullshit, man."
Alpha male trapped in and locked in through religion and politics.
"Soon enough, man, my plans will all come into perfection."
[celestial choir]
[man snores]
[phone rings]
[toy rattles]
[alarm beeping]
[rooster crows]
He's dating Carla.
This's not good.
"First of all, I already told her I got a girlfriend."
"Second, you just put your bare lips on my ear."
How is it going?
I'm....
"JD, I know. he won't stop talking about you."
I'm Jennifer.
"Mmm, Jennifer."
Do you really spend everyday saving children lives?
Tell the nice lady.
I do what I can.
I know two things to be true about bars.
"One they are always packed the week of thanksgiving,"
"And two, put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth"
"I was laughing so hard, milk was coming of my nose."
I was tripped over IV and blood shot over everyone
A little got on my nose.
Every damn day saving those children.
Who wants margaritas?
"Dube, less blood, more fruity drinks."
Right.
That's the thing about Turk.
He hasn't changed a bit since college.
He's still the same goofball who tells me how to be cooler.
"Dude, this girl's pretty hot."
"So try not to blow it,okay?"
Why do you say that?
"Because you're like a 24 convenient store , you never close."
That sounds a Fat Albert like joke
Don't worry about it man.
"I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying."
It's going to be about German industry norms.
"I wish you good luck, I hope it's going to be perfect!"
The following incident is a reenactment.
Professional actors will depict different characters in each episode.
That was a mistake!
Nobody checks the handicapped sticker.
"Mom, we're just not comfortable with it."
"Yeah, and it's a really expensive ticket, by the way."
"Well, I got a bum knee and a broken vagina."
Ticket that!
(DlNG!
DlNG!
DlNG!)
MOTHER'S DAY
"Good afternoon, welcome to the El Fuerte..."
What's good about it?
Sorry!
It was a long drive.
Ha ha ha!
"Um, we have our registration."
You got room in the trash for Mama?
Unless you want my crust.
"Trust me, you don't want that."
My sister and I are on the list.
"And, um, we have our mom with us today."
Does she have a reservation with us?
I have a reservation about your haircut.
It should be under Turner.
P F-ing U!
Either something died in this...
"Ma, I'll put you back in the car so fast."
Oh G-d!
"Catch a disease, nonsense..."
"Alright, we won't be disturbed here"
"Thank you, Loulou"
"Ohlala, I need to pee, I need to pee"
Go
Is it coming yet?
"Oh, that's good"
"Careful with the pants, though"
"Stop talking to me, you're distracting me!"
It's coming alright?
"Yes, it is!"
"Great, byyyeeeee"
"No, Jean!"
"Stop, Jean, stop!"
It's been a long time since we last went to a club!
Huh?
"I was saying, it's been a long time since we last went to a club!"
Yeah yeah
"Brings back memories, hmm?"
Yeah yeah
Which memories does it bring back?
Yeah!
Alright well I'm going to hit on every guy here and sleep with the first one I meet
"Jean, go screw yourself!"
Cool
"But, Loulou, can you hear what I'm saying?"
"Yeah, yeah, you told me to go screw myself and that you were gonna sleep with the first guy you meet"
"Alex, just because the music is loud doesn't mean what you're saying suddenly became interesting, you see?"
It's boring
Do you have a mint?
Want one?
"No, that's for you"
Look.
What's he doing?
- What..
"Everything's lost, Kanji."
Only thing left is this Godrej safe.
Rolex.
It's a Rolex.
- Nah.
Mr. Dinesh. lsn't that a Rolex watch you're wearing?
Must be worth 1.5 -2 lakhs.
It's worth 10.
Mr. Kanji.
I am sure you read the terms and conditions.. ..before reading the policy.
"Not at all, sir."
Your officer asked me to sign at the places marked.. ..and I did so.
How irresponsible you are.
"What happened, sir?"
"Your policy insures you against.. ..accidents like theft, fire, fraud."
Right.
That's what we opted for.
But not against Act of God.
Act of God?
"See, it's written here clearly."
Conditions apply.
My glasses.. - ln the event of loss or damage to the property.. ..the insurance company is not liable to pay.. ..any amount if the damage is caused by act of God.
And here are your signatures.
It's written in such small letters.
And nobody reads that.
What is 'Act of God'?
lncidents that are not caused by humans.
Like?
"- Like earthquake, Tsunami, Thunder."
Just to feel better about yourselves
Ahmed from the Bank
Hello?
Yes Mr.Ahmed
What?
When did this happen?
Okay Mr.Ahmed
I'll pass by
Thanks
What's wrong?
Dad took all his belongings from the bank
What?
"I don't know, let's go where to?"
To see why dad did this
Mr.Sameh
What's wrong?
I wanted to tell you something before you go
Just say it!
I entered the room and saw him in the bathroom
"His bag was open, I don't know why, and I found a lot of contracts and papers and thought I should tell you"
What contracts?
Donating the car and this house after he dies and he's gonna sell our land
Oh god!
And when did he do that?
The dates took place the same period when he was gone
And where are these contracts?
Upstairs in his bag
What have we ever done to deserve this?
Where is he now?
Upstairs
No...we need to put an end to this
Come on lets go
Tonight I am hanging out with Emily. woman:
Okay. man:
But I was planning on telling her exactly how I feel about her.
And then I don't know.
So I was calling my mother to see-- what should I say to this woman?
[woman laughing]
Okay.
I don't know.
"I just think that, you know-- just concentrate on the fact that, you know, you have very, very high feelings of esteem for her, that she's somebody that you've always admired. man:"
"""Esteem""?"
Is that the word I should use?
Esteem?
You think she'd like that? woman:
Yeah.
Whatever. man:
I just don't know if that's-- woman:
You hold her in very high regard. man:
Ok--I don't know if those-- woman:
She's a special person in your life. man:
Okay.
I'll try all that.
Hey.
I am on the train now.
This is my friend Emily.
[romantic music]
"Uh, hello, ""Life In A Day."""
"I'm still with Emily, and we're still hanging out in Chicago."
"Um, this is..."
"We--we just came out of this place, which was cool."
"But, uh, I'm gonna leave this thing on in case anything gets climactic."
man:
"Theresa, look at me."
"They probably make it up just to make people afraid of it,"
'cause they're mean.
I like it because it's so scary.
It's so fascinating about the whole mythology stuff about it.
"There's mystery behind it,"
"'cause you don't know if it's real or not, kinda like Bigfoot."
It's a whole community.
People can talk about it together and whatever.
I think it's a way for people to connect.
"(Finebros) One of the main things people do with this game is they'll film themselves playing it, and then upload their reaction to the Internet."
"So, we're gonna show you a quick montage of people playing ""Slender."""
(man in video) ...just to get me.
"Oh, dude, it's safe."
Safe.
- Aah!
"Oh, my goodness."
"- God, scared me."
(people in video screaming) (laughs)
"- Destiny, please."
"- Tobuscus, yeah."
- Aah!
What the hell?!
No!
- (laughs) I feel you.
- (groaning) - PewDie-- PewDiePie.
- (screams) - (gasps)
I'm happy these people reacted worse than I did.
"(man in video) Oh, God."
Open the (bleep) door!
- (laughs) - What the (bleep)?
What is this?
- (screaming) - His head.
Welcome to Tea Time.
(whispering) I have something really important to tell you.
(whispering) So come close.
(whispering) Closer.
(whispering) Closer ... (whispering) Ok!
(whispering) Today.
Is.
My ...
BlRTHDAY!
YAY!
Today is my Birthday!
I am so excited you're here to celebrate with me!
I have a very good idea.
Would you like to do a special birthday dance with me today?
You would?
I would be so excited.
Thank you!
"First, I have to put on my special birthday tiara!"
Great!
"And secondly, I'm going to teach you the birthday dance moves."
"First, we're going to take our hands and we're going to put them on our knees."
And we're all going to bounce like this ...
Bounce ... bounce ... bounce ... bounce
That's good!
"Next, we're going to take our hands and put them right here by our face."
Cheese.
And you're going to wave from side to side like this ...
Good job everybody!
And for our last dance move we're going to turn in a circle.
Can you turn in a circle without getting dizzy and falling down?
I bet you can!
Let's try it.
"That was that then,-"
- No!
It is ... another!
Hahahaha!
I am going absolutely crazy.
People were so excited about Grant's new product that he started getting requests
left and right for his glasses wipers and spray nozzles.
"So, he started to keep a"
list of everyone who would want a pair very soon.
"By the end of 1 day, 36 of his friends had begged him for glasses wipers and 11 of those people each said that they would also like a pair of nozzles to go with their glasses wipers."
"It's... the pop... from, uh, the pizza place?"
It's -- looks like a person.
He matches the color of the restaurant.
That is the coffee logo.
That is a parade elephant.
That is the Disney.
Those are... little... worms.
"That looks like an ""M""."
"But upside down, ""M""s are ""W""s!"
That is the Apple Store logo!
It has a bite of an apple in it.
"Ooh, looks like the 'merican flag."
A bell.
"Uh, outside space."
Looks like a shooting star?
With a planet.
An eye.
"Chili, and it has an ""S"" next to it, and chilis are spicy."
That looks like a beach ball.
Beach balls are very colorful.
The GE logo.
That's where my grandpa works.
"Oh, I get it."
"You wanted this anchor job for yourself, and this is your way of getting back at me."
You'd let your own sister go down in flames just to satisfy your petty jealousy.
All right... but this is the last time I bail you out.
You're the greatest.
"Afterwards, I'll tell Collins you wrote the stories."
"He'll see how good you are, he'll let you write all my stories."
Me in front of the camera and you behind.
We could be a team.
"*Good morning, Sweet Valley.* *Today's top story...*"
Jessica.
Have you seen Elizabeth?
Nope.
"Ten minutes, people."
"Jessica, I need to proof your copy."
"Sorry, Mr. C. Liz is still Xeroxing it."
"OK, looks good, Camera One."
"Camera Two, zoom out."
Camera Two?
"Hello, Camera Two?"
"What is that, Manny?"
"Oh, sorry."
"Elizabeth, where have you been?"
I need my stories!
These are blank.
They are?
Silly me.
I must have mixed up the stories I wrote with the ones you wrote.
Is there some kind of irony here?
How can you stand there and pretend you don't know what I'm talking about?
Practice?
"You knew how much I wanted to be anchor, and you switched the tapes just so you could get the job."

I'm eyeing him.

"Second man, out of shot:"
"Look at his face, this filth."
[One man laughs.]
Another man:
They shot us with live ammunition
Cameraman:
One bullet in his leg and one in his stomach.
Another man:
"For God to bless you, put him in the morgue."
Man out of shot:
Pick him up with me.
Several voices:
"Slowly, carefully."
"A soul, a soul."
One man:
"This is a human, in the end this is a soul..."
Another man:
"Arrange his arms properly, arrange his arms."
Cameraman:
Was he shot yesterday?
Or today?
It looks like it was from yesterday.
Another man:
Where are his ID cards and stuff?
Cameraman:
"I don't know, search his pockets...the guys must have taken them."
Another man:
"He's not Libyan, I don't think he's Libyan."
Cameraman:
"He's stiffened, you can't arrange his body properly."
"It must be from yesterday, not today."
[music]
"Ah yes, yes."
I feel like I'm getting permission from you.
You did well.
Good Job.
"Ha Ni, it is my first piece of work."
So try it at least once.
"Eat it, okay?"
Okay. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I feel sorry towards Joon Gu... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but I'm really happy about being able to be next to Seung Jo again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm excited but nervous at the same time. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Will I be able to do a good job?
Oh.
Where did it go?
I know I brought it in.
Is this yours?
Mine.
You took it didn't you?
Dummy.
It was on the ground right here.
Who would steal childish panties like those?
I only wear them once in a while.
I usually wear ones that have a lot of lace.
You don't have a body that can be considered sexy though.
Even the A Cup must be too big...
Did you stop growing after elementary school?
What did you say?
Hey.
"Seeing you like that, and not thinking of anything..."
Isn't that a big problem?
Is it that fun to make fun of me?
"If you don't like living with me, you can just say it."
You just grumpily keep making fun of people.
I'm grumpy?
Yeah.
Why am I doing that?
We're in New York. other members have to shoot but I finished my part in D.C. yesterday.
So Jong Up and I went shopping.
The jumbo screens assure me that this really is Times Square!
B.A.P has finally arrived at Times Square.
It's an honor.
It really is an honor.
I still can't believe it.
Times Square.
This is Time Square.
I've only seen it in pictures.
This is my first time here.
All this fanciness.
ls that a celebrity?
Who's that?
one two okay. one two.
The weather is awesome today.
The buildings around here are tall so usually this street gets less sunlight.
But today the sun's shining so much.
"(Very satisfied) Wow, good."
That dog looks happy too.
"Yo, New York City."
We're headed to the set feeling like we're VlP.
"Today, we're filming at MTV in Time Square."
We'll be customizing shoes and painting murals.
Time for some cultural activities.
It feels more like playing rather than working.
You know what I'm saying?
I'll be styling my own shoes.
I'll be making one-of-a-kind shoes.
This looks like a really famous shop. for street artists.
It seems many famous street artists have come through here.
I wanted to make my outfit or shoes with this printing.
Then I would wake up and cry again.
I really couldn't go on.
"I swore to forget about Gil Dong, so that I could live."
What could I do? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's not like he went somewhere I could follow.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I found myself being able to live each day.
Then someday I wouldn't even think about Gil Dong at all.
That's how I lived.
But you know...
I'm so dumb.
I forget sometimes that I'm not supposed to think about him.
"When that happens, my heart hurts really badly."
I can't go on!
I wish I'd just become really stupid.
I can't see you like this anymore.
Do you remember any big event twenty years ago in the fall?
"For example, a rich noblewomen running away with a daughter?"
- Twenty years ago?
"- Yes, the year the late king passed away."
How can we remember something that long ago?
This...!
This is Chunmyungdan.
Try it.
"Doctor Heo, please help us."
He's the son of the Interior Minister.
Please take him home for us.
We're short on staff.
Please?
The son of the Interior Minister?
He must be Gil Dong's older brother.
- I just want one more drink.
- Please be careful.

- That's right.
She'll do love marriage.
Boy's name will start with J.
That means Jimmy.
- Yes.
"This year, the boy will take part in some air competition... ...and win the first prize."
And he'll earn fame in the world.
He'll be her husband.
Air competition?
"Yes, I remember."
Motor cycle race.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
And there's going to be a motorcycle race.
I stood first in Singapore for consecutive 3 years.
And I'll definitely take part in this race.
"Yes, son and do come first."
This is a question of our reputation.
Yes.
This race is of 30 miles distance from Mumbai to Panvel.
And 21 motorbikes across the world are taking part.

"Okay, we're coming in..."
"Okay, first of all-- and I'm sure he hears me by now--"
let me explain something to you.
"Everyone, can you hear me loud and clear?"
My son was supposed to be cleaning his room yesterday.
The Lord's so lucky.
Look at the things He's getting.
"Earlier, people would keep it in a covered platter.. ..in front of Him."
But now they're feeding Him.
Let Him enjoy.
It's your fault.
"Mumbai just experienced a slight earthquake tremor.. ..of 3.5 Richter scale, which didn't cause.. ..any harm to life or property."
See.
Heard that?
But a shop in the flea market has collapsed.. ..which was closed at that time.
Must be Mohammad's shop.
According to our sources.. ..the shop was registered to Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"It's really surprising, because.. ..there are other old shops in this market which are still intact."
But Kanji Lalji Mehta's shop has been completely destroyed.
"This is Shweta Tiwari, with cameraman Vaibhav Mishra, ABP News."
"Sister, switch on ABP News quickly."
We saw.
Brother-in-law's shop is gone.
It's collapsed.
Pravin!
"- Calm down, father."
"No, sister."
Come there with the children.
I'm coming there with father and the others.
- Yes.
"Yes, we're coming."
We're coming.
The idols of Gods have gone underneath.
The shop is completely ruined
Doesn't seem like there was ever a shop here.
What are you saying?
We had goods worth 25 lakhs.
We activate the protocol she signed before the marriage.
"Yes, exactly..."
All her obligations will be put in effect.
"If she wants to divorce, she has to pay me all the compensation written in the contract."
Let's see if she can divorce me now.
He will be even more hostile towards you now.
"He should thank God, that he still breathes."
Or I know what I would do to him.
"Okay, come..."
We have a lot to tell each other.
"Wait, wait..."
"Uhm, well..."
... could you turn your back to me?
- Why?
- Just do it will you?
Kuzey.
Don't lose it again.
I won't.

And you hit me in the face.

But he had already set his eyes on someone.

-Yes.
"This afternoon, a fire broke out in a Seoul warehouse, 35-year old Lee who was working inside the warehouse was injured from smoke inhalation."
"While rescuing him, two firemen from Dobong Station received burns and are currently in intensive care."
The fire burned down the whole warehouse and $350 thousand worth of property was damaged.
The fire was out after an hour.
The police are investigating the cause based on the witness' depositions.
How did you get here?
I'm okay.
I'm not hurt.
I am the one who's hurt.
I can't take it anymore.
"Every time I hear a siren, my heart drops."

- Soo-jeong.
"These people say you're cool, encouraging that you are a great fireman."
"That's all, isn't it?"
"Su-jeong, that's not it."
"And so they just push you deeper and deeper into the fire, right?"
"Soo-jeong, no..."
You know... how we work here...
You know.
"No, I don't know."
I've forgotten it all.
"When you say 'we', I'm not included, so how can I know?"

The way we can square on most calculators --
"let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting ""times"" and then ""equals,"" and on most calculators that will give you the square."
"On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an ""x squared"" button on it, will allow you to do the calculation even faster."
"What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method."
"What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,"
I will try and race you to the answer.
OK?
"So quickly, a two-digit number please."

You used to call me
Just to say I love you baby
You would always treat me like a lady
Everyone was jealous of the way
"We kept keeping on, feelings were so strong"
Always knew that I would occupy your mind
You could always find a little more time
To show me I was number one
Sitting there on my throne
Lately where's the feeling gone
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
The social worker does that.
Not the doctor.
"Not the psychologist, not the nurse."
We do.
That's is what makes us agents of change.

My heart is broken heart  I can't bring my mind together
Boy I'm falling in  love with U U
"What should I do,  what should I do"
I can't let you go  I love you
Baby I'm in love with you ok let's talk about love
Men try to blow whistles at me  And get me
All of them goodbye now
"My cute voice will only Call you out, you~"
What should I do I think I'm in love
Woo woo woo woo yeh
It's because of you
I don't want to say it first  But it lingers in my mouth
Loving U U What should I do  What should I do

You see this?
It says 'Marital status':
'Never married' and the part I highlighted - I should have highlighted - the part next to it:
"'Surviving Spouse's Name, if wife give maiden name'"
'Surviving Spouse's Name' is blank
"Because in this country, gay couple's are not legally recognized."
Gay love is not recognized as love.
And we are therefore not treated as equal human beings to heterosexual human beings
Now look here.
I am on this though.
"Number, box 22a of the Florida Certificate of Death."
'Informant's Name':
Richard Bluestein.
That's me
And next to it in 22b:
'Relationship to decedent'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
"Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?"
"Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember"
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
If you eat too much ooh ooh
You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
On the good ship lollipop.
It's a sweet trip to a candy shop
Where bon-bons play
On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.
Lemonade stands everywhere.
Crackerjack bands fill the air.
And there you are
Happy landing on a chocolate bar.
See the sugar bowl do the tootsie roll
With the big bad devils food cake.
If you eat too much ooh ooh
You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
You'll awake with a tummy ache
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away

Hello.
Today's recipe is an Sweet Popcorn.
"And to make this sweet Popcorn, the ingredients are:"
1/2 cup of water.
"Sir, everyday you buy dozens of goods."
And haggle for just paisa 50 a dozen.
It's a long story.
- How long?
Its 5ft 7 inches long.
"People normally get married to fortunate, lucky and virtuous girls."
But I got a spendthrift wife.
She has changed the entire meaning of expenditure.
She spends my money like water flows.
Sometimes she shops for so long.. ..that she takes a blanket and a pillow.. ..and sleeps in the Home Department of the mall.. ..so that she can get up again in the morning and start shopping.
I'm done with shopping for small things.
The real shopping..
I will do it tomorrow.
Not just that.
If the stereo of the car doesn't work.. - She buys a new stereo.
"No, she buys a new car."
And look.
Do you see this dress?
Its worth 2.5 lakhs.
She says that Mallika Sherawat wore this dress in 'Murder'.
What do you say?
- Mallika Sherawat wore a dress in 'Murder'.
When?
- That's exactly what I say.
That's why I come here from Lokhandwala... ...to buy cheap fruits and vegetables.
"Brother, I pray that even Osama Bin Laden.. ..doesn't get a wife like mine."
"Oh, God."
- You intentionally ruined the dress.
"Mala, why would I do anything like that?"
Because you don't want me to look pretty.
That isn't possible anyway.
"Whether I do something or not, it would make no difference."
(chuckles)
"Fred:Oh, and I almost forgot to say,"
"I'm gonna give Judy a basket, too."
"Um, I don't know why, exactly, but for some reason, my ""Fred"" channel on YouTube says that I joined two years ago."
"If I would've joined two years ago, I'd only be 4 years old."
Do you really think I'd know how to work a computer if I was 4?
"Seriously, I thought you were smarter than that."
"So, yeah, it wasn't actually my channel."
"I was just annoying YouTube, I kept banging on their, you know, door."
"And finally, they said, ""Okay!"
"We'll give you the channel."""
Time to go outside!
Here I go!
(laughs)
Fred:Let's run!
Happy May Day!
(gasps) (gasps in slow motion) (screams)
Fred:He threw the basket at my face!
(Fred crying)
"Fred:I spent so much time working on that basket, trying to make people happy, he threw the darn basket at me!"
"Oh my God, look at this."
"I just realised that right behind me in my neighbor's yard, there's a dog kennel."
"You know inhumane that is, locking your dogs in frickin' gates?"
"How would you feel if I locked you in between gates and watched you from above, laughing evilly?"
(Fred laughing evilly)
Fred:Dogs don't like it either.
"(Fred) Oh, my God, look at this kitty."
"She doesn't wanna be discovered be me, look at her run."
"Fred:Oh, it's a stray kitty with lice."
"Also, I bit one of the other kids in my neighborhood and gave him rabies."
"Oh, my God, she just bit me!"
She just bit me and I'm foamin' from the mouth!
You can fix my word here too.
[indecipherable chatter]
[Other panelist]
"I will tell you guys, while Don's been talking, I've been up here occasionally and Chris, you tweeted to me, I responded."
I've been actually tweeting.
This answers your question Glen earlier.
"I'm using a wireless bluetooth keyboard connected to my phone and a bluetooth headset, which is why you guys haven't heard my phone babbling to tweet to various things that people have been answering."
[undecipherable comments]
[Other panelist]
Not my phone you can't.
[Coordinator in back of room]
I can't hear it from here.
[Other panelist]

"'Mooji,' it says."

This one I don't know:
'Kovan' Kovan?
'...
"Kovan, Shiva, Jesus...' and then in brackets it says,"
"I think, '[Matthew 6:21] all speak of the light, as does Ramana Maharshi."
They describe it as self-effulgent.
Can these be enlightenment...
"Perhaps, is it because I came in?"
Are you leaving because of me?
"Anyways, it has nothing to do with you."
Don't relate everything to yourself.
What do you mean you're leaving this house?
"Until now, under your supervision..."
I have lived comfortably.
But I think it's now time to think about the path ahead of me.
"Just once, living by myself, getting a part time job..."
I want to throw myself into an absolutely unprotected world and watch over myself.
What kind of person am I?
What can I do?
Okay.
That's not a bad idea.
"Aigoo, but still..."
It hasn't been long since Ha Ni has come back.
"Hey, Seung Jo."
It has nothing to do with her.
It's my life.
Okay.
"Go try it out. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; What should I do? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Seung Jo is going to move out of this house. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I came back into this house. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; But this time, Seung Jo... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; is going to leave. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"
Where is Baek Seung Jo?
"If I don't try,"
We couldn't even meet like this.
"It's Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Seung Jo, what are you doing by yourself? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; In what area are you living right now?"
"Hey, Baek Seung Jo."
"Since she doesn't have a chance, tell her to give up."
Tell her like a man.
Seung Jo!
All of a sudden...
It must be lonely living by yourself.
Well it doesn't seem all that bad since I'm with Yoon Hae Ra.
What's going on?
Who did this to you?
"Forget it, just take me to the hospital, I'm not good"
Who did this to you?Say it.Only then I'll take you.
"Serdar, I'm good."
"Take him to the clinicand stitch the wound, thenget him back."
Take me to the hospital!
You will not get away with this.
"You thought to go outand fly, birdie... it's a good plan, but menobody can cheat."
Get him out!
"Mr. Serdar,If you had any humanity in you,let me..."
My son is dying.
What the hell do I care?
He's not my son!
"Perhaps you also will one daybe so helpless,Serdar, and I hope you will findsomeone to help you!"
"See our daughter,does not look good."
"Girl is not good,Take her to her roomand let it rest."
Change clothes you shall goand take a nap...
"'I waited for you,But you did not come."
Pleasant.Your fiancee. '

"Listen, afterthis change of events don t you daregive me empty promises!"
Hello!Is this the police station? yes please
I need to report a crime.
"In the store of Bulent Tiryaki,in the mall, I sawhidden boxes with bullets in them was writtenin Bulgarian..."
They were very concernedand I think it will move quickly.
With whom am I speaking?
I am an anonymous citizen.
I received the application.
And then I was working for Larry McDonough janitor work at the school.
He was the treasurer in charge of the ... there.
Where was his - ?
Grand Rapids.
So I was picking up a little money there.
And when I got done with the school at 7 or 8 o'clock at night I was painting apartment buildings until midnight and then back up again the next morning to go at it again.
You couldn't get a job.
I was making $5.50 an hour at
Steel Case.
Nobody's going to hire you.
"Because two weeks from now, Steel Case calls you back."
So the only place I get a job was to go to Spartan
Warehouse.
They paid a little more and I also had the 7 years teamster.
So then I just put my ... in his apartment and retired and came here.
Built this shack and that was it.
This house is out of styrofoam by the way.
"At Spartan, that's they way they built - Everything was out of styrofoam."
"So, Steel Case, did they call you back, then?"
"Yeah, but I was already in Spartan."
And how long did you work for Spartan?
"Oh, 24 years."
I lost some time getting a hip replaced so I had to work a little bit longer
"So you were off, away from Beaver Island, for a total of?"
"35 years, maybe."
And what brought you back here?
"Oh, hell, I never left."
Never left.
All our vacations were up there.
The kids never got out of Michigan until after - I don't know when they got old enough.
I guess when they got married.
My daughter went to Alaska and my son went to
"And when I trained steps  to work with this program,"
I use Thay's story and some  of you may have heard this.
He talks about -would you hold the mike for me so I can demonstrate this?-
"He talks about the flower and -no, for me.- (Laughter)"
- (K. Weare)There.
"- (J. Bell) Okay, here we go."
"So, Thay - a little more to this side."
(Laughter)
"So, Thay talks about the flowers like tulips that close up at night."
"Every morning the sun comes up, beams down... (Laughter)"
It is not working.
"The flower is here, the sun is here."
(Laughter)
(K. Weare) What are you going to do now?
And the sun beams down its photons indiscriminately on the flower and its natures open up.
The story works  with young people.
"The young people came in  like this, all closed up."
"And our job as teachers, and parents, and Youth workers, is to beam down love and respect indiscriminately on what they've done."
And they begin to test it out.
Sometimes it goes like that.
(Laughter)
Sometimes it goes like that.
Sometimes it goes like that again.
But our job is their nature to open to their own health.
And they will move towards that.
"Sometimes it takes years, we know."
"We get letters from students,  10, 15 years out of Youth Build saying,"
"""Thank you, I couldn't get it then, but now I know."""
Thank you.
(Laughter)
"So,respect and caring, one is going beyond what they expect, for instance, they said it was, ""Oh yeah, they come and grab me."
They knocked on my door  when I didn't get up for school.
"What can I do,that this interferein the business?"
He knows what he's gotbecause of their work...
"I do not trust him... oh, you did of coursetrust him ."
If you sayI usehis position in court
"When you are concerned, it is the exception,"
"I do not know... ,"
Do not lookme so worried
I did not comethat would upset you...
"What do you advise, sir."
Attorney?
"Ah, it's goodthis coffee!"
"If I were you,Mahir Karu would tomorrowsent to prison."
"Do not be worried, my dear,there is a nice, has a doctor,nurse, help, him..."
"Let us Say this... f something happenswhile prisonnobody cares, all believe that he is veryaggressive man"
"But if you escape from here,the doors open to the investigationin all areas of the hospital."

"Oh, what do you do?"
"I have to go,excuse me. mr."

I heard that there was an accident during the broadcast earlier.
"Ah, yes."
You needn't worry about it.
It is extremely bothersome to deal with kids that powder their faces.
Aigo!

"It was the USDA that, sort of, came up with the idea of working on pennycress."
And he's going to tell us a little about how they got started and where they are now in the research side of things.
"But before we get to Terry, I'd like to introduce our overhead..."
"Dr. Bill Bailey, he is the director of the School of Agriculture."
"And he has some welcome words, I guess."
William Bailey:
Words of welcome.
A big decision I was involved in was whether or not to have coffee or cocoa or chili today.
We opted for the coffee.
Welcome.

Illinois farmers make money.

Won Kang Hwi was not a Hallyu star from the beginning.
Do you think people will believe this?
"No matter who looks at it, it is obvious that it is fake."
It is not fake!
I took it personally!
You went to Playground (Bar) yesterday.
Manager Kang said... &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;that you left with Kang Hwi.
"Still, if these photos are revealed, the blow will be severe."
"You know, don't you?"
I am close to Reporter Choi in Sports A.
Don't you remember who introduced you to Reporter Choi?
Jae Hee...  no Jong Chul!
"This business is not such an easy arena. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I don't expect anything big. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The commercial that Won Kang Hwi is shooting again.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; If you hand it over to me, I'll keep my mouth shut.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
You should have chosen your opponent well.
Leave the originals behind  and get out immediately!
Do you know that Won Kang Hwi has a sponsor?
I mean it.
This was filmed yesterday at JY Hotel.
Check it out.
She lodged in the suite room.
That's enough.
Star Entertainment!
"Star Entertainment, on the condition that he brings Lee Tae Ik, proposed a huge contract fee to Won Kang Hwi."
Did you know that?
I also heard that personally.
I heard that you were dating a member of a girl group.
If you don't want to be no.
"1 on the internet hit list,"
leave the originals here and get out immediately!
Why don't you trust what I say?
President. you will suffer a blow like that.
I...  trust my kids!
Wave to each other.
How many work with young people outside of school settings?
"Ah, yes, wave to each other."
How many would like to be working with young people?
(Laughter) Alright.
How many of you are parents?
Look at that.
"Alright, I work with young people who have dropped out of the school systems."
"People from low income background,  ages 16 to 24."
"And what they say to us in the Youth Build program as they come into, is,"
"""They didn't care about us in school."
"Nobody cared about me."""
"So, I just want to say, from all  of young people in Youth Build, tens of thousand have been in Youth Build, who have experienced good teachers as I think most of you probably are."
I know that you've started-
"Jon, your blessing to them was very appropriate- you started your career because you want to make a difference, I know that."
"From all the young people in Youth Build who know the teaching makes a difference,"
"I am standing for them to say thank you  very much, it does make a difference."
I am bringing some voices of some young people I work with.
"There are 3.5 million young people  who are between ages 16 to 24, who are out of school, out of work and raised in lower income communities."
"Here is one of them, Mike Dean."
"Well, so much for order."
(Laugh)
I am OK.
(Laughter)
Mike's is in here somewhere.
Staplers are very useful.
(Laughter)
Mike says:
"""I've never had an easy year growing up in Columbus, Ohio."
I lived in a drug-infested home  without a father.
My neighborhood was drown  in confusion and negativity.
The lack of positive goals and dreams led me to a life of crime.

What is it that man desires?
"In the Phenomenology of the Mind, which is Hegel's magnum opus published in 1807, there is a well known passage one of the highest moments in philosophy in which Hegel develops what is known as the Master-Slave Dialectic"
"During the 1930s in France, a Russian philosopher named Alexandre Kojeve gave some courses about the Master-Slave Dialectic to some people who had gone to...pretty important philosophers like"
"-	If they can that would be huge, but the Infestors are waiting below."
"Umm, viOLet is too good for that!"
He is not going to let that happen.
"-	Yeah, I think viOLet has actually done this, he's gonna kill the last Orbital, and with that, Polt is just going to run around the map with these Marines."
-	He is trying to get Vikings though..
But again he is supply blocked.
-	He can't build anything.
"He's got no supply, he's got like two Depots in the back of his natural, and that's..."
Just about it!
Is there a Command Center floating somewhere?
"-	There is a Command Center being built in the middle-right hand side of the map, but will viOLet see that?"
"-	Yeah, there is no Orbital, so viOLet can just burrow Drones right next to extractors."
"-	Wait, where is viOLet's last building?"
Where is it?
-	Oh My God!
-	Ohh!
"Another Yamato gets planted, and now we start to see the Yamato's incoming for Rain."
Oh no!
BoxeR loses the Ghost!
No EMP's possible now.
And there are the Yamato's going down.
He is picking off one Viking at a time.
He needs to avoid those Seeker Missiles.
"Huge number of Point Defense Drones, a very tense micro situation."
"Now we see the big engagement, this could be the final battle."
"The Ravens on the wrong side, trying to move forward, if he can get a big.."
"Ohh, big Seeker Missile could go off, but no!"
They are all out of energy.
"And it looks like in terms of the air battle, we do see 31 Vikings, more are falling for BoxeR, can he pick off all of the Battlecruisers?"
"And it looks like BoxeR might come out on top in the sky, but the seven Thors from Rain give him the victory there!"
"-	There are still 66 Probes up for HerO, so his economy is still fine."
"-	Yeah, wow."

My favourite thing I saw this year was an article in one of the women's magazines on Valentines

"Hari bol, Gaura Hari bol."
"Hopeless position. hatāś hoiye, hari, tava nām ucca kori"", boro duḥkhe ḍāki bār bār"
I am [ampulating??] all these things with each to the highest position of disappointment whence sometimes somehow or other there comes:
"""Gaurabde ha!"
"O, Lord!"
I'm helpless.
"Save me""."
"""I'm helpless, I'm [soheart??]-powered."
In my home I'm in the midst of so many enemy in there.
In the hand of my enemies.
"No, no freedom."
I'm [clotery??] under control of so many enemies in the form of friends.
The real me such hopeless position.
"I hope, my Lord, You'll come without agression with anger, agressively, otherwise no hope."
Even I'll not be allowed to my connection with you. kāmādīnāṁ kati na katidhā pālitā (CC Madhya 22.16)
From time immemorial I'm serving all my these masters.
But they are not satisfied with my service.
"I may be slave, eternal slave, impossibility of getting of [position??] unique to me."
"Now I find this helpless position, my Lord."
"If you, when thee come on your own accord asserting or serving any way then these, they will fly away."
Otherwise no.
No chance I have got. sāmprataṁ labdha-buddhis tvām āyātaḥ śaraṇam abhayaṁ māṁ niyuṅkṣvātma... (CC Madhya 22.16)
When little attention of some engagement if you extend to me then these will fly.
In the fear of you.
But I think it's too early to say exactly how it will be played out.

"Your time is--in Berlin, I assume, very limited, so if you want to see the Egyptian stuff, you get that information, now, you're ending up in the wrong museum."
Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Okay, so what was the right museum? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA:"
It's in the so-called Old Museum and Altes Museum.
It's very close to it... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA: ...but the Pergamon Museum is, as far as I know, not known or famous for Egyptian stuff."
It's famous for something--other things.

Or will she yell back?
"Do you have a personal relationship, Hugo, with Lady Gaga? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:"

"The workflow for building a metaSL shader tree in 3ds Max is a little  like building one in Mental Mill, only easier."
Here you will be creating a metaSL shader tree to apply  to this human head.
"The model is low-poly based, but will look like it has more detail  with proper mapping and metaSL shaders."
Open the Slate Material Editor.
"Ensure that 3ds Max is set up to use the Mental Ray renderer,  otherwise you won't have access to metaSL shaders."
Expand the metaSL rollout under Maps.
There you will find about  a dozen shaders ready for use.
"You typically start with an illumination Phong shader, which provides  the basis for the metaSL tree."
"To start populating the tree, you drag in other metaSL shaders  and wire them to the proper channels."
The Texture Lookup 2d shader is useful for defining bitmaps as textures.
Start by defining a Diffuse texture; use the Head-diffuse.jpg bitmap  and wire it to the Diffuse Color channel.
Use a Normals Bumpmap shader in the Normal channel.
Use the image file:
Head-normal.jpg.
Add another Texture Lookup 2d shader and use the file Head-specular.jpg  and wire it to the Specular Color channel.
"At this time, notice that if you tried to apply the Phong illumination  node to the object in the scene, it doesn't work."
"You first need to convert the Phong illumination node into  a single-output ""material""."
"Luckily, you can use the Map to Material Conversion node to that end."
Now you can apply the shader tree to the object in the scene.

Baby basket
Today we're going to make a gift basket for a baby.
"We're going to make it look original, elegant and with an artisan touch."
I've used a basket which you can find in any shopping centre or home interiors store.
"I've chosen the wicker one but it could also be white, or whatever colour you want, or which matches best."
To decorate it I've used a few bows made from quilted fabric.
"I have made the rest of the material for the basket with this quilted fabric, but if you go to the shops and you've chosen a blanket or some fabric which you like, try and get it all to match, so if you buy a few satin bows then you can decorate it using the same colours."
"In my case, because I have got it made to measure, they've made me these bows which look great."
"For the base, since I want the things to show at the top and not end up with everything sitting in the bottom and not looking pretty, we can put a base of tissue paper, which is the paper which we use for patterns or for children's handicraft, and I'm going to scrunch it up to make a base."
This tissue paper is very lightweight so we have to scrunch it up.
Now I've got the base on which to arrange all the items.
"I've bought a blanket, a towel, a bib a coat hanger which we have personalised, and a teddy bear which matches the other items."
Since it's a personal gift and I wanted something more artisanal
"I've made a personalised picture on a piece of cloth, in a thick frame, which looks very good, and I've decorated the edge with the same pattern as the rest of the drawing."
"I'm going to put the picture here, and then I'll put in the blanket, the hanger, the towel, and the bear on this side."
"To finish the wrapping you can buy some celophane like this, wrap it all up towards the top, and put on a big bow to finish it."
So that's the baby's gift basket.
I hope that you like it and that you have fun making it.
Until next time!

"Assata Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, a member of the Black Panthers and the Black Liberation Army, becomes the first woman named to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorist list."
"Convicted of murdering a New Jersey trooper in 1973, she's always proclaimed her innocence."
She's lived in Cuba since the early 1980's after she received political asylum.
We'll speak with scholar Angela Davis and Assata's long time attorney Lennox Hinds.
And we'll hear Assata Shakur in her own words.
ASSATA SHAKUR:
"Well the government just perceived us as a threat because they understood that we were serious, they understood we were telling the truth, and they understood also that we were becoming a much more sophisticated opposition, we were not just the piece of pie opposition, but that we wanted a real, structural change in the United States"""

JUAN GONZÁLEZ:
"And I'm Juan Gonzalez, welcome to all of our listeners and viewers around the country and around the world."
"We begin today's show looking at the case of Assata Shakur, a legendary figure within the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army."
"On Thursday, she became the first woman ever to make the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list."
"In addition, the FBI and the state of New Jersey doubled the reward for her capture to $2 million."
"Shakur was convicted in the May 2nd, 1973, killing of a New Jersey state trooper during a shootout that left one of her fellow activists dead."
She was shot twice by police during the incident.
"In 1979, she managed to escape from jail, and she later fled to Cuba where she received political asylum."
[Indistinct muttering]
We've now chosen three dishes that stood out. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Really stood out.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The first person we'd like&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to invite down&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is...
You know that you want to call my name.
"Please, please, call my name."
Ryan.
Let's go.
[Applause]
I'm really not surprised that my plate is one of the top dishes.
These other cooks are gonna have to step up their game if they're gonna want to compete with me.
The next person we'd like &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to invite down&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"- Samantha. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Let's go, Samantha.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
I was one of the only people that decided to do something truly new.
I think a lot of people are gonna be jealous of me.
The third person... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please come down...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Scott. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
My mind is just racing.
I know that I wasn't 100% proud of this dish.
It was not executed properly.
Congratulations.
"I mean, your three dishes &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- stood out.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Thank you, chef."
Thank you.
You managed to cook what we think are the worst three dishes &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of this mystery box challenge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Listen carefully. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This season,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we've rewritten&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the rule books,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;so none of you should ever get&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;too comfortable&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in this kitchen,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; because we could ask you to leave at any time, starting now."
What?
(Becky) We're all gobsmacked.
We just can't believe it.
It's crazy to me.
"And I'm just like, what the heck is gonna happen now?"
"Okay, we'll taste all three dishes."
Whoever we decide has plated the absolute worst dish will be handing back their apron.
"Ryan, bring your dish up to the station, please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Ryan) I made a balsamic, rum-glazed duck breast with some caramelized bananas."
Are you proud of this?
It ties right together.
"Andy Puckett, Ph.D., Director of Planetarium &amp;amp; Visualization Theatre:"
And that's the beauty of the College of Arts and Sciences.
It really exposes you to ideas and ways of thinking that you wouldn't necessarily have been exposed to.
"Jocelyn Krebs, Ph.D. Biology Professor:"
"Especially for undergraduates, it's really important to get a balance of science and liberal arts education."
I was a Creative Writing major before I became a scientist.
And you can't be a successful scientist without being able to write.
Narrator:
The College of Arts and Sciences:
"Biology, Literature, Geology,"
"Music, Philosophy, 37 different programs that together create a balanced, well rounded education."
"Alvin Amason, Native Arts Program Director:"
"I personally don't care if they are an Arts Major, or Anthropology or something close to that."
I think that what they can pull out or identify with in our program will help them through all their endeavors.
All that education is very important to be well rounded
"Xio Owens, CAS-Alumni:"
"As I've gone through my educational career,"
I've also found so many opportunities that
I never would've thought were there.
But they're right here.
"You know, in my hometown, in my home state."
"Steven DeLoose, CAS, Theater Student:"
I was looking around the country at some prestigious schools:
"University of Virginia, University of Michigan, places like that."
And I decided to come to UAA.
And I would not change it for the world.
"Chris Barnett, CAS-Biology Graduate Student:"
It's been a great benefit for me to be able to stay here and to be able to do world-class biomedical research and get papers published.
"Steve Johnson, Director of Seawolf Debate Team Associate Professor:"
"The Opportunites that exist here are just outstanding because we are a relatively new state, because we are a relatively young university, because we embrace that ethos of Alaska so intimately in what it is we do."
Narrator:
Classic New England clam chowder.
Five ingredients...
"Potatoes, cream, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;onion, pork, clams.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"All of those things at the end of the day, they sound easy, and that's &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what makes it a hard dish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"To me, the most intimidating dish is the one I'm well-known for. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's like a work of art.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
You seriously have to follow every step religiously.
Any idea?
Your notorious beef Wellington?
It's exactly that.
"It scares the hell out of me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's so intimidating,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it takes years&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of practice.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Felix, out of Joe, Graham,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and my dish,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what dish are you gonna choose?"
I choose...
The theme of today's elimination test is our most intimidating dishes. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We gave Felix&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the choice of one&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of those three dishes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that give us the most anxiety.
The dish that Felix chose was...
A stunning risotto.
All right.
"My whole stomach sinks, and I feel a little nauseous, because I've only made risotto once in my life, and it was not very good."
"Risotto's not intimidating to me because I've made it before, and I'm comfortable doing it in a short period of time."
- Felix.
- Yes.
"For winning the mystery box challenge, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- you don't have to cook it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Yeah! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're safe.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Go enjoy your safety &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;up in our gallery.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
[Applause]
Thank you.
What an amazing position to be in.
"At least one of you will be eliminated &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the back of this risotto,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; so make sure it's not you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;All of you&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;have got 45 minutes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; to make a stunning risotto. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your 45 minutes starts from...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Now.
Off you go.
"(Announcer) As Felix enjoys the safety of the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; lounge, the remaining home cooks must now choose the necessary ingredients to make one stunning risotto dish."
Butter.
I need butter.
"(Announcer) At the end of the challenge, at least one more person will be sent home."
Is there butter in here?
So whatever that number divided by 2.
"So the pulley itself, the acceleration of the pulley is half of this number, which is 1.59 meters per second squared to the right."
"I know this was a fairly difficult problem and the key realizations though, I think that you had to discover or realize in order to be able to do this was a couple of things."
"One, that the acceleration of this pulley is half the acceleration of the block, or the acceleration of the block is double the acceleration of the pulley."
You have to realize that.
And then you just have to work out the net horizontal forces and realize well the only thing pulling on this block is friction going backwards and tension of the rope to the right.
And that same tension of the rope is constant throughout this wire or through this rope.
"And on this pulley, and this might not be something that you had already realized about pulleys, but now you will, is that since the rope essentially goes around the pulley, it's pulling twice on the pulley."
"And the tension's constant, so it's pulling with a tension of"
T on the top and the bottom.
"And if you realized those things, then it's just a"
little bit of algebra to get the acceleration of the block and the acceleration of the pulley.
"Anyway, I hope I didn't confuse you too much."
I would call this a five star problem if you would see this type of problem on physics competitions.
"So if you know how to do this, you're doing well, at least as far as tension and ropes and friction are concerned."
I'll see you in the next video.

"(Announcer) In this risotto elimination challenge, many are struggling."
"Oh, my God."
"(Announcer) At the end of tonight, another one of these 17 home cooks will be leaving the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Taste.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Start thinking&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;about the execution.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Everything.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; 60 seconds to go."
Come on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Check the plate.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let the risotto relax.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Seasoning.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Butter in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Cheese in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You want rich lava.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;

[Cheers and applause]
Well done.
"And the sad news. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tonight, somebody&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;will be leaving&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen."
(Announcer) The judges will taste each risotto dish.
"Then the three worst dishes will be singled out, and one of those home cooks will leave the competition."
"Okay, let's start off back row."
Monti.
I'm a little freaked out right now.
But I'm not going home.
"I came here to cook, and I came here to win this."
"This is risotto made with white wine and chicken stock with a pancetta, pine nuts, sundried tomato, and white asparagus."
"It does not look like a risotto, does it?"
Uh...
They don't look like that ever. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So there's the risotto&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;down there.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I've got to dig for this one.
The pancetta is crispy. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's the nice thing&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;about it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Unfortunately, your garnish tastes better than the actual body of the risotto."
Have you ever eaten risotto before?
- No.
- That's bizarre.
That I've never eaten risotto?
How are you holding up?
I'm doing all right.
"The thing is, as whoever you're cooking it for is getting the bite, they should get &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a tiny, little piece&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of asparagus,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; a little pancetta, all those things, not huge long pieces that don't really fit on the fork and are just garnished on the top. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you, Monti.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"The judges, they expect us to be at a certain level, and I was far below that level."
[Sniffles]
There were two standout risottos. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The first one belongs to...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Frank. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Great job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;However, there was one&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that stood out head and shoulders above its competition."
That dish belongs to...
David Martinez.
Both of you will become team captains in the next stage of this competition.
But you know this elimination challenge comes with a departure. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;There were three dishes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that stood out&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; all for the wrong reasons. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And at least one&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of those three&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;have cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; their last dish in this competition.
"The first dish that was out of character, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bland, subpar,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and on the verge&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of an embarrassment,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that dish belongs to..."
"Dave Mack. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come down here, please.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Please stand over there.
Thank you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This next dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; had very bizarre flavors and techniques.
Helene.
"The third of the worst dishes had a mix of ingredients that made no sense, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;didn't even seem to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what a risotto was supposed to be. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That dish belongs to...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I was trying to not lose my grip on my countertop, because I know I'm gonna be in the bottom three."
I know it.
"The third of the worst dishes had a mix of ingredients that made no sense, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;didn't even seem to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what a risotto was supposed to be."
That dish...
Belongs to Tali. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Those three risottos&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; were embarrassing. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Who will be sent home?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I did what the challenge asked for, you know, so I feel safe."
I screwed up.
My risotto was undercooked.
"I'm feeling, quite frankly, scared."
My food tastes great.
What do the judges want?
Why didn't they see it on my plate?
"Dave Mack, one step forward, please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You can't turn out&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;undercooked rice&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; with every mouthful just full of grit."
"Dave, you are not safe. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stay there, please.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Helene.
Your dish was really bad. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We were bitterly disappointed.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
But it wasn't one of the worst two.
"Back to your station, please."
Thank you.
Thank you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;

"Turner lived in Derbyshire all his life. In 1865 he married Eliza Lakin (1837 - 1900), and worked as a part-time farmer raising four children at Walnut farm in Barrow upon Trent."
"After Eliza's death in 1900, he moved to Kirk Ireton and later married fellow artist Kate Stevens Smith (1871-1964) - they set up home in Idridgehay, and he died there in 1910. His son William Lakin Turner (1867-1929) also became a famous landscape oil painter."

History.
"The city was founded by Henry Flagler as a community to house the servants working in the two grand hotels on the neighboring island of Palm Beach, across Lake Worth. The original spelling was ""Westpalmbeach"", but it was feared that the 13-letter word would be a bad omen for the new community. On November 5, 1894, 78 people met at the ""Calaboose"" (the first jail and police station located at Clematis St. and Poinsettia, now Dixie Hwy.) and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County (now Miami-Dade County). This made West Palm Beach the oldest incorporated municipality in the county and in South Florida. The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom. Many of the city's landmark structures and old neighborhoods were built during this period."
"Originally, Flagler intended for his Florida East Coast Railway to end in West Palm but after the area experienced a deep freeze, he chose to extend the railroad to Miami instead."
"In the 1960s, Palm Beach County's first enclosed shopping mall, the Palm Beach Mall, and an indoor arena were completed. They led to a short revival for the city, but crime continued to be a serious problem and by the early 1990s there were not many people living or working in downtown. Since the 1990s, developments such as CityPlace and renovation of 1920s architecture on Clematis Street have brought people back to downtown for the entertainment and shopping district."

"The Nashya Shaikh or Nashya Sekh(Bengali: নইস্য শেখ) is a Muslim community found in northern parts of the state of West Bengal in India. They are culturally and linguistically similar to both Rangpuri people of northern Bangladesh and Goalpariya people of Assam. A small number of the community are also found in the neighboring state of Bihar, where they are known as the Bengali Shaikh. These people are more commonly known as Rajbongshi Muslims. The Nashya are considered to be an important indigenous group found in northern West Bengal. They are homogeneous with the Koch Rajbongshi people and are bi-linguistic speaking both Bengali language and Koch language with Koch Rajbongshi language being replaced by Bengali language among the newer generations."
Etymology.
"There are descendants from Koch-Rajbonshi, Mech, Rabha, Bodo and Indo-Aryan people who converted to Islam. They mainly speak the Goalpariya dialect . They are mainly settled in the districts of Dhuburi, Goalpara, South Salmara and Kokrajhar. These people were loose followers of Hinduism. But when a small section of these people converted to Islam, the act was frowned upon. The local Hindus started calling them ""nosto seikh"" meaning ""spoiled Shaikh"". But as more number of people got converted to Islam with time these people came in contact with mainstream Muslims, and the term ""nosto seikh"" slowly got islamicised into ""Nashya seikh""."
Origin.
"The Nashyas trace their origin to the indigenous communities of Koch Rajbongshi of northern West Bengal, though some of them are also from Mech community. There conversion to Islam is said to have taken over two to three centuries, and the Nashya still retain many cultural traits of their pre-Islamic past. Most people of the community are non-practicing Muslims though the newer generations are becoming increasing Islamic due to globalization. From historic evidence, it seems a segment of the indigenous population of north Bengal converted started to convert to Islam when the region fell under the control of Bakhtiyar Khilji. Some of the earliest converts were the chiefs Ali Mach and Kala Pahar. Tradition also ascribes the conversion of several lineages to Sufi saints such as Torsa Pir, Pagla Pir, Shah Fakir Sahib and Shah Gari Sahib."

And there's some Coke
"and you know, just help yourself to anything."
"So it was, it was, you know, the best,"
Wow.
that was a long time ago
and that was only for a few years.
Just once a week.
Yeah.
But I don't know.
I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters.
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
And they stick around for longer.
"Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it."
And I quit you know.
Yeah.
I was just like but I'm wasting my time.
Yeah.
I really liked the little girl and everything
but I thought ...
"She does take up,"
and they do take up a lot of your time.
That ...
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I ...
They're very demanding
Uh-huh.
"Well, and she was really spoiled."
They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.
"So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch."
And the mom was a dentist
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
"Now I never knew they were that, that big, huh,"
I won't have anything to do with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
"Well, it was nice talking to you."
"Well, it certainly was, uh,"
"Maybe you can get,"
"how many,"
have you had very many of these calls?
"Uh, yeah,"
almost ever day.
How wonderful.
Yeah.
"Almost, almost ever single day from when they started it."
Yeah.
Maybe I'll just be so lucky.
"Okay,"
I enjoyed talking to you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
"Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it?"
"Yeah,"
"well, I, um,"
"about, or just over a year ago I bought my own house,"
"so this has been the first opportunity I've had to, uh, be working on my own lawn and garden,"
"and, uh, you know, when, back when I was a kid, you know, mom would send me out to weed the garden."
"I, I'd hate it, you know."
"I think, I think because most kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken advantage of"
"and, you know, there is just, I think it's just trouble waiting to happen."
"So I would advise they didn't, they didn't take a car"
"and, uh they didn't take a television"
"Is it,"
and they didn't take a refrigerator
"Maybe that,"
"Uh, I didn't do any of those, though,"
I feel less strongly about the T V and refrigerators.
"No,"
"I, I,"
"Yeah,"
"we didn't have,"
"Well, let me see,"
what have you seen lately?
"Well, uh, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE."
FIVE?
Yeah
yeah.
"only, only five?"
Yeah.
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.
"Well, no,"
didn't need to.
"No,"
I found that out
How about yourself?
I just saw the latest one.
How is it?
It was fantastic.
"Oh, I can't wait."
"Yeah,"
You too.
"Uh-huh,"
thanks.
Bye-bye.
Bye now.
Okay.
"What kind of pet do you have, Gail?"
"Well, I don't."
I have children
"Oh, you have children"
I have little children.
"Both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets,"
but we've had lots of them in the past.
Have you?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, what have you had?"
"Well, we had a dog before we moved here."
"Uh, and we couldn't bring her with us."
"We came from Colorado,"
and we've had hamsters and fish and birds.
Oh.
"Okay,"
"I've ,"
"Well, you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up."
Uh-huh.
"Well, we had a, a Schnauzer that we lost this summer,"
and he was fourteen years old.
"And, uh, we've had two Schnauzers"
"and before that we had all Dachshunds,"
"and I think my husband wants another Dachshund,"
and we're trying to debate because our children are grown
"and, and, uh, I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a you know, another dog."
That's pretty good.
"Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy"
"but, you know, he's"
Uh-huh.
"I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh,"
"Oh, that's pretty good."
Yeah.
"Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?"
"Well, it's got a, a very small furnace."
Uh-huh.
"And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well."
Yeah.
"But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months"
Uh-huh.
and I have not had to use the heat.
Wow.
Because it's all geothermal.
Yeah.
That's pretty good.
"And with all the,"
"see I've got,"
on the south side is all glass.
"Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass."
Yeah.
"I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet."
So it's almost all glass.
Wow.
"And, uh,"
My wife would love that
"Oh, yeah."
"I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows."
She loves lots of windows.
That's great.
"So, uh,"
Is it a single story?
"Well, not really."
"It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill."
"Oh, I see."
"So the first, you know,"
"the, the, the,"
what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I see."
"And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high."
Oh.
So I've got a pretty good grade there.
Yeah.
"And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
"I, I've always liked that."
"The,"
"you know, I, we don't have much yard"
but I built a small deck in the back.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck."
"I've, I've seen it, uh,"
"and, and I have no problem going out in a boat, uh,"
"it's just so dreadfully expensive,"
and there's just so many other ways live down there.
Yeah.
It's not a treat
Uh-huh.
it's what you do every day.
That's right.
You know.
That's right.
"Uh, one of my favorite things was, we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know, out on the, on the beach and you know, just, uh, pitching them out, on, uh, on, uh, what am I trying to say, newspaper and, and, breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them, and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Uh-huh.
"and, and that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh, but, the other little creatures would take care of what was left."
"That's right,"
"So, going out on a boat, never did appeal to me simply because it, you know, there was so much else to do."
that's right.
Right.
Right.
"Well, do you live like along, uh, Houston, down there?"
"No,"
no.
I live in Dallas.
I lived in Dallas.
"oh, okay."
"But you, uh,"
"Yeah,"
yeah
"And these days that helps, doesn't it?"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah.
It really does.
I know what you mean.
I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.
Now spaghetti's such an easy one.
"Um, I do that a lot."
Uh-huh.
I do spaghetti a lot.
"Yeah,"
it seems like most people like spaghetti.
"Yeah,"
I don't like to do that if it's real hot though.
Yeah.
"Because, um, I don't know,"
"I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
I guess.
"Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's right.
"And, um, we don't entertain that often,"
"but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Most,"
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often.
"I, we're, we're new to Iowa"
"so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before."
"But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,"
Okay.
"Okay,"
I guess we're ready to start.
"Well, I guess, what part of what part of the country do you live in?"
"I'm in Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, okay."
What about yourself?
"Well, I'm also in Dallas."
Okay.
"The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, have you always lived here in Dallas"
"and,"
"No,"
I've lived here for almost five years now.
I see.
"And I'm a, uh,"
"before that I was at school in Rochester, New York"
and I'm originally from Boston.
"Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood."
"That's right,"
but I like it.
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.
"Well, I missed it at first,"
but now I go back there
and I'm a real wimp about the cold
So I like it here.
Yeah.
"I think that's,"
Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too.
"I think there is some, something like that."
Uh-huh
"Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now."
Yeah.
Yeah
"But,"
"I'm not sure,"
"I'm not really sure but, what uh, the gun laws in Pennsylvania are like."
Uh-huh.
Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that.
No.
Uh-huh.
"But like I say, my son, he's, he's always had a,"
"like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old."
Uh-huh.
"But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it."
He goes to the pistol range
and and the rifle range to shoot them.
"He likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh"
"Oh, yeah."
"The skeets, you mean?"
"yeah,"
right
He likes to do that you know
Uh-huh.
"But, uh  I don't know."
Yeah.
"I think they should try to control it and everything, you know."
"But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen."
"And,"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well, you know, he was rear admiral, whatever, you know,"
and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow.
Vulcans age a lot better
"Well, yeah,"
"he didn't look too bad, did he?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"Matter of fact, he looks just as about as old and the, uh, NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK"
Imagine that.
"Yeah,"
that's amazing.
"But, did they have some pretty good special effects?"
"Oh, excellent, excellent special effects."
"But I think the script was, you know, just incredible compared to the last one."
"Yeah,"
"FIVE was, the script was bad, bad, bad"
"Well, you know why?"
"No,"
I don't.
Why?
"Uh, William Shatner wrote it."
"Oh, is that right?"
"And even worse, he directed it."
"Uh,"
"Leonard, Nimoy, he does a lot better."
"Oh, yeah,"
"he, in fact, uh, he didn't direct this one."
He produced this one
"But he directed the one before, uh, I think STAR TREK FOUR, something like that."
"but, I've seen those, too,"
"but,"
"Okay,"
"so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation,"
"but, I think we, we did it"
"Uh, yeah."
"Okay,"
"and, and your name was Lisa."
Lisa.
Great.
Are you the Expressway sites?
"I am,"
"yes,"
and I work in the north building.
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, well, thank you."
Thank you.
"All right,"
good day.
"Uh-huh,"
bye-bye.
"Uh, advice on son or daughter going to college."
Right.
"Uh, that's advice that I will need in time future for my children, rather than one that I have, uh, personal experience with"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I suppose I would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to, to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet, meet those needs."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"uh, let's see,"
"when I, when I went away to school, I'm trying to think my criteria."
"I guess when you're, when you're eighteen or so, uh, it would be important to know if it was a coed college"
"That was a, a strict requirement for me."
"And, uh, there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct."
Uh-huh.
Right.
But the system doesn't allow for the corrections
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, that's interesting."
"I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw, Georgia."
"Oh, yes."
"And, uh, she has a young boy. Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there."
And she complained quite a bit about their school system there.
Yes.
"And,"
And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in.
Right.
She was in Cobb County.
Right.
"I'm,"
I can't really say much about the schools up here.
I really don't come from here
Uh-huh.
I'm only up here temporarily on an internship
"but  uh, I live in Orlando, Florida usually."
Okay.
"And the schools down there, from what I know, are not bad."
They're pretty good.
"Well, that's great."
"But I know that in some, I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good."
Uh-huh.
"For example, I have a brother in North Carolina"
"and he says the schools there are, are incredibly bad. Uh, just terrible."
"Well, I feel that we're way behind."
uh-huh.
"So, which I've been doing."
"Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money."
Uh-huh.
"Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money"
"so that was, you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity"
and you're actually my first call.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"I had not, uh, done"
"I, I guess today  today's my first day that I could  even do it."
"Well, have you called?"
Oh.
"Oh, it is?"
"Yeah,"
"you beat me to the punch, here"
"Oh, well, that, that's nice you know."
"I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody,"
so
Uh-huh.
so that was great.
Yeah.
Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets.
"When I was working, I, uh, bought a bond a month out of my, you know,"
they automatically took it out of my  out of my payroll.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,"
"So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?"
"Well, actually, I love the car I have."
I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible.
Is that right.
Have you heard of it?
"I've, I've seen the ads for it,"
but I'm not real sure what it's about.
"Yeah, um,"
"I actually hadn't heard anything about it,"
"and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,"
"and, and they said it starred, um, Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks,"
at first they told me.
Yeah.
"And I thought, what a strange combination,"
Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep.
That is a strange combination.
"Well, actually, it starred, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks,"
so it's lot better.
Mel Brooks you probably know.
Yeah.
"I know,"
"so it, it was a strange combination."
But it turned out to be a very cute movie.
"I mean, the whole premise is that they go out"
"and, and they die"
"Oh, yeah."
"and they have to,"
Both of them.
Right.
"Both of them are dead,"
"and they happen to meet in this, this town, um, this, this sort of city where you're set up."
"You know, they go"
and they decide if you can move up to the next level.
Oh.
"I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"
"I just, I don't I think that I perhaps would let them have the boat or something,"
I'd make some quick arrangements
That's true.
and I've told so many stories about the snakes
Uh-huh.
"you know, when they pull in, there's a snake instead of a fish, and things like that"
Yeah.
"I'm just,"
Oh.
"I don't know,"
Yeah.
What's the largest fish you ever caught?
"Uh, gosh,"
"I think it was only like three and a half pounds,"
and for me that's big.
"That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really, really big."
"Uh, so, because it's always been, you know, in the, on a lake, and, uh,"
I know they have bigger fish than that
"but, you know, three and a half pounds, and that was, huge for me,"
"Oh, on a lake,"
yeah.
"On a like that's not a bad size fish. *listen; transcript should probably read ""lake"" not ""like"""
"yeah,"
that's a good size fish
I would be impressed
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"So, uh, but"
"yeah,"
I'd love to go catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing.
I've never done that.
Uh-huh.
Do you have it there?
I've I think I've seen it around.
"Yes, sir."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I love Mexican food myself."
"Oh, do you?"
Yeah.
But you go ahead now
"Oh, we, we do too."
"We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food."
I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.
"It's just primarily the price that's, uh, satisfying at this point."
"But the kids,  seem to enjoy it."
Is that right?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh, let's see."
"We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here"
"but it's, uh, not part of a chain"
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.
"But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had"
"that was, uh, not just really super."
It's nice to find a place like that.
"Oh, boy that is wonderful."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I agree with you on that."
And I was really a seafood addict myself.
"I, I love crab meat in particular."
Um.
"I, uh, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to."
"Oh, boy."
"Have you ever been to, uh, what is it, Original Book Binders in Philadelphia?"
Uh-huh.
and everybody else in my area worked first shift
Uh-huh.
and our shifts overlapped
Uh-huh.
"so I would come in,"
"and there would be people sitting at my desk, working,"
"and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this,"
"it's my vitamins,"
"I wonder, what is, you know, yeah, what is,"
"why are they working at my desk,"
and can I have it back.
Yeah.
"Can I have it back soon, maybe."
"Then you start missing stuff,"
and.
"Oh, yeah,"
"no mommy is going to take the vitamins,"
"I'm sorry,"
I have
That's okay.
"See that would, that would make me really mad,"
"because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff,"
"just because,"
"I mean, I know I have everything like a certain way"
and you know how it looks and everything.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, you know how you left it the day before."
Uh-huh. child_talking
"That would bother me, definitely."
"Oh, yeah,"
"so, that's, child_talking"
"but it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style."
"And they were referring to, you know, Captain Kirk,"
"every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell."
Oh.
And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
"Right,"
"so he kind of was a cowboy type, too."
Uh-huh
Made all the decisions
"but, uh, Jean Luke does more of a, a, committee type of management."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"uh, it's definitely a lot better A lot more realistic really."
What other movies have you seen?
"Uh, saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week."
"Oh, how was that?"
It was pretty good.
"Uh, there were a few things different than the old series,"
"but on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. And, a lot of fun."
"Lots of little funny spots, huh."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Did they have Thing
"and,"
"Oh, yes,"
"in fact, Thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series."
"I mean, you know, there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day."
Really?
And he runs around a lot.
"How did,"
I've always wondered how he gets around.
"Uh, you know, just finger hopping."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I, uh,"
"but, you know, I, I wish I had, uh, more news on things like, that I consider long range. Things like science and medicine"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I'm more, I guess I'm more into science and science fiction"
"and, uh, there's, you know,"
"not that the news is science fiction,"
"but, uh, uh, I'm more interested in that."
"Things like, uh, is NASA ready for another space shot. Uh, you know, how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, uh, you know, a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me."
Yeah.
"Well, you're right."
"There is a lot of it that's, that's just garbage, as far as I'm concerned, you know."
Uh-huh.
"But I just like the, more or less, the, the daily news, you know. Just, uh, especially the weather."
Yeah.
I like that
"Me, too."
Although they're usually wrong
"Yeah,"
"Georgia here, they're usually wrong too."
We have weird weather systems.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, like I say, as far as, as actually listening to the news, it's mostly T V, five o'clock to six thirty."
"Uh, that seems like a long time for news"
but that's how long it is.
Yeah.
"And, uh, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news."
Uh-huh.
"And then, uh, my morning paper. I can hardly wait for it to come."
Uh-huh.
and the school that I went to there was fantastic.
"It,"
"I, I really consider myself very, very lucky."
"Uh, we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking, twenty-seven, thirty kids to to a class."
Yeah.
"But,"
But your teacher had control.
Yeah.
"We zipped right along, you know."
"I, I was, I was doing mathematics, fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade, easily."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I, I  believe I was too."
"Uh,"
Uh-huh.
"But, you're right, you know."
"With all this, don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights, you've also taken  something away from the discipline, I think."
Uh-huh
"Uh, well, it, it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it, my son would be in private school."
Yeah.
We just cannot afford it.
Right.
"I was going to ask you if there, if that was an option."
"Uh, if,"
"Uh, I'm of the age that could have gone, although I didn't"
"and, uh, I guess, uh, looking back on it, I tend to think it was pretty, uh, mostly a mistake."
Uh-huh.
"On the other hand, uh, the more I learn about the history, the more I see it was incremental, uh, decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but on the whole I think it, uh, probably was the wrong thing to do."
How about you?
"I've driven one uh,"
"I drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while, about a month."
"Uh, in a month I think I put, uh, three oil coolers on it."
"Uh, every time I turned around I was having trouble with it."

It is used to support the share price in the event that the share price falls in the post-IPO aftermarket. In this case, the underwriter buys shares in the open market and then sells them back to the issuer, stabilizing the share price."

"Charles Bodinier (6 January 1844 - 1911) was a French theater manager. After working for the Comédie-Française he became director of the Théâtre d'Application and then of the Théâtre La Bodinière. La Bodinière appealed to an elite audience, and staged a variety of lectures and performances until Bodinier retired in 1902."
"Charles Bodinier was born on 6 January 1844 in Beaufort-en-Vallée, Maine-et-Loire."
"He became a professional soldier, and was captured in the war of 1870."
He was not released until 1874. In 1876 he joined the staff of the Comédie-Française.
Bodinier was Secretary-General of the Comédie-Française from 1882 to 1889.
"In 1886 Bodinier proposed to establish a small theater where the students of the Conservatoire could stage performances of the Classics, a concept that was well received by the Minister of Fine Arts."
"In his application to the ""Commission des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques"" Bodinier insisted that the Théâtre d'Application would be a school and not a profit-making enterprise, and on that basis he was given permission for six months."
Both the municipal council and the ministry subscribed to establishing the theater.
In 1887 Bodinier opened the Théâtre d'Application in an old tannery at 18 rue Saint-Lazare for use by students at the Conservatoire de Paris.
He became director of the theater in 1888.
"The foyer of the premises were used as an art gallery. The artists Jules Chéret, Ferdinand Bac and Théophile Steinlen had their first one-person shows there while the main room was being used for the Théâtre d'Application."
"The original purpose evolved. The theater at 18 rue Saint-Lazare became known as ""La Bodinière"" and began to be used for different purposes."
La Bodinière's audience came to include members of the Parisian upper class and intelligentsia.
"Starting in 1890, Bodinier began to put on ""matinées-causeries"", where well-known literary figures gave talks."
He also staged plays and shadow shows.
A popular format was a combined lecture with a recital that illustrated the topic.
Charles Bodinier abandoned the theater in 1902 and left philosophically to spend in a quiet retirement in the suburbs.
He died in 1911 aged 67.

"Nathan is most well known for creating the original music for ""Tomb Raider"". While creating the ""Tomb Raider"" music, he had an idea in mind to create music that sounded like English classical music. He notes that his influences might have come from English classical music that his father used to play when he was small. He wrote the entire score for the first ""Tomb Raider"" in four weeks without insight on the game levels to help him draw the music accordingly. On the following two games he was still getting very limited descriptions for what musical elements he needed."

Anna of Foix-Candale (1484 – 26 July 1506) was Queen of Hungary and Bohemia as the third wife of King Vladislaus II.
"Anne was the daughter of Gaston of Foix, Count of Candale and Infanta Catherine of Navarre. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Queen Eleanor of Navarre, and Gaston IV, Count of Foix. Anne grew up at the French royal court in Blois. She was educated in Latin and the Classics."
"The nephew of the French monarch, the Duke of Longueville, is reported to have been in love with her and wished to marry her, but he was prevented because a political marriage was planned for Anne. The elderly, twice-divorced and childless king Vladislaus II of Hungary of the Jagiellon dynasty had been searching a wife capable of giving him a son. His sights were set on a powerful alliance, and Anne, closely related to French royalty, was a good choice. So Anne got engaged in 1500, the marriage contract confirmed in 1501, and she wed Vladislaus by proxy at the French court in Blois in 1502. On her way to Hungary, she was much celebrated in Italy and in Venice, causing a conflict between France and Hungary over who should pay the expenses. On 29 September 1502, Anne wed Vladislaus in Székesfehérvár and she was crowned Queen of Hungary there that same day."
"Anne brought a French court and French advisors with her to Hungary. The relationship was happy at least from the king's view, and he is reported to have regarded her as a friend, assistant and a trusted advisor. She incurred debts in Venice and was said to favour this city all her life. In 1506, her signature was placed on a document alongside the king's regarding an alliance with the Habsburgs. On July 23, 1503 Anne gave birth to a daughter, known as Anna Jagellonica, and on July 1, 1506 to the long-awaited male heir, the future king Louis II. She enjoyed great popularity, but her pregnancies ruined her health. She died in Buda on July 26, 1506, a little more than three weeks after the birth of her son due to complications from delivery.

"Kung Fu VS Acrobatic (aka Thunderbolt 1991) is a 1990 Hong Kong martial arts fantasy comedy film directed by Taylor Wong and starring Andy Lau, Natalis Chan and Joey Wong. The film is a homage to the 1964 martial arts film ""Buddha's Palm"" which starred Cho Tat-wah, who also acts in a supporting role in this film."
"Advertising company staff Mo Tak-fai (Lau) and his friend Lai Chi (Chan) go to mainland China for a business trip. Chi smuggles some relics, leading to them being chased by the police. They go into a cave to escape capture, but Chi is bitten by a poisonous snake. He finds a medicine belonging to an ancient hero named Long Jianfei and shares it with Tak-fai. Not only does the medicine detoxifies Chi, it also bestows Tak-fai and Chi internal strengths. They also rescue Princess Yunluo (Wong) and her maid Xiao Man (Mui) from the Yuan Dynasty after 800 years of slumber but in the process also releasing a two-hundred-year-old evil martial arts expert Tian Can (Yuen)."
"Fai and Chi remain skeptical about the things that happened and they bring the two ladies to Hong Kong. Yunluo is able to adapt to modern life in Hong Kong very quickly. On the other hand, in order to defeat Tian Can, Yunluo helps Fai to learn the ""Buddha's Palm"" technique while Chi, due to poor qualifications, only excel at the ""Seven Rotary Slice"" technique. However, when Tian Can arrives he effortlessly defeats Fai since he has not mastered the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. Tian Can forces Fai to eat a cursed silkworm, which can cause pain to people who consume it when Tian Can plays his drum."
"The next day, Tian Can goes on a spree. He steals money from a bank ATM, threatens Fai and Chi to go to their boss' home and capture his family, as well as defeating the police who come after them. Yunluo saves the two men but Fai is furtherly injured by Tian Can in the process. Fortunately they come across Yim Chan, leader of a supernatural performing troupe from China, who heals Fai from his injuries while also channelling energy to him. A few days later, Fai finally masters the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. He and his friends confront Tian Can in a final duel and Fai uses ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" to cripple Tian Can's martial arts ability, becoming a true hero in the end."

"Brent W. Jeffs is an author, advocate, and member of the influential Jeffs family in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church)."
"Jeffs wrote the memoir ""Lost Boy"" along with author Maia Szalavitz, which was released on May 19, 2009. The book is a depiction of life within the FLDS Church and his ostracism from the organization at a young age. The title of the book comes from the term ""the lost boys"", which refers to the many young men expelled from the FLDS Church. Jeffs is a grandson to FLDS ""prophet"" Rulon Jeffs, nephew to imprisoned FLDS ""prophet"" Warren Jeffs and Lyle Jeffs, and his mother is the daughter of another non-FLDS ""prophet"" as well."

"The British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) was a firm which manufactured and sold Hollerith unit record equipment and other data-processing equipment. During World War II, BTM constructed a number of ""bombes"", machines used at Bletchley Park to break the German Enigma machine ciphers."
"The company was formed in 1902 as The Tabulator Limited, after Robert Porter obtained the rights to sell Herman Hollerith's patented machines from the US Tabulating Machine Company (later to become IBM). By 1909, the company had been renamed the ""British Tabulating Machine Company Limited"". In 1920, the company moved from London to Letchworth, Hertfordshire; it was also at this point that it started manufacturing its own machines, rather than simply reselling Hollerith equipment."
"Annual revenues were £6K in 1915, £122K in 1925, and £170K in 1937. In 1916 there were 45 staff; this increased to 132 in 1922, 326 in 1929 and 1225 in 1939."
"In return for the exclusive right to market Hollerith equipment in Britain and the Empire (excluding Canada), BTM paid 25% of its revenues to the American company by way of royalties. This became an ever-increasing burden as the years progressed; BTM attempted to renegotiate the agreement on several occasions, but it was only finally terminated in 1948."
"During World War II, BTM was called upon to design and manufacture a machine to assist breaking the German Enigma machine ciphers. This machine, known as a Bombe, was initially conceived by Alan Turing, but the actual machine was designed by BTM chief engineer Harold 'Doc' Keen, who had led the company's engineering department throughout the 1930s. The project was codenamed ""CANTAB"". By the end of the European war, over two hundred bombes had been built and installed."
"BTM built a valve based computer called the HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer). The first model (HEC 1) was built in 1951, an example is held by the Birmingham Museum. BTM went on to develop the HEC 2, 2M and 4 models, eventually building more than 100. The machines had a 2 kilobyte drum memory and 1000 valves, and could use punched cards for input and output, or drive a printer."

In 1979 she took part in a writing course at the German Literature Institute in Leipzig. After publishing two collections of her own poetry and a collection of travel memoirs, her next publication was supposed to have been a collection of interviews with people in Havelland. Small excerpts appeared in 1983 and 1984 in literature magazines in the German Democratic Republic, but the publication of the entire text, which contained numerous passages critical of relations in the German Democratic Republic, was prevented by government censorship. The book ""So sehe ick die Sache"" was therefore published openly only in West Germany."
"In 1987, Eckart used a visit to the Frankfurter Buchmesse to relocate to the Federal Republic of Germany; she remained, however, a citizen of the German Democratic Republic. In 1988 she emigrated to the United States, where she continued her studies. In 1993 she earned her Master of Arts at the University of Texas at San Antonio, and her PhD from the University of Minnesota.

He was instrumental in wresting back Marwar from Rana Kumbha along with his brother and establishing the separate kingdom of Bikaner for his nephew Rao Bika. Later, he established his own principality of Chachabad and was killed in an ambush while fighting the Delhi Sultanate forces at the age of 73."
"While camping at village Chattriyan, near Sirsa, Rao Kandhal was ambushed by the forces of Bahlol Lodi. He called on his sons Rajsi and Sura for help, who were with him; however they fled leaving their father cornered. With only fifteen men around him, they gave fight with Rao Kandhal slaying nine men and drawing swords with Bahlol Lodi himself. The battle resulted in the death of the 73-year-old Rathore chief."
"Rao Bagha at the time was at Chachabad along with his son Rao Banir. Along with the forces of Rao Bika of Bikaner and Rao Jodha of Jodhpur, Rao Bagha led his forces against Bahlol Lodi and exacted revenge for his father's death. He was killed in this battle."
"After his death, instead of his grandson Rao Banir who was then a minor, the titles of Rao Kandhal went to Rao Rajsi (of Rajasar, later Rawatsar) owing to political intrigue. Rao Banir went to Sahawa, and later shifted his seat to Shivgarh Ghanghu where he finally settled. Many junior thikanas emerged from Shivgarh Ghanghu later on, including Churu, Ghantel, Lohsana, Karanpura, Depalsar, Dudwa, Lakhau, Jhariya, Jhanjhani, among others."

= = = Edward Rigby (physician) = = =
"Edward Rigby (1747–1821) was an English physician, writer, and local politician."
"The son of John Rigby, by his wife Sarah (d. 1773), daughter of John Taylor, he was born at Chowbent, Lancashire, on 27 December 1747."
"One of his sisters married Dr. Caleb Hillier Parry, and became the mother of Sir William Edward Parry."
"Educated at Norwich School and Warrington Academy, Rigby was apprenticed in 1762 to David Martineau, surgeon, of Norwich, and then studied in London. Admitted a member of the Corporation of Surgeons on 4 May 1769, he married in the same year, and settled in Norwich."
"In 1786 Rigby took the lead in establishing the Norfolk Benevolent Society for the relief of the widows and orphans of medical men. In July 1789 he visited France and other parts of the continent, witnessing the storming of the Bastille. A practical agriculturist, he was the friend of Thomas William Coke of Holkham, he experimented on his own farm at Framingham Earl, about five miles from Norwich."
"In 1783 Rigby became a member of the corporation of guardians of Norwich, and promoted the economical administration of the Poor Laws. Meeting with much opposition, he resigned in the following year. He became alderman in 1802 in a very tight contest for the North Ward, sheriff in 1803, and mayor of Norwich in 1805, presiding over a meeting addressing the issue of smallpox in the city. Rigby is said to have made known the flying shuttle to Norwich manufacturers, and to have introduced vaccination."
"In politics Rigby was a Whig, and a supporter of William Windham. In 1794, however, when Windham became Secretary at War and had to stand again for Norwich, Rigby was one of the disillusioned Whigs who backed James Mingay against him, and proposed the candidate. Windham was elected, but Mingay's reputation as a Whig was boosted."
"Rigby died on 27 October 1821, and was buried at Framingham."
"In 1776 Rigby published ""An Essay on the Uterine Hæmorrhage which precedes the Delivery of the full-grown Fœtus"" (3rd edit. 1784; 6th edit., with a memoir by John Cross, Norwich, 1822). This work was translated into French, by Marie-Anne-Victoire Gallain Boivin (1818), and German, and made Rigby's professional reputation. He wrote also:"
"His ""Letters from France"", addressed to his wife in 1789, were first published by his daughter Lady Eastlake, London, 1880."
"Rigby married, first, Sarah, coheir of John Dybal, by whom he left two daughters, and secondly, in 1803, Anne Palgrave, daughter of William Palgrave of Great Yarmouth, by whom he had twelve children, four of whom, three girls and a boy, were the production of one birth on 15 August 1817.

= = = Masterpiece (Roy Lichtenstein) = = =
Masterpiece is a 1962 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein that uses his classic Ben-Day dots and narrative content contained within a speech balloon. In 2017 the painting sold for $165 million.
"According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, ""Masterpiece"" was part of Lichtenstein's first exhibition at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles from April 1 – April 27, 1963, featuring ""Drowning Girl"", ""Portrait of Madame Cézanne"" and other works from 1962 and 1963 When discussing another work (""I Know...Brad""), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of cliched oversimplification. ""Drowning Girl"" is another notable work with Brad as the heroic subject."
"The source of this image was a comic book panel with the two subjects positioned similarly to their position here, but they were situated in an automobile. In the source image the narrative content of the speech balloon said ""But someday the bitterness will pass..."""
"""Masterpiece"" was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited The Art Institute of Chicago from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the Tate Modern in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and The Centre Pompidou from July 3 to November 4, 2013. Several publications presented ""Masterpiece"" as part of their announcement of the retrospective."
"In January 2017, Agnes Gund sold the 1962 painting ""Masterpiece"", which for years hung over the mantle of her Upper East Side apartment, for $165 million. The proceeds of the sale will be used to start a fund for criminal justice reform called the Art for Justice fund. The painting is currently one of the 15 highest prices ever to be paid for a piece of artwork. The purchaser was Steven A. Cohen."
"""Masterpiece"" is regarded as a tongue in cheek joke that reflects upon Lichtenstein's own career. In retrospect, the joke is considered ""witty and yet eerily prescient"" because it portended some of the future turmoil that the artist would endure. In the painting, the blonde female's speech bubble, ""Why, Brad darling, This painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!"" conveys her remark as she gazes at the painting, of which a corner of the back is shown. Silent Brad conveys his agreement by his facial expression. Adrian Searle of ""The Guardian"" says that the 1962 work, whose narrative and graphical content were both borrowed, was timely because Lichtenstein had his first exhibition in New York City at Leo Castelli Gallery that year, making the painting aspirational in an ironic way that comments on success and ""the socio-sexual status of the hot young artist"". The satirical commentary on Lichtenstein's career, followed the inside joke made the year before in ""Mr. Bellamy"". According to Roberta Smith of ""The New York Times"", ""Masterpiece"" was one of Lichtenstein's works created in a way that produced ""faint and uneven"" Ben Day dots."

"Justin first approached Mike Doolin, an innovative luthier with an excellent reputation, to build a double-neck steel-string guitar. Justin wanted a guitar with two identical DADGAD-tuned necks to expand on his unique two-handed tapping style. The challenge was to design an instrument that could handle 340 pounds of string tension and yet still be acoustically responsive. The instrument features many of Doolin's innovations, including a pinless bridge, and adjustable neck angles. Doolin and King chose an instrument with a modified jumbo-style body, cocobolo (rosewood) back and sides, and a redwood top. The redwood is incredibly strong and stable, while at the same time being dynamic and possessing a rich acoustic tone. They also decided on using B-Band acoustic pickups, which are known for their excellent fidelity. The result is an unprecedented instrument, completely unique, with a wonderful tone.

"João Oliveira dos Santos (born 15 January 1933) better known as Mestre João Grande, is a Grão-Mestre (Grand Master) of the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira angola who has contributed to the spread of this art throughout the world. He was a student of the ""father of Angola"", Mestre Pastinha, and has an academy in New York City."
"Mestre João Grande was born in the village of Itagi in the south of the Brazilian state of Bahia. As a child he worked alongside his family in the fields. At the age of 10 he saw ""corta capim"" for the first time. This is a movement performed by crouching down, extending one leg in front and swinging it around in a circle, hopping over it with the other leg. Fascinated, he asked what it was called and was told that it was ""the Dance of the Nagos"" — a dance of the African descendants in the city of Salvador. The Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria had a major cultural influence in Salvador, which was considered the Black Rome of Brazil. But the dance was actually of Central African origin— it was Capoeira. João didn't learn the correct name of the movement until many years later, but it changed his life forever. At the age of ten he left home in search of ""the Dance of the Nagos""."
"Ten years later, he ended up in Brazil, the birthplace of capoeira as we know it, where he saw a proper capoeira roda for the first time. Present were mestres Menino Gordo, João Pequeno, who was there with his first teacher, Mestre Barbosa, and Cobrinha Verde, one of the most skillful players of that era."
"João Grande asked Mestre Barbosa if he could study and Mestre Barbosa sent him to João Pequeno, who later became his closest associate in capoeira. João Pequeno sent him to Mestre Pastinha who had a famous academy in the Cardeal Pequeno neighborhood of Brotas. João Grande requested permission to join his academy, and Pastinha accepted João as a student at the age of twenty, relatively late in capoeira life. While studying, João Grande worked as a longshoreman, playing after work or on his few days off."
"Mestre João Grande eventually became such an acclaimed capoeirista that when Carybé, a painter famous for his documentation of African Culture in Bahia, chose to do studies of capoeira he chose João Grande as a model."
"João Grande and João Pequeno are featured in numerous films of capoeira including one in which they demonstrate the knife techniques of the art. In 1966 João Grande travelled to Senegal with Mestre Pastinha to demonstrate capoeira at the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar. He was awarded his Diploma of capoeira from Pastinha in 1968 making him a full-fledged master of capoeira Angola. He subsequently toured Europe and the Middle East with Viva Bahia, a pioneering group that performed Afro-Brazilian folk arts such as capoeira, samba, maculelê, candomblé and puxada da rede."
"Eventually Pastinha's academy fell on hard times. Pastinha, was asked by the government to vacate his building for renovations, but the space was never returned to him. Instead it became a restaurant with entertainment, now called SENAC. Pastinha died broke and bitter about his treatment, but never regretted living the life of a capoeirista."
"João Grande returned when Mestre Moraes and Mestre Cobra Mansa persuaded him to come out of retirement in the mid-1980s. He began to teach with their organization Grupo Capoeira Angola Pelourinho. In 1989 he was invited by Jelon Vieira to tour the United States. The tour was a tremendous success. In 1990 he returned to present capoeira at the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta, Georgia and at the Schomberg Center for Research for Black Culture in New York City. João Grande decided he liked the US and has been teaching in New York City ever since."
"In 1995 he received a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Upsala College, East Orange, New Jersey. In 2001 he was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship from the NEA, which is one of the most prestigious awards given to practitioners of traditional arts in the US. He has also recorded an audio CD and several DVDs featuring himself and his students, as well as other illustrious figures of capoeira Angola."

= = = Norman Dyhrenfurth = = =
"Norman Gunther Dyhrenfurth (Breslau, today Wroclaw, May 7, 1918 – Salzburg, September 24, 2017) was a German-Swiss-American mountaineer and filmmaker. He was the leader of the successful American Mount Everest Expedition of 1963, which placed six climbers on the summit."
"Norman Dyhrenfurth was born in Germany, the son of Himalayan explorers Günter Oskar Dyhrenfurth and Hettie Dyhrenfurth. His mother was of half Jewish ancestry. After the Nazis came to power, they emigrated, first to Austria in 1933, then two years later to Switzerland, where they became citizens. In 1936, Dyhrenfurth's parents were awarded a gold medal for alpinism at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1937. His service in the United States Army enabled him to gain joint U.S.-Swiss citizenship. He was the founder of the Motion Picture Division of the Department of Theater Arts at UCLA, but resigned that position in 1952. In 1954, he was a Fulbright scholar in Italy."
"Dyhrenfurth first came to the attention of the mountaineering community in the United States in 1939, when he completed some challenging climbs in the Grand Tetons. He was a participant in the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition. In 1960, he was cameraman for the Swiss expedition to Dhaulagiri, and after that climb, approached the government of Nepal about obtaining a permit for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest. He learned that a permit had already been granted to another American climber, William Hackett. Although Dyhrenfurth tried to combine his efforts with Hackett's, that expedition failed to gain funding and never took place. Another application resulted in India being selected for an attempt to climb Everest, but Dyhrenfurth persevered and tried again."
"Dyhrenfurth received a permit from the Nepalese authorities on May 10, 1961, for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest in the spring of 1963. He recruited a team of climbers that included Jake Breitenbach, Jim Whittaker, Willi Unsoeld, Lute Jerstad, Tom Hornbein, Dave Dingman and Barry Bishop. William Siri was the deputy team leader. Al Auten was the radio operator, and Gil Roberts was the team doctor. Sherpa Nawang Gombu was also part of the team."
"On March 23, 1963, Breitenbach was killed in the collapse of a serac in the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp. The members of the expedition decided to proceed. Dyhrenfurth's style of leadership being democratic and team-oriented, he called a meeting, discussed the tragedy, let everyone speak, and when the decision was made to continue, the team remained intact. Dyhrenfurth's leadership style included a ""commitment to consensus"", and he was considered by those who have studied the expedition a ""huge asset to the team""."
"On May 1, Whittaker and Gombu reached the summit of Mount Everest by the South Col route used by the successful British expedition of 1953."
"On May 22, Unsoeld and Hornbein completed the first ascent of the West Ridge, descending by the South Col, thus completing the first traverse of Everest. That same day, Bishop and Jerstad reached the summit by the South Col route. The two pairs of climbers met up high on the mountain, and made their descent in the gathering darkness. From midnight until 4:00 am, they bivouacked high on the mountain, without sleeping bags, tents or bottled oxygen. All survived, though Unsoeld and Bishop suffered from frostbite, resulting in the amputation of toes."

"Hon. Patrick Perkins, J. P., (10 October 1838 — 17 May 1901), nicknamed Paddy Perkins, was a brewer and politician in colonial Queensland. He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and, later, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council."
"Patrick Perkins was born in a humble cottage on a small farm in the village of Clonoulty near Cashel, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was the second son of Thomas Perkins, a farmer, and his wife Ellen (""née"" Gooley). He attended the local National School."
"Thomas and Ellen Perkins and their eight children (including Patrick) immigrated on the ""Persian"", departing Southampton and arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 9 April 1854."
"In 1861, he married Mary Ellen Hickey in Victoria. They had four children born in Victoria:Thomas Hector (born 1864); Mary Eveleen, (1867-1942) m. Charles Seymour-Allan; Edgar Colin Francis (born 1868) and Lilly Eleanor Perkins (born 1875) m. Randall Macdonnell, m. George Wilkie Gray. They had two children born in Queensland: Patrick Harold (born 1878) and Helene Cicilia (born 1880, Toowoomba d 1965 Adelaide), Sr Margaret Mary of the Dominican priory, Adelaide."
"Patrick Perkins was a miner and storekeeper on the diggings in Victoria in districts including Ballarat, Bendigo, Woods Point and Jamieson."
"With his brother Thomas, he started breweries in Victoria and Queensland. In 1866, Patrick Perkins started the Perkins Brewery in Toowoomba. In 1872, he later extended his operations to Brisbane with the purchase of the City Brewery in 1872."
"In 1876, Patrick Perkins moved to Queensland in order to manage the Brisbane and Toowoomba breweries."
"Perkins also had interests in property and mining, including the Mount Morgan Mine and coal mining in the West Moreton area."
He was considered a shrewd and successful business man.
"On 9 April 1877, Edward Wilmot Pechey, the member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the seat of Aubigny, resigned. On 1 May 1877, in a by-election, Perkins was elected in Aubigny, defeating Angus Mackay (the then editor of ""The Queenslander"") by a large majority. He was elected again in Aubigny in the 1878 election and was appointed as Minister of Lands in the First McIlwraith Ministry from 21 January 1879 to 13 November 1883."
"Perkins was elected again in Aubigny in the 1883 election, However, allegations about electoral fraud (including intimidation, bribery, and ballot stuffing) in the Aubigny election started to surface, resulting in a petition to the Governor of Queensland detailing numerous kind of electoral fraud and asking to declare that the Aubigny election was void and that Patrick Perkins was guilty of bribery and corruption. On 21 February 1884, the Committee of Elections and Qualifications ruled the Aubigny election was null and void and called for a by-election. Perkins had denied any involvement in the alleged electoral fraud and the Committee of Elections and Qualifications did not disqualify him from re-contesting the seat, which provoked outrage in some quarters. However, Patrick Perkins announced he would not re-contest the seat as he would be taking a trip to England."
James Campbell was elected unopposed at the resulting by-election on 4 March 1884.
"At the 1888 election, Perkins was elected in the seat of Cambooya on 10 May 1888, which he held until 6 May 1893."
"On 23 May 1893, Perkins was appointed to Queensland Legislative Council from 23 May 1893. Being a lifetime appointment, he served until his death on 17 May 1901."
"In 1883 used his wealth to buy a palatial home at 273 North Quay, Brisbane, which he called ""Aubigny"" after the electorate that first sent him to parliament. The house was originally built in 1870 by Samuel Davis, a Jewish businessman, and included a separate building used as Brisbane's first synagogue. Patrick Perkins used the former synagogue as a billiards room. In 1899, the Perkins family rented the property to the Criminal Investigation Department which used the house as offices and the synagogue as a photography room. In 1906, the house was sold to the Rev. Mother Patrick of the Sisters of Mercy to create the 20-bed Mater Misericordiae Hospital (now a tertiary hospital located at South Brisbane); the former synagogue being the hospital chapel. Once the hospital outgrew the house and relocated to the South Brisbane area where it still operates, the house was renamed ""Loretto"" and used as a hostel for Catholic girls; the former synagogue being the maids' quarters. In about 1939 the house was demolished to make way for the construction of a church for the Church of Christ, Scientist."
"He attended the opening of the first Federal Parliament at the Royal Exhibition Building on 9 May 1901 and caught a chill which developed into bronchial pneumonia, from which he died on Friday 17 May 1901 at ""Ingleborough"", Berkeley Street, Hawthorn."
"On Saturday 18 May 1901, his funeral was conducted at the Roman Catholic church at Glenferrie, after which he was buried in the Boroondara General Cemetery in Kew, Melbourne."

= = = Der Philosophische Arzt = = =
"Der Philosophische Arzt is a medical publication published in the late 18th century by Melchior Adam Weikard, a prominent German physician and philosopher to the Russian Empress, Catherine II."
"The first edition of ""Der Philosophische Arzt"" was first published in 1775, but perhaps as early as 1770. It was initially published anonymously as was the second edition, though it was widely believed that Weikard was the author. The reason for doing so is unclear but was probably due to anticipated critical reactions to its publication from several sources. A principal one was the Prince-Bishop of Fulda, to whom Weikard served as physician and in a Catholic region where Weikard worked as a spa doctor being supported by the state. According to Otto Schmitt's biography of Weikard published in 1970, the reaction of organized religion to the publication of his textbook was widespread condemnation. This was likely due to his attacks in the textbook on various religious practices for curing medical illnesses. According to Schmidt, the attacks against Weikard continued throughout his career but his patron, Prince Heinrich von Bibra, maintained an amicable relationship with him and supported him financially late in his career despite many people who criticized the Prince for doing so."

The football program installed one of the first artificial turfs in the state, the only Sprinturf installation in Arizona, as its main football, soccer, and track field at a cost of $1 million."
"Paradise Valley opened in 1957 at Bell Road and 40th street which at the time was on the outskirts of Phoenix. The original campus consisted of an administration building, several small classroom buildings and a small gymnasium and athletic fields located to the north of the classroom buildings. In the 1960s a library, cafeteria, shop building and three larger classroom buildings were added to the campus. The gymnasium was also expanded in the 1960s. In the early 1970s a new building called the 700 building was constructed. Between 1976 and 1979 several new buildings designed by the Tempe architecture office of Michael & Kemper Goodwin Ltd. The plan included a new vocational education building and an additional physical education building. In 1982 the remaining 1957 classroom buildings were demolished to make way for a larger classroom building. The new building was nearly complete when the 1983-1984 school year began. At that time the 1960s buildings were updated. In 1983 the 700 building was demolished to make way for a new 1,200 seat auditorium and associated fine arts building. The auditorium and fine arts building were completed in 1984. In 1990 it was decided that Paradise Valley would close its original campus and move to a new campus being constructed at Union Hills Drive and 16th Street. The new campus opened for the 1991-1992 school year. It was then decided that the original campus would be renovated and reopened. The original gymnasium as well as the administration building were demolished and rebuilt and the campus was thoroughly spruced up. The updated school reopened for the 1993-1994 school year. The new campus on Union Hills was then renamed North Canyon High School. The CREST STEM program was established in 2010 offering students classes in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. In 2013 the three 1960s classroom buildings were demolished to make way for two new twin story buildings housing the science department and CTE classes. In 2013 the auditorium was also completely renovated. The 2013 projects were completed by McCarthy Construction."
When the school was established the Paradise Valley High School District was also created. In July 1976 the high school district unified with the elementary district to form the Paradise Valley Unified School District.

"A 6'11"" power forward/center, McDaniels averaged nearly 40 points per game as a senior at Allen County High School in Scottsville, Kentucky. From 1967 to 1971, he played at Western Kentucky University, leading his team to a third-place finish in the 1971 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. (The NCAA later voided Western Kentucky's participation in the tournament, accusing McDaniels of signing with an agent while still in college.) He also set WKU school records with 2,238 career points (now tied with Courtney Lee) and 1,118 career rebounds."
"McDaniels was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round of the 1971 NBA draft and No. one overall by the Dallas Chaparrals in the 1971 American Basketball Association Draft, but he began his professional career with the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association, who offered him a $1.35 million contract to be paid over twenty-five years. Reportedly, the Cougars first approached McDaniels during November 1970, while he was still playing for Western Kentucky. McDaniels averaged 26.8 points and 14 rebounds in 58 games with the Cougars during the 1971–72 season and scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the 1972 ABA All-Star Game. However, he feuded with the Cougars while trying to renegotiate his contract – he wanted his salary to be spread over fifteen years, rather than twenty-five – and near the end of his rookie season he decided to leave the Cougars for the SuperSonics."
"McDaniels remained with Seattle for the next two full seasons. However, he struggled to maintain the same level of production he had achieved in the ABA, and by the 1973–74 NBA season, McDaniels was averaging just 5.5 points per game. During that time, McDaniels was dogged by off-court troubles as the Cougars questioned the legality of his jump to the NBA. He later admitted in an interview, ""I should have stayed in the ABA for a couple of years. I was just young and things started going bad for me there and I didn't know how to handle them.""

= = = Joe Cesare Colombo = = =
"Joe Colombo, born Cesare Colombo (30 July 1930 – 30 July 1971) was an Italian industrial designer."
"Cesare ""Joe"" Colombo was until 1949 educated at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, the academy of fine arts, in Milano as a painter and studied afterwards until 1954 Architecture at Politecnico di Milano University."
"In 1951 he joined the ""Movimento Nucleare"", founded by Sergio D´Angelo and Enrico Baj. The following four years Colombo was active as a painter and sculptor of the abstract Expressionism and exhibited his works with other members in Milano, Torino, Verviers, Venice and Brussels."
"In 1955 Colombo joined the Art Concret group, but gave up his painting to promote his Design Career. Before he cooperated at an exhibition for the tenth Triennale of 1954 and documented the Ceramic Designs of an international meeting in Albisola. For his presentation Colombo created for example three exterior seatings which were combined with a ""shrinelike"" presentation of TVs."
"In 1959, Colombo had to take over the family company, which produced electric appliances, and started to experiment with new construction and production technologies. In 1962 Colombo opened his own interior design and architecture projects, mostly for lodges and skiing."
"Colombo designed products for Oluce, Kartell, Bieffe, Alessi, Flexform and Boffi."
Colombo died in 1971 on his 41st birthday.
"Together with his brother Gianni, Colombo developed the idea of prismatic lamps like the lamp ""Acrilica""(1962). His first design for Kartell was the chair ""No.4801"" (1963–1967) which consisted of three assembled plywood elements. The flowing elements of his chair were a foretaste of his later plastic designs, like the chair ""universale No.4860"" (1965–1967), which was the first seating for adults made of ABS."
"Moreover, Colombo produced innovative designs for furniture, lamps, glass, doorknobs, pipes, alarm clocks, and wristwatches. He created the professional camera ""Trisystem"" (1969), the air conditioner ""Candy"" (1970), dinnerware for Alitalia (1970; still in use), as well as an ergonomic and engined printing table."
"Since the beginning of his career Colombo was most interested in living systems. His early modular container ""Combi-Centre"" of 1963 is an example for that. This preference for furniture systems led to designs like ""Additional Living System"" (1967–1968) and the chairs ""Tube"" (1969–1970) and ""Multi"" (1970), which could be assembled in various positions to get a great number of sitting positions."

"Blas Ruiz de Hernán González or Blas Ruiz de Fernán González was an explorer from Ciudad Real, Spain."
"In the last decade of the 16th century, along with the Portuguese adventurer Diogo Veloso from Amarante, Blas Ruiz was the first European to ever set foot in Laos."
"Ruiz's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Ruiz met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Veloso of Portugal. When Lovek was invaded by Ayautthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Ruiz to flee to the Spanish colony of the Philippines, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Ruiz returned with Veloso, who had fled to the Portuguese colony of Melaka, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam. Ruiz and Veloso decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek."
"Ruiz and Veloso arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian Elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Ruiz and Veloso were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Ruiz and Veloso returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayatthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos. Eventually Ruiz returned to the Philippines. It is not known whether he died there, Spain, or somewhere else."
"In July 1593 king Satha I sent an embassy to Manila asking for Spanish military help to defend Cambodia. The embassy consisted of Portuguese Diogo Veloso, who had been living in his court since 1583, and Spanish Gregorio de Vargas Machuca. Satha I kept Spanish Bias Ruiz de Hernan Gonzalez as captain of his bodyguard. Veloso came back in February 1594, alone and without help. After Ayutthaya's attack on Cambodia, Veloso, Bias Ruiz and de Vargas Machuca found themselves in Manila. They continued to ask for help, and at last, Spanish Manila agreed to send 3 ships with 120 Spanish and Mexican soldiers, some Japanese and Philippino auxiliaries and some friars, under the commander Suarez Gallinato. The ship with Bias Ruiz was the only one that reached Cambodia. The one with Veloso was wrecked off the Mekong delta and Gallinato's ship was forced to go to Malacca due to the weather. Veloso rejoined Bias Ruiz at Phnom Penh in March 1596. They were both killed at Phnom Penh in July 1599 during a fight between Christians (Spanish and Philippinos) and Muslim Malay mercenaries of Barom Reacha II, who was Satha's son. Satha had died in October 1597 after contracting disease after he fled to Lan Xang."
"The women featured had a separate section from the men. There were only three women listed in the top 50. Sheikha Munira al-Qubaysi (number 21), an educator of girls and women; Queen Rania of Jordan (number 37), who promotes global education; and Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned of Qatar (number 38), who is chairwoman of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development."
"The listing also includes an extensive Arts and Culture Section. The general Arts and Culture Section included the names of singers Salif Keita, Youssou N'Dour, Raihan, Yusuf Islam and Sami Yusuf, Dawud Wharnsby; musician A. R. Rahman (India); film stars Aamir Khan and Shahrukh Khan; comedian Azhar Usman and martial artist Ma Yue. All the Qāriʾs (Quran reciters) listed in the book are from Saudi Arabia."
"""Foreign Policy"" magazine's Marc Lynch stated, ""Esposito and Kalin's methodology seems strange. Any list in which the Sultan of Oman (Qaboos bin Said al Said, who was sixth) outranks, say, Turkish preacher Fethullah Gülen (placed 13th) or the Aga Khan (Aga Khan IV, who was placed 20th) seems odd to this observer..."""
"In 2010, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list as the most influential Muslim in the world for the second consecutive year. Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei maintained second place. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan moved into third place. Jordanian King Abdullah II was placed fourth above Moroccan King Mohammed VI who moved down to fifth place."
"In 2011, achievements of a lifetime were given more weight than achievements within the current year. which meant that the lists of names were going to change gradually, rather than dramatically, year-on-year. The Arab Spring had no impact on Saudi King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's influence, it had boosted King Mohammed VI of Morocco's influence, who moved up to second place, and it had no effect on Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who came in third place."
"Erdoğan was expected by many to receive the top spot in light of the Arab Spring. Erdoğan was credited with Turkey's ""Muslim democracy"", and was seen as the leader of a country that, as the Brookings Institution said, ""played the 'most constructive' role in the Arab events."""
"Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani influence rose during the Arab Spring, moving him to sixth place. He had driven much of the Arab Spring through the coverage given by ""Al Jazeera"", given financial support to protesters and political support to Libya, making him arguably the biggest enabler of the Arab Spring."
"In 2012, the edition was published by S. Abdallah Schleifer, Professor Emeritus and Senior Fellow Kamal Adham Center for Television & Digital Journalism, The American University in Cairo."
"There were more Muslims from America than any other country again with 41 spots on the 500 list. Countries with the next highest number of names were Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom, with 25 Muslims each, followed by Indonesia, with 24. It lists the winners according to 13 categories, including spiritual guides, Quran reciters, scholars, politicians, celebrities, sports figures, radicals, and media leaders."
"For the fourth year running, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list. He was followed by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at second place. Erdoğan's advance gave him advantage over Moroccan King Mohammed VI who took the third place. Fourth place went to Dr Mohammed Badie, whose name appeared in the top 10 for the first time. He was followed by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who took the fifth place. Sheikh Al-Azhar Dr. Ahmad el-Tayeb and prominent Islamic scholar Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi who is President of Global Association of Muslim Scholars, also made it to the top 10 ranks."
"""The Clarinet Projected"" reported that they considered seven of the top ten to be ""Islamists""."
"In 2013, the list was edited once again by Professor Emeritus S. Abdallah Schleifer of the American University in Cairo."
"The top of the list went to Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Sheikh of the Al Azhar University for the prominent role played by him in Egypt's troubled democratic transition His astute decision making over the past couple of years has preserved the traditional approach of Al-Azhar which faced threats from Islamists and Salafis in the years that have followed Mubarak's fall. His public support of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's coup also gave it a strong religious grounding that was necessary for it to achieve the legitimacy needed to prevent a civil war, effectively making him a ""king-maker"" and cementing his place at the top of the list. He was followed on the listing by Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud and Iranian Grand Leader Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei."
"Reflective of the wider trajectory of the Arab Spring, this year's list showed a decline in influence from Muslim Brotherhood associated figures Dr Mohammed Badie, Sheikh Yusuf al Qaradawi and ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. Coup kingpin General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who was previously unlisted now ranks at 29."
"The US dominates the list again with 41 inclusions including Muhammad Ali, Dr Mehmet Oz, Rep. Keith Ellison, Yasiin Bey (Mos Def), and Fareed Zakaria. Representing the UK are Mo Farah, Yusuf Islam, Riz Khan, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, Cambridge's Dr Timothy Winter and 18 others."
"In 2014, the chief editor of the list was again Professor S Abdallah Schleifer. The top spot went back to Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, due to his being the ""absolute monarch of the most powerful Arab nation."" The list accords him the place in light of Saudi Arabia being home to Islam's two holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, which millions of Muslims visit throughout the year, as well as the kingdom's oil exports. Rounding out the top three are Dr Muhammad Ahmed al-Tayeb, grand sheikh of Al-Azhar University and grand imam of Al-Azhar mosque, and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The top nine are all political leaders and royals, including Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan."
"The top 50 fit into six broad categories: 12 are political leaders (kings, generals, presidents), four are spiritual leaders (Sufi shaykhs), 14 are national or international religious authorities, three are ""preachers"", six are high-level scholars, 11 are leaders of movements or organizations. In total 72 Americans are among the 500 most influential Muslims, a disproportionately strong showing, but only one among the top 50, Sheikh Hamza Yusuf Hanson of Zaytuna Institute listed at number 38."
"In 2015, the top 50 was again dominated by religious scholars and heads of state. The top five, was King Abdullah of Jordan; Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand sheikh of Egypt's Al-Azhar University; King Salman of Saudi Arabia; Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan came in at Number eight, but surprisingly Syrian President Bashar al-Assad did not make the Top 50 this year or last, though he is still listed in the 500. The prime minister of Iraq did not make the list, but Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Hussein Sistani did, coming in at number nine."
"There was 32 newcomers to the 2016 list. 22 Indians featured on the list. As in past years, there continued to be more Muslims from the United States than any other country. Since at least 2012, the U.S. has outpaced nations with a far larger Muslim population, with at least 40 notable people of influence, with Pakistan (33), Saudi Arabia (32), Egypt (27) and the UK (27)."

"Maryland Route 170 (MD 170) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs from MD 175 in Odenton north to MD 2 in Brooklyn Park. MD 170 connects the western Anne Arundel County communities of Odenton and Severn and the North County communities of Linthicum, Pumphrey, and Brooklyn Park with Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI Airport). The highway connects BWI Airport with Interstate 695 (I-695) and MD 100 and forms part of the Airport Loop, a circumferential highway that connects the airport and I-195 with many airport-related services."
"MD 170 originally served as the main highway between Baltimore and Fort George G. Meade. This highway, which included part of modern MD 174 west of Severn, was mostly constructed shortly after Camp Meade was established during World War I in the late 1910s. The Odenton–Severn portion of MD 170 was originally built as MD 554 in the 1930s, but became part of MD 170 in the mid-1940s. MD 170 went through another round of upgrades in the early 1940s due to its strategic importance during World War II. The highway originally passed through the area now occupied by BWI Airport. MD 170 was relocated north of MD 176 in the late 1940s during the construction of the airport and south of MD 176 in the late 1950s. The highway has been expanded to four lanes around its interchanges with I-195, I-695, MD 32, and MD 100 and along the perimeter of BWI Airport since the 1960s."
"MD 170 begins at an intersection with MD 175 (Annapolis Road) in Odenton. The highway continues south as county-maintained Piney Orchard Parkway, which leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line and the Piney Orchard community. MD 170 heads north on Telegraph Road, which begins as a four-lane divided highway but reduces to a two-lane undivided road and passes through an industrial area. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway again shortly before its diamond interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). MD 170 continues north as a two-lane road with a center left-turn lane that crosses Severn Run. The center turn lane ends as the highway approaches the center of Severn. There, the highway intersects MD 174, which heads west as Reece Road and east as Donaldson Avenue. MD 170 expands to a four-lane divided highway as it approaches its single-point urban interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The highway becomes an undivided four-lane road between MD 100 and its intersection with MD 176 (Dorsey Road) at Harmans. The long ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 100 is unsigned MD 170A."
"MD 170 continues north as Aviation Boulevard and joins the Airport Loop. The highway parallels the Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, which carries MARC's Penn Line, and the hiker-biker BWI Trail. MD 170 meets the eastern end of Stoney Run Road, which heads east and immediately loops back west and crosses over the state highway and the railroad on its way to the BWI Car Rental Facility. The highway intersects unsigned MD 995 (Amtrak Way), which leads to the BWI Rail Station serving Amtrak and MARC trains, as it gradually curves to the east. MD 170 crosses Kitten Branch immediately before its partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern terminus of I-195 and the northern terminus of MD 995A (Metropolitan Boulevard). The highway passes under the BWI Trail and expands to a divided highway before its intersection with Terminal Road and an at-grade intersection with MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink. Access to the rail line's BWI Business District station is via Elkridge Landing Road at the next intersection. MD 170 leaves the Airport Loop at its intersection with MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), where the highway turns north onto Camp Meade Road."
"MD 170 intersects the Baltimore Light Rail again and begins to parallel it as a two-lane road with a center turn lane. The light rail veers away to the east shortly before the highway's intersection with MD 762 (Andover Road), where the center turn lane ends. MD 170 enters Linthicum and intersects the light rail line a third time and begins to parallel it again shortly before the Linthicum station in the center of the community. The highway intersects MD 169 (Maple Road) and expands to a four-lane divided highway shortly before its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). There is no access from MD 170 to eastbound I-695 or from westbound I-695 to MD 170. The highway reduces to a two-lane road again and passes the North Linthicum station just south of MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard) in the center of Pumphrey. MD 170 continues northeast as Belle Grove Road, which veers away from the light rail line. The highway parallels the Patapsco River and passes under I-895 Spur (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) before entering Brooklyn Park. There, MD 170 reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with MD 2, Jack Street, and Hanover Street at the Baltimore city limits. MD 2 heads south as Governor Ritchie Highway toward Glen Burnie and north into the city as Potee Street."
"MD 170 is a part of the National Highway System from its southern terminus in Odenton to I-695 in Linthicum. Within that stretch, there are two sections that serve as intermodal passenger transport links: from its southern terminus to MD 32 in Odenton, and from MD 176 to MD 162 along the perimeter of BWI Airport. The portions from MD 32 in Odenton to MD 176 in Severn and from MD 162 to I-695 within Linthicum are National Highway System principal arterials."
"When the Maryland State Roads Commission applied numbers to state highways, they assigned MD 170 to its current corridor from Severn to Brooklyn Park and to what is now MD 174 from Severn to Fort Meade. The portion of the modern highway from Odenton to Severn was originally MD 554. Much of what was to become MD 170 was constructed along the Old Annapolis Road between Pumphrey and Severn. A portion of this road ran through the hamlet of Wellham Crossroads in the middle of what is now BWI Airport. The highway was paved in macadam from the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard in Pumphrey to Hammonds Ferry Road in Linthicum by 1910. A second section of improved highway was planned by 1910 from Linthicum south to Wellham Crossroads. A section of highway from the current MD 170–MD 174 intersection in Severn west to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor) was built as a concrete road by 1915."
"Construction on the highway from Severn to Linthicum became a high priority with the United States' entrance into World War I; the remainder of the Severn–Linthicum highway and the highway from the railroad at Severn southwest to newly established Camp Meade, now collectively called the Camp Meade Road, were paved in concrete between 1916 and 1919. Belle Grove Road from Pumphrey to Brooklyn Park was also paved in concrete in this period of time. A poorly constructed portion of the Camp Meade Road between Wellham Crossroads and Dorsey Road was repaved with asphalt in 1919. MD 170 was relocated at the railroad crossing when the highway's overpass of the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed in 1931. The old road, which is now Severn Station Road west of the tracks and Old Camp Meade Road to the east, became MD 483."
"Telegraph Road from Severn to Odenton was built as a concrete road in three sections. The highway was constructed from the right-angle turn in the Camp Meade Road in Severn south to Evergreen Road in 1932 and 1933. Another section of MD 554 was completed from Odenton Road (then MD 180 and later MD 677) in Odenton to a point north of Old Mill Road in 1936. The gap in MD 554 was filled in or shortly after 1940. MD 170 was widened to from Brooklyn Park to Pumphrey in 1940. With the outbreak of World War II, MD 170 was designated a road of strategic importance to connect Baltimore with Fort Meade; the highway was reconstructed as a asphalt-surfaced concrete road in 1942. By 1946, MD 170 and MD 554 had swapped numbers, with the former now the road from Severn to Odenton."
"MD 170 was relocated as a road from MD 176 north to what is now the MD 170–MD 162 junction in 1947 and 1948 to make way for the construction of Friendship International Airport. The highway's interchange with the Friendship International Airport Access Road, which was designated MD 46 and later became I-195, was started in 1950, the same year the airport opened, and completed in 1954. South of the airport, MD 170 ran concurrently with MD 176 from the current MD 176–MD 652 intersection west to current MD 170A, which the highway used to connect with the modern alignment of MD 170. The stub of MD 170 north from MD 176 to Friendship Cemetery on the airport reservation became MD 652. MD 170 assumed its present alignment west of MD 170A when the highway was relocated from MD 176 south to the site of the MD 100 interchange as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway between 1958 and 1960. The old alignment became much of current MD 652 and the portion of MD 652 north of MD 176 was transferred to county maintenance."
"When the expressway spur between MD 168 and U.S. Route 301 (now MD 648) was built between 1951 and 1954, the expressway, which became part of the Baltimore Beltway, included an at-grade intersection with MD 170 between Linthicum and Pumphrey. This junction was replaced with the present interchange in 1967; MD 170 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of the interchange in 1968. MD 170's grade separation with Stoney Run Road on the west side of the airport was built in 1982. The state highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from north of I-195 to MD 162 when the adjacent east–west portion of MD 162 was built in 1988. MD 170 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway through its interchange with MD 100 when the single-point urban interchange was built in 1995. MD 170 had been expanded to four lanes through its interchange with MD 32 and from MD 176 through the I-195 interchange, and had its southern terminus rolled back from MD 677 to MD 175, by 1999."
"MD 170A is the designation for the one-way ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 170 southwest of BWI Airport. The ramp is included in the clockwise direction of the Airport Loop and has a spur near its southern end. MD 170A, which has the official designation of MD 170 Spur, was assigned by 1999."

"Stuart A. Weitzman (born 1941) is an American shoe designer, entrepreneur and founder of the shoe company, Stuart Weitzman. Weitzman has designed footwear for Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. In 2014 Weitzman paid a world record $9.48 million for the British Guiana 1c magenta stamp. In May 2017, Stuart Weitzman Holdings, LLC, appointed Giovanni Morelli as Creative Director and Weitzman stepped down from his role."
"In the late 1950s, Weitzman's father, Seymour Weitzman and his older brother Warren opened a shoe factory in Haverhill, Massachusetts, called ""Seymour Shoes"". Weitzman began designing shoes for his father's business in the early 1960s."
"Weitzman graduated from George W. Hewlett High School in 1958 and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1963. When Seymour died in 1965, Warren and Stuart ran the business. They sold the business to a company in Spain in 1971, and Weitzman continued to design shoes for the company. In 1994, he bought back the business, but he continues to manufacture his shoe designs in Spain."
"Weitzman is known for providing one-of-a-kind, ""million dollar"" shoes to an Oscar nominee to wear at the Academy Awards, including a pair of platinum sandals adorned with 464 diamonds that actress Laura Harring wore to the 2002 ceremony. For the 2007 Oscars, shoes were designed for and provided to Diablo Cody, who subsequently declined to wear them, stating that she was not aware of nor interested in the publicity attendant with wearing the shoes. Weitzman uses unique materials including cork, vinyl, lucite, wallpaper, and 24-karat gold. His shoes are sold in over 70 countries."
"The eponymous company that Weitzman founded has changed hands a number of times. Jones Apparel Group purchased a majority stake in the company in 2010 and later bought the remaining 45 percent of shares retained by Weitzman in 2012. In January 2015, Sycamore Partners LLC (the private equity fund that owns Jones Apparel Group) agreed to sell the company to Coach, the luxury fashion house, for $574 million. As part of the deal, Weitzman stayed on as a shoe designer for the company."
Weitzman is married to Jane Gershon. Stuart and Jane have two daughters.
"On June 17, 2014, Weitzman, who had collected stamps as a child, anonymously purchased the ""world's most famous stamp"", the British Guiana 1c magenta at a Sotheby's auction in New York for $9,480,000, including buyer's premium, the highest price ever paid for a postage stamp. Weitzman has since identified himself as the purchaser and has lent the stamp to the National Postal Museum for exhibition. In June 2015, Weitzman also identified himself as the current owner of the unique plate block of four 1918 U.S. 24-cent Inverted Jennies, widely regarded as the world's most celebrated philatelic printing error."
Stuart has a philanthropic foundation in Spain and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Hispanojudía Foundation.

MD 175 is a major highway through the large unincorporated community of Columbia; the highway connects U.S. Route 29 (US 29) next to Columbia Town Center with Interstate 95 (I-95) and an industrial area on the eastern side of Howard County. MD 175 also connects Fort Meade with Jessup and Odenton in western Anne Arundel County, where it links MD 295 and MD 32 with the eastern part of the U.S. Army base."
"MD 175 was constructed from Ellicott City to Millersville in the late 1920s and early 1930s as part of three routes: MD 531 from MD 103 near Ellicott City to US 1 near Jessup, MD 175 from there to Fort Meade and north to Hanover, and MD 180 from Odenton to Millersville. The highway did not originally extend through Fort Meade; MD 175 was constructed through the military installation in the early 1940s as part of major upgrades to the highway from Jessup to Odenton due to its strategic importance. By 1946, MD 175 extended from Ellicott City to Millersville. The highway was widened from Odenton to Millersville in the late 1940s and from Ellicott City to Odenton in the mid-1950s. MD 175 was relocated at I-95 around 1970 and as a major highway through the newly constructed community of Columbia in the mid-1970s. The old portion of the highway from Ellicott City to the new highway became MD 108 and MD 104. There are plans to expand MD 175 to a multi-lane divided highway through Fort Meade due to increased activity at the Army post."
"MD 175 begins just west of its bridges over the Little Patuxent River. The highway continues southwest as Little Patuxent Parkway, the county-maintained six-lane divided highway that forms the main street of Columbia Town Center. MD 175 heads east as Rouse Parkway, a four-lane divided controlled access highway; the highway was renamed from Little Patuxent Parkway to honor Columbia founder James Rouse and his wife Patty in 2006. The highway immediately has a cloverleaf interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike). MD 175 heads southeast through intersections with Thunder Hill Road, Tamar Drive, and Dobbin Road as it passes between the Columbia villages of Oakland Mills to the southwest and Long Reach to the northeast. The state highway expands to six lanes at Dobbin Road and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Snowden River Parkway that provides access to a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses and a trumpet interchange with Columbia Gateway Drive. Access from eastbound MD 175 to Columbia Gateway Drive requires using the Snowden River Parkway interchange. MD 175 widens to eight lanes at Columbia Gateway Drive, a width the highway carries through its intersection with the eastern end of MD 108 (Waterloo Road) to the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95. The highway's name changes from Rouse Parkway to Waterloo Road at the MD 108 junction. MD 175 has six lanes from I-95 to east of its junction with US 1 (Washington Boulevard), which was the site of a tavern called Waterloo and before that Spurrier's Tavern."
"MD 175 narrows to a two-lane undivided road as it passes between the Maryland Wholesale Produce Distribution Center to the southwest and the Patuxent Institution on the northeast and enters Jessup. East of Dorsey Run Road, which leads to the Jessup Auto Distribution Center, the state highway crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision and enters Anne Arundel County, where the highway's name changes to Jessup Road. East of the tracks, MD 175 meets the eastern end of unsigned MD 723 (Old Jessup Road), which accesses the Jessup station on MARC's Camden Line, which uses the Capital Subdivision tracks. The highway continues east past the former Maryland House of Correction and has a cloverleaf interchange with MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway), where the highway's name becomes Annapolis Road. MD 175 temporarily expands to four lanes at its intersection with MD 713, which heads south as Rockenbach Road into Fort Meade and north as Ridge Road toward Hanover. The highway passes through the eastern part of Fort Meade and expands to a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane at Reece Road, which becomes MD 174 on the eastern boundary of the military installation."
"At the southeastern corner of the fort, MD 175 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway) and enters Odenton. The highway crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and meets the southern end of MD 170 (Telegraph Road); the south leg of the intersection, Piney Orchard Parkway, leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line, which uses the Amtrak tracks. MD 175 continues as a four-lane undivided highway to a five-legged roundabout at the eastern end of Odenton where the highway meets Odenton Road, Higgins Drive, and Sappington Station Road, which is unsigned MD 32AA. The highway continues as a two-lane undivided road past Arundel High School and through the village of Gambrills before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway) west of Millersville. MD 175 has separate intersections with southbound and northbound MD 3; Millersville Road continues east from the northbound intersection through the eponymous village and past the historic Childs Residence."
MD 175 is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal freight transport connector from I-95 to Dorsey Run Road in Jessup and as a principal arterial from US 29 to I-95 through Columbia.
"The first section of MD 175 was constructed between 1924 and 1926 as a macadam road from US 1 southeast to the entrance of the Maryland House of Correction east of the B&O Railroad (now CSX) in Jessup. MD 175 was extended as a concrete road east to its modern intersection with MD 713, then northeast along what later became MD 713 to MD 176 in Hanover in 1929. The easternmost portion of MD 175, which was originally MD 180, was constructed as a concrete road starting in 1930 from MD 3 to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak) in Odenton; the highway was complete west to Gambrills by the end of 1930. The original western part of MD 175, from US 1 in Jessup to MD 103 in Ellicott City, was constructed as MD 531 in 1932. The portion of the highway through Fort Meade was a public highway maintained by Anne Arundel County or the federal government through World War II."
"MD 180's crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad was constructed in 1938. The highway was relocated through Odenton using the new bridge in 1938 and 1939; the old road became MD 677. MD 175's bridge over the B&O Railroad in Jessup was completed in 1942. The highway was widened to a wide road with a concrete base and asphalt surface from Jessup to the MD 713 intersection in 1942. MD 175 was also extended as a road through Fort Meade from MD 713 to west of Odenton between 1942 and 1944. By 1946, MD 175 had been extended east over MD 180 to Millersville and west over MD 531 to Ellicott City; the portion of MD 175 from Fort Meade to MD 176 became MD 713. MD 175 was widened from from Odenton to Millersville starting in 1948. The highway was widened and resurfaced from Odenton to the newly constructed Baltimore–Washington Expressway interchange in 1954. MD 175 was also widened with curve amelioration from US 1 to MD 103 between 1954 and 1956."
"MD 175's first divided highway section was created when the highway was relocated from US 1 to just north of the modern MD 108 intersection in conjunction with the construction of the I-95 interchange in 1969 and 1970. The state highway's interchange with US 29 in Columbia was built in several stages. The westbound and eastbound bridges across the Little Patuxent River were built in 1970 and 1974, respectively. The first parts of the interchange to open were the ramps between county-maintained Little Patuxent Parkway and southbound US 29. MD 175's bridges over US 29 were built in 1974. The interchange fully opened when the new Little Patuxent Parkway was completed from the existing highway at the present MD 108 interchange west to US 29 in 1977. The portion of MD 175 north of the new highway was replaced by an eastward extension of MD 108 and MD 104. The highway's trumpet interchange with Columbia Gateway Drive opened with Little Patuxent Parkway. MD 175 was two lanes from US 29 to Columbia Gateway Drive until the road was expanded to a divided highway in 1987. The highway's interchange with Snowden River Parkway was constructed in 2001. MD 175's roundabout in Odenton was installed in 2004."
"The Maryland State Highway Administration plans to upgrade MD 175 from MD 295 in Jessup east to MD 170 in Odenton in response to the greatly increased traffic destined for Fort Meade due to the Base Realignment and Closure process. The state plans to expand MD 175 to a six-lane divided highway along the stretch, construct intersection improvements at MD 713, Reece Road, Mapes Road, and Charter Oaks Boulevard, and reconstruct the MD 295 interchange. One of the first projects to begin construction is improvements at the MD 713 intersection, which started in 2011 and are expected to be completed in 2013."

"Microsoft RPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call) is a modified version of DCE/RPC. Additions include partial support for UCS-2 (but not Unicode) strings, implicit handles, and complex calculations in the variable-length string and structure paradigms already present in DCE/RPC."
"The DCE 1.0 reference implementation only allows such constructs as ""size_is(len)"", or possibly ""size_is(len-1)"". MSRPC allows much more complex constructs such as ""size_is(len / 2 - 1)"" and even ""length_is ((max & ~0x7) + 0x7)"", a common expression in DCOM IDL files."
"MSRPC was used by Microsoft to seamlessly create a client/server model in Windows NT, with very little effort. For example, the Windows Server domains protocols are entirely MSRPC based, as is Microsoft's DNS administrative tool. Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5's administrative front-ends are all MSRPC client/server applications, and its MAPI was made more secure by ""proxying"" MAPI over a set of simple MSRPC functions that enable encryption at the MSRPC layer without involving the MAPI protocol."
"MSRPC is derived from the Distributed Computing Environment 1.2 reference implementation from the Open Software Foundation, but has been copyrighted by Microsoft. DCE/RPC was originally commissioned by the Open Software Foundation, an industry consortium to set vendor- and technology-neutral open standards for computing infrastructure. None of the Unix vendors (now represented by the Open Group), wanted to use the complex DCE or such components as DCE/RPC at the time."
"Microsoft's Component Object Model is based heavily on MSRPC, adding interfaces and inheritance. The marshalling semantics of DCE/RPC are used to serialize method calls and results between processes with separate address spaces, albeit COM did not initially allow network calls between different machines."
